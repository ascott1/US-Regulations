                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 900.3  Proposals.

    (a) A marketing agreement or a marketing order may be proposed by 
the Secretary or by any other person. If any person other than the 
Secretary proposes a marketing agreement or marketing order, he shall 
file with the Administrator a written application, together with at 
least four copies of the proposal, requesting the Secretary to hold a

[[Page 9]]

hearing upon the proposal. Upon receipt of such proposal, the 
Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made and such 
consideration thereof to be given as, in his opinion, are warranted. If 
the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator to conclude 
that the proposed marketing agreement or marketing order will not tend 
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, or that for other proper 
reasons a hearing should not be held on the proposal, he shall deny the 
application, and promptly notify the applicant of such denial, which 
notice shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds for the 
denial.
    (b) If the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator to 
conclude that the proposed marketing agreement or marketing order will 
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, or if the Secretary 
desires to propose a marketing agreement or marketing order, he shall 
sign and cause to be served a notice of hearing, as provided in this 
subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 900.4  Institution of proceeding.

    (a) Filing and contents of the notice of hearing. The proceeding 
shall be instituted by filing the notice of hearing with the hearing 
clerk. The notice of hearing shall contain a reference to the authority 
under which the marketing agreement or marketing order is proposed; 
shall define the scope of the hearing as specifically as may be 
practicable; shall contain either the terms or substance of the proposed 
marketing agreement or marketing order or a description of the subjects 
and issues involved and shall state the industry, area, and class of 
persons to be regulated, the time and place of such hearing, and the 
place where copies of such proposed marketing agreement or marketing 
order may be obtained or examined. The time of the hearing shall not be 
less than 15 days after the date of publication of the notice in the 
Federal Register, as provided in this subpart, unless the Administrator 
shall determine that an emergency exists which requires a shorter period 
of notice, in which case the period of notice shall be that which the 
Administrator may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances: 
Provided, That, in the case of hearings on amendments to marketing 
agreements or marketing orders, the time of the hearing may be less than 
15 days but shall not be less than 3 days after the date of publication 
of the notice in the Federal Register.
    (b) Giving notice of hearing and supplemental publicity. (1) The 
Administrator shall give or cause to be given notice of hearing in the 
following manner:
    (i) By publication of the notice of hearing in the Federal Register;
    (ii) By mailing a true copy of the notice of hearing to each of the 
persons known to the Administrator, to be interested therein;
    (iii) By issuing a press release containing the complete text or a 
summary of the contents of the notice of hearing and making the same 
available to such newspapers in the area proposed to be subjected to 
regulation as reasonably will tend to bring the notice to the attention 
of the persons interested therein;
    (iv) By forwarding copies of the notice of hearing addressed to the 
governors of such of the several States of the United States and to 
executive heads of such of the Territories and possessions of the United 
States as the Administrator, having due regard for the subject matter of 
the proposal and the public interest, shall determine, should be 
notified.
    (2) Legal notice of the hearing shall be deemed to be given if 
notice is given in the manner provided by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section; and failure to give notice in the manner provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not affect the 
legality of the notice.
    (c) Record of notice and supplemental publicity. There shall be 
filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing an 
affidavit or certificate of the person giving the notice provided in 
(b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section. In regard to the provisions 
relating to mailing in (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a determination by 
the Administrator that such provisions have been complied with shall be 
filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing. 
In the alternative, if notice is not given in the manner provided in 
(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section there shall be filed with 
the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing a 
determination by the Administrator that such notice is impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest with a brief statement 
of the reasons for such determination. Determinations by the 
Administrator as herein provided shall be final.

<R05>
Sec. 900.5  Docket number.

    Each proceeding, immediately following its institution, shall be 
assigned a docket number by the hearing clerk and thereafter the 
proceeding may be referred to by such number.

<R05>
Sec. 900.6  Judges.

    (a) Assignment. No judge who has any pecuniary interest in the 
outcome of a proceeding shall serve as judge in such proceeding.
    (b) Powers of judges. Subject to review by the Secretary, as 
provided elsewhere in this subpart, the judge, in any proceeding, shall 
have power to:
    (1) Rule upon motions and requests;
    (2) Change the time and place of hearing, and adjourn the hearing 
from time to time or from place to place;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;

[[Page 10]]

    (4) Examine and cross-examine witnesses and receive evidence;
    (5) Admit or exclude evidence;
    (6) Hear oral argument on facts or law;
    (7) Do all acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance 
of order at the hearing and the efficient conduct of the proceeding.
    (c) Who may act in absence of judge. In case of the absence of the 
judge or his inability to act, the powers and duties to be performed by 
him under this part in connection with a proceeding may, without 
abatement of the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the Secretary, 
be assigned to any other judge.
    (d) Disqualification of judge. The judge may at any time withdraw as 
judge in a proceeding if he deems himself to be disqualified. Upon the 
filing by an interested person in good faith of a timely and sufficient 
affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of a judge, the Secretary 
shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the 
proceeding, after making such investigation or holding such hearings, or 
both, as he may deem appropriate in the circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 900.7  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. All motions and requests shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during the course of the hearing 
may be filed with the judge or may be stated orally and made a part of 
the transcript.
    Except as provided in Sec. 900.15(b) such motions and requests shall 
be addressed to, and ruled on by, the judge if made prior to his 
certification of the transcript pursuant to Sec. 900.10 or by the 
Secretary if made thereafter.
    (b) Certification to Secretary. The judge may in his discretion 
submit or certify to the Secretary for decision any motion, request, 
objection, or other question addressed to the judge.

<R05>
Sec. 900.8  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) Time and place. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
fixed in the notice of hearing, unless the judge shall have changed the 
time or place, in which event the judge shall file with the hearing 
clerk a notice of such change, which notice shall be given in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 900.4 (relating to the giving of notice of 
the hearing): Provided, That, if the change in time or place of hearing 
is made less than 5 days prior to the date previously fixed for the 
hearing, the judge, either in addition to or in lieu of causing the 
notice of the change to be given, shall announce, or cause to be 
announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed for the 
hearing.
    (b) Appearances--(1) Right to appear. At the hearing, any interested 
person shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in person or 
through his authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with 
respect to matters relevant and material to the proceeding. Any 
interested person who desires to be heard in person at any hearing under 
these rules shall, before proceeding to testify, state his name, 
address, and occupation. If any such person is appearing through a 
counsel or representative, such person or such counsel or representative 
shall, before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the 
hearing, state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or 
representative, and the names and addresses and occupations of such 
person and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such 
counsel or representative shall give such other information respecting 
his appearance as the judge may request.
    (2) Debarment of counsel or representative. Wherever, while a 
proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds that a person, acting 
as counsel or representative for any person participating in the 
proceeding, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge 
may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel 
or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be 
taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or 
suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Provided, That the judge 
may suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of 
enabling the client to obtain other counsel or other representative.
    In case the judge has ordered that a person be precluded from 
further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the 
judge, within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the Secretary 
a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order and shall 
recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other 
proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after 
notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order, respecting the 
appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings 
before the Secretary, as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
    (3) Failure to appear. If any interested person fails to appear at 
the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived the right to be heard in 
the proceeding.
    (c) Order of procedure. (1) The judge shall, at the opening of the 
hearing prior to the taking of testimony, have noted as part of the 
record the notice of hearing as filed with the Office of the Federal 
Register and the affidavit or certificate of the giving of notice or the 
determination provided for in Sec. 900.4(c).
    (2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters 
specified in the notice of the hearing in such order as the judge shall 
announce.
    (d) Evidence--(1) In general. The hearing shall be publicly 
conducted, and the testi

[[Page 11]]

mony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.
    Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or make 
affirmation. Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent required 
for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the 
hearing, the judge may limit the number of times any witness may testify 
to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative 
evidence.
    The judge shall, insofar as practicable, exclude evidence which is 
immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the 
sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to any other ruling of the judge during the hearing, he 
shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an 
automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the 
judge. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon 
except as ordered by the judge. The ruling of the judge on any objection 
shall be a part of the transcript.
    Only objections made before the judge may subsequently be relied 
upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible as evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the discretion of 
the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy 
attested by the person having legal custody thereof and accompanied by a 
certificate that such person has the custody.
    (4) Exhibits. All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon satisfactory showing of the 
authenticity, relevancy, and materiality of the contents thereof, be 
numbered as exhibits and received in evidence and made a part of the 
record. Such exhibits shall be submitted in quadruplicate and in 
documentary form. In case the required number of copies is not made 
available, the judge shall exercise his discretion as to whether said 
exhibits shall, when practicable, be read in evidence or whether 
additional copies shall be required to be submitted within a time to be 
specified by the judge. If the testimony of a witness refers to a 
statute, or to a report or document (including the record of any 
previous hearing) the judge, after inquiry relating to the 
identification of such statute, report, or document, shall determine 
whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made 
a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be 
incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material 
matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report or document 
(including the record of any previous hearing) containing immaterial or 
irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be 
excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the 
direction of the judge.
    (5) Official notice. Official notice may be taken of such matters as 
are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That interested persons shall be given adequate 
notice, at the hearing or subsequent thereto, of matters so noticed and 
shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are 
inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.
    (6) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a 
brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence 
consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be 
inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be 
considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the 
judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall 
not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such 
evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In 
the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the judge erred in 
excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing 
shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.

<R05>
Sec. 900.9  Oral and written arguments.

    (a) Oral argument before judge. Oral argument before the judge shall 
be in the discretion of the judge. Such argument, when permitted, may be 
limited by the judge to any extent that he finds necessary for the 
expeditious disposition of the proceeding and shall be reduced to 
writing and made part of the transcript.
    (b) Briefs, proposed findings and conclusions. The judge shall 
announce at the hearing a reasonable period of time within which 
interested persons may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings and 
conclusions, and written arguments or briefs, based upon the evidence 
received at the hearing, citing, where practicable, the page or pages of 
the transcript of the testimony where such evidence appears. Factual 
material other than that adduced at the hearing or subject to official 
notice shall not be alluded to therein, and, in any case, shall not be 
considered in the formulation of the marketing agreement

[[Page 12]]

or marketing order. If the person filing a brief desires the Secretary 
to consider any objection made by such person to a ruling of the judge, 
as provided in Sec. 900.8(d), he shall include in the brief a concise 
statement concerning each such objection, referring where practicable, 
to the pertinent pages of the transcript.

<R05>
Sec. 900.10  Certification of the transcript.

    The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing 
as soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written 
arguments, briefs, proposed findings and proposed conclusions, and shall 
furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be 
necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall 
transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the 
transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the 
exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. He 
shall attach to the original transcript of testimony his certificate 
stating that to the best of his knowledge and belief, the transcript is 
a true transcript of the testimony given at the hearing except in such 
particulars as he shall specify; and that the exhibits transmitted are 
all the exhibits as introduced at the hearing with such exceptions as he 
shall specify. A copy of such certificate shall be attached to each of 
the copies of the transcript of testimony. In accordance with such 
certificate the hearing clerk shall note upon the official record copy, 
and cause to be noted on other copies, of the transcript each correction 
detailed therein by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the 
text as originally transcribed) at the appropriate place any words 
necessary to make the same conform to the correct meaning, as certified 
by the judge. The hearing clerk shall obtain and file certifications to 
the effect that such corrections have been effected in copies other than 
the official record copy.

<R05>
Sec. 900.11  Copies of the transcript.

    (a) During the period in which the proceeding has an active status 
in the Department, a copy of the transcript and exhibits shall be kept 
on file in the office of the hearing clerk, where it shall be available 
for examination during official hours of business. Thereafter said 
transcript and exhibits shall be made available by the hearing clerk for 
examination during official hours of business after prior request and 
reasonable notice to the hearing clerk.
    (b) If a personal copy of the transcript is desired, such copy may 
be obtained upon written application filed with the reporter and upon 
payment of fees at the rate (if any) provided in the contract between 
the reporter and the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 900.12  Administrator's recommended decision.

    (a) Preparation. As soon as practicable following the termination of 
the period allowed for the filing of written arguments or briefs and 
proposed findings and conclusions the Administrator shall file with the 
hearing clerk a recommended decision.
    (b) Contents. The Administrator's recommended decision shall 
include: (1) A preliminary statement containing a description of the 
history of the proceedings, a brief explanation of the material issues 
of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, and proposed 
findings and conclusions with respect to such issues as well as the 
reasons or basis therefor; (2) A ruling upon each proposed finding or 
conclusion submitted by interested persons; and (3) An appropriate 
proposed marketing agreement or marketing order effectuating his 
recommendations.
    (c) Exceptions to recommended decision. Immediately following the 
filing of his recommended decision, the Administrator shall give notice 
thereof, and opportunity to file exceptions thereto by publication in 
the Federal Register. Within a period of time specified in such notice 
any interested person may file with the hearing clerk exceptions to the 
Administrator's proposed marketing agreement or marketing order, or 
both, as the case may be, and a brief in support of such exceptions. 
Such exceptions shall be in writing, shall refer, where practicable, to 
the related pages of the transcript and may suggest appropriate changes 
in the proposed marketing agreement or marketing order.
    (d) Omission of recommended decision. The procedure provided in this 
section may be omitted only if the Secretary finds on the basis of the 
record that due and timely execution of his functions imperatively and 
unavoidably requires such omission.

<R05>
Sec. 900.13  Submission to Secretary.

    Upon the expiration of the period allowed for filing exceptions or 
upon request of the Secretary, the hearing clerk shall transmit to the 
Secretary the record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: all 
motions and requests filed with the hearing clerk and rulings thereon; 
the certified transcripts; any proposed findings or conclusions or 
written arguments or briefs that may have been filed; the 
Administrator's recommended decision, if any, and such exceptions as may 
have been filed.

<R05>
Sec. 900.13a  Decision by Secretary.

    After due consideration of the record, the Secretary shall render a 
decision. Such decision shall become a part of the record and shall 
include (a) a statement of his findings and conclusions, as well as the 
reasons or basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law or 
discretion presented on the

[[Page 13]]

record, (b) a ruling upon each proposed finding and proposed conclusion 
not previously ruled upon in the record, (c) a ruling upon each 
exception filed by interested persons and (d) either (1) a denial of the 
proposal to issue a marketing agreement or marketing order or (2) a 
marketing agreement and, if the findings upon the record so warrant, a 
marketing order, the provisions of which shall be set forth directly or 
by reference, regulating the handling of the commodity or product in the 
same manner and to the same extent as such marketing agreement, which 
order shall be complete except for its effective date and any 
determinations to be made under Sec. 900.14(b) or Sec. 900.14(c): 
Provided, That such marketing order shall not be executed, issued, or 
made effective until and unless the Secretary determines that the 
requirements of Sec. 900.14(b) or Sec. 900.14(c) have been met.

<R05>
Sec. 900.14  Execution and issuance of marketing agreements and 
          marketing orders.

    (a) Execution and issuance of marketing agreement. If the Secretary 
has approved a marketing agreement, as provided in Sec. 900.13a, the 
Administrator shall cause copies thereof to be distributed for execution 
by the handlers eligible to become parties thereto. If and when such 
number of the handlers as the Secretary shall deem sufficient shall have 
executed the agreement, the Secretary shall execute the agreement. After 
execution of a marketing agreement, such agreement shall be filed with 
the hearing clerk, and notice thereof, together with notice of the 
effective date, shall be given by publication in the Federal Register. 
The marketing agreement shall not become effective less than 30 days 
after its publication in the Federal Register, unless the Secretary, 
upon good cause found and published with the agreement, fixes an earlier 
effective date therefor: Provided, That no marketing agreement shall 
become effective as to any person signatory thereto before either (1) it 
has been filed with the Office of the Federal Register, or (2) such 
person has received actual notice that the Secretary has executed the 
agreement and the effective date of the marketing agreement.
    (b) Issuance of marketing order with marketing agreement. Whenever, 
as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary executes a 
marketing agreement, and handlers also have executed the same as 
provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, he shall, if he finds that it will 
tend to effectuate the purposes of the Act, issue and make effective the 
marketing order, if any, which was filed as a part of his decision 
pursuant to Sec. 900.13a: Provided, That the issuance of such order 
shall have been approved or favored by producers as required by section 
8c(8) of the act.
    (c) Issuance of marketing order without marketing agreement. If, 
despite the failure or refusal of handlers to sign the marketing 
agreement, as provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, the Secretary makes 
the determinations required under section 8c(9) of the Act, the 
Secretary shall issue and make effective the marketing order, if any, 
which was filed as a part of his decision pursuant to Sec. 900.13a.
    (d) Effective date of marketing order. No marketing order shall 
become effective less than 30 days after its publication in the Federal 
Register, unless the Secretary, upon good cause found and published with 
the order, fixes an earlier effective date therefor: Provided, That no 
marketing order shall become effective as to any person sought to be 
charged thereunder before either (1) it has been filed with the Office 
of the Federal Register, or (2) such person has received actual notice 
of the issuance and terms of the marketing order.
    (e) Notice of issuance. After issuance of a marketing order, such 
order shall be filed with the hearing clerk, and notice thereof, 
together with notice of the effective date, shall be given by 
publication in the Federal Register. (7 U.S.C. 610(c).)

Sec. 900.15  Filing; extensions of time; effective date of filing; and 
          computation of time.

    (a) Filing, number of copies. Except as is provided otherwise in 
this subpart, all documents or papers required or authorized by the 
foregoing provisions of this subpart to be filed with the hearing clerk 
shall be filed in quadruplicate. Any document or paper, so required or 
authorized to be filed with the hearing clerk, shall, during the course 
of an oral hearing, be filed with the judge. The provisions of this 
subpart concerning filing with the hearing clerk of hearing notices, 
recommended and final decisions, marketing agreements and orders, and 
all documents described in Sec. 900.17 shall be met by filing a true 
copy thereof with the hearing clerk.
    (b) Extensions of time. The time for the filing of any document or 
paper required or authorized by the foregoing provisions of this subpart 
to be filed may be extended by the judge (before the record is certified 
by the judge) or by the Administrator (after the record is so certified 
by the judge but before it is transmitted to the Secretary), or by the 
Secretary (after the record is transmitted to the Secretary) upon 
request filed, and if, in the judgment of the judge, Administrator, or 
the Secretary, as the case may be, there is good reason for the 
extension. All rulings made pursuant to this paragraph shall be filed 
with the hearing clerk.
    (c) Effective date of filing. Any document or paper required or 
authorized by the foregoing provisions of this subpart to be filed shall 
be deemed to be filed when it is postmarked or when it is received by 
the hearing clerk.

[[Page 14]]

    (d) Computation of time. Sundays and Federal holidays shall be 
included in computing the time allowed for the filing of any document or 
paper: Provided, That, when such time expires on a Sunday or legal 
holiday, such period shall be extended to include the next following 
business day.

to be involved in the decisional process of the proceeding discuss ex 
parte the merits of the proceeding with any person having an interest in 
the proceeding or with any representative of such person: Provided, That

limitation; and Provided further, That an employee of the Department who

such a person if all parties known to be interested in the proceeding 
have been given notice and an opportunity to participate. A memorandum 
of any such discussion shall be included in the record of the 
proceeding.
    (b) No person interested in the proceeding shall make or knowingly 
cause to be made to an employee of the Department who is or may 
reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process of the

    At any time before the close of the hearing the petition or answer 
may be amended, but the hearing shall, at the request of the adverse

<R05>

outcome of the proceeding, or who has participated in any investigation

such proceeding.
    (b) Conduct. The judge shall conduct the proceeding in a fair and 
impartial manner and shall not discuss ex parte the merits of the 
proceeding with any person who is or who has been connected in any 
manner with the proceeding in an advocative or investigative capacity.

place of hearing;
    (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;

unless otherwise ordered by the Secretary, be assigned to any other 
judge.
    (e) Disqualification of judge. The judge may at any time withdraw as 
judge in a proceeding if he deems himself to be disqualified. Upon the 
filing by an interested person in good faith of a timely and sufficient 
affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of a judge, the Secretary 
shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the 
proceeding, after making such investigation or holding such hearings, or 
both, as he may deem appropriate in the circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 900.56  Consolidated hearings.

    At the discretion of the judge, hearings upon two or more petitions 
pertaining to the same order may be consolidated, and the evidence taken

Sec. 900.57  Intervention.

    Intervention in proceedings subject to this subpart shall not be 
allowed, except that, in the discretion of the Secretary or the judge, 
any person (other than the petitioner) showing a substantial interest in 
the outcome of a proceeding shall be permitted to participate in the 
oral argument and to file a brief.

<R05>
Sec. 900.58  Prehearing conferences.

    In any proceeding in which it appears that such procedure will 
expedite the proceeding, the judge, at any time prior to the 
commencement of or during the course of the hearing, may request the 
parties or their counsel to appear at a conference before him to 
consider (a) the simplification of issues; (b) the possibility of 
obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents which will avoid 
unnecessary proof; (c) the limitation of the number of expert or other 
witnesses; and (d) such other matters as may expedite and aid in the 
disposition of the proceeding. No transcript of such conference shall be 
made, but the judge shall prepare and file for the record a written 
summary of the action taken at the conference, which shall incorporate 
any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties at the 
conference or as a result of the conference. If the circumstances are 
such that a conference is impracticable, the judge may request the 
parties to correspond with him for the purpose of accomplishing any of 
the objects set forth in this section. The judge shall forward copies of 
letters and documents to the parties as the circumstances require. 
Correspondence in such negotiations shall not be a part of the record, 
but the judge shall submit a written summary for the record if any 
action is taken.

<R05>
Sec. 900.59  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. All motions and requests shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during the course of an oral 
hearing may be filed with the judge or may be stated orally and made a 
part of the transcript.
    The judge is authorized to rule upon all motions and requests filed 
or made prior to the transmittal by the hearing clerk to the Secretary 
of the record as provided in this subpart. The Secretary shall rule upon 
all motions and requests filed after that time.
    (b) Certification of motions. The submission or certification of any 
motion, request, objection, or other question to the Secretary shall be 
in the discretion of the judge.
[25 FR 5907, June 28, 1960, as amended at 38 FR 29798, Oct. 29, 1973]

<R05>
Sec. 900.60  Oral hearings before judge.

    (a) Time and place. The judge shall set a time and place for hearing 
and shall file with the hearing clerk a notice stating the time and 
place of hearing. If any change in the time or place of hearing becomes 
necessary, it shall be made by the judge, who, in such event, shall file 
with the hearing clerk a notice of the change. Such notice shall be 
served upon the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral 
hearing and made a part of the transcript.
    (b) Appearances--(1) Representation. In any proceeding under the 
act, the parties may appear in person or by counsel or other 
representative. The Department, if represented by counsel, shall be 
represented by an attorney assigned by the General Counsel of the 
Department, and such attorney shall present or supervise the 
presentation of the position of the Department.
    (2) Debarment of counsel or representative. Whenever, while a 
proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds that a person acting 
as counsel or representative for any party to the proceeding is guilty 
of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge may order that such 
person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in 
such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such 
order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending 
disposition of the appeal: Provided, That the judge may suspend the 
proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the client 
to obtain other counsel or representative.
    In case the judge has issued an order precluding a person from 
further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the 
judge, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall submit to the 
Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the 
issuance of the order and shall recommend what action the Secretary 
should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or 
representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter, 
the Secretary may, after notice and an oppor

[[Page 18]]

tunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance of such 
person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary 
as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
    (3) Failure to appear. If the petitioner, after being duly notified, 
fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have authorized 
the dismissal of the proceeding, without further procedure, and with or 
without prejudice as the judge may determine. In the event that the 
petitioner appears at the hearing and no representative of the 
Department appears, the judge shall proceed ex parte to hear the 
evidence of the petitioner. Provided, That failure on the part of such 
representative of the Department to appear at a hearing shall not be 
deemed to be waiver of the Department's right to file suggested findings 
of fact, conclusions and order; to be served with a copy of the judge's 
initial decision and to appeal to the Secretary with respect thereto.
    (c) Order of proceeding. Except as may be determined otherwise by 
the judge, the petitioner shall proceed first at the hearing.
    (d) Evidence--(1) In general. The hearing shall be publicly 
conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported 
verbatim.
    The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be upon oath or 
affirmation and subject to cross-examination.
    Any witness may, in the discretion of the judge, be examined 
separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be 
parties to the proceeding.
    The judge shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence which is 
immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the 
sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or 
cross-examination, or any other ruling of the judge, he shall state 
briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception 
will follow which may be pursued in an appeal pursuant to Sec. 900.65 by 
the party adversely affected by the judge's ruling.
    (3) Depositions. The deposition of any witness shall be admitted, in 
the manner hereinafter provided in and subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 900.61.
    (4) Affidavits. Except as is otherwise provided in this subpart, 
affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible 
and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make 
timely objections) that affidavits may be used.
    (5) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the discretion of 
the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy 
attested by the person having legal custody thereof and accompanied by a 
certificate that such person has the custody.
    (6) Exhibits. All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the 
admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits and 
received in evidence and made a part of the record. Except where the 
judge finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of 
each exhibit, in addition to the original, shall be filed with the judge 
for the use of each other party to the proceeding. The judge shall 
advise the parties as to the exact number of copies which will be 
required to be filed and shall make and have noted on the record the 
proper distribution of the copies.
    If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report, 
document, or transcript, the judge, after inquiry relating to the 
identification of such statute, report, document, or transcript, shall 
determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and 
physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it 
shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and 
material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report, document, 
or transcript containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such 
immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be excluded and shall be 
segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the direction of the 
judge.
    (7) Official notice. Official notice will be taken of such matters 
as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That the parties shall be given adequate notice, at 
the hearing or by reference in the judge's report or the tentative order 
or otherwise, of matters so noticed, and (except where official notice 
is taken, for the first time in the proceeding, in the final order) 
shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are 
erroneously noticed.
    (8) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a 
brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence 
consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be 
inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be 
considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the 
judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall 
not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such 
evidence will consume a considerable

[[Page 19]]

length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if on appeal the 
Secretary decides that the judge erred in excluding the evidence, and 
that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit 
the taking of such evidence.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Transcript. (1) During the period in which the proceeding has an 
active status the transcript and exhibits shall be kept on file in the 
office of the hearing clerk, where it shall be available for examination 
during official hours of business. Thereafter said transcript and 
exhibits shall be made available by the hearing clerk for examination 
during official hours of business after prior request and reasonable 
notice to the hearing clerk.
    (2) If a personal copy of the transcript is desired, such copy may 
be obtained upon written application filed with the reporter, and upon 
payment of fees at the rate (if any) provided in the contract between 
the reporter and the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 900.61  Depositions.

    (a) Procedure in lieu of deposition. Before any party may have 
testimony taken by deposition, said party shall, if practicable, submit 
to the other party an affidavit which shall set forth the facts to which 
the witness would testify, if the deposition should be taken. If, after 
examination of such affidavit, the other party agrees, or (within 10 
days after submission of the affidavit) fails to object, that the 
affidavit may be used in lieu of the deposition, the judge shall admit 
the affidavit in evidence and shall not order the deposition to be 
taken.
    (b) Application for taking deposition. Upon the application of a 
party to the proceeding, the judge may, at any time after the filing of 
the moving paper, order, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, 
the taking of testimony by deposition. The application shall be in 
writing and shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall set forth: 
(1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and 
address of the person (referred to hereinafter in this section as the 
``officer''), qualified under the rules in this part to take 
depositions, before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the 
proposed time and place of the examination, which shall be at least 15 
days after the date of the mailing of the application; and (4) the 
reasons why such deposition should be taken.
    (c) Judge's order for taking deposition. If, after the examination 
of the application, the judge is of the opinion that the deposition 
should be taken, he shall order its taking. The order shall be filed 
with the hearing clerk and shall be served upon the parties and shall 
state: (1) The time and place of the examination (which shall not be 
less than 10 days after the filing of the order); (2) the name of the 
officer before whom the examination is to be made; (3) the name of the 
deponent. The officer and the time and place need not be the same as 
those suggested in the application.
    (d) Qualifications of officer. The deposition shall be taken before 
the judge or before an officer authorized by the law of the United 
States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer 
oaths, or before an officer authorized by the Secretary to administer 
oaths.
    (e) Procedure on examination. The deponent shall be examined under 
oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. The 
testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the officer or by some 
person under his direction and in his presence. In lieu of oral 
examination, parties may transmit written interrogatories to the officer 
prior to the examination and the officer shall propound such 
interrogatories to the deponent.
    The applicant must arrange for the examination of the witness either 
by oral examination or by written interrogatories. If it is found by the 
judge, upon the protest of a party to the proceeding, that such party 
has his residence and his place of business more than 100 miles from the 
place of the examination and that it would constitute an undue hardship 
upon such party to be represented at the examination, the applicant will 
be required to conduct the examination by means of interrogatories. When 
the examination is conducted by means of interrogatories, copies of the 
interrogatories shall be served upon the other parties to the proceeding 
at least five days prior to the date set for the examination, and the 
other parties shall be afforded an opportunity to file with the officer 
cross-interrogatories at any time prior to the time of the examination.
    (f) Certification by officer. The officer shall certify on the 
deposition that the deponent was duly sworn by him and that the 
deposition is a true record of the deponent's testimony. He shall then 
securely seal the deposition, together with two copies thereof, in an 
envelope and mail the same by registered mail to the hearing clerk.
    (g) Use of depositions. A deposition ordered and taken in accord 
with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under 
the act if the judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and 
(1) that the witness is dead; or (2) that the witness is at a distance 
greater than 100 miles from the place of hearing, unless it appears that 
the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the 
deposition; or (3) that the witness is unable to attend or testify 
because of age, sickness, infirmity or imprisonment; or (4) that the 
party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the attendance 
of

the witness by subpena but has been unable to do so; or (5) that such 
exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the

taken refuses to offer it in evidence, the other party may offer the 
deposition, or any part thereof, in evidence.

Sec. 900.62  Subpenas.

    (a) Issuance of subpenas. The attendance of witnesses and the 
production of documentary evidence from any place in the United States 
on behalf of any party to the proceeding may, by subpena, be required at 
any designated place of hearing. Subpenas may be issued by the Secretary 
or by the judge, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, upon a 
reasonable showing by the applicant of the grounds, necessity, and 
reasonable scope thereof.
    (b) Application for subpena duces tecum. Subpenas for the production 
of documentary evidence, unless issued by the judge upon his own motion, 
shall be issued only upon a verified written application. Such 
application shall specify, as exactly as possible, the documents desired 
and shall show their competency, relevancy, and materiality and the 
necessity for their production.
    (c) Service of subpenas. Subpenas may be served (1) by a United 
States Marshal or his deputy, or (2) by any other person who is not less 
than 18 years of age, or (3) by registering and mailing a copy of the 
subpena addressed to the person to be served at his or its last known 
residence or principal place of business or residence. Proof of service 
may be made by the return of service on the subpena by the United States 
Marshal or his deputy; or, if served by an individual other than a 
United States Marshal or his deputy, by an affidavit of such person 
stating that he personally served a copy of the subpena upon the person 
named therein; or, if service was by registered mail, by an affidavit 
made by the person mailing the subpena that it was mailed as provided in 
this paragraph and by the signed return post-office receipt: Provided, 
That, if the subpena is issued on behalf of the Department, the return 
receipt without an affidavit of mailing shall be sufficient proof of 
service. In making personal service, the person making service shall 
leave a copy of the subpena with the person subpenaed; the original, 
bearing or accompanied by the required proof of service shall be 
returned to the official who issued the same.

States, and persons taking depositions shall be entitled to the same 
fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States, 
to be paid by the party at whose request the deposition is taken. 
Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance 
the witnesses appear, and claims therefor, as to witnesses subpenaed on 
behalf of the Department, shall be proved before the person issuing the 
subpena, and, as to witnesses subpenaed on behalf of any other party, 
shall be presented to such party.

as the judge may specify, but not later than the time fixed for filing 
proposed findings of fact, conclusions and order, or briefs, as the case 
may be, the parties may file with the judge proposed corrections to the 
transcript. (2) As soon as practicable after the filing of proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions and order, or briefs, as the case may be, 
the judge shall file with the hearing clerk his certificate indicating 
any corrections to be made in the transcript, and stating that, to the 
best of his knowledge and belief, the transcript, as corrected, is a 
true, correct, and complete transcript of the testimony given at the 
hearing, and that the exhibits are all the exhibits properly a part of 
the hearing record. The original of such certificate shall be attached 
to the original transcript and a copy of such certificate shall be 
served upon each of the parties by the hearing clerk who shall also 
enter onto the transcript (without obscuring the text) any correction 
noted in the certification.
    (b) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders. Within 10 
days (unless the judge shall have announced at the hearing a shorter or 
longer period of time) after the transcript has been filed with the 
hearing clerk, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, each party 
may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings of fact, conclusions, 
and order, based solely upon the evidence of record, and briefs in 
support thereof.
    (c) Administrative Law Judge's Decision. The judge, within a 
reasonable time after the termination of the period allowed for the 
filing of proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders, and briefs 
in support thereof, shall prepare upon the basis of the record, and 
shall file with the hearing clerk, his initial decision, a copy of which 
shall be served by the hearing clerk, upon each of the parties. Such 
decision shall become final without further proceedings 35 days after 
the date of service thereof, unless there is an appeal to the Secretary 
by a party to the proceeding: Provided, however, That no decision shall 
be final for the purpose of judicial review except a final decision 
issued by the Secretary pursuant to an appeal by a party to the 
proceeding.

Sec. 900.65  Appeals to Secretary: transmittal of record.

    (a) Filing of appeal. Any party who disagrees with a judge's 
decision or any part thereof, may appeal the decision to the Secretary 
by transmitting an appeal petition to the hearing clerk within 30 days 
after service of said decision upon said party. Each issue set forth in 
the appeal, and the arguments thereon, shall be separately numbered; 
shall be plainly and concisely stated; and shall contain detailed 
citations of the record, statutes, regulations and authorities being 
relied upon in support thereof. The appeal petition shall be served upon 
the other party to the proceeding by the hearing clerk.
    (b) Argument before Secretary--(1) Oral argument. A party bringing 
an appeal may request within the prescribed time period for filing such 
appeal, an opportunity for oral argument before the Secretary. Failure 
to make such request in writing, within the prescribed time period, 
shall be deemed a waiver of oral argument. The Secretary, in his 
discretion, may grant, refuse or limit any request for oral argument on 
appeal.
    (2) Scope of argument. Argument to be heard on appeal, whether oral 
or in a written brief, shall be limited to the issues raised by the 
appeal, except that if the Secretary determines that additional issues 
should be argued, the parties shall be given reasonable notice of such 
determination, so as to permit preparation of adequate arguments on all 
the issues to be argued.
    (c) Response. Within 20 days after service of an appeal brought by a 
party to the proceeding, any other party may file a response in support 
of or in opposition to such appeal.
    (d) Transmittal of record. Whenever an appeal is filed by a party to 
the proceeding, the hearing clerk shall transmit to the Secretary the 
record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: the pleadings; any 
motions and requests filed, and the rulings thereon; the transcript of 
the testimony taken at the hearing, as well as the exhibits filed in 
connection therewith; any statements filed under the shortened 
procedure; any documents or papers filed in connection with prehearing 
conferences; such proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders,

Sec. 900.66  Consideration of appeal by the Secretary and issuance of 
          final order.

    (a) Consideration of appeal. As soon as practicable after the 
receipt of the record from the hearing clerk, or, in case oral argument 
was had, as soon as practicable thereafter, the Secretary, upon the 
basis of and after due consideration of the record, shall rule on the 
appeal. If the Secretary decides that no change or modification of the 
judge's decision is warranted, he may adopt the Judge's decision as the 
final order of the Secretary, preserving any right of the party bringing 
the appeal to seek judicial review of such decision in the proper forum. 
At no stage of the proceeding between its institution and the issuance 
of the order shall the Secretary discuss ex parte the merits of the 
proceeding with any person who is connected with the proceeding in an 
advocative or an investigative capacity, or with any representative of 
such person: Provided, however, That the Secretary may discuss the 
merits of the proceeding with such a person if all parties to the 
proceeding, or their representatives, have been given an opportunity to 
be present. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this 
section, a memorandum or other communication from any party, or from any 
person acting on behalf of any party, which relates to the merits of the 
proceeding, receives the personal attention of the Secretary (or, if an 
official other than the Secretary is to issue the order, then of such 
other official) during the pendency of the proceeding, such memorandum 
or communication shall be regarded as argument made in the proceeding 
and shall be filed with the hearing clerk, who shall serve a copy 
thereof upon the opposite party to file a reply thereto.
    (b) Issuance of final order. A final order issued by the Secretary 
shall be filed with the hearing clerk, who shall serve it upon the 
parties: Provided, That, if the terms of the order differ substantially 
from those proposed in the decision of the judge, the Secretary shall, 
if he deems it advisable to do so, direct that a copy of the order be 
served upon the parties as a tentative order; and, in such event, 
opportunity shall be given the parties to file exceptions thereto and 
written arguments or briefs in support of such exceptions. In such case, 
if exceptions are filed within a period of time (to be fixed by the 
Secretary but not to exceed 20 days) following the service of the 
tentative order, the Secretary shall give consideration, to and shall 
make such changes in the tentative order as he deems to be appropriate; 
otherwise, the tentative order shall become final, as of the day 
following the date of expiration of the period fixed for the filing of 
exceptions.

<R05>
Sec. 900.302  Associations eligible to vote.

    (a) Any association of producers, not previously determined to be a 
cooperative association may file an application for a determination as 
to whether it is a cooperative association and thus eligible to vote in 
a referendum. Such application shall be filed with the Administrator at 
least 60 days prior to the holding of the referendum: Provided, however, 
That the Administrator may permit the filing of an application in less 
than 60 days when, in the opinion of the Administrator, such filing 
would not delay the conduct of the referendum.
    (b) Within a time fixed by the referendum agent, but not later than 
5 days prior to the final date for balloting, each cooperative 
association electing to vote shall, upon the request of the referendum 
agent, furnish to him a certified list showing the name and address of 
each producer for whom it claims the right to vote and the plant at 
which such person's milk was received during the representative period.

<R05>
Sec. 900.303  Conduct of referendum.

    The referendum shall be conducted by mail in the manner prescribed 
in this subpart. The referendum agent may utilize such personnel or

<R05>
Sec. 900.304  Who may vote.

    (a) Each producer shall be entitled to only one vote and to cast one 
ballot in each referendum; and no person who may claim to be a producer 
shall be refused a ballot. Each producer casting more than one ballot

invalidate all ballots cast by such voter in such referendum.
    (c) Voting by proxy or agent, or in any manner, except by the 
producer or cooperative association will not be permitted; however, a 
producer which is other than an individual may cast its ballot by a

is cast is a producer.

<R05>
Sec. 900.305  Duties of referendum agent.

    The referendum agent shall also:
    (a) For purposes of mailing, prepare a record of producers which 
will disclose the name of each such person, his address, the name of the 
handler who received the producer's milk during the representative 
period, and the name of the cooperative association, if any, which 
claims the right to vote for the producer. Such record may be compiled 
from readily available sources, including the following:
    (1) Records of the Department;
    (2) Producer records supplied by handlers;
    (3) Health authority records;
    (4) Certifications signed by dairy farmers who claim to be 
producers;
    (5) Any other reliable sources of information which may be available 
to the referendum agent.
    (b) Apply, as a guide, the following criteria in preparing a record 
of producers:
    (1) When the order requires approval by an appropriate health 
authority before a person meets the definition of producer, only those 
persons having such approval and who otherwise meet the definition may 
be regarded as producers. When the definition of producer requires the 
shipment of milk to a handler or a plant as well as health authority 
approval, only those persons having such approval and whose milk was 
received by a handler or at a plant may be regarded as producers.
    (2) When the order requires shipment to a handler or to a plant, 
without regard to health authority approval, a person may not be 
regarded as a producer, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, unless his name appears on the handler's producer records.
    (3) In the case of a producer that is other than an individual, the 
business unit shall be regarded as the producer.
    (4) No person may be included in the record more than once although 
he may operate more than one farm, hold more than one

[[Page 30]]

health authority approval, or appear on more than one handler's producer 
records.
    (5) In the event the health authority records are not available, are 
inaccurate, or are incomplete, the appearance of the producer's name on 
a handler's records as an approved producer shall be prima facie 
evidence of health authority approval.
    (6) In the event any handler refuses or fails to make his records 
available to the referendum agent, a certification signed by the 
producer shall be regarded by the referendum agent as prima facie 
evidence that such person is eligible to vote.
    (c) Verify the information supplied by each cooperative association 
which wishes to vote on behalf of producers, as follows:
    (1) Examine the records of the cooperative association for the 
prupose of ascertaining whether each producer claimed by the cooperative 
association is a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with the 
cooperative association.
    (2) Identify the persons ascertained to be members of, stockholders 
in, or under contract with a cooperative association which wishes to 
vote on behalf of its producers with the names of producers which appear 
on the record compiled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) In determining whether a cooperative association may vote on 
behalf of a producer the following criteria shall be used:
    (i) The cooperative association may vote for each producer who is a 
member of, stockholder in, or under contract with such cooperative 
association on the date of the order directing that the referendum be 
conducted.
    (ii) The cooperative association may cast only one ballot for all 
such producers.
    (iii) Whenever more than one cooperative association claims the 
right to vote for a producer only the cooperative association which 
furnished evidence satisfactory to the referendum agent that such 
association was in fact marketing the milk of the producer on the date 
of the referendum order may vote for such producer.

<R05>
Sec. 900.306  Notice of the referendum.

    (a) The referendum agent shall at least 5 days prior to the final 
date for balloting:
    (1) Mail to each cooperative association which has elected to cast a 
ballot on behalf of its producers and to each of all other known 
producers, a notice of the referendum which will include instructions 
for completing the ballot, a statement as to the time within which the 
ballot must be mailed to, and received by, the referendum agent, a copy 
of the final decision, and a ballot containing a description of the 
terms and conditions of the order.
    (2) Give public notice of the referendum:
    (i) By furnishing press releases and other information to available 
media of public information (including but not limited to press, radio, 
and television facilities) serving the area, announcing the time within 
which ballots must be completed and mailed to and received by the 
referendum agent, eligibility requirements, where additional information 
may be procured, and other pertinent information; and
    (ii) By such other means as said agent may deem advisable.

    There shall be no voting except within the time specified by the 
referendum agent as stated in the notice of the referendum.

<R05>
Sec. 900.308  Tabulation of ballots.

    (a) General. The referendum agent shall verify the information 
supplied with each ballot. If he ascertains that the person who cast the 
ballot was eligible to do so, that the ballot is complete and was mailed 
and received within the prescribed time, the ballot shall be eligible to 
be counted. If the referendum agent ascertains that the person who cast 
the ballot was not eligible to do so, or if the producer who cast the 
ballot was a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with a 
cooperative association which cast a valid ballot, or if the ballot is 
not completed or cast in accordance with instructions, or if the ballot 
was not mailed to or received by the referendum agent within the 
prescribed time, the ballot shall be marked ``disqualified'' with a 
notation on the ballot as to the reason for the disqualification. The 
total number of ballots cast, including the disqualified ballots, shall 
be ascertained. The number of eligible ballots cast approving and the 
number of eligible ballots cast disapproving the issuance of the order 
shall also be ascertained. The ballots marked ``disqualified'' shall not 
be considered as approving or disapproving the issuance of the order, 
and the persons who cast such ballots shall not be regarded as 
participating in the referendum.
    (b) Individual-handler pool provisions. Whenever separate approval 
of the pooling provisions of the order is required by section 
608c(5)(B)(i) of the Act, any ballot which approves the issuance of the 
order and disapproves the pooling provisions, or approves the pooling 
provisions and disapproves the issuance of the order, shall be 
disqualified; and the referendum agent shall mark the ballot 
accordingly.
    (c) Record of results of the referendum. The referendum agent shall 
notify the Administrator of the number of eligible ballots cast, the 
count of the votes, the number of disqualified ballots and the number of 
producers who were eligible to cast ballots. The referendum agent shall 
seal the ballots, including those marked ``disqualified'', the list of 
eligible voters and tabulation of ballots, and shall transmit to the 
Administrator a complete detailed report of all action taken in

[[Page 31]]

connection with the referendum together with all the ballots cast and 
all other information furnished to or compiled by the referendum agent.
    (d) Announcement of the results of the referendum. Announcement of 
the results of the referendum will be made only at the direction of the

shall not disclose the results of the referendum or the total number of 
ballots cast.

producers or processors shall, unless supplemented or modified by the 
Secretary, be conducted in accordance with this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 900.401  Definitions.

    (a) Act means Public Act No. 10, 73d Congress (48 Stat. 31), as

ness unit. For the purpose of this definition, the term ``partnership'' 
includes (1) a husband and wife who have title to, or leasehold interest 
in, land as tenants in common, joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, 
or, under community property laws, as community property, and (2) so-
called ``joint ventures,'' wherein one or more parties to the agreement, 
informal or otherwise, contributed capital and others contribute labor, 
management, equipment, or other services, or any variation of such 
contributions by two or more parties, so that it results in the growing 
of the commodity for market and the authority to transfer title to the 
commodity so produced.
    (h) Producer means any person defined as a producer in the order 
who: (1) Owns and farms land, resulting in his ownership of the

other than as hereinbefore set forth, of legal title to the commodity 
grown thereon shall not be deemed to result in such owners or lessees 
becoming producers.

<R05>
Sec. 900.402  Voting.

    (a) Each person who is a producer, as defined in this subpart, at 
the time of the referendum and who also was a producer during the 
representative period, shall be entitled to only one vote in the 
referendum, except that: (1) In a landlord-tenant relationship, wherein 
each of the parties is a producer, each such producer shall be entitled 
to one vote in the referendum; and (2) a cooperative association of 
producers, bona fide engaged in marketing the commodity or product 
thereof proposed to be regulated, or in rendering services for or 
advancing the interest of the producers of such commodity or product,

processor entitled to vote in a referendum shall be entitled to cast one

outcome to the Administrator and promptly thereafter submit the 
following:
    (1) All ballots received by the agent and appointees, together with 
a certificate to the effect that the ballots forwarded are all of the 
ballots cast and received by such persons during the referendum period;
    (2) A list of all challenged ballots deemed to be invalid; and

    (a) Effective time. The provisions of the order or any amendment to 
the order shall become effective at such time as the Secretary may 
declare and shall continue in force until suspended or terminated.
    (b) Suspension or termination. The Secretary shall suspend or 
terminate any or all of the provisions of the order whenever he finds 
that such provision(s) obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the 
declared policy of the Act. The order shall terminate whenever the 
provisions of the Act authorizing it cease to be in effect.
    (c) Continuing obligations. If upon the suspension or termination of 
any or all of the provisions of the order, there are any obligations 
arising under the order, the final accrual or ascertainment of which 
requires acts by any handler, by the market administrator, or by any 
other person, the power and duty to perform such further acts shall 
continue notwithstanding such suspension or termination.
    (d) Liquidation. (1) Upon the suspension or termination of any or 
all provisions of the order, the market administrator, or such other 
liquidating agent designated by the Secretary, shall if so directed by 
the Secretary liquidate the business of the market administrator's 
office, dispose of all property in his possession or control, including 
accounts receivable and execute and deliver all assignments or other 
instruments necessary or appropriate to effectuate any such disposition; 
and
    (2) If a liquidating agent is so designated, all assets and records 
of the market administrator shall be transferred promptly to such 
liquidating agent. If, upon such liquidation, the funds on hand exceed 
the amounts required to pay outstanding obligations of the office of the 
market administrator and to pay necessary expenses of liquidation and 
distribution, such excess shall be distributed to contributing handlers 
and producers in an equitable manner.
    (e) Separability of provisions. If any provision of the order or its 
application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the 
application of such provision and of the remaining provisions of the 
order to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.


<R05>
Sec. 1000.5  Handler responsibility for records and facilities.

    Each handler shall maintain and retain records of his operations and 
make such records and his facilities available to the market 
administrator. If adequate records of a handler, or of any other 
persons, that are relevant to the obligation of such handler are not 
maintained and made available, any

[[Page 38]]

skim milk and butterfat required to be reported by such handler for 
which adequate records are not available shall not be considered 
accounted for or established as used in a class other than the highest 
priced class.
    (a) Records to be maintained. (1) Each handler shall maintain 
records of his operations (including, but not limited to, records of 
purchases, sales, processing, packaging, and disposition) as are 
necessary to verify whether such handler has any obligation under the 
order, and if so, the amount of such obligation. Such records shall be 
such as to establish for each plant or other receiving point for each 
month:
    (i) The quantities of skim milk and butterfat contained in, or 
represented by, products received in any form, including inventories on 
hand at the beginning of the month, according to form, time, and source 
of each receipt;
    (ii) The utilization of all skim milk and butterfat showing the 
respective quantities of such skim milk and butterfat in each form 
disposed of or on hand at the end of the month; and
    (iii) Payments to producers, dairy farmers and cooperative 
associations, including the amount and nature of any deductions and the 
disbursement of money so deducted.
    (2) Each handler shall keep such other specific records as the 
market administrator deems necessary to verify or establish such 
handler's obligation under the order.
    (b) Availability of records and facilities. Each handler shall make 
available all records pertaining to such handler's operations and all 
facilities the market administrator finds are necessary for such market 
administrator to verify the information required to be reported by the 
order and/or to ascertain such handler's reporting, monetary or other 
obligation under the order. Each handler shall permit the market 
administrator to weigh, sample, and test milk and milk products and 
observe plant operations and equipment and make available to the market 
administrator such facilities as are necessary to carry out his duties.
    (c) Retention of records. All records required under the order to be 
made available to the market administrator shall be retained by the 
handler for a period of 3 years to begin at the end of the month to 
which such records pertain. If, within such 3-year period, the market 
administrator notifies the handler in writing that the retention of such 
records, or of specified records, is necessary in connection with a 
proceeding under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act or a court action 
specified in such notice, the handler shall retain such records, or 
specified records, until further written notification from the market 
administrator. The market administrator shall give further written 
notification to the handler promptly upon the termination of the 
litigation or when the records are no longer necessary in connection 
therewith.


<R05>
Sec. 1000.6  Termination of obligations.

    The provisions of this section shall apply to any obligation under 
the order for the payment of money:
    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
the obligation of any handler to pay money required to be paid under the 
terms of the order shall terminate 2 years after the last day of the 
month during which the market administrator receives the handler's 
report of receipts and utilization on which such obligation is based, 
unless within such 2-year period, the market administrator notifies the 
handler in writing that such money is due and payable. Service of such 
written notice shall be complete upon mailing to the handler's last 
known address and it shall contain but need not be limited to the 
following information:
    (1) The amount of the obligation;
    (2) The month(s) on which such obligation is based; and
    (3) If the obligation is payable to one or more producers or to a 
cooperative association (except an obligation to be prorated to 
producers under an individual handler pool), the name of such 
producer(s) or such cooperative association, or if the obligation is 
payable to the market administrator, the account for which it is to be 
paid;
    (b) If a handler fails or refuses, with respect to any obligation 
under the order, to make available to the market administrator all 
records required by the order to be made available, the market 
administrator may notify the handler in writing, within the 2-year

[[Page 39]]

period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, of such failure or 
refusal. If the market administrator so notifies a handler, the said 2-
year period with respect to such obligation shall not begin to run until 
the first day of the month following the month during which all such 
records pertaining to such obligation are made available to the market 
administrator;
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, a handler's obligation under the order to pay money shall not 
be terminated with respect to any transaction involving fraud or willful 
concealment of a fact, material to the obligation, on the part of the 
handler against whom the obligation is sought to be imposed; and
    (d) Unless the handler files a petition pursuant to section 
8c(15)(A) of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations (7 CFR 
900.50 et seq.) within the applicable 2-year period indicated below, the 
obligation of the market administrator:
    (1) To pay a handler any money which such handler claims to be due 
him under the terms of the order shall terminate 2 years after the end 
of the month during which the skim milk and butterfat involved in the 
claim were received; or
    (2) To refund any payment made by a handler (including a deduction 
or offset by the market administrator) shall terminate 2 years after the 
end of the month during which payment was made by the handler.

samples, and washing and sanitizing of tank trucks at the premises shall 
not disqualify it as a bulk reload point.

<R05>
Sec. 1001.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A distributing plant from which:
    (1) Not less than 40 percent of its total receipts of fluid milk 
products (except filled milk) in any month, or in either of the 2 
preceding months, are disposed of as Class I (except filled milk); and
    (2) Route disposition (except filled milk) in the marketing area in 
the month:
    (i) Is not less than 10 percent of its total receipts of fluid milk 
products (except filled milk);
    (ii) Exceeds its route disposition in any other Federal marketing 
area; and
    (iii) Exceeds 700 quarts on any day or a daily average of 300 
quarts.
    (b) A supply plant which meets the conditions specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Receipts and disposition 
of filled milk shall be excluded in determining whether a plant has met 
these conditions. For the purposes of this paragraph, milk received at a 
plant from a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d) shall be considered as having been received at that plant 
from dairy farmers' farms.
    (1) It is a plant from which in any month of August and December at 
least 15 percent, and in any month of September through November at 
least 25 percent, of its total receipts of milk from dairy farmers' 
farms is shipped as fluid milk products, other than as diverted milk, to 
pool distributing plants.
    (2) For any month of August through December, it is one of a group 
of plants that meets the conditions specified in this paragraph.
    (i) The handler's written request for continuation of pool supply 
plant status, which the plant held under the handler's operation in the 
preceding month, is received by the market administrator on or before 
the 16th day of the month.
    (ii) The group of plants, considered as a unit, meets the shipping 
requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iii) To qualify as a pool supply plant under this paragraph in 
December of any year, the plant, considered individually, shall have 
shipped at least 5 percent of its total receipts of milk from dairy 
farmers' farms as fluid milk products, other than as diverted milk, to 
pool distributing plants in one of the months of August through December 
of that year.
    (iv) In the event of the failure of a group of plants to meet fully 
the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, termination of 
pool supply plant status shall be limited to the

[[Page 42]]

least number of plants which will result in the remaining supply plants 
meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. If 
such termination becomes necessary, the handler shall be permitted to 
designate which plants shall continue to have pool plant status for the 
month.
    (v) For the purposes of this paragraph, any supply plant operated by 
a cooperative association that is also a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d) 
may be considered as one of a group of plants. In that event, the 
group's total receipts of milk from dairy farmers' farms shall be the 
total of such receipts by the association other than at any of its 
plants that is not one of the group, and the group's qualifying 
shipments shall consist of the qualifying shipments from the plants in 
the group plus the quantity of milk moved by the association in its 
capacity as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d) from farms of its members to 
pool distributing plants.
    (3) For any month of January through July, it is a plant from which 
at least 15 percent of its total receipts of milk from dairy farmers' 
farms is shipped as fluid milk products, other than as diverted milk, to 
pool distributing plants or it is a plant that meets the requirements 
for automatic pool plant status specified in this paragraph. The 
automatic pool plant status of a plant shall be revoked for any month 
for which the market administrator has received the handler's written 
request for revocation on or before the 16th day of that month. In that 
event, the plant shall not have automatic pool plant status in any 
subsequent month of the current January through July period.
    (i) The plant was a pool supply plant under this order in each of 
the preceding months of August through December; or
    (ii) The plant was a pool supply plant under this order in at least 
two of the preceding months of August through December and would have 
been such a plant in all other months in that period had it not been a 
pool plant under the New York-New Jersey Federal order.
    (4) No plant shall be a pool supply plant in any month in which it 
is operated as:
    (i) A pool distributing plant; or
    (ii) A regulated plant under another Federal order if its Class I 
disposition of fluid milk products, except filled milk, in the marketing 
area regulated by that order exceeds its shipments of fluid milk 
products, except filled milk, to pool distributing plants under this 
order.
    (c) Each plant, other than a plant operated as a pool distributing 
plant or a pool supply plant, that is located in the marketing area and 
operated by a cooperative association shall be a pool plant in any month 
in which its route disposition does not exceed 2 percent of its total 
receipts of fluid milk products. Receipts and disposition of filled milk 
shall be excluded in determining whether a plant has met these 
conditions.
    (d) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) An exempt distributing plant under Sec. 1001.8(e);
    (2) The plant of a producer-handler under any Federal order;
    (3) A plant designated as a regular pool plant under the New York-
New Jersey Federal order; or
    (4) Any plant for which the market administrator determines that a 
specified proportion or quantity of the receipts from dairy farmers and 
of milk from other sources handled at a plant is not available for Class 
I use because there is in force an unconditional contract for the plant 
to supply fluid milk products for Class II or Class III use, the plant 
shall not be a pool plant for the month in which the market 
administrator notifies the handler of the determination and for any 
subsequent month in which the contract is in force for any part of the 
month.
[56 FR 5310, Feb. 11, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1001.8  Nonpool plant.

    Nonpool plant means a plant (except a pool plant) which receives 
milk from dairy farmers or is a milk or filled milk manufacturing, 
processing or bottling plant. The following categories of nonpool plants 
are further defined as follows:
    (a) Other order plant means a pool plant under another Federal order 
or any other plant at which all fluid milk products handled become 
subject to the

[[Page 43]]

classification and pricing provisions of another Federal order.
    (b) Producer-handler plant means a plant operated by a producer-
handler as defined in any order (including this part) issued pursuant to 
the Act.
    (c) Partially regulated distributing plant means a nonpool plant 
that is not a regulated plant under another Federal order, a producer-
handler plant, or an exempt distributing plant, and from which there is 
route disposition in the marketing area during the month.
    (d) Unregulated supply plant means a nonpool plant that is not an 
other order plant, a producer-handler plant, or an exempt distributing 
plant from which fluid milk products are shipped during the month to a 
pool plant.
    (e) Exempt distributing plant means:
    (1) A plant, other than a pool supply plant or a regulated plant 
under another Federal order, that meets all the requirements for status 
as a pool distributing plant, except that its route disposition 
(exclusive of filled milk) in the marketing area in the month does not 
exceed 700 quarts on any day or a daily average of 300 quarts.
    (2) A plant that is operated by a governmental agency and from which 
there is route disposition in the marketing area.
[56 FR 5310, Feb. 11, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1001.9  Handler.

    Handler means:
    (a) Any person who operates a pool plant;
    (b) Any person who operates any other plant, or a pool bulk tank 
unit as defined under another Federal order, from which fluid milk 
products are disposed of, directly or indirectly, in the marketing area;
    (c) Any person who does not operate a plant but who engages in the 
business of receiving fluid milk products for resale and distributes to 
retail or wholesale outlets packaged fluid milk products received from 
any plant described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section; or
    (d) Any cooperative association with respect to the milk that is 
moved from farms in tank trucks operated by, or under contract to, the 
association to pool plants or as diverted milk to nonpool plants for the 
account of, and at the direction of, the association. The association 
shall be considered as the handler who received the milk from the dairy 
farmers. However, the cooperative association shall not be the handler 
with respect to the milk moved from any farm if the association and the 
operator of the pool plant to which milk from such farm is moved both 
submit a request in writing, on or before the due date for filing the 
monthly reports of receipts and utilization, that the operator of the 
pool plant be considered as the handler who received the milk from the 
dairy farmer, and the pool plant operator's request states that the pool 
plant operator is purchasing the milk from such farm on the basis of the 
farm bulk tank measurement readings and the butterfat tests of samples 
of the milk taken from the farm bulk tank.

conditions:
    (a) Provides as the person's own enterprise and at the person's own 
risk the maintenance, care, and management of the dairy herd and other 
resources and facilities that are used to produce milk, to process and 
package such milk at the producer-handler's own plant, and to distribute 
it as route disposition.
    (b) The person's own route disposition constitutes the majority of 
the route disposition from the plant.
    (c) The quantity of route disposition in the marketing area from the 
person's plant is greater than in any other Federal marketing area.
    (d) The producer-handler receives no fluid milk products except from 
such handler's own production and from pool handlers, either by transfer

producer-handler's plant each exceed 4,300 pounds per day for the month, 
the producer-handler's receipts from pool plants are not in excess of 2

[[Page 44]]

percent of receipts from own production. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, the producer-handler's receipts of fluid milk products shall 
include receipts from plants of other persons at all retail and 
wholesale outlets that are located in a Federal marketing area and 
operated by the producer-handler, an affiliate, or any person who 
controls or is controlled by the producer-handler.

or dealer shall be considered as having been performed by the handler or 
dealer. Receipts from a ``dairy farmer for other markets'' under 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be considered as 
receipts from the unregulated plant at which the greatest quantity of 
his milk was received in the most recent month.
    (a) The term includes a dairy farmer with respect to milk that is 
purchased from him during the month by a dealer who operates a plant but 
does not operate a pool plant, if the milk is moved to a pool plant 
directly from the dairy farmer's farm. The term shall not apply to the 
dairy farmer, however, if all the nonpool milk purchased from him during 
the month by the same dealer is a receipt of producer milk under the 
provisions of another Federal order or will be such if the dairy farmer 
is a producer under this order.
    (b) The term includes a dairy farmer with respect to milk that is 
purchased from him by a handler and moved to a pool plant or that is 
purchased from him by a cooperative association in its capacity as a 
handler under Sec. 1001.9(d), if that handler caused milk from the same 
farm to be moved as nonpool milk to any plant during the same month. The 
term shall not apply to the dairy farmer, however, if all the nonpool 
milk is a receipt of producer milk under the provisions of another 
Federal order or will be such if the dairy farmer is a producer under 
this order or if all the nonpool milk is excluded from producer milk 
under Sec. 1001.15.
    (c) The term includes a dairy farmer with respect to milk that is 
received from him by a handler at a pool plant or that is purchased from 
him by a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d) during any of the months of January through July, if the 
handler caused nonpool milk from the same farm to be received during any 
of the preceding months of August through December at a plant that is 
not a pool plant under any Federal order in the current month. The term 
shall not apply to the dairy farmer, however, if all the nonpool milk 
was a receipt of producer milk under the provisions of another Federal 
order or represented receipts from own production by a producer-handler 
under any Federal order, or was excluded from producer milk under 
Sec. 1001.15.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) 
of this section, the term shall apply to any dairy farmer with respect 
to milk moved from his farm to a handler's pool plant or purchased from 
him by a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d) during any month in which milk from that farm was 
received as base milk under another Federal order.

    (a) A producer-handler under any Federal order;
    (b) A dairy farmer with respect to milk caused to be moved from his

shall include any milk of a producer that was not received at any plant 
but which the handler or an agent of the handler has accepted, measured, 
sampled, and transferred from the producer's farm tank into a tank truck 
during the month. Such milk shall be considered as having been received 
at the pool plant at which other milk from the same farm of that 
producer is received by the handler during the month, except that in the 
case of a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d), the milk shall be considered as having been received at 
a plant in the zone location of the pool plant, or pool plants within 
the same zone, to which the greatest aggregate quantity of the milk of 
the cooperative association in such capacity was moved during the 
current month or the most recent month.

    (d) Receipts of any milk product (other than a fluid milk product or 
a product specified in Sec. 1001.40(b)(1)) for which the handler fails

Sec. 1001.15  Diverted milk.

    Diverted milk means milk, other than that excluded under 
Sec. 1001.12 from being considered as received from a producer, that 
meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 
and is not excluded from diverted milk under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (a) Milk that a handler in its capacity as the operator of a pool 
plant reports as having been moved from a dairy farmer's farm to the 
pool plant, but which the handler caused to be moved from the farm to 
another plant, if the handler specifically reports such movement to the 
other plant as a movement of diverted milk, and the conditions of 
paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section have been met. Milk that is 
diverted milk under this paragraph shall be considered to have been 
received at the pool plant from which it was diverted, but for pricing 
purposes the location adjustments for the zone location specified in 
Sec. 1001.53 shall be used.
    (1) During any 2 months subsequent to July of the preceding calendar 
year, or during the current month, on more than half of the days on 
which the handler caused milk to be moved from the dairy farmer's farm 
during the month, all of the milk that the handler caused to be moved 
from that farm was physically received as producer milk at the handler's 
pool plant or at another of the handler's pool plants that is no longer 
operated as a plant.

[[Page 46]]

    (2) During the current month and not more than 5 other months 
subsequent to July of the preceding calendar year, milk from the dairy 
farmer's farm was received at or diverted from the handler's pool plant 
as producer milk, and during the current month all of the milk from that 
farm that the handler reported as diverted milk was moved from the farm 
in a tank truck in which it was intermingled with milk from other farms, 
the milk from a majority of which farms was diverted from the same pool 
plant in accordance with the preceding provisions of this paragraph.
    (b) Milk that a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler 
under Sec. 1001.9(d) caused to be moved from a dairy farmer's farm to a 
nonpool plant if the association specifically reports the movement to 
such plant as a movement of diverted milk, and the conditions of 
paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section have been met. Milk that is 
diverted under this paragraph shall be considered to have been received 
by the cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d), but for pricing purposes the location adjustments for 
the zone location specified in Sec. 1001.53 shall be used.
    (1) During any 2 months subsequent to July of the preceding calendar 
year, or during the current month, on more than half of the days on 
which the cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d) caused milk to be moved from the farm as producer milk 
during the month, all of the milk that the association caused to be 
moved from the farm was physically received at a pool plant.
    (2) During the current month and not more than 5 other months 
subsequent to July of the preceding calendar year, the cooperative 
association in its capacity as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d) caused 
milk to be moved from the dairy farmer's farm as producer milk, and 
during the current month all of the milk from that farm that the 
cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d) reported as diverted milk was moved from the farm in a 
tank truck in which it was intermingled with milk from other farms, the 
milk from a majority of which farms was diverted by the association in 
accordance with the preceding provisions of this paragraph.
    (c) Milk moved, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, from dairy farmers' farms to nonpool plants in excess of 35 
percent in the months of September through November and 45 percent in 
other months, of the total quantity of producer milk received (including 
diversions) by the handler during the month shall not be diverted milk. 
Such milk, and any other milk reported as diverted milk that fails to 
meet the requirements set forth in this section, shall be considered as 
having been moved directly from the dairy farmers' farms to the plant of 
physical receipt, and if that plant is a nonpool plant the milk shall be 
excluded from producer milk. If the handler fails to designate the dairy 
farmers whose milk is to be so excluded, the entire quantity of milk 
that the handler caused to be moved from dairy farmers' farms directly 
to nonpool plants during the month shall be excluded from producer milk.

Sec. 1001.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1001.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraphs; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(6) of this section which was received in the form of a bulk fluid milk 
product or a bulk fluid cream product;
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant and milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1001.9(d));
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1001.9(d) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that if the 
operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such milk 
on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm and 
butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the applicable 
percentage under this paragraph shall be 2 percent:
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in receipts from dairy farmers for other markets and in bulk fluid milk 
products received from unregulated supply plants, excluding the quantity 
for which Class II or Class III classification is requested by the 
handler; and
    (7) Less 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products transferred to other plants that is not in 
excess of the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat to which 
percentages are applied in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) of 
this section; and
    (c) The quantity of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
shrinkage of milk from producers for which a cooperative association is 
the handler pursuant to Sec. 1001.9(d), but not in excess of 0.5 percent 
of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such milk. If the 
operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such milk 
on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm and 
butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the applicable 
percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative association shall be 
zero.

Sec. 1001.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream

[[Page 52]]

product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be classified as 
Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request the same 
classification in another class. In either case, the classification of 
such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1001.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1001.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1001.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1001.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1001.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of Sec. 1001.44(b), the skim 
milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source 
milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than 
would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1001.40.
    (c) Transfers and diversions to producer-handlers and to exempt 
distributing plants. Skim milk or butterfat in the following forms that 
is transferred or diverted from a pool plant to a producer-handler under 
this or any other Federal order or to an exempt distributing plant shall 
be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and

[[Page 53]]

    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or an exempt distributing plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1001.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of milk for 
such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of milk from plants not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order which the market administrator 
determines constitute regular sources of milk for such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining

[[Page 54]]

Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and then to Class III 
utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

Sec. 1001.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1001.9(d) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1001.40, 
1001.41, and 1001.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1001.9(d) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative; and
    (d) If receipts from more than one pool plant are to be assigned, 
the receipts shall be assigned in sequence according to the zone 
locations of the plants, beginning with the plant in the lowest-numbered 
zone for assignments to Class I milk and beginning with the plant in the 
highest numbered zone for assignments to Class III milk; and
    (e) Receipts of other source milk from more than one plant shall be 
assigned in sequence according to the zone locations of the plants, 
beginning with the plant in the lowest-numbered zone for assignments to 
Class I milk and beginning with the plant in the highest-numbered zone 
for assignments to Class III milk.
    (f) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.
    (g) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1001.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1001.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

Sec. 1001.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1001.9(a) for each of the handler's pool plants separately and of 
each handler described in Sec. 1001.9(d) by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to the handler's utilization 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

[[Page 55]]

    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1001.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; and
    (ii) Receipts of exempt milk;
    (iii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1001.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1001.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(5) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1001.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1001.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1001.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts from dairy farmers of fluid milk products which are 
rejected and segregated in the handler's normal operation for receiving 
milk, and which receipts are accepted and disposed of by the handler as 
salvage product rather than as milk;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from an exempt 
distributing plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;

[[Page 56]]

    (vii) Receipts of fluid milk products (other than exempt milk) from 
a local or State government which has elected nonproducer status for the 
month pursuant to Sec. 1001.16(c); and
    (viii) Receipts of fluid milk products from dairy farmers for other 
markets;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
this allocation step (exclusive of transfers between pool plants of the 
same handler) at all pool plants of the handler;
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants remaining at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1001.40(b)(1), in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(iii), (a)(5) and (7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, prorata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v) and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk

[[Page 57]]

products to the same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk 
products to be allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from another order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii) and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II with respect to whichever of 
the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class, as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1001.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the

[[Page 58]]

computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this section 
result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I that 
exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class

(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from other pool plants according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1001.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and in receipts from 
handlers under Sec. 1001.9(d), subtract such excess from the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with Class III. 
Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1001.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from a 
regulated plant or handler under another Federal order pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1001.44(b), 
estimate and publicly announce the utilization (to the nearest whole 
percentage) in each class during the month of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such estimate shall be 
based upon the most current available data and shall be final for such 
purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1001.43(g) and Sec. 1001.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.

Sec. 1001.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1001.76 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section

Sec. 1001.52  Plant location adjustments.

    The Class I and blended prices computed under Secs. 1001.50 and 
1001.61 shall be subject to plant location adjustments based upon the 
zone locations of plants. The zone location of any plant and the 
location adjustments applicable to each zone location shall be 
determined as specified in this section.
    (a) The following zones are defined for the purpose of determining 
location adjustments:
    (1) Zone 1 shall include the State of Rhode Island and the 
Massachusetts counties of Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Norfolk, Plymouth 
and Suffolk, and between Boston and Massachusetts highway route number 
128.
    (2) Zone 2 shall include the Massachusetts counties of Middlesex 
(only that portion south of Massachusetts highway route number 2 not 
included in Zone 1) and Worcester (only the townships of Berlin, 
Blackstone, Bolton, Douglas, Hopedale, Mendon, Milford, Millville, 
Northborough, Northbridge, Southborough, Sutton, Upton, Uxbridge, 
Westborough and that portion of Harvard township south of Massachusetts 
highway route number 2).
    (3) Zone 3 shall include: (i) The Connecticut counties of Middlesex 
(except the townships of Cromwell, Durham, Haddam, Middlefield, 
Middletown, and Portland), New London, Tolland (except the townships of 
Ellington and Somers), and Windham.
    (ii) The Massachusetts county of Worcester (only the townships of 
Auburn, Boylston, Charlton, Clinton, Dudley, Grafton, Holden, Lancaster, 
Leicester, Millbury, Oxford, Paxton, Shrewsbury, Southbridge, Sterling, 
Webster, West Boylston, and Worcester City).
    (4) Zone 5 shall include: (i) The Connecticut counties of Fairfield, 
Hartford, Litchfield, Middlesex (only the townships of Cromwell, Durham, 
Haddam, Middlefield, Middletown and Portland), New Haven, and Tolland 
(only the townships of Ellington and Somers).
    (ii) The Massachusetts counties of Hampden (only the townships of 
Brimfield, Holland, Monson, Palmer and Wales), Hampshire (only the 
township of Ware) and Worcester (only the townships of Brookfield, East 
Brookfield, Hardwick, New Braintree, North Brookfield, Oakham, Spencer, 
Sturbridge, Warren and West Brookfield).

    (b)-(c)  [Reserved]
    (d) The zone location of each plant in the State of Massachusetts 
(except Berkshire County) that is outside the areas specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be based upon its highway mileage 
distance to Boston, Massachusetts. The distance for each plant shall be 
the mileage between Boston, Massachusetts, and the named point nearest 
to the plant, measured to the greatest extent possible over roads 
designated as principal roads, on the road maps specified in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (e) The zone location of each plant that is outside the areas 
specified in

[[Page 61]]

paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall be based upon its 
highway mileage distance to Boston, Mass., as determined by use of 
Mileage Guide No. 11, and supplements to and revisions thereof, issued 
by Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, Agent, Arlington, Va. The mileages 
used shall be those shown between designated key points in the mileage 
charts, and between named points on the appropriate State road maps, as 
published in the mileage guide. In any instance in which the map does 
not clearly show the mileage between points on a road, the mileage used 
shall be the mileage as determined by the highway authority for the 
State in which the road is located. The distance for each plant shall be 
the mileage between Boston and the named point nearest to the plant, as 
shown in the mileage charts. If that named point is not listed in the 
mileage charts, the distance for the plant shall be the lowest mileage 
distance between Boston and that named point, computed as follows:
    (1) Determine from the charts the mileage between Boston and each of 
the three key points nearest to the named point which are nearer to 
Boston than the named point; and
    (2) For each of these key points, add to the result in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section the mileage between the key point and the named 
point, measured to the greatest extent possible over roads designated as 
principal roads.
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, 
for any named point located in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, 
or Berkshire County, Mass., determine the highway mileage distance 
between Boston and the named point by use of the appropriate State maps 
contained in Mileage Guide No. 7, issued by Household Goods Carriers' 
Bureau, Agent, Arlington, Va. Such distance shall be the lowest highway 
mileage between Boston and the named point on the map, over roads 
designated thereon as paved, all-weather roads. In the event that the 
named point is not located on a through, paved, all-weather road, such 
other roads shall be used to reach a through, paved, all-weather road as 
will result in the lowest highway mileage to Boston, except that such 
other roads shall not be used for a distance of more than 15 miles if it 
is otherwise possible to connect with a through, paved, all-weather 
road. In any instance in which the map does not clearly show the mileage 
between points on a road, the mileage used shall be the mileage as 
determined by the highway authority for the State in which the road is 
located. The mileage so determined, or the mileage determined under 
paragraph (e) of this section, whichever is less, shall be considered to 
be the lowest highway mileage distance between Boston and the named 
point.
    (g) The location adjustments for each plant shall be the amounts 
shown in the following table for the zone in which the plant is located:

and credits under Sec. 1001.71, the minimum amounts payable to producers 
under Sec. 1001.73, and the minimum amounts payable to cooperative 
associations under Sec. 1001.74, the location adjustments specified in 
Sec. 1001.52 for the zone location of the plant for which the 
computation is being made shall be used except that for the following 
items the adjustments for the zone locations specified shall be used:
    (a) For producer milk diverted by any handler, including a 
cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d), the zone location of the plant to which the milk was 
diverted;
    (b) For producer milk of a cooperative association in its capacity 
as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d) moved to a pool plant, the zone 
location of the plant to which the milk was moved;
    (c) For milk of a cooperative association in its capacity as a 
handler under Sec. 1001.9(d) in shrinkage, overage, extraordinary loss, 
and ending inventory, the zone location of the pool plant, or pool 
plants within the same zone, to which the greatest aggregate quantity of 
such milk of the cooperative association was moved during the current 
month or the most recent month;
    (d) For beginning inventory of a cooperative association in its 
capacity as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d), the zone location at which 
the milk was priced as ending inventory during the previous month;
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) For receipts from unregulated supply plants assigned to Class I 
milk, the zone location of the plant from which the product was 
received;
    (g) For any excess of beginning inventory assigned to Class I milk 
under Sec. 1001.44(a)(2)(iii), (a)(5), (a)(7)(i), or (a)(9) over the 
quantities of producer milk and of milk from cooperative associations in 
their capacity as handlers under Sec. 1001.9(d) assigned to Class II and 
Class III milk in the preceding month, the zone location of the pool 
plants from which an equivalent quantity of receipts of fluid milk 
products were assigned to Class II or Class III milk in the preceding 
month in sequence beginning with the plant in the lowest-numbered zone; 
and
    (h) For purposes of computing the value of fluid milk products at 
class prices, any fluid milk products moved in bulk from a pool plant to 
another pool plant at which a higher Class I price applies and which is 
classified as Class I milk shall be priced at the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the plant to which the milk was moved 
subject to a location adjustment credit for the transferee-plant 
determined by the market administrator as follows:
    (1) After the allocation step of Sec. 1001.44(a)(12) for the 
transferee-plant, multiply the remaining pounds of Class I skim milk and 
Class I butterfat, plus the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in 
receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from other pool plants that 
are assigned to Class I use, by 110 percent and 150 percent, 
respectively;
    (2) Subtract the respective pounds of skim milk and butterfat in 
bulk fluid milk products physically received at the plant from the 
following sources:
    (i) Producers;
    (ii) Cooperative associations in their capacity as handlers under 
Sec. 1001.9(d);
    (iii) Receipts of diverted milk from pool plants; and
    (iv) Receipts (other than diverted milk) from pool plants at which 
the same or a higher Class I price applies;
    (3) Assign any pounds remaining (which are not in excess of Class I 
transfers) to skim milk and butterfat in bulk receipts of fluid milk 
products (except diverted milk) from other pool plants at which a lower 
Class I price applies in sequence according to the zone location of the 
plants, beginning with the plant in the lowest numbered zone; and
    (4) Multiply the hundredweight computed for each transferor-plant in 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section by the difference in the Class I prices 
applicable at the transferee-plant and transferor-plant and total such 
amounts.

Sec. 1001.60  Handler's value of milk for computing basic blended price.

    For the purpose of computing the basic blended price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants, and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1001.9(d) with respect to milk that was not 
received at a pool plant, as directed in this section. The prices used 
shall be those for the applicable zone locations as determined under 
Sec. 1001.53.
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1001.9(d) that were classified in each class 
as determined pursuant to Sec. 1001.44 by the applicable class prices 
and add the resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1001.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1001.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1001.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1001.44(b).
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1001.43(g) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv), (vii), and (viii) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1001.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid 
cream products from an other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid 
milk products from pool plants, other order plants and unregulated 
supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between

the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1001.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1001.44(b);

applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1001.43(g) and Sec. 1001.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1001.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the

[[Page 64]]

hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.43(g);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1001.61(e); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1001.61  Partially regulated distributing plant operator's value of milk for computing basic blended price.

    For the purpose of computing the basic blended price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk 
distributed as route disposition in the marketing area by the operator 
of a partially regulated distributing plant, as follows:
    (a) Subtract from the quantity of route disposition, except 
reconstituted milk products, distributed in the marketing area by the 
partially regulated distributing plant operator the quantity of fluid 
milk products (except reconstituted milk products and those described in 
paragraph (b) of this section) received at the plant during the month 
that is classified and priced as Class I milk or the equivalent thereof 
under any marketwide pool Federal order and that is not used to offset 
route disposition in any other marketing area, and multiply the result 
by the applicable Class I price;
    (b) Multiply by the difference between the applicable Class I price 
and the Class III price for the month the quantity of filled milk 
distributed as route disposition in the marketing area from the 
partially regulated distributing plant which is not proved to have been 
made from other fresh fluid milk products; and
    (c) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant. Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds 
of labeled reconstituted milk included previously in this paragraph by 
the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of 
the partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any 
reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not 
be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (d) Add the values pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section.
    (e) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1001.43(g). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the

[[Page 65]]

nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the Class I price 
applicable under the other order at the location of the plant where the 
nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the 
Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment option shall 
apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the plant that 
processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more 
Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement 
fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the 
nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the 
source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk 
products cannot be determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1001.62  Computation of basic blended price.

    The market administrator shall compute the basic blended price per 
hundredweight applicable to milk received at plants located in zone 21 
and containing 3.5 percent butterfat as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Secs. 1001.60 and 1001.61 for all handlers from whom the market 
administrator has received at the market administrator's office prior to 
the 11th day after the end of the month the reports for the month 
prescribed in Sec. 1001.30 and the payments for the preceding month 
required under Sec. 1001.72(a);
    (b) Deduct the amount of the plus adjustments, and add the amount of 
the minus adjustments, that are applicable under Secs. 1001.52 and 
1001.53;
    (c)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance of the producer-settlement fund at the close of business on the 
10th day after the end of the month;
    (f) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk;
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1001.60(f); and
    (3) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1001.61(a); and
    (g) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents for the 
purpose of retaining a cash balance in the producer-settlement fund. The 
result shall be the basic blended price for the month.

to his right to offset any amounts due from the handler under these 
sections and under Secs. 1001.85 and 1001.86.
    (b) All amounts subtracted under Sec. 1001.62(c), including interest 
earned thereon, shall remain in the producer-settlement fund as an

Sec. 1001.62(d).
    (c) The market administrator shall place all monies subtracted under

<R05>
Sec. 1001.71  Handlers' producer-settlement fund debits and credits.

    On or before the 15th day after the end of the month, the market 
administrator shall render a statement to each handler showing the 
amount of the handler's producer-settlement fund debit or credit, as 
calculated in this section.
    (a) The producer-settlement fund debit or credit for each plant and 
each cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d) shall be computed as specified in this paragraph.
    (1) Multiply the quantities of producer milk, the quantities of 
fluid milk products received at the pool plant from cooperative 
associations in their capacity as handlers under Sec. 1001.9(d), the 
quantities of other source fluid milk receipts at pool plants that were 
allocated to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1001.44; and the quantities of 
route disposition in the marketing area by partially regulated 
distributing plants for which a value was determined pursuant to 
Sec. 1001.61(a) by the basic blended price computed under Sec. 1001.62 
adjusted by any location adjustments applicable under Secs. 1001.52 and 
1001.53.
    (2) For any cooperative association in its capacity as a handler 
under Sec. 1001.9(d), multiply the quantities of milk moved to each pool 
plant by the basic blended price computed under Sec. 1001.62 adjusted by 
any location adjustments applicable under Secs. 1001.52 and 1001.53; and 
to the result add the value determined under Sec. 1001.60.
    (3) If the value of fluid milk products, as determined under 
Sec. 1001.60 for any pool plant, under Sec. 1001.61 for any partially 
regulated distributing plant, or under paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
for any cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under 
Sec. 1001.9(d), is greater than the credit as determined under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, the difference shall be the producer-settlement 
fund debit for the plant or the cooperative association in its capacity 
as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d).
    (4) If the value of fluid milk products, as determined under 
Sec. 1001.60 or 1001.61 for any plant, or as determined under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section for any cooperative association in its capacity 
as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d), is less than the credit as determined 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the difference shall be the 
producer-settlement fund credit for the plant or the cooperative 
association in its capacity as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d).
    (b) The producer-settlement fund debit or credit of any handler 
shall be the net of the producer-settlement fund debits and credits as 
computed for all of its operations under paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 1001.72  Payments to and from the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 18th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay to the market administrator the handler's producer-
settlement fund debit for the month as determined under Sec. 1001.71.
    (b) On or before the 20th day after the end of the month, the market 
administrator shall pay to each handler the handler's producer-
settlement fund credit for the month as determined under Sec. 1001.71. 
If the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund is 
insufficient to make such payments, the market administrator shall 
reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete them as soon as the 
funds are available.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.73  Payments to producers.

    (a) On or before the 5th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay each producer for milk received from him during the 
first 15 days of the month at a rate that is not less than the Class III 
price for the preceding month.
    (b) On or before the 20th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall make final payment to each producer for the total value of 
milk received from him during the month at not less than the basic 
blended price per hundredweight computed under Sec. 1001.62, adjusted by 
the location adjustment applicable under Secs. 1001.52 and 1001.53 and 
the butterfat differential applicable under Sec. 1001.76, minus the 
amount of the payment made to the producer under paragraph (a) of this 
section. If

[[Page 67]]

the handler has not received full payment from the market administrator 
under Sec. 1001.72(b) by the date payments are due under this paragraph, 
he may reduce pro rata his payments to producers by an amount not to 
exceed such underpayment. Such payments shall be completed after receipt 
of the balance due from the market administrator by the next following 
date for making payments under this paragraph.
    (c) If the handler's net payment to a producer is for an amount less 
than the total amount due the producer under this section, the burden 
shall rest upon the handler to prove to the market administrator that 
each deduction from the total amount due is properly authorized and 
properly chargeable to the producer.
    (d) In making payment to producers under paragraph (b) of this 
section for milk diverted from a pool plant the handler may elect to pay 
such producers at the price applicable at the zone location of the plant 
from which the milk was diverted, if the resulting net payment to each 
producer is not less than that otherwise required under this section and 
the rate of payment and the deductions shown on the statement required 
to be furnished under Sec. 1001.75 are those used in computing the 
payment.

Sec. 1001.74  Payments to cooperative associations.

    (a) Each cooperative association may file with a handler who is not 
a cooperative association a claim either for the payments that the 
handler is required to make to the association's producer members under 
Sec. 1001.73 or for authorized deductions from such payments. The claim 
shall contain a list of the producers to whom the payments are due or to 
whom the deductions apply, an agreement to indemnify the handler in the 
making of such payments or deductions, and a certification that the 
association has for each producer listed an unterminated membership 
contract authorizing the payment or deduction.
    (b) The handler shall withhold from the association's producer 
members the payments or the deductions specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section in accordance with the association's claim. He shall pay 
the amounts withheld to the association on or before the dates on which 
such amounts otherwise would have been due to the producer members under 
Sec. 1001.73.
    (c) For each producer member from whom payment was withheld, the 
handler shall furnish the association a supporting statement showing the 
information required to be furnished to the producer under Sec. 1001.75. 
Such information with respect to milk received during the first 15 days 
of the month shall be furnished not later than the 27th day of the month 
and with respect to milk received during the remainder of the month not 
later than the 12th day of the following month. For each producer member 
from whom a deduction is made under this section, the handler shall 
furnish the association a statement showing the pounds of milk received.
    (d) Each handler who receives fluid milk products at his plant from 
a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool 
plant or in its capacity as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d) shall make 
payment to the association for such receipts as follows:
    (1) On or before the 5th day after the end of the month, for the 
fluid milk products received from the association during the first 15 
days of the month at a rate that is not less than the Class III price 
for the preceding month. The payment made to the association under this 
subparagraph shall constitute partial payment of the total amount 
required to be paid under this paragraph.
    (2) On or before the 20th day after the end of the month, for not 
less than the total value of fluid milk products received from the 
association's pool plants, as determined by multiplying the respective 
quantities assigned to each class under Sec. 1001.44 by the class price 
for the month, adjusted by the location adjustments applicable under 
Secs. 1001.52 and 1001.53 and the butterfat differential applicable 
under Sec. 1001.76, minus the amount of the payment made to the 
association under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) On or before the 20th day after the end of the month, for not 
less than the

[[Page 68]]

total value of milk received from the cooperative association in its 
capacity as a handler under Sec. 1001.9(d), at the basic blended price 
per hundredweight for the month computed under Sec. 1001.62, adjusted by 
the location adjustment applicable under Secs. 1001.52 and 1001.53 and 
the butterfat differential applicable under Sec. 1001.76, minus the 
amount of the payment made to the association under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section. If the handler has not received full payment from the 
market administrator under Sec. 1001.72(b) by the date payment is due 
under this paragraph, he may reduce his payment to the association by an 
amount not to exceed such underpayment. Such payment shall be completed 
after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator by the 
next following date for making payment under this paragraph.

designation as a producer-handler: Provided, That all milk production 
resources and facilities owned, operated, or controlled by the applicant 
either directly or indirectly shall be considered as constituting a part 
of the applicant's milk production unit in the absence of proof 
satisfactory to the market administrator that some portion of such 
facilities or resources do not constitute an actual or potential source 
of milk supply for the applicant's operation as a producer-handler.
    (5) Such other information as may be required by the market 
administrator.
    (b) Requirements. (1) The handler has and exercises (in his capacity 
as a handler) complete and exclusive control over the operation and 
management of a plant at which he handles milk received from production 
facilities and resources (milking herd, buildings housing such herd, and 
the land on which such buildings are located) the operation and 
management of which also are under the complete and exclusive control of 
the handler (in his capacity as a dairy farmer), all of which facilities 
and resources for the production, processing, and distribution of milk 
and milk products constitute an integrated operation over which the 
handler (in his capacity as a producer-handler) has and exercises 
complete and exclusive control.
    (2) The handler, in his capacity as a handler, handles no fluid milk 
products other than those derived from the milk production facilities 
and resources designated as constituting the applicant's operation as a 
producer-handler.
    (3) The handler is not, either directly or indirectly, associated 
with control or management of the operation of another plant or another 
handler, nor is another handler so associated with his operation.
    (4) The handler sells more than an average of 100 quarts per day of 
Class I-A milk to persons in the marketing area other than to other 
plants.
    (5) In case the plant of the applicant was operated by a handler 
whose designation as a producer-handler previously had been cancelled 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the quantity of fluid milk 
products handled during the 12 months preceding the application which 
was derived from sources other than the designated milk production 
facilities and resources constituting the applicant's operation as a 
producer-handler is less than the volume set forth for cancellation 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section.
    (c) Cancellation. The designation as a producer-handler shall be 
cancelled under conditions set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of 
this section or, except as specified in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of 
this section, upon determination by the market administrator that any of

be met, such cancellation to be effective on the first day of the month 
following the month in which the requirements were not met.

the producer-handler is delivered in the name of another person as pool 
milk to another handler or except in the months of June through November 
with prior notice to the market administrator, a dairy herd, cattle 
barn, or milking parlor is transferred to another person who uses such 
facilities or resources for producing milk which is delivered as pool 
milk to another handler. This provision, however, shall not be deemed to 
preclude the occasional sale of individual cows from the herd.
    (2) A dairy herd, cattle barn, or milking parlor, previously used 
for the production of milk delivered as pool milk to another handler, is 
added to the designated milk production facilities and resources of the 
producer-handler, except in the months of December through May, with 
prior notice to the market administrator, or if such facilities and 
resources were a part of the designated production facilities and 
resources during any of the preceding 12 months. This provision, 
however, shall not be deemed to preclude the occasional purchase of 
individual cows for the herd.
    (3) If the producer-handler handles an average of more than 150 
product pounds per day of fluid milk products which are derived from 
sources other than the designated milk production facilities and 
resources, the cancellation of designation shall be effective the first 
of the month in which he handled such fluid milk products.

[[Page 74]]

    (4) If the producer-handler handles fluid milk products derived from 
sources other than the designated milk production facilities and 
resources in a volume less than specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, the designation shall be cancelled effective on the first of 
the month following the third month in any six-month period in which the 
producer-handler handled such fluid milk products: Provided, That the 
receipt of up to an average of ten pounds per day of packaged fluid milk 
products in the form of fluid skim milk, or of any volume of other 
packaged fluid milk products (except milk) from pool plants, shall not 
be counted for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4).
    (d) Public announcement. The market administrator shall publicly 
announce the name, plant, and farm location of persons designated as 
producer-handlers, and those whose designations have been canceled. Such 
announcements shall be controlling with respect to the accounting at 
plants of other handlers for fluid milk products received from such 
producer-handler on and after the first of the month following the date 
of such announcement.
    (e) Burden of establishing and maintaining producer-handler status. 
The burden rests upon the handler who is designated as a producer-
handler (and upon the applicant for such designation) to establish 
through records required pursuant to Sec. 1000.5 that the requirements 
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section have been and are continuing 
to be met and that the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section for cancellation of designation do not exist.

of the month following the month in which an application is received by 
the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary shall either determine that the provisions of paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (4) of this section either have been met or have not been 
met, or notify the applicant that additional information is needed prior 
to making a determination. Such designation shall be effective the first 
of the month following the date of designation and shall continue until 
such designation is canceled pursuant to Sec. 1002.27: Provided, That 
notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this 
section, any plant which for the month immediately preceding the 
effective date of this section, had a designation pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.24 as then in effect, is hereby designated a regular pool 
plant from the effective date of this section until such designation is 
canceled pursuant to Sec. 1002.27.
    (1) An application by the operator of the plant for such 
determination has been addressed to the Secretary and filed at the 
office of the market administrator: Provided, That if 50 percent or more 
of the dairy farmers delivering milk at such plant deliver such milk for 
the account of a cooperative association which does not operate the 
plant but for which milk such association receives payment, an 
application must be filed by such cooperative association as well as the 
person operating the plant.
    (2) The plant is located in New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania.
    (3) The plant was a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of 
Sec. 1002.28 for each of the 12 months immediately preceding the month 
during which an application is filed.
    (4) The operating requirements of Sec. 1002.26 are being met.
    (b) A plant may be designated at any time as a regular pool plant 
upon application made by the person operating the plant to the Secretary 
showing that the plant is a replacement for one or more pool plants, 
designated pursuant to this section, which are operated by him and that 
substantially all of the dairy farmers delivering milk at the plant 
previously delivered milk to the pool plant or plants replaced.

Sec. 1002.25  Bulk tank units.

    Any handler receiving milk from farms in a tank truck shall 
establish such farms in one or more bulk tank units (hereinafter called 
``units'') each consisting of one or more farms, in accordance with 
provisions of this section. The milk of any farm included in a unit 
shall be considered for pricing purposes as having been received by the 
handler in the unit at the nearest point of the township (as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.52(b)) in which such farm is located. Any handler 
who receives milk at a pool plant or a plant distributing Class I-A milk 
in the marketing area which is delivered from a farm to such plant in a 
tank truck shall be deemed to have received such milk from a unit, pool, 
partial pool, or nonpool, and any handler who receives bulk milk from a 
farm in a tank truck containing pool milk shall be deemed to have 
received such milk from a farm of a unit either pool, partial pool, or 
nonpool.
    (a) Handlers who may establish, maintain, and be responsible for 
pool units are as follows:
    (1) A handler who operates a pool plant or a handler who operates a 
plant from which Class I-A milk is distributed in the marketing area 
other than to another plant: Provided, That a handler who is affiliated 
with or is a subsidiary of a handler operating a pool plant may also 
operate pool units if both handlers notify the market administrator in 
writing of such relationship: Provided further, That such handler who 
operates a distributing plant but not a pool plant, to be eligible to 
maintain a pool unit for any month, must have combined receipts of skim 
milk and butterfat from such unit for such month classified as Classes 
I-A and I-B in a percentage at least as great as the market percentage 
of pool milk in Classes I-A and I-B for the same month of the preceding 
year.
    (2) A cooperative handler who does not operate a plant but who 
receives milk from farms in a tank truck and delivers such milk to 
plants of other handlers if such cooperative for 12 months has been 
qualified as a basis for payments pursuant to Sec. 1002.77 or if such 
cooperative has operated a pool

[[Page 78]]

unit for 12 consecutive months: Provided, That such cooperative must 
meet the definition of a cooperative set forth in Sec. 1002.77(a)(1).
    (3) Any other cooperative handler who does not operate a plant if 
such cooperative meets the definition of a cooperative set forth in 
Sec. 1002.77(a)(1) subject to the conditions of this section.
    (4) For the months specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this 
section, any other handler operating a unit in any of the months of 
April, May, or June which unit had for such month any skim milk or 
butterfat classified as Class I-A milk in the marketing area (on some 
basis other than failure to account for such milk) and had a total Class 
I-A and Class I-B classification in a percentage at least as great as 
the market percentage of pool milk in Classes I-A and I-B for the same 
month in the preceding year.
    (i) Such month.
    (ii) Each of the months through March following such month except 
for any month when the Class I-B or combined Class I-A and Class I-B of 
such unit is less than 60 percent.
    (b) The handler may establish the units in any manner chosen by him, 
subject to the following limitations:
    (1) Each unit shall have a headquarters where the basic record of 
receipts and butterfat tests of milk from each farm are maintained and 
where there is maintained the basic record of each receipt and each 
delivery of milk by each tank truck receiving milk from farms of the 
unit and related details with respect to the movement of such milk.
    (2) Each unit shall be given a name indicating the general 
geographic area in which farms comprising such unit are located.
    (3) The handler shall declare whether each unit is to be operated as 
a pool unit. Farms from which the milk is to be pooled shall be 
established in a separate unit from those which are not to be pooled.
    (4) Farms in the area specified in paragraph (e) of this section 
shall be in units separate from farms in the area specified in paragraph 
(f) of this section.
    (c) Except as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this 
section, a handler may declare that a unit is to be operated as a pool 
unit and at any time may add a farm to a pool unit: Provided, That a 
handler pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section may not add farms 
to a pool unit during the months of July through March unless such 
handler's Class I-A skim milk or butterfat utilization exceeds the total 
receipts of skim milk or butterfat, respectively, in milk from the pool 
unit, and in the latter case he may add only the smallest number of 
farms necessary to provide sufficient milk to cover such Class I-A 
utilization.
    (1) If the unit is a declared nonpool unit or if the farm is a part 
of a declared nonpool unit of such handler, the unit or farm may be 
changed to a pool status, except as excluded from the pool milk 
definition pursuant to Sec. 1002.14(d), only beginning the first day of 
a month upon notice to the market administrator by not later than the 
10th day of such month. If the notice is filed after the 10th day of the 
month, the effective date shall be the first day of the following month 
except as specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    (2) In the period of December through June, no new pool unit may be 
established, no nonpool or partial pool unit may be declared to be a 
pool unit, and no farm may be added to a pool unit if the handler 
caused, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, any pool unit or 
any farm of a pool unit to become nonpool in the period of July through 
November immediately preceding: Provided, That this limitation shall not 
prevent the handler from including in a pool unit a farm which for the 
first time has converted from can delivery to bulk tank delivery and 
from which the handler received as pool milk all milk delivered by such 
farm in cans for a period of 30 days immediately preceding: Provided 
further, That, except in the case set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, this paragraph (c)(2) shall not be applicable if the farm which 
is caused to become nonpool thereby becomes a producer farm under 
another order with a provision for marketwide equalization.
    (3) No farm which was caused to become nonpool may be made a part of 
a pool unit by a handler set forth in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) 
of this

[[Page 79]]

section until after the passage of a complete April-May-June period 
following the time such farm was caused to become nonpool:
    (i) The handler who caused the farm to become nonpool.
    (ii) The handler or other person who received the milk as nonpool 
milk.
    (iii) A handler who is substantially under the same management 
control, or ownership as the handler or other person set forth in 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (iv) A handler who receives the milk through arrangement with the 
handler or other person set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), or 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (4) A handler may transfer a farm from one pool unit to another of 
his pool units on the first day of any month upon notice to the market 
administrator by not later than the 10th day of such month.
    (5) A farm shall automatically be added to a pool unit or a nonpool 
unit shall automatically become a pool unit effective the first day of 
any month in which any of the skim milk or butterfat in milk of such 
farm or unit is assigned pursuant to Sec. 1002.45 to Class I-A milk 
unless the handler is precluded from doing so pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section or unless such milk is considered 
producer milk under an other order with a provision for marketwide 
equalization. If some but not all skim milk or butterfat in milk 
received from such farms previously a part of a nonpool unit is assigned 
to Class I-A milk the handler operating such unit has until the time of 
filing the report required pursuant to Sec. 1002.30 to specify which 
farms are to be added to a pool unit and if upon verification by audit 
the market admininstrator finds that other skim milk or butterfat in 
milk of a declared nonpool unit is assigned to Class I-A milk, the 
handler operating such unit has until ten days after notification by the 
market administrator to specify which farms are to be added to a pool 
unit. In absence of such specification, all eligible farms shall be 
added to the pool unit.
    (d) A handler may cause a pool unit or a farm which is a part of a 
pool unit to become nonpool by the methods set forth in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (4) of this section: Provided, That the failure of a unit 
to meet the pool requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section 
shall not be considered for purposes of this paragraph to be a change of 
pool status caused by the handler: Provided further, That a handler 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section must continue in a pool 
unit any farm which was a part of such handler's pool unit in any of the 
months of April, May, or June preceding from which he receives milk or 
from which any other handler receives milk through arrangement with him: 
Provided further, That if a unit operated by a handler is reported by 
another handler which is a cooperative, the actions specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (4) of this section must be concurred in by 
such cooperative handler.
    (1) The handler may change the status of a declared pool unit to a 
declared nonpool unit effective the first day of any month upon notice 
to the market administrator by not later than the 10th day of such 
month. If the notice is filed after the 10th day of the month, the 
effective date shall be the first day of the following month.
    (2) The handler may transfer a farm from a pool unit to a nonpool 
unit effective the first day of any month upon notice to the market 
administrator by not later than the 10th day of such month. If the 
notice is filed after the 10th day of the month, the effective date 
shall be the first day of the following month.
    (3) The handler may so operate a unit located in the area specified 
in paragraph (e) of this section that its pool status is cancelled 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.27.
    (4) The handler may arrange for the milk of a farm in his pool unit 
to be delivered to another person as nonpool milk. Any delivery of milk 
by a farm in a handler's pool unit to another person as nonpool milk 
shall be considered to have been arranged by such handler unless such 
handler can establish that such other person is not substantially under 
the same management, control or ownership as such handler and that such 
handler was in no way a party to such nonpool delivery.
    (e) A declared pool unit must be operated to meet the requirements 
set

[[Page 80]]

forth in Sec. 1002.26 if the farms of such unit are located in the 
following area: New York, New Jersey, the counties of Addison, Rutland, 
and Bennington in Vermont, the county of Berkshire in Massachusetts, or 
in Pennsylvania. Failure to meet such requirements shall make such 
declared pool unit subject to suspension and cancellation pursuant to 
the procedure set forth in Sec. 1002.27. This paragraph shall not be 
applicable to a cooperative handler specified in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (f) A declared pool unit made up of farms located outside the area 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section or a declared pool unit made 
up of farms specified in paragraph (e) of this section and operated by a 
cooperative handler specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall 
be a pool unit in the months of July through March if at least 25 
percent of the milk in such unit is delivered in such month to pool 
plants, and shall be a pool unit in the months of April through June 
only if 60 percent of the milk of such unit was received at pool plants 
during the period of October through December immediately preceding or 
if such handler received no milk of such unit or from farms of such unit 
in the preceding October through December.
    (g) Any unit declared to be a pool unit shall be designated a pool 
unit in any month (1) if the handler is qualified in such month pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section, (2) if such unit meets all the 
requirements of this section applicable to it to be a pool unit, or (3) 
if the designation of such unit has not been cancelled pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.27.
    (h) Each handler shall report by not later than the 10th day of the 
month any changes in units during the preceding month and as of the 
first day of such month.
    (i) Whenever the market administrator finds that a handler has 
received bulk tank milk from a farm required to be included in an 
established unit but which has not been so included, he shall 
tentatively assign such farm to a unit and promptly notify the handler 
of such action. Unless otherwise requested by the handler within 10 days 
of such notice, the tentative assignment by the market administrator 
will become final.
    (j) Whenever the market administrator finds that a handler has 
caused milk to become nonpool pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section he shall promptly notify the handler of such finding. Within 10 
days of such notice the handler may, except as to any such milk pooled 
under another order, (1) make a written claim that the failure to 
include the milk involved as pool milk was an error and, in such event, 
the market administrator shall pool such milk and rescind his finding, 
or (2) make a written offer to submit proof that he had not caused such 
milk to become nonpool. In the latter event, the market administrator 
shall examine such proof and shall either rescind his original finding 
or confirm it. Failure to respond to the market administrator's notice 
shall be deemed to confirm the finding.
    (k) Units other than those which are pool units pursuant to 
paragraph (g) of this section shall be designated partial pool units if 
they meet the provisions set forth in paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (1) Any nonpool unit which would have been automatically made a pool 
unit pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section except that the 
handler is precluded from adding farms thereof to a pool unit pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. If a unit of a handler 
becomes a partial pool unit pursuant to this paragraph, all of the 
handler's pool units and partial pool units shall be combined and the 
skim milk and butterfat in milk of the partial pool units assigned to 
Class II and Class III of such combined total prior to any skim milk and 
butterfat in the partial pool unit milk being assigned to Class I-A.
    (2) Any unit the milk of which fails to meet the pooling 
requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, or any unit operated by a 
handler not specified in paragraph (a) of this section, as being 
eligible to establish and maintain pool units, or any unit made up of 
farms located in the 401 miles and over freight zone unless the handlers 
operating such unit is eligible to establish a pool unit and has 
specifically requested such unit to be so designated.

[[Page 81]]

    (l) The market administrator shall publicly announce the names of 
handlers establishing pool units and the names and headquarters of such 
units. He shall also publicly announce any change in the pool status of 
such units, and the names of handlers who are ineligible to add farms to 
a pool unit under the terms set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.

source of milk for the marketing area shall constitute sufficient 
evidence that this requirement is being met even though such approval is 
restricted to prohibit shipment to the marketing area of milk for 
specified periods during which permission is given by such health 
authority for receiving unapproved milk or skim milk at the plant or for 
shipment of approved skim milk from such plant; and
    (c) Have no commitments for disposition of milk that prevent him

Sec. 1002.27  Suspension and cancellation of designation.

    The designation of a pool plant pursuant to Sec. 1002.24 or of a 
declared pool unit consisting of farms in the area specified in 
Sec. 1002.25(e) may be suspended or canceled under any of the following 
provisions:
    (a) The designation shall be canceled effective on the first of the 
month following the filing with the market administrator, and on a form 
prescribed by him, of an application by the handler operating the plant: 
Provided, That a plant whose designation is so canceled on the first of 
any of the months of August through November shall be a pool plant if it 
meets the provisions of paragraph (e) of Sec. 1002.28, and shall not be 
a pool plant pursuant to any other provision of this order prior to 
December 1 following such cancellation: Provided further, That such 
application for cancellation shall be accompanied by proof that the 
handler, if not a cooperative association qualified pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.77 has notified any qualified cooperative association which 
has any members who deliver milk to such plant, and has notified 
individually all producers delivering to such plant who are not members 
of such qualified cooperative association, of his intention to make such 
application: Provided further, That if 50 percent or more of the 
producers delivering milk at such plant deliver such milk for the 
account of a cooperative association which does not operate the plant 
but for which milk such association receives payment, an application 
must be made by such cooperative association as well as by the handler 
operating the plant: Provided further, That if a handler applies for a 
replacement designation pursuant to Sec. 1002.24(b), the designation of 
the plant or plants replaced shall be canceled automatically at the time 
the replacement designation becomes effective.
    (b) The designation of any plant which in any month is not approved 
by a health authority as a source of milk for the marketing area shall 
be automatically suspended at the beginning of the second month 
following the month that the handler receives notice that the plant does 
not have health approval as a source of milk for the marketing area 
unless the absence of

[[Page 82]]

health approval is a temporary condition covering a period of not more 
than 15 days: Provided, That the designation of a plant approved by a 
health authority as a source of milk for the marketing area, even though 
such approval is restricted to prohibit shipment to the marketing area 
of milk for specified periods during which permission is given by such 
health authority for receiving unapproved milk or skim milk at the plant 
or for shipment of approved skim milk from such plant, shall not be 
suspended pursuant to this provision.
    (c) The designation of a plant pursuant to Sec. 1002.24 shall be 
suspended at the beginning of the second month following any consecutive 
12-month period in which the plant failed to receive any pool milk or at 
the beginning of the second month following a month in which there is a 
failure to maintain the facilities and equipment that constitute a plant 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.8(a).
    (d) The designation of any plant or unit shall be suspended, 
effective no sooner than 10 days nor later than 20 days after the date 
of mailing of notice, by registered letter, to the handler, whenever the 
market administrator, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraphs 
(h) and (j) of this section, finds on the basis of available information 
that the handler operating the plant or unit is not meeting the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 1002.26: Provided, That, if the handler 
operating the plant or unit is not a cooperative association qualified 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.77, the market administrator shall notify any 
qualified cooperative association which has any members who deliver milk 
to such plant or unit, and shall also notify individually all producers 
delivering to such plant or unit who are not members of such qualified 
cooperative association, of such suspension of designation.
    (e) In the case of suspension pursuant to this section of the 
designation of one or more plants or units for failure to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 1002.26(a) or (c) the handler operating such plant 
or unit may select, prior to the effective date of such suspension, one 
or more other pool plants or pool units consisting of farms in the area 
specified in Sec. 1002.25(e) for suspension in lieu thereof if, during 
the preceding month, the quantity of pool milk received from producers 
at such substituted plants or units was not less than the quantity of 
pool milk received from producers at the plants or units named for 
suspension. The handler may also select the order in which plant or unit 
designations are to be canceled in the event of a later determination by 
the Secretary canceling the designation of some but not all of the 
plants or units suspended.
    (f) Not later than 10 days after the effective date of suspension of 
designation pursuant to this section, the handler operating the plant or 
unit may apply to the Secretary for a review. If the handler fails to so 
apply for such review, the designation shall be canceled as of the 
effective date of the suspension. If the handler does so apply, the 
Secretary shall, after review, either determine that the requirements 
set forth in Sec. 1002.26 have been met and order the suspension 
revoked, or determine that such requirements have not been met and order 
the designation canceled as of the effective date of the suspension: 
Provided, That, if the Secretary has made no determination within two 
months after the end of the month in which the suspension was made 
effective, but later orders the designation canceled, such cancellation 
shall be effective as of the first of the month following the date of 
such determination.
    (g) Beginning with the effective date of a suspension pursuant to 
this section, and until the Secretary has either ordered the designation 
canceled or ordered the suspension revoked, the plant or unit shall be 
treated as a pool plant or pool unit: Provided, That all payments into 
or out of the producer settlement fund (except such payments on the 
basis of operations during a month in which the plant meets the 
requirements of Sec. 1002.28 or the unit meets the requirements of 
Sec. 1002.25(g)) shall be held in reserve by the market administrator 
until an order is issued by the Secretary, but not longer than 2 months 
after the end of the month in which the suspension was made effective.
    (h) No pool plant or pool unit designation shall be suspended for 
failure

[[Page 83]]

to meet the requirements of Sec. 1002.26(a) except under the following 
conditions or pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section:
    (1) A meeting has been held no sooner than three days after notice 
by the market administrator to all handlers operating pool plants 
designated pursuant to Sec. 1002.24 or pool units consisting of farms in 
the area specified in Sec. 1002.25(e) for consideration of the desirable 
utilization of milk received from producers during a period ending not 
later than the end of the second month after the month during which such 
meeting is held.
    (2) There has been issued by the market administrator, following 
such meeting, and mailed to all handlers operating pool plants 
designated pursuant to Sec. 1002.24 or pool units consisting of farms in 
the area specified in Sec. 1002.25(e) the market administrator's 
determination of the desirable utilization of milk received from 
producers each month during all or a part of the period set forth in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Such determination shall include a 
schedule setting forth, by months, the desired minimum percentage of 
pool milk received from producers to be utilized in specified classes. 
Such specified classes shall include Class I-A in the marketing area, 
and may include all or a part of other Class I-A and Class I-B.
    (3) The market administrator finds on the basis of available 
information that the handler operating a plant or unit or the 
cooperative reporting a plant or unit is not utilizing milk received 
from producers in accordance with the minimum percentage set forth in 
the determination of the market administrator previously announced 
pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section: Provided, That the 
suspension of the designation of a plant or unit may be made effective 
during the months of November and December if the market administrator 
finds that the handler is utilizing any milk received from producers in 
classes other than those set forth in the determination of the market 
administrator announced pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (i) The cancellation of pool plant or pool unit designation for 
failure to meet the requirements of Sec. 1002.26(a) shall be subject to 
the following conditions:
    (1) No pool plant or pool unit designation shall be canceled if the 
handler operating the plant or unit utilized the milk received by the 
handler from producers during the month in which the suspension is made 
effective in accordance with the minimum percentage set forth in the 
determination of the market administrator announced pursuant to 
paragraph (h)(2) or paragraph (l) of this section.
    (2) No pool plant or pool unit designation shall be canceled if the 
handler operating the plant or unit utilized in the specified classes 
set forth in the determination of the market administrator announced 
pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section a percentage of the total 
milk received by such handler from producers during the month in which 
the suspension is made effective which is not less than the percentage 
of the total pool milk reported by all handlers for such month to have 
been used in the specified classes.
    (3) In the event that all milk received from producers at a plant or 
unit is reported to the market administrator by a cooperative 
association qualified pursuant to Sec. 1002.77 and such association pays 
the producer for such milk, the pool plant or pool unit designation 
shall not be canceled if a percentage of all milk reported by such 
cooperative association is utilized in accordance with the minimum 
percentage set forth in the determination of the market administrator 
announced pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section, or in accordance 
with the percentage set forth in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (4) Cancellation of designations shall be limited to those plants or 
units necessary to result in a utilization of milk received at the 
remaining pool plants and pool units operated by the handler, or 
reported by the cooperative, as the case may be, in accordance with the 
minimum percentage set forth in paragraph (l) of this section, or in the 
determination of the market administrator announced pursuant to 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (j) Loss of approval by health authorities of a plant as a source of 
milk for the marketing area may in itself constitute adequate reason for 
the

[[Page 84]]

market administrator to suspend the designation of the plant for failure 
to meet the requirements of Sec. 1002.26(b) only if the absence of such 
approval continues for more than 15 days.
    (k) The designation shall be canceled effective on the first of the

Sec. 1002.44  Transfers.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in 
the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a 
pool plant or a pool unit to another pool plant shall be classified as 
Class I-A milk unless the operators of both plants request the same 
classification in another class. In either case, the classification of 
such transfers shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.45(a)(17) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1002.45(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1002.45(a)(8) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1002.45(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1002.45(a) (13) or (15) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1002.45(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk,

[[Page 90]]

shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would 
be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers to other order plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream 
product from a pool plant to an other order plant shall be classified in 
the following manner:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes (either Class I-A, II or III) to which allocated 
as a fluid milk product under the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both the transferor and the transferee 
plants so request in the reports of receipts and utilization filed with 
their respective market administrators, transfers in bulk form shall be 
classified as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such 
utilization available for such classification pursuant to the allocation 
provisions of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers 
were allocated under the other order is not available to the market 
administrator for the purpose of establishing classification under this 
paragraph, classification shall be as Class I-A, subject to adjustment 
at a later date;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class 1-A milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1002.41.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat in the 
following forms that is transferred from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I-A milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant or a pool unit to a 
nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-handler 
plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I-A milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged 
fluid milk product; and
    (2) As Class I-A milk, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid 
milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the following 
conditions apply:
    (i) The transferring handler claims classification pursuant to the 
assignment set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section in the 
handler's report submitted to the market administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred;
    (ii) The operator of such transferee plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for the purpose of verification;
    (iii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes of 
this section, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a second nonpool plant shall be 
classified pursuant to the same assignment procedure with respect to 
receipts and utilization at such second nonpool plant, except that 
classification of such transfers in Class I-A and I-B shall not be less 
than the quantities which would be assigned to those classes if the 
transfer of such products had been directly from a pool plant or pool 
unit.

[[Page 91]]

the basis of the following assignment of utilization at the transferee 
plant pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section:
    (i) Packaged receipts of fluid milk products from Federal order 
sources shall first be assigned to route disposition in Federal order 
marketing areas (assigning receipts to sales in the same market to the 
extent possible) and any residual shall be assigned to Class 1-B route 
sales.
    (ii) Such bulk transfers and other bulk receipts of fluid milk 
products at such transferee plant from pool plants and units and from 
other order plants shall next be assigned to any remaining route 
disposition in any Federal order marketing area. For this purpose 
receipts from each Federal order market shall first be assigned to 
remaining route sales in such marketing area and any remainder of such 
receipts shall be prorated with all Federal order receipts to remaining 
route disposition in all Federal order marketing areas.
    (iii) Receipts from dairy farmers shall then be assigned to any 
remaining route sales in the marketing area.
    (iv) Remaining receipts from dairy farmers and other unregulated 
other source receipts (excluding opening inventory) in the form of fluid 
milk products shall be assigned pro rata to Class I-B, Class II and 
Class III utilization at such plant to the extent of such utilization 
available at such plant and any remainder of such receipts shall be 
assigned pro rata to Class I-A bulk sales to plants regulated under this 
order and Class I bulk sales to plants regulated under other orders.
    (v) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products from plants defined 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.8 (b) and (d) shall be assigned pro rata among 
such plants to any remaining Class II and Class III utilization on a pro 
rata basis, then to any remaining Class I-A disposition and finally any 
Class I-B disposition.
    (vi) Any remaining receipts of fluid milk products or bulk fluid 
cream products being assigned pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
assigned pro rata with remaining receipts from other order plants, first 
to remaining Class I-A utilization, then to Class I-B utilization, then 
to Class II utilization, and finally to Class III utilization at such 
plant: Provided, That if on inspection of the books and records of such 
plant the market administrator finds that there is insufficient 
utilization to cover such receipts, the remainder shall be classified as 
Class I-A.
    (vii) Any remaining Class I-A route disposition in any Federal 
marketing area shall be subject to the pricing specified in 
Sec. 1002.60(d)(2).

Sec. 1002.45  Allocation of skim milk and butterfat classified.

    The classification of milk received from producers at each pool 
plant or pool unit for each handler shall be determined each month 
pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section: Provided, That 
for the purpose of establishing the pool status of any plant with Class 
I-A route disposition in the marketing area which is not a pool plant 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.24, skim milk and butterfat in milk received at 
such plant directly from dairy farmers or units up to an amount 
sufficient to qualify such plant as a pool plant pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.28 (a) or (b) shall be considered the source of such Class I-A 
route disposition of such plant and be subtracted from Class I-A prior 
to the application of the allocation sequence set forth in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section, unless at the time of filing the handler's 
report pursuant to Sec. 1002.30 the handler elects not to have it so 
allocated.
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk classified as Class III pursuant to Sec. 1002.42(b);
    (2) Subtract the pounds of skim milk received in packaged form from 
a producer-handler for marketing as certified fluid milk products from 
the total pounds of skim milk in Class I-A and Class 1-B milk, 
respectively, in accordance with its proportionate disposition in such 
classes;
    (3) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III, 2 
percent of the pounds of skim milk in packaged fluid milk products 
received

[[Page 92]]

from other order plants, and subtract the balance from Class I-A;
    (4) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class 1-A the 
pounds of skim milk in packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the 
beginning of the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool 
plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(4) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (5) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1002.41(c)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1002.41(c)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(6) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (7) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1002.41(c) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1002.41(d)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class I-A, Class II and Class III milk, in series 
beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(6) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1002.41(c)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(5), (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products not approved by a duly 
constituted health authority which are excepted from the pool milk 
definition pursuant to Sec. 1002.14(b);
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler 
pursuant to an other order or a producer-handler defined pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.12 (except pool milk designated in the preamble of 
Sec. 1002.14).
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a handler's plant at which 
milk is excepted from the pool milk definition pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.14(h).
    (v) Receipts of fluid milk products from a handler with own farm 
milk, which milk is excepted from the pool milk definition pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.14(i).
    (9) Subtract in series beginning with Class III from the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III milk the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts of other source milk in the form of fluid milk products 
from plants other than those defined in Sec. 1002.8 (b) or (d) and units 
other than pool units for which the handler requests a Class II or Class 
III classification, but not in any case to exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class;
    (10) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II or 
Class III milk the pounds of skim milk in bulk receipts of fluid milk 
products from other order plants not previously assigned and for which a 
Class II or Class III classification is requested by both the transferor 
and transferee handler in filing reports of receipts and utilization for 
the month with their respective market administrators, but not in any 
case to exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class;
    (11) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1002.41(c)(1), in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(4), (6) and (8)(i) of this section;

[[Page 93]]

    (12) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
    (13)(i) Subtract pro rata from the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I-B, Class II and Class III milk the remaining pounds of skim milk 
in receipts of other source milk in the form of fluid milk products from 
plants not defined pursuant to Sec. 1002.8 (b) or (d) and from units 
other than pool units: Provided, That if the pounds of skim milk to be 
assigned pursuant to this paragraph (a)(13)(i) exceed the available 
pounds of skim milk in Class I-B, Class II, and Class III the handler 
shall designate the priority of sources to be assigned to such classes;
    (ii) No assignment shall be made pursuant to this paragraph with 
respect to milk received from a plant not defined pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.8 (b) or (d) in the 401 miles and over freight zone at a plant 
from which 50 percent or more of the gross receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat leaves the plant in the form of fluid milk products in 
consumer packages or dispenser inserts and is classified as Class I-A;
    (14) Subtract pro rata from the remaining pounds of skim milk in 
each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts from dairy farmers and 
from the handler's own farm which are excepted from the pool milk 
definition pursuant to Sec. 1002.14 (h) and (i);
    (15) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of 
fluid milk products from other order plants not previously assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) (3) and (10) of this section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, such subtraction 
shall be pro rata to the pounds of skim milk in each class with respect 
to whichever of the following quantities represents the higher 
proportion of Class II and Class III milk combined:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1002.22(d); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(15)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I-A 
milk and Class I-B milk after such proration at the pool plants at which 
such other source milk was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(15)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(15) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I-A milk and Class I-B milk combined shall be decreased by a like 
amount, pro rata to remaining utilization in each such class. In such 
case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation 
step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(15)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(15) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I-A milk or Class I-B milk that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in that class, the pounds of skim milk in such class shall be 
increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be 
decreased by a like amount (decreasing

[[Page 94]]

as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount in sequence beginning with the nearest other pool plant 
of such handler at which Class I-A or Class I-B utilization is 
available;
    (16) If the plant at which assignment is being made is a plant from 
which 50 percent or more of the gross receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat in the form of fluid milk products left the plant in the form 
of fluid milk products in consumer packages or dispenser inserts and was 
classified as Class I-A, subtract pro rata from the remaining pounds of 
skim milk in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid 
milk products from plants in the 401 miles and over freight zone, not 
defined pursuant to Sec. 1002.8 (b) or (d);
    (17) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I-A 
milk the pounds of skim milk in remaining receipts from plants (except 
other order plants) or units the pool status of which has not yet been 
established and which receipts have not previously been assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) (13) and (16) of this section;
    (18) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in each class 
the pounds of skim milk received in the form of fluid milk products and 
bulk fluid cream products from other pool plants and from pool units 
(not previously assigned pursuant to the preamble of this section), in 
accordance with the classification assigned by the transferee handler 
subject to the conditions of paragraph (a)(18) (i) through (iii) of this 
section:
    (i) The skim milk so assigned to any class of utilization shall be 
limited to the amount thereof remaining in such class in the transferee 
plant;
    (ii) If the transferor plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of this section the 
skim milk so transferred shall be classified so as to allocate the least 
possible Class I-A or I-B utilization to such other source milk; and
    (iii) If the transferor handler received during the month other 
source milk to be allocated pursuant to paragraph (a)(13) of this 
section, the skim milk so transferred shall not be classified as Class 
I-A or I-B to a greater extent than would be applicable to a like 
quantity of such other source milk received at the transferee plant;
    (19) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I-A the 
pounds of skim milk received directly from dairy farmers or units which 
was deducted pursuant to the proviso in the preamble of this section;
    (20) If the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes exceeds the 
pounds of skim milk in receipts from producers subtract such excess from 
the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) Combine the amounts of skim milk and butterfat determined 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section into one total for 
each class.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1002.81 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:

    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.

[[Page 97]]

    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent reporting period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.

of New Jersey shall be in the 1- to 10-mile zone. The market 
administrator shall publicly announce the freight zones for pool plants.
    (b) The market administrator shall determine and publicly announce a 
freight zone for each minor civil division (township, borough, 
incorporated village, or city) within which farms included in a pool or 
partial pool unit are located by computing the shortest highway mileage 
distance from the nearest point in the minor civil division to the 
nearest point specified in paragraph (a) of this section, using the 
mileage guide specified in such paragraph supplemented by U.S. 
Geological Survey maps. In States where the smallest governmental unit 
except for incorporated cities or villages is the county, a zone for the 
county shall be determined in the same manner as for minor civil 
divisions. The zone for each farm shall be the zone of the minor civil 
division or county in which the farm is located.
    (c) The differential rates applicable at plants shall be as set 
forth in the following schedule:

    (d) The differential rate applicable to each pool unit or partial 
pool unit shall be computed each month as follows: Multiply the volume 
of pool milk received from farms in each zone by the rate for that zone 
as set forth in the schedule in paragraph (c) of this section, add the 
resulting values for all zones of the unit, divide such sum by the total 
volume of milk received by the unit and round to the nearest 0.1 cent. 
Rates shall be computed separately for Columns B and C of such schedule.
    (e) In the event that a plant in the 401 miles and over freight zone 
becomes a pool plant, a 10-mile zone shall be determined for such plant 
and for each farm in any pool unit delivering to such plant. The Column 
B differentials in paragraph (c) of this section shall be extended at 
the same rate as provided in such column for such plant or unit: 
Provided, That in no case shall such differential cause the class price 
or the uniform price for such plant or unit to be less than the Class 
III price for such plant or unit: Provided further, That farms or units 
delivering to such plant shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the 
plant.

Sec. 1002.60  Net pool obligation of handlers.

    Each handler's net pool obligation for milk received at each plant 
and unit shall be computed separately pursuant to paragraphs (a) through 
(d) of this section and then combined into one total to be adjusted by 
any credit applicable pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section to 
determine the handler's total net pool obligation.
    (a) Multiply the quantity of milk in each class remaining after the 
computation pursuant to Sec. 1002.45(a)(20) and the corresponding step 
of Sec. 1002.45(b) by the applicable class price adjusted by the 
applicable differential pursuant to Sec. 1002.52:
    (b) For each partial pool plant or partial pool unit multiply the 
quantity of pool milk in each class by the applicable class price 
adjusted by the applicable differential pursuant to Sec. 1002.52;
    (c) Deduct, in the case of each plant or unit nearer than the 201-
to-210-mile zone and add, in the case of each plant or unit farther than 
the 201-to-210-mile zone, the sum obtained by multiplying the quantity 
of pool milk received from dairy farmers by the differential in Column B 
of Sec. 1002.52(c) applicable at the plant and weighted average Column B 
differential computed pursuant to Sec. 1002.52(d) applicable to the 
unit.
    (d) Add the amounts computed in paragraph (d) (1) through (4) of 
this section:
    (1) Multiply the pounds of overage deducted from each class pursuant 
to Sec. 1002.45(a)(20) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1002.45(b) by 
the applicable class price adjusted by the differentials pursuant to 
Secs. 1002.52 and 1002.81;
    (2) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of 
nonfluid milk products subtracted from Class I-A pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.45(a)(8)(i) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1002.45(b) and 
the pounds of skim milk and butterfat specified in 
Sec. 1002.44(d)(3)(vii) by the difference between the Class I-A and 
Class III prices, each adjusted by the applicable differential pursuant 
to Sec. 1002.52;
    (3) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of 
nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1002.40(c) 
by the difference between the Class I price less $1.00 (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price, both adjusted by 
the applicable differential pursuant to Sec. 1002.52. Alternatively, the 
handler may, with respect to such receipts of nonfluid milk products 
processed from producer milk regulated under another Federal order, 
elect to make payment to the producer-settlement fund of the other order 
at the difference between the Class I price applicable under the other 
order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk products were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
products is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment may 
only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk products. This 
payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid milk 
products used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be determined 
by the market administrator;
    (4) Multiply the quantity of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of 
concentrated fluid milk products from plants other than those defined in 
Sec. 1002.8(b) or (d) or as a producer-handler and which are assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1002.40(c) or which are subtracted from Class 
I-A pursuant to Sec. 1002.45(a)(8)(i) and the corresponding

[[Page 100]]

step of Sec. 1002.45(b) by the Class I price, adjusted by the applicable 
differential pursuant to Sec. 1002.52.
    (5) Multiply the producer-handler price differential by the pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I-A pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.45(a)(8)(iii) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1002.45(b);
    (6) Multiply the difference between the Class III price for the 
preceding month and the Class I-A price or the Class II price, as the 
case may be, for the current month, both applicable at the location of 
the nearest plant or unit from which an equivalent quantity of Class III 
milk was received in the preceding month, by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat subtracted from Class I-A and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.45(a)(11) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1002.45(b).
    (e) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.
    (f) Deduct any credit applicable pursuant to Sec. 1002.55.

Sec. 1002.61  Computation of the uniform price.

    The market administrator shall, on or before the 14th day of each 
month, audit for mathematical correctness and obvious errors the report 
submitted for the preceding month by each handler. If the unreserved 
cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the 
computation is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of pool milk on all 
reports, the report of any handler who has not made payment of the last 
monthly pool debit account rendered pursuant to Sec. 1002.71 shall not 
be included in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such 
handler shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months 
until he has made full payment of outstanding monthly pool debits. 
Subject to the aforementioned conditions, the market administrator shall 
compute the uniform price in the following manner:
    (a) Combine into one total the net pool obligations of all handlers 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1002.60;
    (b) Subtract the total of payments required to be made pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.77;
    (c) Subtract an amount computed by multiplying the quantity of pool 
milk delivered directly from farms to pool plants and partial pool 
plants that was not put into a tank truck prior to such delivery, by a 
rate per hundredweight that is equal to the rate specified in 
Sec. 1002.55;
    (d)-(e) [Reserved]
    (f) Add the amount of unreserved cash in the producer settlement 
fund;
    (g) Subtract an amount equal to not less than 8 cents nor more than 
9 cents per hundredweight of pool milk and receipts of concentrated 
fluid milk products for which a payment obligation is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1002.60(d)(4) to provide against the contingency of errors in 
reports and payments or of delinquencies in payments by handlers; and
    (h) Divide the result obtained in paragraph (g) of this section by 
the total pounds of pool milk delivered by dairy farmers and the total 
pounds of concentrated fluid milk products for which a payment 
obligation is computed pursuant to Sec. 1002.60(d)(4). The result shall 
be known as the uniform price.

received payments from the producer settlement fund. After computing the 
uniform price and each handler's pool debit or credit each month, and at 
such times as he deems appropriate, the market administrator shall 
render each handler a statement of his account showing the debit or 
credit balance, together with all debits or credits entered on such 
handler's account since the previous statement was rendered: Provided, 
That the handler operating a pool plant receiving milk from a partial 
pool plant or partial pool unit without producers as defined in 
Sec. 1002.6, or from a partial pool plant in the 401 miles or over 
freight zone, shall be responsible for the debit or credit arising on 
milk so received and for the payment of the administration assessment 
pursuant to Sec. 1002.85 on such milk.

such handler shown on the last statement of account rendered pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.71. Payments to the market administrator shall be deemed not 
to have been made until such payments have been received by the market

shall make payment to each handler of the credit balance, if any, of 
such handler shown on the last statement of account rendered pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.71. If the date by which such payments are to be made falls on 
Saturday or Sunday or a national holiday, such payments need not be made 
until the next day that the market administrator's office is open for 
public business. If payments to the producer-settlement fund under 
Sec. 1002.72 were delayed because the due date fell on a Saturday or 
Sunday or a national holiday, payments under this paragraph may be 
delayed by the same number of days.
    (b) If the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient 
to make full payment required under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
market administrator shall reduce uniformly the payments to each handler 
and shall complete such payments as soon as the necessary funds are 
available. No handler who, on the 20th day of the month, has not 
received such payments in full from the market administrator shall be 
deemed to be in violation of Secs. 1002.80 through 1002.82 if he reduces 
his total

Sec. 1002.74  Handler's pool debit or credit.

    After computing the uniform price for each month, the market 
administrator shall compute each handler's pool debit or credit as 
follows:
    (a) Add the contents computed as follows:
    (1) Multiply the quantity of pool milk received by each handler from 
dairy farmers by the uniform price;
    (2) Multiply the quantity of pool milk received by the handler at a 
pool plant or partial pool plant directly from farms that was not put 
into a tank truck prior to delivery by a rate per hundredweight that is 
equal to the rate specified in Sec. 1002.55;
    (3) Multiply the quantity of concentrated fluid milk products for 
which a payment obligation is computed pursuant to Sec. 1002.60(d)(4) by 
the uniform price.
    (b) If the result obtained in paragraph (a) of this section is less 
than the handler's net pool obligation, the difference shall be entered 
on the handler's producer settlement fund account as such handler's pool 
debit.
    (c) If the result obtained in paragraph (a) of this section is 
greater than the handler's net pool obligation, the difference shall be 
entered on the handler's producer settlement fund account as such 
handler's pool credit.

marketed by its member producers: Provided, That such processing 
facilities must be capable of handling not less than 1 million pounds of 
milk daily: Provided further, That the cooperative must be willing to 
accept nonmember milk on a temporary basis under the generally 
prevailing conditions for acceptance of milk from its own members.

prevailing conditions for such acceptance of milk from its own members.
    (3) The applicant cooperative or federation demonstrates that it has 
the ability to perform the marketwide services for which application is 
made, and that such services will be performed.
    (4) The applicant cooperative or the federated cooperatives of an 
applicant federation are in no way precluded from arranging for the 
utilization of milk under their respective control so as to yield the 
highest available net return to all producers without displacing an 
equivalent quantity of other producer milk in the preferred 
classification.
    (c) Notice of designation or denial; effective date. Upon 
determination by the market administrator that a cooperative or a 
federation shall be designated to receive payment for performance of the 
marketwide services, he shall transmit such determination to the

specifically set forth in such notice his reasons for denial of the 
application.
    (d) Requirements for continued designation. From time to time and in 
accordance with the rules and regulations which may be issued by the

perform the marketwide services enumerated in this paragraph. Such 
services shall include:

order, including the preparation and presentation of evidence at public 
hearings, the submission of appropriate briefs and exceptions, and also 
participating, by voting or otherwise, in the referenda relative to 
amendments;
    (4) participating in the meetings called by the market 
administrator, such as meetings with respect to rules and regulations 
issued under the order, including activities such as the preparation and

order and, as a part of such program, issuing publications that contain 
relevant data and information about the order and its operation, and the 
distribution of such publications to members and, on the same 
subscription basis, to nonmembers who request it, and holding meetings 
at which members and nonmembers may attend;
    (6) in the case of a cooperative or federation which receives an 
additional payment under paragraph (f)(3) or (4) of this section, 
operating marketing facilities, or having affiliated cooperatives or 
federated cooperatives that operate marketing facilities, i.e., pool 
plant(s) and pool bulk tank unit(s), at which is received at least 25 
percentum, by weight, of milk marketed by its member producers; and in 
addition, controls, or having affiliated cooperatives or federated 
cooperatives that control processing facilities capable of handling at 
least 10 percentum, by weight, of the milk marketed by its member 
producers: Provided, That such processing facilities must be capable of 
handling at least one million pounds of milk daily: Provided further, 
That the cooperative or federation must be willing to accept nonmember 
milk on a temporary basis under the generally prevailing conditions for 
such acceptance of milk of its own members; and
    (7) performing such other services as are needed to maintain 
satisfactory marketing conditions and promote market stability.
    (f) Rate, computation, time, and method of payment. (1) Subject to 
the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, the market 
administrator, on or before the 20th day of each month, shall make 
payment out of the producer-settlement fund, or issue equivalent credit 
therefore, to each cooperative or federation which is designated for 
such payments for marketwide services. The payments to a cooperative or 
federation shall be based upon the milk reported by cooperative or 
proprietary handlers to have been received during the preceding month 
from its member producers, subject to adjustment upon verification by 
the market administrator.
    (2) Such payment or credit shall be at the rate of 3 cents per 
hundredweight of milk in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Any cooperative that operates marketing facilities or whose 
affiliated cooperatives operate marketing facilities, i.e., pool 
plant(s) and pool bulk tank unit(s), at which is received at least 25 
percentum, by weight, of the milk marketed by its member producers, and, 
in addition, controls, or has affiliated cooperatives that control, 
processing facilities capable of handling, at least 10 percentum, by 
weight, of the milk marketed by its member producers but not less than 
one million pounds of milk daily shall receive a payment in addition to 
that provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section of one cent per 
hundredweight of all milk marketed by member producers in accordance 
with paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (4) Any federation that operates marketing facilities, or whose 
federated cooperatives operate marketing facilities, i.e., pool plant(s) 
and pool bulk tank unit(s), at which is received at least 25 percentum, 
by weight, of the milk marketed by its member producers, and, in 
addition, controls, or whose federated cooperatives control, processing 
facilities capable of handling at least 10 percentum of the milk 
marketed by its member producers but not less than 1 million pounds 
daily, shall receive a payment, in addition to the payment provided for 
in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, of 1 cent per hundredweight of all 
milk marketed by member producers in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section.
    (5) If an individually designated cooperative is affiliated with a 
federation, the cooperative payment shall be made to such cooperative 
unless its contract with the federation specified in writing that the 
federation is to receive the payments. Any such contract must authorize 
the federation to receive the payments for at least 1 year, and such 
agreement must cover or be renewed

[[Page 106]]

for a yearly period for every subsequent year for which the federation 
is to receive the payments.
    (g) Cancellation of designation. (1) The market administrator shall 
issue an order wholly or partly canceling the designation of a 
previously designated cooperative or federation for payments authorized 
pursuant to this section and such payments shall not thereafter be made 
to it if he determines that:
    (i) The cooperative or federation no longer complies with the 
requirements of this part: Provided, That if one of its affiliated or 
federated cooperatives has failed to comply with the requirements of 
this part applicable to it or has failed, promptly after demand by the 
market administrator, to arrange for the utilization of milk under its 
control so as to yield the highest available net return to all producers 
without displacing an equivalent quantity of other producer milk in the 
preferred classification, the cooperative or federation shall be 
disqualified only to the extent that its qualification for payments or 
the amount of its payment are based upon the membership, milk, or 
operations of such noncomplying affiliated or federated cooperatives.
    (ii) The cooperative or federation has failed to make reports or 
furnish records pursuant to this section or pursuant to rules and 
regulations issued by the market administrator; or
    (iii) In the case of the cooperative, it has failed, promptly after 
demand by the market administrator, to arrange for the utilization of 
milk under its control so as to yield the highest available net return 
to all producers without displacing an equivalent quantity of other 
producer milk in the preferred classification.
    (2) An order of the market administrator wholly or partly canceling 
the designation of a cooperative or federation shall not be issued until 
after the cooperative or federation has had opportunity for hearing 
thereon following not less than 15 days' notice to it specifying the 
reasons for the proposed cancellation. If the cooperative or federation 
fails to file a written request for hearing with the market 
administrator within such period of 15 days, the market administrator 
may issue an order of cancellation without further notice: But if within 
such period a request for hearing is filed, the market administrator 
shall promptly proceed to hold such hearing pursuant to rules and 
regulations issued by him under paragraph (i) of this section.
    (3) A cancellation order issued by the market administrator shall 
set forth the findings and conclusions on the basis of which it is 
issued.
    (h) Appeals--(1) From denials of application. Any cooperative or 
federation whose application for designation has been denied by the 
market administrator may, within 30 days after notice of such denial, 
file with the Secretary a written petition for review. But the failure 
to file such petition shall not bar the cooperative or federation from 
again applying to the market administrator for designation.
    (2) From cancellation orders. A cancellation order by the market 
administrator shall become final 30 days after its service on the 
cooperative or federation unless within such 30-day period the 
cooperative or federation files a written petition with the Secretary 
for review thereof. If such petition for review is filed, payments for 
which the cooperative or federation has been canceled by the order shall 
be held in reserve by the market administrator pending ruling of the 
Secretary, after which the sums so held in reserve shall either be 
returned to the producer-settlement fund or paid over to the cooperative 
or federation depending on the Secretary's ruling on the petition. If 
such petition for review is not filed, any payments which otherwise 
would be made within the 30-day period following issuance of the 
cancellation order shall be held in reserve until such order becomes 
final and shall then be returned to the producer-settlement fund.
    (3) Record on appeal. If an appeal is taken under paragraph (h) (1) 
or (2) of this section, the market administrator shall promptly certify 
to the Secretary the ruling or order appealed from and the evidence upon 
which it was issued: Provided, That if a hearing was held the complete 
record thereof, including the applications, petitions, and all exhibits 
or other documentary material submitted in evidence shall be the record 
so certified. Such certified material shall

[[Page 107]]

constitute the sole record upon which the appeal shall be decided by the 
Secretary.
    (i) Regulations. The market administrator is authorized to issue 
regulations and amendments thereto to effectuate the provisions of this 
section and to facilitate and implement the administration of its 
provisions. Such regulations shall be issued in accordance with the 
following procedure:
    (1) All proposed rules and regulations and amendments thereto shall 
be the subject of a meeting called by the market administrator, at which 
all interested persons shall have opportunity to be heard. Not less than 
5 days prior to the meeting, notice thereof and of the proposed 
regulations or amendments shall be mailed to qualified cooperatives and 
federations. A stenographic record shall be made at such meetings which 
shall be public information and be available for inspection at the 
office of the market administrator.
    (2) A period of at least 5 days after the meeting shall be allowed 
for the filing of briefs.
    (3) All regulations and amendments thereto issued by the market 
administrator pursuant to this section must be submitted in tentative 
form to the Secretary for approval, shall not be effective without such 
approval. The regulations or amendments in tentative form shall be 
forwarded also to cooperatives and federations designated under this 
section and to other persons upon request in writing. The Secretary 
shall either approve the regulations or amendments thereto submitted by 
the market administrator or direct the market administrator to 
reconsider the tentative rules or amendments. In the event the market 
administrator is directed to give reconsideration to the matter, the 
market administrator shall either issue revised tentative regulations or 
amendments or call another meeting pursuant to this section for 
additional consideration of the rules or amendments.
    (j) Reports and records. Each designated cooperative or federation 
shall, in accordance with rules and regulations issued by the market 
administrator:
    (1) After submission to the market administrator for verification, 
make a public report of its performance of marketwide services pursuant 
to this section, including data on its receipts and expenditure of 
cooperative payments funds and a description of the marketwide services 
performed. The report shall contain a certification by the market 
administrator that the report is, to the best of his knowledge, accurate 
and in accordance with the rules and regulations which he has 
established.
    (2) Submit an annual report to the market administrator which shall 
include:
    (i) A concise report of its performance of marketwide services and 
allocations of expenditures to such performance for the previous year; 
and
    (ii) An outline of its proposed program and budget for performance 
of marketwide services for the coming year.
    (3) Make such additional reports to the market administrator as may 
be requested by him for the administration of the provisions of this 
section.
    (4) Maintain and make available to the market administrator or his 
representative such records as will enable the market administrator to 
verify such reports.
    (k) Notices, demands, orders, etc. All notices, demands, orders, or 
other papers required by this section to be given to or served upon a 
cooperative or federation shall be deemed to have been given or served 
as of the time when mailed to the last known secretary of the 
cooperative or federation at his last known address.

                Payment by Handlers Directly to Producers


<R05>
Sec. 1002.80  Time and rate of payments.

    (a) On or before the last day of the month, each handler shall make 
payment to each producer for milk received from such producer during the 
first 15 days of the month at not less than the lowest class price for 
the preceding month.

[[Page 108]]

    (b) On or before the 20th day of the month, each handler shall make 
payment, pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this 
section, to each producer for the balance due for all milk received from 
such producer during the preceding month at not less than the uniform 
price for such month, subject to the following adjustments:
    (1) Appropriate differentials set forth in Secs. 1002.81 and 
1002.82;
    (2) Proper deductions for the month that were authorized in writing 
by producers from whom the handler received milk (except as specified in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section);
    (3) For milk received in a bulk tank unit and for which 
transportation was provided by the handler or at his expense, there may 
be deducted, as proper and as authorized in writing by the producer, or 
by a cooperative association authorized to act on behalf of such 
producer, a tank truck service (transportation) charge. This charge may 
include any farm-to-first plant transportation costs for which the 
handler was not reimbursed through the transportation credit pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.55, but such charge shall be reduced by the amount that the 
class use location value of milk at the plant of first receipt exceeds 
its class use location value where the milk was accounted for as a 
receipt in the bulk tank unit from which the milk was transferred. Any 
such deduction, plus the transportation credit, and plus the amount of 
the increase in class use location value of the milk at the plant 
compared to the unit shall not exceed the actual transportation costs 
incurred. Any such deduction also must be made by the handler not later 
than the date on which the producer is required to be paid for such 
milk. If authorization for such deduction is cancelled by the producer 
or by the cooperative by notifying the handler in writing, such 
cancellation shall be effective on the first day of the month following 
its receipt by the handler; and
    (4) For pool milk delivered directly from a farm to a pool plant or 
a partial pool plant that was not put into a tank truck prior to such 
delivery, the handler shall pay to the producer an additional amount 
computed by multiplying the quantity of such milk by a rate per 
hundredweight that is equal to the rate specified in Sec. 1002.55.
    (c) Upon receipt of a written request from a cooperative association 
which the market administrator determines is authorized by its producer-
members to collect payment for their milk, each handler, on or before 2 
days before payments are due to individual producers if paid by check, 
or the same day such payments are due to individual producers if paid in 
cash or cash equivalent, shall pay the cooperative association for milk 
received during the month from the producer-members of such association 
an amount equal to not less than the total amount otherwise due such 
producer-members as determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.
    (d) Each handler which is also a cooperative marketing association, 
determined by the Secretary to be qualified under the Capper-Volstead 
Act with respect to producers who are members of and under contract with 
such association, may make distribution in accordance with the contract 
between the association and such members of the net proceeds of all its 
sales in all markets in all use classifications.
    (e) Whenever verification by the market administrator of the payment 
to any producer or cooperative association of producers for milk 
delivered to any handler discloses payment of less than is required by 
this part, the handler shall make up such payment to the producer or 
cooperative association of producers not later than the time of making 
payment next following such disclosure.
    (f) If a handler claims that he cannot make the required payment 
because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the 
cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer 
in existence, such payment shall be made to the producer settlement 
fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays 
the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no 
longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market 
administrator shall make such payment from the producer settlement fund 
to the handler or to the lawful claimant as the case may be.

[[Page 109]]

    (g) If not later than the date when such payment is required to be 
made, legal proceedings have been instituted by the handler for the 
purpose of administrative or judicial review of the market 
administrator's findings upon verification as provided above such 
payment shall be made to the producer settlement fund and shall be held 
in reserve until such time as the above-mentioned proceedings have been 
completed or until the handler submits proof to the market administrator 
that the required payment has been made to the producer or association 
of producers in which latter event the payment shall be refunded to the 
handler.

Sec. 1002.81  Butterfat differential.

    The butterfat differential for the adjustment of prices as specified 
in this part shall be plus or minus for each one-tenth of one percent of 
butterfat above or below 3.5 percent by an amount computed as follows: 
Round to the nearest one-tenth cent, 0.138 times the current month's 
butter price less 0.0028 times the preceding month's average pay price 
per hundredweight, at test, for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota 
and Wisconsin, using the ``base month'' series, adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.51 (a) through (e), as reported by the Department. The butter

    The transportation differential shall be plus or minus the 
appropriate differential shown in column B of the schedule in

                        Expense of Administration


<R05>
Sec. 1002.85  Payment by handlers.

    To share on a pro rata basis the expense of administration of this 
part, each handler shall, on or before the date specified for making 
payment to the producer-settlement fund pursuant to Sec. 1002.72, pay to 
the market administrator a sum not exceeding five cents per 
hundredweight on the total quantity of pool milk received from dairy 
farmers at plants or from farms in a unit operated by such handler, 
directly or at the instance of a cooperative association of producers 
and on the quantity for which payment is made pursuant to 
Sec. 1002.60(d)(2), the exact amount to be determined by the market 
administrator subject to review by the Secretary. This section shall not 
be deemed to duplicate any similar payment by any handler under an order 
issued by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of 
New York, or the Director of the Division of Dairy Industry of the New 
Jersey Department of Agriculture, with respect to the marketing area. 
Whenever verification by the market administrator discloses an error in 
the payment made by any handler, such error shall be adjusted not later 
than the date next following such disclosure on which payments are due 
pursuant to this section.

Sec. 1004.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, pool plant 
means a plant (except a producer-handler plant or the plant of a handler 
pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(e)) specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section.

percent in the months of September through February, and 30 percent in 
the months of March through August, of its receipts described in 
paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section is disposed of as Class I milk 
(except filled milk) and a volume not less than 15 percent of such 
receipts is disposed of as route disposition (other than as filled milk) 
in the marketing area.
    (1) Milk received at such plant directly from dairy farmers 
(excluding milk diverted as producer milk pursuant to Sec. 1004.12, by 
either the plant operator or by a cooperative association, and also 
excluding the milk of dairy farmers for other markets) and from a 
cooperative in its capacity as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(c); or
    (2) In the case of a plant with no receipts described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, receipts of fluid milk products (other than 
filled milk) from other plants.
    (3) A plant which meets the ``pool plant'' requirements of this 
paragraph during any month shall retain its pool status during the 
immediately succeeding two months as long as the plant continues to meet 
the 15-percent in-area Class I disposition requirement, unless written 
application is filed by the plant operator with the market administrator 
on or before the first day of any such month requesting that the plant 
be designated a nonpool plant for such month and each subsequent month 
during which it does not otherwise qualify pursuant to this paragraph.
    (4) A plant's status as an other order plant pursuant to paragraph 
(f) of this section will become effective beginning the third 
consecutive month in which a plant is subject to the classification and 
pricing provisions of another order.
    (b) Any plant not meeting the conditions of paragraph (a) of this 
section from which during the month a quantity of fluid milk products 
(other than filled milk) not less than the applicable percentage (as 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of such plant's receipts 
of milk from dairy farmers (including milk diverted as producer milk 
pursuant to Sec. 1004.12 by either the plant operator or by a 
cooperative association) and from a cooperative association in its 
capacity as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(c) is moved to a plant(s) 
meeting the percentage disposition requirements specified in paragraph 
(a)

[[Page 112]]

of this section with respect to its total receipts of fluid milk 
products (other than filled milk) from dairy farmers, cooperative 
associations as handlers pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(c) and from other 
plants. However, a plant shall not qualify pursuant to this paragraph in 
any month in which a greater proportion of its qualifying shipments are 
made to a plant(s) regulated under another Federal order than to plants 
regulated under this order.
    (1) The applicable percentage for the purpose of this paragraph 
shall be:
    (i) 50 percent for any month of September through February; and
    (ii) 40 percent for any month of March through August.

of this section, subject to the requirement of paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section.
    (1) A reserve processing plant operated by a cooperative association 
at which milk from dairy farmers is received if the total of fluid milk 
products (except filled milk) transferred from such cooperative 
association plant(s) to, and the milk of member producers physically 
received at, pool plants pursuant to Sec. 1004.7(a) is not less than 25 
percent of the total milk of member producers during the month.
    (2) A reserve processing plant operated by a federation of 
cooperative associations if, during the month, 30 percent or more of the 
producer milk of member producers of such cooperative is caused to be 
delivered to and physically received at pool plants qualified pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section either from the farms of such producers 
or by transfer in the form of fluid milk products (except filled milk) 
from the plant(s) of such cooperatives. If a pipeline is maintained 
between a reserve processing plant and a nonpool plant operated by 
another person and located on the same premises, the reserve processing 
plant shall be a pool plant for the month if the operator of such plant 
proves to the satisfaction of the market administrator that such plant 
should be eligible for pool status on the basis of the plant's monthly 
receipts and disposition of milk and that the pipeline was used only to 
move by-products (not milk) between such plants during the month.
    (3) A reserve processing plant owned and operated by a cooperative 
association that also owns and operates a pool plant pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.7(a) so long as the volume of the cooperative's member milk 
pooled at the reserve processing plant does not exceed the volume of 
sales of Class I milk (except filled milk) from the cooperative's pool 
distributing plant, plus the milk of member producers received directly 
at pool plants pursuant to Sec. 1004.7(a) of other handlers during the 
month.
    (4) A cooperative or federation of cooperatives operating a pool 
reserve processing plant qualified pursuant to this paragraph shall 
notify the market administrator each month, at the time of filing 
reports pursuant to Sec. 1004.30 and in the detail prescribed by the 
market administrator, with respect to any receipts from member dairy 
farmers of the cooperative(s) delivering to such plant not meeting the 
health requirements for disposition as fluid milk in the marketing area.
    (e) A plant that qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section during each of the immediately preceding months 
of September through February shall be qualified for automatic pool 
plant status for each of the following months of March through August, 
unless the plant operator files a written request with the market 
administrator prior to the beginning of any such month asking that such 
plant not be a pool plant. Such nonpool status shall be effective on the 
first day of the month following the receipt of such request and shall 
continue until the plant again qualifies as a pool plant pursuant to 
paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The automatic pool plant status for any plant identified in 
paragraph (e) of this section shall be cancelled if another plant is 
qualified as a pool plant on the basis of deliveries to the same plants 
through which such automatic pooling status was acquired by the plant. 
Cancellation of the plant's automatic pool plant status shall be 
effective on the first day of the month in which the other plant is 
qualified as a pool plant and shall continue until the

[[Page 113]]

plant again qualifies as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) or (d) 
of this section; and
    (2) The automatic pool plant status of a reserve processing plant 
operated by a federation of cooperative associations qualified pursuant 
to paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be forfeited for any month 
during the March through August period in which the market administrator 
determines on the basis of the investigation conducted pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section that such plant shall not be a pool 
plant for the month.
    (f) A plant specified in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section 
shall, except as provided in Secs. 1004.32(e) and 1004.71(c), be exempt 
from the provisions of this part:
    (1) Any plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
which would be subject to the classification and pricing provisions of 
another order issued pursuant to the Act unless the Secretary determines 
that a greater volume of Class I milk, except filled milk, is disposed 
of from such plant as route disposition in the Middle Atlantic marketing 
area than is so disposed of in a marketing area regulated pursuant to 
such other order; or
    (2) Any plant subject to the classification and pricing provisions 
of another order issued pursuant to the Act, notwithstanding its status 
under this order pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
    (g) The applicable shipping percentage of paragraphs (a) and (b) or 
(d) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market 
administrator if the market administrator finds that such revision is 
necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic 
shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall 
investigate the need for revision either on the market administrator's 
own initiative or at the request of interested parties. If the 
investigation shows that a revision of the shipping percentages might be 
appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that 
the revision is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. 
Any request for revision of shipping percentages shall be filed with the 
market administrator no later than the 15th day of the month prior to 
the month for which the requested revision is desired effective.

    (i) All of the diversions of milk of members of a cooperative 
association or a federation of cooperative associations to nonpool

federation, and the amount of member milk so diverted does not exceed 55 
percent of the volume of milk of all members of such cooperative 
association or federation delivered to or diverted from pool plants 
during the month.
    (ii) All of the diversions of milk of dairy farmers who are not

adjustments pursuant to Secs. 1004.52 and 1004.75 and the direct-
delivery differential pursuant to Sec. 1004.79, milk which is diverted 
shall be considered to be received at the location of the plant to which

(d)(2)(ii) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market 
administrator if the market administrator finds that such revision is 
necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic 
shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall 
investigate the need for revision either on the market administrator's 
own initiative or at the request of interested parties. If the 
investigation shows that a revision of the diversion limit percentages 
might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice 
stating that the revision is being considered and invite data, views and 
arguments. Any request for revision of the diversion limit percentages 
shall be filed with the market administrator no later than the 15th day 
of the month prior to the month for which the requested revision is 
desired effective.

diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that if the 
operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such milk 
on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm and 
butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the applicable 
percentage under this paragraph shall be 2 percent:
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined

Sec. 1004.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1004.44(a)(13) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1004.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;

[[Page 121]]

    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1004.44(a)(8) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1004.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1004.44 (a) 
(12) or (13) or the corresponding steps of Sec. 1004.44(b), the skim 
milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source 
milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than 
would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or the divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1004.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to 
exempt distributing plants operated by governmental agencies. Skim milk 
or butterfat in the following forms that is transferred from a pool 
plant to a producer-handler under this or any other Federal order or 
transferred or diverted from a pool plant to an exempt distributing 
plant operated by a governmental agency shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or an exempt distributing plant operated by a 
governmental agency shall be classified:

[[Page 122]]

    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1004.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of milk for 
such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of milk from plants not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order which the market administrator 
determines constitute regular sources of milk for such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the

mathematical and other obvious errors, the reports of receipts and 
utilization submitted pursuant to Sec. 1004.30 (a), (b), and (d) by each 
handler and compute the total pounds of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in each class at each of the plants of such handler, and 
the total pounds of skim milk and butterfat in each class which was 
received from producers by a cooperative association handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.9 (b) and (c) and was not received at a pool plant.
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
products plus all the water originally associated with such solids.
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1004.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III use at the plant.
    (e) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1004.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1004.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

Sec. 1004.44  Classification of producer milk.

    After making the computations pursuant to Sec. 1004.43, the market 
administrator each month shall determine the classification of milk 
received from producers by each cooperative association handler pursuant 
to Sec. 1004.9 (b) and (c) which was not received at a pool plant, and 
the classification of milk received from producers and from cooperative 
association handlers pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(c) at each pool plant for 
each handler as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1004.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I, the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; and
    (ii) Receipts of exempt milk;
    (3) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(8)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining, or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the 
beginning of the month. This paragraph

[[Page 124]]

shall apply only if the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this 
paragraph or comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the 
immediately preceding month;
    (5) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1004.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1004.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(6) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (7) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1004.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1004.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(6) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1004.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(5), (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products from dairy farmers for other 
markets pursuant to Sec. 1004.11 and from unidentified sources;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler, as 
defined under this or any other Federal order;
    (iv) Receipts (other than exempt milk) of fluid milk products from a 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(e);
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from 
unregulated supply plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor plant 
and is not assigned under this step at a plant regulated under another 
market pool order;
    (9) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (8)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests aclassification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (8)(v) and (9)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(9)(ii) (A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the

[[Page 125]]

pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of Class I utilization resulting from reported Class I 
transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, from a 
cooperative association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.9(c), and in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from other 
order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(vi) 
of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants remaining at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (10) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1004.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(4), (6) and (8)(i) of this section;
    (11) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (12) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, prorata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
unregulated supply plants and from other order plants if not classified 
or priced pursuant to the order regulating such plants, that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (8)(v) and (9) (i) and (ii) 
of this section and that were not offset by transfers or diversions of 
fluid milk products to the same unregulated supply plant from which 
fluid milk products to be allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like

[[Page 126]]

amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such 
case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation 
step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in remaining 
receipts of bulk fluid milk products from other order plants (except 
receipts from other order plants not classified and priced pursuant to 
the order regulating such plants), that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8)(vi) and (9)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(13) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II with respect to whichever of 
the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class, as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1004.45(b); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(13)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at such plants, the pounds of such excess shall 
be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I after 
such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk was 
received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(13)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(13) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(13)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(13) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (14) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant and from a cooperative 
association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(c) 
according to the classification assigned pursuant to Sec. 1004.42(a); 
and
    (15) If the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes exceed the 
pounds of skim milk in producer milk,

[[Page 127]]

subtract such excess from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class in series beginning with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall 
be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(15) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1004.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) On or before the 15th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests, the class utilization of 
milk purchased from such association or delivered to the pool plant(s) 
of each handler by producers who are members of such cooperative 
association. For the purpose of this report, the milk so purchased or 
received shall be allocated to each class in the same ratio as all 
producer milk received by such handler during such month;
    (b) Whenever required for purpose of allocating receipts from other 
order plants pursuant to Sec. 1004.44(a)(13) and the corresponding step 
of Sec. 1004.44(b), the market administrator shall estimate and publicly 
announce the utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) in each class 
during the month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer 
milk of all handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the most current 
available data and shall be final for such purpose;
    (c) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1004.43(e) and Sec. 1004.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (d) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order 
plant, the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler; and, as necessary, any changes in such classification 
arising from the verification of such report.

    (d) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound shall be a figure 
computed as follows:
    (1) Compute a butterfat differential per one percent butterfat, 
rounded to the nearest one-tenth cent, by multiplying the current 
month's butter

[[Page 128]]

price by 1.38, and subtract from the result an amount determined by 
multiplying 0.028 by the preceding month's average pay price per 
hundredweight, at test, for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and 
Wisconsin, using the ``base month'' series, adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.51 (a) through (e), as reported by the Department. The butter 
price means the simple average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, Grade A butter price as reported by the Department.
    (2) Multiply the butterfat differential obtained in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section by 3.5, and subtract the resulting amount from the Class 
III price;
    (3) Divide the value obtained from the calculations of paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section by 100; and
    (4) Add to the resulting amount the butterfat differential computed 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The sum thereof shall be the price 
per pound for producer butterfat for the month.
    (e) Nonfat milk solids price. The price per pound for nonfat milk 
solids shall be computed by subtracting from the Class III price the 
butterfat price multiplied by 3.5, and dividing the result by the 
average percentage of nonfat milk solids in all producer milk for the 
month.
    (f) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight shall be 
the Class III price for the month adjusted to remove the value of 3.5 
percent butterfat and rounded to the nearest cent. Such adjustment shall 
be computed by multiplying the butterfat differential pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section by 3.5 and subtracting the result from 
the Class III price.
    (g) Class III-A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Central States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as 
reported by the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by 
subtracting from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat 
dry milk price, plus the butterfat differential value per hundredweight 
of 3.5 percent milk and rounded to the nearest cent, and subject to the 
adjustments set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for the 
applicable month.

Sec. 1004.51  Basic formula prices.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1004.50(d)(1) and rounded to 
the nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the non dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average

[[Page 129]]

for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat price, as 
reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined

Sec. 1004.52  Location differentials to handlers.

    (a) For that milk received from producers and from a cooperative 
association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(c) at a 
plant located 55 miles or more by shortest highway distance from the 
city hall in Philadelphia, Pa., and also 75 miles or more by the 
shortest highway distance from the nearer of the zero milestone in 
Washington, DC, or the city hall in Baltimore, MD (all such distance to 
be determined by the market administrator), and which is assigned to

disposition exceeds 95 percent of the sum of receipts at such plant from 
producers, cooperative associations pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(c), and the 
pounds assigned as Class I to receipts from other order plants and 
unregulated supply plants, and from dairy farmers for other markets 
pursuant to Sec. 1004.11. Such assignment is to be made first to 
transferor plants at which no location adjustment credit is applicable 
and then in sequence beginning with the plant at which the least 
location adjustment would apply: Provided, That for the purposes of this 
paragraph, transfers from a pool plant to a second pool plant which are 
in turn transferred to a third pool plant shall be treated as though the 
transfer was direct from the originating plant to the plant of final 
receipt.

Sec. 1004.61  Computation of weighted average differential price and producer nonfat milk solids price.

    For each month the market administrator shall compute a ``weighted 
average differential price'' and a ``producer nonfat milk solids 
price'', as follows:
    (a) The ``weighted average differential price'' shall be the result 
of the following computations:
    (1) Combine into one total:
    (i) The value computed pursuant to Sec. 1004.60 (a) through (h) for 
all handlers who filed the reports prescribed by Sec. 1004.30 for the 
month and who made the payments pursuant to Sec. 1004.71 for the 
preceding month;
    (ii) An amount equal to the total value of the location 
differentials computed pursuant to Sec. 1004.75;
    (iii) An amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance in the producer-settlement fund.
    (2) Divide the total value calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section by the sum of the following for all handlers:
    (i) The total hundredweight of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.13 represented by the value established pursuant to (1)(i) of 
this paragraph; and
    (ii) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1004.60(h).
    (3) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight. The result shall be the ``Weighted average differential 
price.''
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The ``Producer nonfat milk solids price'' to be paid to all 
producers for the pounds of nonfat milk solids contained in their milk 
shall be computed by the market administrator each month as follows:
    (1) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.60 (i) and (j) for all handlers who made reports pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.30 and who made payments pursuant to Sec. 1004.71 for the 
preceding month;
    (2) Divide the resulting amount by the total pounds of nonfat milk 
solids in producer milk; and
    (3) Round by subtracting a positive amount not to exceed one cent. 
The result is the ``Producer nonfat milk solids price.''

Secs. 1004.30(b) and 1004.32(c) the information necessary to compute the 
amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall pay the 
amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) An amount computed as follows:
    (1)(i) The obligation that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1004.60 at such plant shall be determined as though such plant were 
a pool plant. For purposes of such computation, receipts at such nonpool 
plant from a pool plant, a cooperative association as a handler pursuant 
to Sec. 1004.9(b), or an other order plant shall be assigned to the 
utilization at which classified at the pool plant or other order plant 
and transfers from such nonpool plant to a pool plant or an other order 
plant shall be classified as Class III milk if allocated to such class 
at the pool plant or other order plant and be valued at the weighted 
average price of the respective order if so allocated to Class I milk 
except that reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be valued at 
the Class III price. There shall be included in the obligation so 
computed a charge in the amount specified in Sec. 1004.60(h) and a 
credit in the amount specified in Sec. 1004.71(b)(2) with respect to 
receipts from an unregulated supply plant, except that the credit for 
receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be at the Class 
III price, unless an obligation with respect to such plant is computed 
as specified below in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; and
    (ii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, and provides with his reports pursuant to Secs. 1004.30(b) 
and 1004.32(c) similar reports with respect to the operations of any 
other nonpool plant which serves as a supply plant for such partially 
regulated distributing plant by shipments to such plant during the month 
equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1004.7(b) with agreement of the 
operator of such plant that the market administrator may examine the 
books and records of such plant for purposes of verification of such 
reports, there will be added the amount of the obligation computed at 
such nonpool supply plant in the same manner and subject to the same 
conditions as for the partially regulated distributing plant.
    (2) From this obligation there will be deducted the sum of: (i) The 
gross payments made by such handler for milk (approved by a duly 
constituted health authority for fluid disposition) received during the 
month from dairy farmers at such plant and like payments made by the 
operator of a supply plant(s) included in the computations pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and (ii) any payments to the producer-
settlement fund of another order under which such plant is also a 
partially regulated distributing plant.
    (b) An amount computed as follows:

[[Page 136]]

    (1) Determine the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
disposed of as Class I milk on routes in the marketing area;
    (2) Deduct the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
received as Class I milk at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants; cooperative associations in their capacity as handlers 
pursuant to Sec. 1004.9(b), and other order plants, except that deducted 
under a similar provision of another order issued pursuant to the Act;
    (3) Deduct the quantity of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of on routes in the 
marketing area from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (4) Combine the amounts of skim milk and butterfat remaining into 
one total and determine the weighted average butterfat content; and
    (5) From the value of such milk at the Class I price, subtract its 
value at the uniform price computed pursuant to Sec. 1004.62, and add 
for the quantity of labeled reconstituted skim milk specified in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section its value computed at the Class I price 
less $1.00 (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the value 
of such milk at the Class III price (except that the Class I price and 
the uniform price shall be adjusted for the location of the nonpool 
plant and shall not be less than the Class III price). For any 
reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not 
be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1004.43(e). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

the same day of each succeeding month until such obligation is paid, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The amount payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
charges previously computed pursuant to this section and all such 
amounts shall be paid to the administrative assessment fund maintained 
by the market administrator;
    (b) Any obligation that was determined at a date later than that 
prescribed by the order because of a handler's failure to submit a 
report to the market administrator when due, shall be considered to have 
been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been 
filed when due; and
    (c) Payments shall be deemed not to have been made until such 
payments have been received, except:
    (1) Any payment received after the due date in an envelope that is 
postmarked not later than the second day prior to the due date shall be 
considered to have been received by the due date; and
    (2) If the date by which payments must be received falls on a 
Saturday or Sunday or on a national holiday, payments shall be 
considered to have been received by the due date if received not later 
than the next day on which the market administrator's office is open for

per hundredweight or such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe 
and shall pay such deductions to the market administrator on or before

establish the weights, samples and tests of milk of producers who are

[[Page 138]]

not receiving such service from a cooperative association; and
    (b) In the case of producers for whom the Secretary determines a 
cooperative association is actually performing the services set forth in

    Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A plant that is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency 
for the processing or packaging of Grade A milk and from which during 
the month is:
    (1) Route disposition, except filled milk, in the marketing area not 
less than 15 percent of its total route disposition, except filled milk, 
during the month; and

[[Page 140]]

    (2) The total quantity of fluid milk products, except filled milk, 
disposed of in class I is not less than 60 percent in each of the months 
of August through November and January and February, and 40 percent in 
each of the other months, of the total quantity of fluid milk products, 
except filled milk, physically received at such plant or diverted 
therefrom pursuant to Sec. 1005.13, subject to the following conditions:
    (i) Two or more plants operated by the same handler may be 
considered as a unit for the purpose of meeting the total Class I 
requirement percentages specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section if 
each plant in the unit meets the in-area route disposition requirement 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and if such handler 
requests that the plants be so considered as a unit. If such a handler 
wishes to add or remove plants from consideration as a unit, such a 
request must be made before the first day of the month for which it is 
to be effective.
    (ii) The applicable percentages in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
may be increased or decreased up to 10 percentage points by the Director 
of the Dairy Division if the Director finds such revision is necessary 
to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the 
marketing area. Before making such a finding, the Director shall 
investigate the need for revision either at the Director's own 
initiative or at the request of interested persons. If the investigation 
shows that a revision might be appropriate, the Director shall issue a 
notice stating that the revision is being considered and invite written 
data, views, and arguments.
    (b) A plant, other than a plant described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, from which fluid milk products, except filled milk, are shipped 
to pool plants pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Such shipments 
must equal not less than 60 percent in each of the months of August 
through November and January and February, and 40 percent in each of the 
other months, of the total quantity of milk approved by a duly 
constituted regulatory agency for fluid consumption that is received 
during the month from dairy farmers (including producer milk diverted 
from the plant pursuant to Sec. 1005.13 but excluding milk diverted to 
such plant) and handlers described in Sec. 1005.9(c). The operator of 
such plant may include milk diverted from such plant to plants described 
in paragraph (a) of this section as qualifying shipments in meeting up 
to one-half of the required shipments. The applicable shipping 
percentage of this paragraph may be increased or decreased up to 10 
percentage points by the market administrator if the market 
administrator finds such revision is necessary to obtain needed 
shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a 
finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for 
revision either at the market administrator's own initiative or at the 
request of interested persons. If the investigation shows that a 
revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a 
notice stating that the revision is being considered and invite data, 
views, and arguments.
    (c) A plant located in the State of North Carolina, South Carolina 
or Virginia that is operated by a cooperative association if pool plant 
status under this paragraph is requested for such plant by the 
cooperative association and during the month 60 percent or more of the 
producer milk of members of such cooperative association, excluding such 
milk that is received at or diverted from pool plants described in 
paragraph (b) of this section but including milk delivered by such 
cooperative as a handler described in Sec. 1005.9(c), is delivered 
directly from their farms to pool plants described in paragraph (a) of 
this section or is transferred to such plants as a bulk fluid milk 
product from the plant of the cooperative association, subject to the 
following conditions:

or (b) of this section or under the provisions of another Federal order 
applicable to a distributing plant or a supply plant; and
    (2) The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency to 
handle milk for fluid consumption.
    (d) A plant located within the marketing area (other than a 
producer-handler plant or a governmental agency plant) that meets the 
qualifications

[[Page 141]]

described in paragraph (a) of this section regardless of its quantity of 
route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area.
    (e) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A governmental agency plant;
    (3) A plant with route disposition in this marketing area that is 
located within the marketing area of another Federal order and that is 
fully regulated under such order;
    (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
which is not located within any Federal order marketing area but which 
also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from 
which there is a greater quantity of route disposition, except filled 
milk, during the month in such other Federal order marketing area than 
in this marketing area; and
    (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section if 
the plant has automatic pooling status under another Federal order or if 
the plant meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order during 
the month and makes greater qualifying shipments to plants regulated 
under such other order than to plants regulated under this order.

    (c) Diverted from a pool plant for the account of the handler 
operating such plant to another pool plant;
    (d) Diverted from a pool plant to a nonpool plant (other than a 
producer-handler plant) for the account of the handler described in 
Sec. 1005.9 (a) or (b) subject to the following conditions:
    (1) A producer's milk shall be eligible for diversion to a nonpool 
plant during any month in which such producer's milk is physically 
received at a pool plant as follows:
    (i) In any month of July through February, six days' production;
    (ii) In any month of March through June, two days' production.
    (2) During each of the months of July through November and January 
and February, the total quantity of milk diverted by a cooperative 
association shall not exceed one-fourth of the producer milk that such 
cooperative caused that month to be delivered to or diverted from such 
pool plants;
    (3) A handler described in Sec. 1005.9(a) that is not a cooperative 
association may divert for its account any milk that is not under the 
control of a cooperative association that diverts milk during the month 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The total quantity of milk 
so diverted shall not exceed one-fourth of the milk that is physically 
received at or diverted from

shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to make such 
designation, no milk diverted by such handler pursuant to this paragraph 
shall be producer milk;
    (5) To the extent that it would result in nonpool status for the 
pool plant from which diverted, milk diverted for the account of a 
cooperative association from the pool plant of another handler shall not 
be producer milk;
    (6) The cooperative association shall designate the dairy farmer 
deliveries that are not producer milk pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of 
this section. If the diverting handler fails to make such designation, 
no milk diverted by such handler shall be producer milk; and

Sec. 1005.41  Shrinkage.

    For the purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1005.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through 
(6) of this section which was received in the form of a bulk fluid milk 
product or a bulk fluid cream product.
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant);
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1005.9(c), and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this subparagraph shall be 
2 percent;

[[Page 147]]

    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this 
subparagraph shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received from unregulated supply plants, 
excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III classification is

the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such 
milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm 
and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 1005.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1005.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1005.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1005.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1005.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.44(a)(11) or (a)(12) or the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1005.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, 
up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such 
receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk 
to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to another order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as

[[Page 148]]

described in paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to the class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1005.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to 
governmental agency plants. Skim milk or butterfat in the following 
forms that is transferred from a pool plant to a producer-handler under 
this or any other Federal order or transferred or diverted from a pool 
plant to a governmental agency plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or a governmental agency plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and 
(d)(2)(i)(B) of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk 
form shall be classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool 
plant's utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) 
through (d)(2)(viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in such handler's report of receipts and utilization 
filed pursuant to Sec. 1005.30 for the month within which such 
transaction occurred; and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;

[[Page 149]]

    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool

sequence:
    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata

Sec. 1005.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1005.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1005.40, 1005.41, and 1005.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1005.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the

[[Page 150]]

pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be considered under this 
part as used or disposed of by the handler shall be an amount equivalent 
to the nonfat milk solids contained in such product plus all of the 
water originally associated with such solids; and
    (c) The classification of producer milk of a handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.9 (b) or (c) shall be determined separately from the 
operations of any pool plant operated by such handler.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1005.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1005.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

Sec. 1005.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1005.9(a) for each pool plant of the handler 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1005.9(c), by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to the utilization of such receipts 
by such handler as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1005.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1005.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1005.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this subparagraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in

[[Page 151]]

other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1005.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1005.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1005.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from a 
governmental agency plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) of this section which are 
in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(A) through (a)(8)(ii)(C) of this section. Should the pounds 
of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1005.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and

[[Page 152]]

    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1005.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) and (a)(8)(ii) of this section and 
that were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products 
to the same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to 
be allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (a)(8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), 
(a)(12)(iii), and (a)(12)(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be 
pro rata to the pounds of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class 
III combined, with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
with respect to whichever of the following quantities represents the 
lower proportion of Class I milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1005.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler

[[Page 153]]

(excluding any duplication of utilization in each class resulting from 
transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (a)(12)(ii) 
of this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (a)(12)(ii) 
of this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1005.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1005.9(c), subtract such excess from the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1005.9(c) in each class shall be the combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the 
computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1005.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:

    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat

[[Page 155]]

Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfatS dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this

(a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section, the adjustment shall be a minus 
2.5 cents for each 10 miles or fraction thereof (by the shortest hard-
surfaced highway distance as determined by the market administrator) 
that such plant is from the nearer of the city halls in Greenville, 
South Carolina, or Charlotte or Greensboro, North Carolina.
    (b) For fluid milk products transferred in bulk from a pool plant to 
a pool distributing plant at which a higher Class I price applies and 
which are classified as Class I milk, the Class I price shall be the 
Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant subject 
to a location adjustment credit for the transferor-plant which shall be 
determined by the market administrator for skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, as follows:
    (1) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
the transferee-plant after the computations pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.44(a)(12) and the pounds of skim milk in receipts of 
concentrated fluid milk products from other pool plants that are 
assigned to Class I use, an amount equal to:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of milk at the transferee-
plant from producers and handlers described in Sec. 1005.9(c); and
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products from other pool plants.
    (2) Assign any remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I at the 
transferee-plant to the skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from other pool plants, first to the transferor-plant at which 
the highest Class I price applies and then to other plants in sequence 
beginning with the plant at which the next highest Class I price 
applies;
    (3) Compute the total amount of location adjustment credits to be 
assigned to transferor-plants by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk assigned pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section to each 
transferor-plant at which the Class I price is lower than the Class I 
price at the transferee-plant by the difference in the Class I prices 
applicable at the transferor-plant and transferee-plant, and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (4) Assign the total amount of location adjustment credits computed 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section to those transferor-plants 
that transferred fluid milk products containing skim milk classified as 
Class I milk pursuant to Sec. 1005.42(a) and at which the applicable 
Class I price is less than the Class I price at the transferee-plant, in 
sequence beginning with the plant at which the highest Class I price 
applies. Subject to the availability of such credits, the credit 
assigned to each plant shall be equal to the hundredweight of such Class 
I skim milk multiplied by the applicable location adjustment rate for 
such plant. If the aggregate of this computation for all plants having 
the same location adjustment rate exceeds the credits that are available 
to those plants, such credits shall be prorated to the volume of skim 
milk in Class I transfers from such plants; and
    (5) Location adjustment credit for butterfat shall be determined in 
accordance with the procedure outlined for skim milk in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section.
    (c) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be 
adjusted at the rates set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, except 
that the adjusted Class I price shall not be less than the Class III 
price.

<R05>
Sec. 1005.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk for each 
handler described in Sec. 1005.9(a) with respect to each of its pool 
plants and for each handler described in Sec. 1005.9 (b) and (c) with 
respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1005.9(c) that were classified in each class 
pursuant to Secs. 1005.43(a) and 1005.44(c) by the applicable class 
prices, and add the resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1005.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1005.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1005.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1005.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1005.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1005.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1005.44 (a)(7)(v) and 
(a)(7)(vi) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1005.44(b); and
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1005.43(d) and Sec. 1005.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1005.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1005.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1005.76(a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that

[[Page 158]]

results from any inventory reclassification of bulk concentrated fluid 
milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. Any such applicable 
class price change shall be applied to the plant that used the 
concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid milk products 
were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the 
plant during the prior month.

follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.

Sec. 1005.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1005.30(b) and 1005.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;

[[Page 161]]

    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants, handlers pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.9(b), and other order plants, except that subtracted under a 
similar provision of another Federal milk order; and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not another order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(except that the Class I price and weighted average price shall not be 
less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant, a handler 
described in Sec. 1005.9(b), or another order plant shall be allocated 
at the partially regulated distributing plant to the same class in which 
such products were classified at the fully regulated plant or as 
classified pursuant to Sec. 1005.42 with respect to receipts from a 
handler described in Sec. 1005.9(b);
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or 
another order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1005.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced

[[Page 162]]

at the lowest class price of the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1005.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1005.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1005.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1005.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1005.7(b) 
subject to the following conditions:
    (A) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with its reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1005.30(b) and 
1005.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (B) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (C) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1005.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1005.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1005.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1005.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the

Sec. 1005.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    (a) Whenever verification by the market administrator of payments by 
any handler discloses errors made in payments to the producer-settlement 
fund pursuant to Sec. 1005.71 or to the transportation credit balancing 
fund pursuant to Sec. 1005.81, the market administrator shall promptly 
bill such handler for any unpaid amount and such handler shall, within 
15 days, make payment to the market administrator of the amount so 
billed. Whenever verification discloses that payment is due from the

balancing fund, as soon as funds become available. If a handler is due 
additional payment for a month in which payments to handlers were 
prorated pursuant to Sec. 1005.82(a), the additional payment pursuant to 
this section shall be multiplied by the final proration percentage 
computed in Sec. 1005.82(a)(2).
    (b) Whenever verification by the market administrator of the payment 
by a handler to any producer or cooperative association for milk 
received by such handler discloses payment of less than is required by 
Sec. 1005.73, the handler shall pay such balance due such producer or 
cooperative association not later than the time of making payment to 
producers or cooperative associations next following such disclosure.

1005.73, 1005.76, 1005.77, 1005.81, 1005.85 or 1005.86 shall be 
increased one and one-fourth percent per month beginning on the first 
day after the due date, and on each date of subsequent months following 
the day on which such type of obligation is normally due, subject to the 
following conditions:
    (a) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
interest charges previously computed pursuant to this section;
    (b) For the purposes of this section, any obligation that was 
determined at a date later than that prescribed by the order because of 
a handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator when 
due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have 
been due if the report had been filed when due; and
    (c) All monies collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to 
the administrative assessment fund maintained by the market 
administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 1005.80  Transportation credit balancing fund.

    The market administrator shall maintain a separate fund known as the 
Transportation Credit Balancing Fund into which shall be deposited the 
payments made by handlers pursuant to Sec. 1005.81 and out of which 
shall be made the payments due handlers pursuant to Sec. 1005.82. 
Payments due a handler shall be offset against payments due from the 
handler.

Sec. 1005.81  Payments to the transportation credit balancing fund.

    (a) On or before the 12th day after the end of the month, each 
handler operating a pool plant and each handler specified in Sec. 1005.9 
(b) and (c) shall pay to the market administrator a transportation 
credit balancing fund assessment determined by multiplying the pounds of 
Class I producer milk assigned pursuant to Sec. 1005.44 by $0.065 per 
hundredweight or such lesser amount as the market administrator deems 
necessary to maintain a balance in the fund equal to the total 
transportation credits disbursed during the prior June-January period. 
In the event that during any month of the June-January period the fund 
balance is insufficient to cover the amount of credits that are due, the 
assessment should be based upon the amount of credits that would have 
been disbursed had the fund balance been sufficient.
    (b) The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before 
the 5th day of the month the assessment pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section for the following month.

<R05>
Sec. 1005.82  Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund.

    (a) Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund to 
handlers and cooperative associations requesting transportation credits 
shall be made as follows:
    (1) On or before the 13th day after the end of each of the months of 
July

[[Page 164]]

through December and any other month in which transportation credits are 
in effect pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the market 
administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and reported 
pursuant to Sec. 1005.30(a)(5), bulk milk transferred from another order 
plant as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that received, 
and reported pursuant to Sec. 1005.30(a)(6), milk directly from 
producers' farms as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a 
preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section 
to the extent that funds are available in the transportation credit 
balancing fund. If an insufficient balance exists to pay all of the 
credits computed pursuant to this section, the market administrator 
shall distribute the balance available in the transportation credit 
balancing fund by reducing payments prorata using the percentage derived 
by dividing the balance in the fund by the total credits that are due 
for the month. The amount of credits resulting from this initial 
proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section;
    (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for 
transportation credits on or before the 20th day of the month following 
the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to 
Sec. 1005.32(a). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted 
by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary 
proration of transportation credit payments for the preceding month 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Handlers will be promptly 
notified of an overpayment of credits based upon this final computation 
and remedial payments to or from the transportation credit balancing 
fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following 
month;
    (3) Transportation credits paid pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) and 
(2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market 
administrator pursuant to Sec. 1005.77. Adjusted payments to or from the 
transportation credit balancing fund will remain subject to the final 
proration established pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and
    (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the 
responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written 
documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator 
pursuant to Sec. 1005.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the 
transportation credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section 
shall be made to such cooperative association rather than to the 
operator of the pool plant at which the milk was received.
    (b) The market administrator may extend the period during which 
transportation credits are in effect (i.e., the transportation credit 
period) to the months of January and June if a written request to do so 
is received 15 days prior to the beginning of the month for which the 
request is made and, after conducting an independent investigation, 
finds that such extension is necessary to assure the market of an 
adequate supply of milk for fluid use. Before making such a finding, the 
market administrator shall notify the Director of the Dairy Division and 
all handlers in the market that an extension is being considered and 
invite written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to extend the 
transportation credit period must be issued in writing prior to the 
first day of the month for which the extension is to be effective.
    (c) Transportation credits shall apply to the following milk:
    (1) Bulk milk received from a plant regulated under another Federal 
order, except Federal Orders 1007, 1011, and 1046, and allocated to 
Class I milk pursuant to Sec. 1005.44(a)(12); and
    (2) Bulk milk received directly from the farms of dairy farmers at 
pool distributing plants subject to the following conditions:
    (i) The quantity of such milk that shall be eligible for the 
transportation credit shall be determined by multiplying the total 
pounds of milk received from producers meeting the conditions of this 
paragraph by the lower of:
    (A) The marketwide estimated Class I utilization of all handlers for 
the month pursuant to Sec. 1005.45(a); or
    (B) The Class I utilization of all producer milk of the pool plant 
operator receiving the milk after the computations described in 
Sec. 1005.44;

[[Page 165]]

    (ii) The dairy farmer was not a ``producer'' under this order during 
more than 2 of the immediately preceding months of January through June 
and not more than 50 percent of the production of the dairy farmer 
during those 2 months, in aggregate, was received as producer milk under 
this order during those 2 months. However, if January and/or June are 
months in which transportation credits are disbursed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, these months shall not be included in the 
2-month limit provided in this paragraph; and
    (iii) The farm on which the milk was produced is not located within 
the specified marketing area of this order or the marketing areas of 
Federal Orders 1007, 1011, or 1046, or within the Kentucky counties of 
Allen, Barren, Metcalfe, Monroe, Simpson, and Warren.
    (d) Transportation credits shall be computed as follows:
    (1) The market administrator shall subtract from the pounds of milk 
described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section the pounds of 
bulk milk transferred from the pool plant receiving the supplemental 
milk if milk was transferred to a nonpool plant on the same calendar day 
that the supplemental milk was received. For this purpose, the 
transferred milk shall be subtracted from the most distant load of 
supplemental milk received, and then in sequence with the next most 
distant load until all of the transfers have been offset;
    (2) With respect to the pounds of milk described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section that remain after the computations described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the market administrator shall:
    (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the 
shipping plant and the receiving plant;
    (ii) Multiply the number of miles so determined by 0.35 cent;
    (iii) Subtract the other order's Class I price applicable at the 
shipping plant's location from the Class I price applicable at the 
receiving plant as specified in Sec. 1005.53;
    (iv) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section; and
    (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this 
section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(2) 
introductory text of this section.
    (3) For the remaining milk described in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section after computations described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, the market administrator shall:
    (i) Determine an origination point for each load of milk by locating 
the nearest city to the last producer's farm from which milk was picked 
up for delivery to the receiving pool plant. Alternatively, the milk 
hauler that is transporting the milk of producers described in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section may establish an origination point following the 
last farm pickup by stopping at the nearest independently-operated truck 
stop with a certified truck scale and obtaining a weight certificate 
indicating the weight of the truck and its contents, the date and time 
of weighing, and the location of the truck stop;
    (ii) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between 
the receiving pool plant and the truck stop or city, as the case may be;
    (iii) Subtract 85 miles from the mileage so determined;
    (iv) Multiply the remaining miles so computed by 0.35 cent;
    (v) If the origination point determined pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section is in a Federal order marketing area, subtract 
the Class I price applicable at the origination point pursuant to the 
provisions of such other order (as if the origination point were a plant 
location) from the Class I price applicable at the distributing plant 
receiving the milk. If the origination point is not in any Federal order 
marketing area, determine the Class I price at the origination point 
based upon the provisions of this order and subtract this price from the 
Class I price applicable at the distributing plant receiving the milk;
    (vi) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph 
(d)(3)(v) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv) of this section; and

[[Page 166]]

    (vii) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(3)(vi) by the 
hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(3) introductory text of 
this section.

production) other than such receipts by a handler described in 
Sec. 1005.9(c) that were delivered to pool plants of other handlers;
    (b) Receipts from a handler described in Sec. 1005.9(c);
    (c) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I

Sec. 1005.86  Deduction for marketing services.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
handler, in making payments to producers for milk (other than milk of 
such handler's own production) pursuant to Sec. 1005.73, shall deduct 5 
cents per hundredweight, or such amount not exceeding 5 cents per 
hundredweight, as may be prescribed by the Secretary, and shall pay such 
deductions to the market administrator on or before the 15th day after 
the end of the month. Such money shall be used by the market 
administrator to provide market information and to check the accuracy of 
the testing and weighing of their milk for producers who are not 
receiving such service from a cooperative association.
    (b) In the case of producers who are members of a cooperative 
association which the Secretary has determined is actually performing 
the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, each handler 
shall (in lieu of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section), make such deductions from the payments to be made to such 
producers as may be authorized by the membership agreement or marketing 
contract between such cooperative association and such producers, and on 
or before the 13th day after the end of each month, pay such deductions 
to the cooperative association of which such producers are members, 
furnishing a statement showing the amount of any such deductions and the 
amount of milk for which such deduction was computed for each producer.

Sec. 1006.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in 
the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a 
pool plant to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk 
unless the operators of both plants request the same classification in 
another class. In either case, the classification of such transfers 
shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1006.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1006.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1006.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1006.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1006.44(a)(11) or (a)(12) or the 
corresponding steps of

[[Page 175]]

Sec. 1006.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred, up to the 
total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of 
other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater 
extent than would be the case if the other source milk had been received 
at the transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1006.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and to exempt distributing 
plants. Skim milk or butterfat in the following forms that is 
transferred from a pool plant to a producer-handler under this or any 
other Federal order or to an exempt distributing plant shall be 
classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, an exempt 
distributing plant, or a producer-handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1006.30 for the month

[[Page 176]]

within which such transaction occurred; and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month, the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors, the reports submitted by each 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1006.30 and compute the total pounds of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class at each pool plant.
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the

pounds of skim milk used or disposed of in such product shall be 
considered to be a quantity equivalent to the nonfat milk solids 
contained in such product plus all the water originally associated with 
such solids.
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1006.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1006.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1006.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by

Sec. 1006.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1006.9(a) for each of the handler's pool plants separately and of 
each handler described in Sec. 1006.9(b) and (c) by allocating the 
handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to such handler's 
utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1006.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I the remainder of such receipts.
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1006.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1006.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(5) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to, any product specified in Sec. 1006.40(b), 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1006.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;

[[Page 178]]

    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1006.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from an exempt 
distributing plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) of this section which are 
in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant 
and that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this 
section, if Class II or Class III classification is requested by the 
operator of the other order plant and the handler, but not in excess of 
the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;

[[Page 179]]

    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1006.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that 
were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the 
same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be 
allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (a)(8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1006.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler):
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation

[[Page 180]]

step from Class II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds 
of such excess shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in Class I after such proration at the pool plants at which 
such other source milk was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1006.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as overage;
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for purposes of allocating receipts from other 
order plants pursuant to Sec. 1006.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step 
of Sec. 1006.44(b), the market administrator shall estimate and publicly 
announce the utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) in each class 
during the month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer 
milk of all handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the most current 
available data and shall be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1006.43(d) and Sec. 1006.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.

[[Page 181]]

    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products of bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association, upon request by such association, the 
percentage of the milk caused to be delivered by the cooperative 
association for its members which was utilized in each class at each 
pool plant receiving such milk. For the purpose of this report, the milk 
so received shall be allocated to each class at each pool plant in the 
same ratio as all producer milk received at such plant during the month.

    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simply 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.

of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for

<R05>
Sec. 1006.60  Handler's value of milk for computing the uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1006.9 (b) and (c) as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk in each class as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1006.44(a) by the applicable class prices and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1006.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1006.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1006.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1006.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1006.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.44(a)(7)(i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1006.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1006.44(a)(7)(v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1006.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1006.43(d) and Sec. 1006.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1006.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1006.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1006.76(b)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that

[[Page 184]]

results from any inventory reclassification of bulk concentrated fluid 
milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. Any such applicable 
class price change shall be applied to the plant that used the 
concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid milk products 
were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the 
plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1006.61  Computation of uniform price.

    For each month, the market administrator shall compute a uniform 
price for milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.60 for all handlers who filed the reports pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.30 for the month, except those in default of payments required 
pursuant to Sec. 1006.71 for the preceding month;
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Add an amount equal to the total value of the minus location 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1006.75(a);
    (d) Subtract an amount equal to the total value of the plus location 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1006.75(a);
    (e) Add an amount equal to one-half the unobligated balance in the 
producer-settlement fund;
    (f) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations;
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1006.60(f); and
    (g) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight.

Sec. 1006.72  Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

    On or before the 13th day after the end of each month, the market 
administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the 
amount computed pursuant to Sec. 1006.71(a)(2) exceeds the amount 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1006.7(a)(1). If, at such time, the balance in 
the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments

Sec. 1006.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund 
on or before the 25th day after the end of the month either of the 
amounts (at the handler's election) calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section. If the handler fails to report pursuant to 
Secs. 1006.30 and 1006.31(b) the information necessary to compute the 
amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall pay the 
amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) The obligation that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.60 at such plant shall be determined as though such plant were 
a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Receipts at such nonpool plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be assigned to the utilization at which classified at 
the pool plant or other order plant;
    (ii) Transfers from such nonpool plant to a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be classified in the class to which allocated at the 
pool plant or other order plant. Class I milk transferred from such 
nonpool plant to pool plants and other order plants shall be valued at 
the uniform price of the respective order, except that reconstituted 
skim milk (including that in filled milk), and milk or skim milk from 
producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order shall be valued 
at the Class II price. No obligation shall apply to Class I milk 
transferred to a pool plant or an other order plant if such Class I 
utilization is assigned to receipts at the partially regulated 
distributing plant from pool plants and other order plants at which such 
milk was classified and priced as Class I milk;

[[Page 187]]

    (iii) Such handler's obligation shall include any charges computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1006.60(f) and any credits computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1006.71(a)(2)(ii) with respect to receipts of Class I milk from an 
unregulated supply plant, except that the credit for receipts of 
reconstituted skim milk (including that in filled milk), and milk or 
skim milk from producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order 
shall be at the Class II price, unless an obligation with respect to 
such plant is computed as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
section;
    (iv) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, and provides with his report pursuant to Sec. 1006.30 a 
similar report for each nonpool plant which serves as a supply plant for 
such partially regulated distributing plant by shipments to such plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1006.7(b) with 
agreement of the operator of such plant that the market administrator 
may examine the books and records of such plant for purposes of 
verification of such reports, there will be added the amount of the 
obligation computed at such nonpool supply plant in the same manner and 
subject to the same conditions as for the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (2) From this obligation, deduct the sum of:
    (i) The gross payments made by such handler, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1006.74, for Grade A milk received during the month from dairy 
farmers at such plant and like payments made by the operator of a supply 
plant(s) included in the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Payments to the producer-settlement fund of another order under 
which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant.
    (b) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area;
    (2) Deduct the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
received at the partially regulated distributing plant as follows:
    (i) Any Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that deducted under a similar provision of another order issued pursuant 
to the Act; and
    (ii) Receipts from a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat 
disposed of to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any 
order issued pursuant to the Act is classified and priced as Class I 
milk and is not used as an offset on any other payment obligation 
pursuant to any other order;
    (3) Deduct from any remainder the pounds of reconstituted milk made 
from nonfluid milk products, and milk or skim milk contained in receipts 
from producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order, which are 
then disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area from the 
partially regulated distributing plant;
    (4) Combine the amounts of skim milk and butterfat remaining into 
one total; and
    (5) From the value of such milk at the Class I price applicable at 
the location of the nonpool plant, subtract its value at the uniform 
price applicable at such location, and add the amount obtained from 
multiplying the pounds of labeled reconstituted milk included in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section by the difference between the Class I 
price applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant less $1.00 (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the 
Class III price. For any reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the 
Class I price shall not be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such 
disposition, payments may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order regulating the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients at the difference between the Class I price applicable under 
the other order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk 
ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) 
and the Class III price. This payment option shall apply only if a 
majority of the total milk received at the plant that processed the 
nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders 
and

[[Page 188]]

payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order 
pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the 
nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1006.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1007.3  Route disposition.

    Route disposition means a delivery to a retail or wholesale outlet 
(except a plant), either directly or through any distribution facility 
(including disposition from a plant store, vendor or vending machine) of 
a fluid milk product classified as Class I milk. Packaged fluid milk 
products that are transferred to a distributing plant from a plant with 
route disposition in the marketing area and which are classified as 
Class I under Sec. 1007.40(a) shall be considered as route disposition 
from the transferor plant, rather than the transferee plant, for the 
single purpose of qualifying it as a pool plant under Sec. 1007.7(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1007.4  Plant.

    Plant means the land, buildings, facilities, and equipment 
constituting a single operating unit or establishment at which milk or 
milk products, including filled milk, are received, processed, or 
packaged. Separate facilities without stationary storage tanks that are 
used only as a reload point for transferring bulk milk from one tank 
truck to another or separate facilities used only as a distribution 
point for storing packaged fluid milk products in transit for route 
disposition shall not be a plant under this definition.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.5  Distributing plant.

    Distributing plant means a plant that is approved by a duly 
constituted regulatory agency for the handling of Grade A milk and at 
which fluid milk products are processed or packaged and from which there 
is route disposition in the marketing area during the month.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.6  Supply plant.

    Supply plant means a plant that is approved by a duly constituted 
regulatory agency for the handling of Grade A milk and from which fluid 
milk products are transferred during the month to a pool distributing 
plant.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.7  Pool plant.

    Pool plant means a plant specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or 
(d) of this section, or a unit of plants as specified in paragraph (e) 
of this section, but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (g) of 
this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (a) through 
(c) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph 
(f) of this section:
    (a) A distributing plant from which during the month:
    (1) Total route disposition, except filled milk, is equal to 50 
percent or more of the total quantity of Grade A fluid milk products, 
except filled milk, physically received at such plant or diverted 
therefrom pursuant to Sec. 1007.13; and
    (2) Route disposition, except filled milk, in the marketing area is 
at least the lesser of a daily average of 1,500 pounds or 10 percent of 
the total quantity of fluid milk products, except filled milk, 
physically received or diverted therefrom pursuant to Sec. 1007.13.
    (b) A supply plant from which during each of the months of July 
through November 60 percent (40 percent during each of the months of 
December through June) of the total quantity of

[[Page 193]]

Grade A milk that is received during the month from dairy farmers 
(including producer milk diverted from the plant pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.13 but excluding milk diverted to such plant) and handlers 
described in Sec. 1007.9(c) is transferred to pool distributing plants.
    (c) A plant located within the Southeast marketing area that is 
operated by a cooperative association if pool plant status under this 
paragraph is requested for such plant by the cooperative association and 
during the month producer milk of members of such cooperative 
association is delivered directly from farms to pool distributing plants 
or is transferred to such plants as a fluid milk product from the 
cooperative's plant. Such deliveries, in excess of receipts by transfer 
from pool distributing plants, must equal not less than 60 percent of 
the total producer milk of such cooperative association in each of the 
months of July through November, and 40 percent of such milk in each of 
the months of December through June. The plant's pool plant status shall 
be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The plant does not qualify as a pool plant under paragraphs (a) 
or (b) of this section or under the provisions of another Federal order 
applicable to a distributing plant or a supply plant; and
    (2) The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency to 
handle Grade A milk.
    (d) A plant located within the marketing area (other than a 
producer-handler plant or a governmental agency plant) that meets the 
qualifications described in paragraph (a) of this section regardless of 
its quantity of route disposition in any other Federal order marketing 
area.
    (e) Two or more plants operated by the same handler and that are 
located within the Southeast marketing area may qualify for pool status 
as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route disposition 
requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the 
following additional requirements:
    (1) At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool 
plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) Other plants in the unit must process only Class I or Class II 
products and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or a 
lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant 
included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and
    (3) A written request to form a unit, or to add or remove plants 
from a unit, must be filed with the market administrator prior to the 
first day of the month for which it is to be effective.
    (f) The applicable percentages in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section may be increased or decreased up to 10 percentage points by the 
market administrator if, following a written request for such a 
revision, the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary 
to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the 
marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator 
shall investigate the need for the revision by conducting an 
investigation and conferring with the Director of the Dairy Division. If 
the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market 
administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being 
considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision 
to revise an applicable percentage must be issued in writing seven days 
before the effective date.
    (g) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) An exempt plant as defined in Sec. 1007.8(e);
    (3) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
which is not located within the Southeast marketing area, meets the 
pooling requirements of another Federal order, and has had greater sales 
in such other Federal order marketing area for three consecutive months, 
including the current month;
    (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
which is located in another order's marketing area and which is required 
to be regulated under such other order because of its location within 
the other order's marketing area; and
    (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and 
from which

[[Page 194]]

greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under such 
other order than are made to plants regulated under this part, or such 
plant has automatic pooling status under such other order.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.8  Nonpool plant.

    Nonpool plant means any milk or filled milk receiving, 
manufacturing, or processing plant other than a pool plant. The 
following categories of nonpool plants are further defined as follows:
    (a) Other order plant means a plant that is fully subject to the 
pricing and pooling provisions of another order issued pursuant to the 
Act.
    (b) Producer-handler plant means a plant operated by a producer-
handler as defined in any order (including this part) issued pursuant to 
the Act.
    (c) Partially regulated distributing plant means a nonpool plant 
that is not an other order plant, a producer-handler plant, or an exempt 
plant, from which there is route disposition in consumer-type packages 
or dispenser units in the marketing area during the month.
    (d) Unregulated supply plant means a supply plant that does not 
qualify as a pool supply plant and is not an other order plant, a 
producer-handler plant, or an exempt plant.
    (e) Exempt plant means a plant:
    (1) Operated by a governmental agency from which fluid milk products 
are distributed in the marketing area. Such plant shall be exempt from 
all provisions of this part; or
    (2) Which has monthly route disposition of 100,000 pounds or less 
during the month. Such plant will be exempt from the pricing and pooling 
provisions of this order, but the handler will be required to file 
periodic reports as prescribed by the market administrator to enable 
determination of the exempt status of such handler.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.9  Handler.

    Handler means:
    (a) Any person who operates one or more pool plants;
    (b) Any cooperative with respect to producer milk which it causes to

association;
    (c) Any cooperative association with respect to milk that it 
receives for its account from the farm of a producer for delivery to a 
pool plant of another handler in a tank truck owned and operated by, or 
under the control of, such cooperative association, unless both the 
cooperative association and the operator of the pool plant notify the 
market administrator prior to the time that such milk is delivered to 
the pool plant that the plant operator will be the handler of such milk 
and will purchase such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples. Milk for which the cooperative association is the handler 
pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to have been received by the 
cooperative association at the location of the pool plant to which such 
milk is delivered;
    (d) Any person who operates a partially regulated distributing 
plant;
    (e) A producer-handler;
    (f) Any person who operates an other order plant described in

    (b) Receives no Class I milk from sources other than his/her own 
farm production and pool plants;
    (c) Disposes of no other source milk as Class I milk; and
    (d) Provides proof satisfactory to the market administrator that the

to produce all Class I milk handled (excluding receipts from pool 
plants) and the operation of the processing and packaging business are 
his/her personal enterprise and personal risk.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.11  [Reserved]


<R05>

    (b) Producer shall not include:
    (1) A producer-handler as defined in any order (including this part)

    (2) Any person with respect to milk produced by such person whose 
milk is delivered to an exempt plant, excluding producer milk diverted 
to such exempt plant pursuant to Sec. 1007.13;
    (3) Any person with respect to milk produced by such person which is

Sec. 1007.13  Producer milk.

    Producer milk means the skim milk and butterfat contained in milk of 
a producer that is:
    (a) Received at a pool plant directly from such producer by the 
operator of the plant;
    (b) Received by a handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c);
    (c) Diverted from a pool plant to the pool plant of another handler. 
Milk so diverted shall be deemed to have been received at the location 
of the plant to which diverted; or
    (d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or cooperative 
association to a nonpool plant that is not a producer-handler plant, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) In any month of December through June, not less than four days' 
production of the producer whose milk is diverted is physically received 
at a pool plant during the month;
    (2) In any month of July through November, not less than ten days' 
production of the producer whose milk is diverted is physically received 
at a pool plant during the month;
    (3) The total quantity of milk so diverted during the month by a 
cooperative association shall not exceed 33 percent during the months of 
July through November, or 50 percent during the months of December 
through June, of the producer milk that the cooperative association 
caused to be delivered to, and physically received at, pool plants 
during the month;
    (4) The operator of a pool plant that is not a cooperative 
association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a 
cooperative association that diverts milk during the month pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section. The total quantity of milk so diverted 
during the month shall not exceed 33 percent during the months of July 
through November, or 50 percent during the months of December through 
June, of the producer milk physically received at such plant (or such 
unit of plants in the case of plants that pool as a unit pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.7(d)) during the month;
    (5) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in 
paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section shall not be producer milk. 
The diverting handler shall designate the dairy farmer deliveries that 
will not be producer milk pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this 
section. If the handler fails to make such designation, no milk diverted 
by such handler shall be producer milk;
    (6) To the extent that it would result in nonpool status for the 
plant from which diverted, milk diverted for the account of a 
cooperative association from the pool plant of another handler shall not 
be producer milk;
    (7) The cooperative association shall designate the dairy farm 
deliveries that are not producer milk pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of 
this section. If the cooperative association fails to make such 
designation, no milk diverted by it to a nonpool plant shall be producer 
milk;

[[Page 196]]

    (8) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to 
which diverted; and
    (9) The market administrator may increase or decrease the applicable 
percentages in paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section by up to 10 
percentage points, and may increase or decrease the 10-day and 4-day 
delivery requirements in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section by 
50 percent if, following a written request for such a revision, the 
market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure 
orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. 
Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate 
the need for the revision by conducting an investigation and conferring 
with the Director of the Dairy Division. If the investigation shows that 
a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a 
notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting 
written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable 
percentage must be issued in writing seven days before the effective 
date.

in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c), except that 
if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchased 
such milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the 
farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchased such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

<R05>
Sec. 1007.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant 
to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk unless the 
operators of both plants request the same classification in another 
class. In either case, the classification shall be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1007.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products.
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1007.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a) (11) or (12) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1007.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if 
the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant 
to an other order

[[Page 201]]

plant shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification 
shall apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section.
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be Class I subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to the class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1007.40.
    (c) Transfers and diversions to producer-handlers and to exempt 
plants. Skim milk or butterfat that is transferred or diverted from a 
pool plant to a producer-handler under another Federal order or to an 
exempt plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk if transferred or diverted to a producer-
handler;
    (2) As Class I milk if transferred to an exempt plant in the form of 
a packaged fluid milk product;
    (3) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator if transferred or diverted in the form of a bulk fluid 
milk product or a bulk fluid cream product to an exempt plant. For this 
purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and butterfat in each 
class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be assigned to the 
extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or an exempt plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream 
product, unless the following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in such handler's report of receipts and utilization 
filed pursuant Sec. 1007.30 for the month within which such transaction 
occurred; and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;

[[Page 202]]

    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal order 
from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk products 
from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder shall be 
assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plants from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plants from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that such 
transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk products 
from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-plant, 
shall be classified to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in this paragraph.
    (e) Transfers by a handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c) to pool 
plants. Skim milk and butterfat transferred in the form of bulk milk by 
a handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c) to another handler's pool plant 
shall be classified pursuant to Sec. 1007.44 pro rata with producer milk 
received at the transferee-handler's plant.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1007.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1007.40, 1007.41, and 1007.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class

[[Page 203]]

for a handler described in Sec. 1007.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by the 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1007.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association;
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignment 
under Sec. 1007.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1007.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler; and
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III use at the plant.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1007.9(a) for each pool plant of the handler 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c), by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to the utilization of such receipts 
by such handler as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1007.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1007.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1007.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was

[[Page 204]]

subject to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of 
another Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to, any product specified in Sec. 1007.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1007.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1007.40(b)(1) that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under any Federal milk order and from an exempt distributing 
plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is fully regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased a like amount. 
In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount;
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that

[[Page 205]]

the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated supply 
plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts remaining 
at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1007.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5), and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), (a)(8)(i), and (a)(8)(ii) of this section and that 
were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the 
same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be 
allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased a 
like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii) and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then

[[Page 206]]

from Class II, with respect to whichever of the following quantities 
represents the lower proportion of Class I milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1007.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds remaining in Class I after such 
proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk was 
received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1007.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c), subtract such excess from the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1007.9(c) in each class shall be the combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the 
computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1007.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the

[[Page 207]]

month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all 
handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the most current available 
data and shall be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Secs. 1007.43(d) and 1007.44 on the 
basis of such report (including any reclassification of inventories of 
bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests, the percentage of 
producer milk delivered by members of such association that was used in 
each class by each handler receiving such milk. For the purpose of this 
report the milk so received shall be prorated to each class in 
accordance with the total utilization of producer milk by such handler.

second preceding month plus $3.08.
    (b) The Class II price shall be the basic formula price for the 
second preceding month plus $.30.
    (c) The Class III price shall be the basic formula price for the 
month.
    (d) The Class III-A price for the month shall be the average Central 
States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as reported by the

<R05>
Sec. 1007.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1007.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:

[[Page 208]]

    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

    (3) For a plant located in the Missouri counties of Dunklin or 
Pemiscot, the adjustment shall be minus 53 cents.
    (4) For a plant located in the Texas counties of Bowie or Cass, the 
adjustment shall be zero.
    (5) For a plant located within another Federal order marketing area, 
other than in those counties specified in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and 
(4) of this section, the adjustment shall be determined by subtracting 
the Class I differential price in Zone 7 of this order

[[Page 209]]

from the Class I differential price, adjusted for the plant's location, 
under such other Federal order.
    (6) For a plant located outside the areas described in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (5) of this section, the adjustment shall be computed by 
multiplying 2.5 cents per 10 miles, or fraction thereof (by the shortest 
hard-surfaced highway distance as determined by the market 
administrator), from the nearer of Shreveport, Louisiana; Little Rock, 
Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; Jackson, Tennessee; Nashville, Tennessee; 
or Atlanta, Georgia, and subtracting that figure from the location 
adjustment applicable at Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, Jackson, 
Nashville, or Atlanta, as the case may be.
    (b) For fluid milk products transferred in bulk form from a pool 
plant to a pool distributing plant at which a higher Class I price 
applies and which are classified as Class I milk, the Class I price 
shall be the Class I price at the transferee-plant subject to a location 
adjustment credit for the transferor-plant which shall be determined by 
the market administrator for skim milk and butterfat, respectively, as 
follows:
    (1) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
the transferee-plant after the computations pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.44(a)(12) plus the pounds of skim milk in receipts of 
concentrated fluid milk products from other pool plants that are 
assigned to Class I use, an amount equal to:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of milk at the transferee-
plant from producers and handlers described in Sec. 1007.9(c); and
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products from other pool plants;
    (2) Assign any remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I at the 
transferee-plant to the skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products 
from other pool plants, first to the transferor-plants at which the 
highest Class I price applies and then to other plants in sequence 
beginning with the plant at which the next highest Class I price 
applies;
    (3) Compute the total amount of location adjustment credits to be 
assigned to transferor-plants by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk assigned pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section to each 
transferor-plant at which the Class I price is lower than the Class I 
price applicable at the transferor-plant and the transferee-plant, and 
add the resulting amounts;
    (4) Assign the total amount of location adjustment credits computed 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section to those transferor-plants 
that transferred fluid milk products containing skim milk classified as 
Class I milk pursuant to Sec. 1007.42(a) and at which the applicable 
Class I price is less than the Class I price at the transferee-plant, in 
sequence beginning with the plant at which the highest Class I price 
applies. Subject to the availability of such credits, the credit 
assigned to each plant shall be equal to the hundredweight of such Class 
I skim milk multiplied by the adjustment rate determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section for such plant. If the aggregate of 
this computation for all plants having the same adjustment as determined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section exceeds the credits that 
are available to those plants, such credits shall be prorated to the 
volume of skim milk in Class I in transfers from such plants; and
    (5) Location adjustment credit for butterfat shall be determined in 
accordance with the procedure outlined for skim milk in paragraphs (b) 
(1) through (4) of this section.
    (c) The market administrator shall determine and publicly announce 
the zone location of each plant of each handler. The market 
administrator shall notify the handler on or before the first day of any 
month in which a change in a plant location zone will apply.
    (d) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be 
adjusted at the rates set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, except 
that the adjusted Class I price shall not be less than the Class III 
price.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.53  Announcement of class prices.

    The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before the 
fifth day of each month the Class I price and Class II prices for the 
following month, and the Class III and Class III-A prices for the 
preceding month.

Sec. 1007.54  Equivalent price.

    If for any reason a price or pricing constituent required by this 
part for computing class prices or for other purposes is not available 
as prescribed in this part, the market administrator shall use a price 
or pricing constituent determined by the Secretary to be equivalent to 
the price or pricing constituent that is required.

                             Uniform Prices


<R05>
Sec. 1007.60  Handler's value of milk for computing the uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1007.9 (b) and (c) with respect to milk that 
was not received at a pool plant as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c) that were classified in each class 
pursuant to Secs. 1007.43(a) and 1007.44(c) by the applicable class 
prices, and add the resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1007.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1007.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1007.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1007.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1007.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants, and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1007.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1007.43(d) and Sec. 1007.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1007.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1007.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1007.76 (a)(5) or (c); and

[[Page 211]]

    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.61  Computation of uniform price (including weighted average price).

    (a) The market administrator shall compute the weighted average 
price for each month and the uniform price for each month per 
hundredweight of milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content as follows:
    (1) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.60 for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed in 
Sec. 1007.30 for the month and who made payments pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.71 for the preceding month;
    (2) Add not less than one-half the unobligated balance in the 
producer-settlement fund;
    (3) Add an amount equal to the total value of the minus adjustments 
and subtract an amount equal to the total value of the plus adjustments 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1007.75;
    (4) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations;
    (i) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (ii) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1007.60(f); and
    (5) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight. The resulting figure, rounded to the nearest cent, shall 
be the weighted average price for each month and the uniform price.

from such handler.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 12th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay to the market administrator the amount, if any, by 
which the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds 
the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1007.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) The value at the uniform price as adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.75, of such handler's receipts of producer milk and milk 
received from handlers pursuant to Sec. 1007.9(c); and

pooling shall pay to the market administrator an amount computed as 
follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is route disposition from 
such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide pool 
orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by the difference between the Class I price under this part 
applicable at the location of the other order plant (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price.

<R05>
Sec. 1007.72  Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

    On or before the 13th day after the end of each month, the market 
administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the 
amount computed pursuant to Sec. 1007.71(a)(2) exceeds the amount 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1007.71(a)(1). If, at such time, the balance 
in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments 
pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce 
uniformly such payments and shall complete such payments as soon as the 
funds are available.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.73  Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

    (a) Each handler shall pay each producer for producer milk for which 
payment is not made to a cooperative association pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section, as follows:
    (1) On or before the 26th day of each month, for milk received 
during the first 15 days of the month from such producer who has not 
discontinued delivery of milk to such handler before the 23rd day of the 
month at not less than the Class III price for the preceding month or 90 
percent of the weighted average price for the preceding month, whichever 
is higher, less proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer. 
If the producer had discontinued shipping milk to such handler before 
the 25th day of any month, the applicable rate for making payments to 
such producer shall be the Class III price for the preceding month; and
    (2) On or before the 15th day of the following month, an amount 
equal to not less than the uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to 
Secs. 1007.74 and 1007.75, multiplied by the hundredweight of milk 
received from such producer during the month, subject to the following 
adjustments:
    (i) Less payments made to such producer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section;
    (ii) Less deductions for marketing services made pursuant to

    (iv) Less proper deductions authorized in writing by such producer.
    (3) If a handler has not received full payment from the market 
administrator pursuant to Sec. 1007.72 by the 15th day of such month, 
such handler may reduce payments pursuant to this paragraph to producers 
on a pro rata basis but not by more than the amount of the underpayment. 
Such payments shall be completed thereafter not later than the date for 
making payments pursuant to this paragraph next following after receipt 
of the balance due from the market administrator.
    (b) On or before the day prior to the dates specified in paragraph

reduce payments pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to such 
cooperative association on a pro rata basis, prorating such underpayment 
to the volume of milk received from such cooperative association in 
proportion to the total milk received from producers by the handler, but 
not by more than the amount of the underpayment. Such payments shall be 
completed in the following manner:
    (1) If the handler receives full payment from the market 
administrator by the 15th day of the month, the handler shall make 
payment to the cooperative association of the full value of the 
underpayment on the 15th day of the month;
    (2) If the handler has not received full payment from the market 
administrator by the 15th day of the month, the handler shall make

    (2) On or before the 14th day of the following month, not less than 
the uniform price as adjusted pursuant to Secs. 1007.74 and 1007.75, and 
less any payments made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) If a handler has not received full payment from the market 
administrator pursuant to Sec. 1007.72 by the 14th day of such month,

Sec. 1007.76  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1007.30(b) and 1007.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be an amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(except that the Class I price and weighted average price shall not be 
less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:

[[Page 215]]

    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be computed to the extent possible 
to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant from 
pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are in Class I 
and for which a value is computed for the handler operating the 
partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1007.60 shall be 
priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price if such is 
provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of milk at the 
transferee plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the location of 
the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class price of the 
respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted skim milk in 
filled milk shall be priced at the lowest price class of the respective 
order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1007.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1007.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1007.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1007.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributed plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1007.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (A) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with its reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1007.30(b) and 
1007.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (B) The operator of such nonpool plant maintains books and records 
showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such 
plant which are made available if requested by the market administrator 
for verification purposes; and
    (C) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1007.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1007.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk had the 
plant been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1007.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1007.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but

[[Page 216]]

not less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever audit by the market administrator of any handler's reports, 
books, records, or accounts, or other verification discloses errors 
resulting in money due the market administrator from a handler, or due a 
handler from the market administrator, or due a producer or cooperative 
association from a handler, the market administrator shall promptly 
notify such handler of any amount so due and payment thereof shall be 
made on or before the next date for making payments as set forth in the 
provisions under which the error(s) occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.78  Charges on overdue accounts.

    Any unpaid obligation due the market administrator from a handler 
pursuant to Secs. 1007.71, 1007.76, 1007.77, 1007.78, 1007.81, 1007.85, 
and 1007.86 shall be increased 1.5 percent each month beginning with the 
day following the date such obligation was due under the order. Any 
remaining amount due shall be increased at the same rate on the 
corresponding day of each month until paid. The amounts payable pursuant 
to this section shall be computed monthly on each unpaid obligation and 
shall include any unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this 
section. The late charges shall be added to the respective accounts to 
which due. For the purpose of this section, any obligation that was 
determined at a date later than prescribed by the order because of a 
handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator when 
due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have 
been due if the report had been filed when due.

<R05>
Sec. 1007.80  Transportation credit balancing fund.

    The market administrator shall maintain a separate fund known as the 
Transportation Credit Balancing Fund into which shall be deposited the 
payments made by handlers pursuant to Sec. 1007.81 and out of which 
shall be made the payments due handlers pursuant to Sec. 1007.82. 
Payments due a handler shall be offset against payments due from the 
handler.

<R05>
Sec. 1007.81  Payments to the transportation credit balancing fund.

    (a) On or before the 12th day after the end of the month, each 
handler operating a pool plant and each handler specified in Sec. 1007.9 
(b) and (c) shall pay to the market administrator a transportation 
credit balancing fund assessment determined by multiplying the pounds of 
Class I producer milk assigned pursuant to Sec. 1007.44 by $0.07 per 
hundredweight or such lesser amount as the market administrator deems 
necessary to maintain a balance in the fund equal to the total 
transportation credits disbursed during the prior June-January period. 
In the event that during any month of the June-January period the fund 
balance is insufficient to cover the amount of credits that are due, the 
assessment should be based upon the amount of credits that would have 
been disbursed had the fund balance been sufficient.
    (b) The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before 
the 5th day of the month the assessment pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section for the following month.

<R05>
Sec. 1007.82  Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund.

    (a) Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund to 
handlers and cooperative associations requesting transportation credits 
shall be made as follows:
    (1) On or before the 13th day after the end of each of the months of 
July through December and any other month in which transportation 
credits are in effect pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the 
market administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and 
reported pursuant to Sec. 1007.30(a)(5), bulk milk transferred from an 
other order plant as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or 
that received, and reported pursuant to Sec. 1007.30(a)(6), milk 
directly from producers' farms as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, a preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of 
this section to the extent that funds are available in the 
transportation credit balancing fund. If an insufficient balance exists 
to pay all of the credits computed pursuant to this section, the market 
administrator shall distribute the balance available in the 
transportation credit balancing fund by reducing payments prorata using 
the percentage derived by dividing the balance in the fund by the total 
credits that are due for the month. The amount of credits resulting from 
this initial proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for 
transportation credits on or before the 20th day of the month following 
the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to 
Sec. 1007.32(a). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted 
by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary 
proration of transportation credit payments for the preceding month 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Handlers will be promptly 
notified of any payment adjustments based upon this final computation 
and remedial payments to or from the transportation credit balancing 
fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following 
month;
    (3) Transportation credits paid pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) and 
(2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market 
administrator pursuant to Sec. 1007.77. Adjusted payments to or from the 
transportation credit balancing fund will remain subject to the final 
proration established pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and
    (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the 
responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written 
documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator 
pursuant to Sec. 1007.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the 
transportation credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section 
shall be made to such cooperative association rather than to the 
operator of the pool plant at which the milk was received.
    (b) The market administrator may extend the period during which 
transportation credits are in effect (i.e., the transportation credit 
period) to the months of January and June if a written request to do so 
is received 15 days prior to the beginning of the month for which the 
request is made and, after conducting an independent investigation, 
finds that such extension is necessary to assure the market of an 
adequate supply of milk for fluid use. Before making such a finding, the 
market administrator shall notify the Director of the Dairy Division and 
all handlers in the market that an extension is being considered and 
invite written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to extend the 
transportation credit period must be issued in writing prior to the 
first day of the month for which the extension is to be effective.
    (c) Transportation credits shall apply to the following milk:
    (1) Bulk milk received from a plant regulated under another Federal 
order, except Federal Orders 1005, 1011, and 1046, allocated to Class I 
milk pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a)(12); and
    (2) Bulk milk received directly from the farms of dairy farmers at 
pool distributing plants subject to the following conditions:
    (i) The quantity of such milk that shall be eligible for the 
transportation

[[Page 218]]

credit shall be determined by multiplying the total pounds of milk 
received from producers meeting the conditions of this paragraph by the 
lower of:
    (A) The marketwide estimated Class I utilization of all handlers for 
the month pursuant to Sec. 1007.45(a); or
    (B) The Class I utilization of all producer milk of the pool plant 
operator receiving the milk after the computations described in 
Sec. 1007.44;
    (ii) The dairy farmer was not a ``producer'' under this order during 
more than 2 of the immediately preceding months of January through June 
and not more than 50 percent of the production of the dairy farmer 
during those 2 months, in aggregate, was received as producer milk under 
this order during those 2 months. However, if January and/or June are 
months in which transportation credits are disbursed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, these months shall not be included in the 
2-month limit provided in this paragraph; and
    (iii) The farm on which the milk was produced is not located within 
the specified marketing area of this order or the marketing areas of 
Federal Orders 1005, 1011, or 1046, or within the Kentucky counties of 
Allen, Barren, Metcalfe, Monroe, Simpson, and Warren.
    (d) Transportation credits shall be computed as follows:
    (1) The market administrator shall subtract from the pounds of milk 
described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section the pounds of 
bulk milk transferred from the pool plant receiving the supplemental 
milk if milk was transferred to a nonpool plant on the same calendar day 
that the supplemental milk was received. For this purpose, the 
transferred milk shall be subtracted from the most distant load of 
supplemental milk received, and then in sequence with the next most 
distant load until all of the transfers have been offset;
    (2) With respect to the pounds of milk described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section that remain after the computations described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the market administrator shall:
    (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the 
shipping plant and the receiving plant;
    (ii) Multiply the number of miles so determined by 0.35 cent;
    (iii) Subtract the other order's Class I price applicable at the 
shipping plant's location from the Class I price applicable at the 
receiving plant as specified in Sec. 1007.52;
    (iv) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section; and
    (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this 
section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(2) 
introductory text of this section.
    (3) For the remaining milk described in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section after computations described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, the market administrator shall:
    (i) Determine an origination point for each load of milk by locating 
the nearest city to the last producer's farm from which milk was picked 
up for delivery to the receiving pool plant. Alternatively, the milk 
hauler that is transporting the milk of producers described in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section may establish an origination point following the 
last farm pickup by stopping at the nearest independently-operated truck 
stop with a certified truck scale and obtaining a weight certificate 
indicating the weight of the truck and its contents, the date and time 
of weighing, and the location of the truck stop;
    (ii) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between 
the receiving pool plant and the truck stop or city, as the case may be;
    (iii) Subtract 85 miles from the mileage so determined;
    (iv) Multiply the remaining miles so computed by 0.35 cent;
    (v) If the origination point determined pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section is in a Federal order marketing area, subtract 
the Class I price applicable at the origination point pursuant to the 
provisions of such other order (as if the origination point were a plant 
location) from the Class I price applicable at the distributing plant 
receiving the milk. If the origination

[[Page 219]]

point is not in any Federal order marketing area, determine the Class I 
price at the origination point based upon the provisions of this order 
and subtract this price from the Class I price applicable at the 
distributing plant receiving the milk;
    (vi) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph 
(d)(3)(v) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv) of this section; and
    (vii) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(3)(vi) by the 
hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(3) introductory text of 
this section.

        Administrative Assessment and Marketing Service Deduction


<R05>
Sec. 1007.85  Assessment for order administration.

    As each handler's pro rata share of the expense of administration of 
the order, each handler shall pay to the market administrator on or 
before the 15th day after the end of the month 5 cents per hundredweight 
or such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe with respect to:
    (a) Receipts of producer milk (including such handler's own 
production) other than such receipts by a handler described in 
Sec. 1007.9(c) that were delivered to pool plants of other handlers;
    (b) Receipts from a handler described in Sec. 1007.9(c);
    (c) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I 
use pursuant to Sec. 1007.43(d) and other source milk allocated to Class 
I pursuant to Sec. 1007.44(a) (7) and (11) and the corresponding steps 
of Sec. 1007.44(b), except such other source milk that is excluded from 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1007.60 (d) and (f); and
    (d) Route disposition in the marketing area from a partially 
regulated distributing plant that exceeds the skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted pursuant to Sec. 1007.76(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1007.86  Deduction for marketing services.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section each 
handler, in making payments to producers for milk (other than milk of 
such handler's own production) pursuant to Sec. 1007.73, shall deduct 7 
cents per hundredweight or such lesser amount as the Secretary may 
prescribe and shall pay such deductions to the market administrator not 
later than the 15th day after the month. Such money shall be used by the 
market administrator to verify or establish weights, samples and tests 
of producer milk and provide market information for producers who are 
not receiving such services from a cooperative association. Such 
services shall be performed in whole or in part by the market 
administrator or an agent engaged by and responsible to the market 
administrator;
    (b) In the case of producers for whom a cooperative association that 
the Secretary has determined is actually performing the services set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall make, in lieu 
of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this section, such 
deductions from the payments to be made to such producers as may be 
authorized by the membership agreement or marketing contract between 
such cooperative association and such producers, and on or before the 
15th day after the end of the month, pay such deductions to the 
cooperative association rendering such services accompanied by a 
statement showing the amount of any such deductions and the amount of 
milk for which such deduction was computed for each producer.

Sec. 1012.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in 
the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a 
pool plant to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk 
unless the operators of both plants request the same classification in 
another class. In either case, the classification of such transfers 
shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1012.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1012.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1012.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1012.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1012.44(a)(11) or (a)(12) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1012.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk

[[Page 228]]

to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1012.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat in the 
following forms that is transferred from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1012.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are

[[Page 229]]

made available for verification purposes if requested by the market 
administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that

milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class at each pool plant.
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk used or disposed of in such product 
shall be considered to be a quantity equivalent to the nonfat milk 
solids contained in such product plus all the water originally 
associated with such solids.

    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1012.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1012.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1012.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by

Sec. 1012.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1012.9(a) for each of the handler's pool plants separately and of 
each handler described in Sec. 1012.9(b) and (c) by allocating the 
handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to such handler's 
utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1012.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I the remainder of such receipts.
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1012.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1012.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(5) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to, any product specified in Sec. 1012.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1012.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II; and
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except

[[Page 231]]

other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated fluid milk 
product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, packaged 
inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified in 
Sec. 1012.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) of this section which are 
in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant 
and that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this 
section, if Class II or Class III classification is requested by the 
operator of the other order plant and the handler, but not in excess of 
the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1012.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the

[[Page 232]]

month that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) 
and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that 
were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the 
same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be 
allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (a)(8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1012.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler):
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool

[[Page 233]]

plants at which such other source milk was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1012.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as overage;
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1012.60  Handler's value of milk for computing the uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1012.9 (b) and (c) as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk in each class as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1012.44(c) by the applicable class prices and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1012.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1012.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1012.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1012.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1012.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1012.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1012.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1012.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1012.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1012.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1012.43(d) and Sec. 1012.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1012.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1012.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1012.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1012.76(b)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk

unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the plant during the 
prior month.

Sec. 1012.61  Computation of uniform price.

    For each month, the market administrator shall compute a uniform 
price for milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1012.60 for all handlers who filed the reports pursuant to 
Sec. 1012.30 for the month, except those in default of payments required 
pursuant to Sec. 1012.71 for the preceding month;
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Add an amount equal to the total value of the minus location 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1012.75;
    (d) Subtract an amount equal to the total value of the plus location 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1012.75;
    (e) Add an amount equal to one-half the unobligated balance in the 
producer-settlement fund;
    (f) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1012.60(f); and
    (g) Subtract not less than four cents nor more than five cents per 
hundredweight.

Sec. 1012.72  Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

    On or before the 13th day after the end of each month, the market 
administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the 
amount computed pursuant to Sec. 1012.71(a)(2) exceeds the amount 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1012.71(a)(1). If, at such time, the balance

preceding month per hundredweight of milk received during the first 15 
days of the month, less proper deductions authorized in writing by such 
producer;
    (2) On or before the 5th day of the following month to each producer 
who had not discontinued shipping milk to such handler before the last

amount of such underpayment. Payment to producers shall be completed 
thereafter not later than the date for making payments pursuant to this 
paragraph next following after receipt of the balance due from the 
market administrator.
    (b) In the case of a cooperative association which the market

Sec. 1012.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund 
on or before the 25th day after the end of the month either of the 
amounts (at the handler's election) calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section. If the handler fails to report pursuant to 
Secs. 1012.30 and 1012.31(b) the information necessary to compute the 
amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall pay the 
amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) The obligation that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1012.60 at such plant shall be determined as though such plant were 
a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Receipts at such nonpool plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be assigned to the utilization at which classified at 
the pool plant or other order plant;
    (ii) Transfers from such nonpool plant to a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be classified in the class to which allocated at the 
pool plant or other order plant. Class I milk transferred from such 
nonpool plant to pool plants and other order plants shall be valued at 
the uniform price of the respective order, except that reconstituted 
skim milk (including that in filled milk), and milk or skim milk from 
producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order shall be valued 
at the Class II price. No obligation shall apply to Class I milk 
transferred to a pool plant or an other order plant if such Class I 
utilization is assigned to receipts at the partially regulated 
distributing plant from pool plants and other order plants at which such 
milk was classified and priced as Class I milk;
    (iii) Such handler's obligation shall include any charges computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1012.60(f) and any credits computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1012.71(a)(2)(ii) with respect to receipts of Class I milk from an 
unregulated supply plant, except that the credit for receipts of 
reconstituted skim milk (including that in filled milk), and milk or 
skim milk from producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order 
shall be at the Class II price, unless an obligation with respect to 
such plant is computed as specified in (a)(1)(iv) of this section;

[[Page 240]]

    (iv) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests and provides with his report pursuant to Sec. 1012.30 a 
similar report for each nonpool plant which serves as a supply plant for 
such partially regulated distributing plant by shipment to such plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1012.7(b) with 
agreement of the operator of such plant that the market administrator 
may examine the books and records of such plant for purposes of 
verification of such reports, there will be added the amount of the 
obligation computed at such nonpool supply plant in the same manner and 
subject to the same conditions as for the partially regulated 
distributing plant.
    (2) From this obligation, deduct the sum of:
    (i) The gross payments made by such handler, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1012.74, for Grade A milk received during the month from dairy 
farmers at such plant and like payments made by the operator of a supply 
plant(s) included in the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Payments to the producer-settlement fund of another order under 
which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant.
    (b) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area;
    (2) Deduct the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
received at the partially regulated distributing plant as follows:
    (i) Any Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that deducted under a similar provision of another order issued pursuant 
to the Act; and
    (ii) Receipts from a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat 
disposed of to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any 
order issued pursuant to the Act is classified and priced as Class I 
milk and is not used as an offset on any other payment obligation 
pursuant to any other order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant and milk or skim milk contained in receipts from 
producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order disposed of as 
route disposition in the marketing area;
    (4) Combine the amounts of skim milk and butterfat remaining into 
one total;
    (5) From the value of such milk at the Class I price applicable at 
the location of the nonpool plant, subtract its value at the uniform 
price applicable at such location, and add the amount obtained from 
multiplying the pounds of labeled reconstituted milk included in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section by the difference between the Class I 
price applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant less $1.00 (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the 
Class III price. For any reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the 
Class I price shall not be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such 
disposition, payments may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order regulating the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients at the difference between the Class I price applicable under 
the other order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk 
ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) 
and the Class III price. This payment option shall apply only if a 
majority of the total milk received at the plant that processed the 
nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders 
and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the 
nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1012.43(d). Payments

[[Page 241]]

may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1013.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in 
the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a 
pool plant to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk 
unless the operators of both plants request the same classification in 
another class. In either case, the classification of such transfers 
shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1013.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1013.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1013.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1013.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1013.44(a)(11) or (a)(12) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1013.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if 
the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the

[[Page 251]]

other classes shall be classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1013.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat in the 
following forms that is transferred from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1013.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:

[[Page 252]]

    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

Sec. 1013.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1013.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month, the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors, the reports submitted by each 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1013.30(a) and compute the total pounds of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in Class I milk, Class II milk, and 
Class III milk at each pool plant.
    (b) The skim milk contained in any product utilized, produced or 
disposed of by the handler during the month shall be considered to be an 
amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such product, 
plus all of the water originally associated with such solids.
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1013.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1013.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1013.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

Sec. 1013.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1013.9(a) for each of the handler's pool plants separately and of 
each handler described in Sec. 1013.9 (b) and (c) by allocating the 
handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to such handler's 
utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1013.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is

[[Page 253]]

not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I the remainder of such receipts.
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1013.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1013.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(5) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to, any product specified in Sec. 1013.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1013.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1013.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) of this section which are 
in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds

[[Page 254]]

of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk unconcentrated 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
unconcentrated fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant 
and that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this 
section, if Class II or Class III classification is requested by the 
operator of the other order plant and the handler, but not in excess of 
the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1013.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that 
were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the 
same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be 
allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall

[[Page 255]]

be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (a)(8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1013.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler):
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream

[[Page 256]]

products from another pool plant according to the classification of such 
products pursuant to Sec. 1013.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as overage;
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

order plants pursuant to Sec. 1013.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step 
of Sec. 1013.44(b), the market administrator shall estimate and publicly 
announce the utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) in each class 
during the month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer 
milk of all handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the most current 
available data and shall be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1013.43(d) and Sec. 1013.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests the percentage of 
producer milk delivered by members of such association which was used in 
each class by each handler receiving such milk. For the purpose of this 
report, the milk so received shall be prorated to each class in 
accordance with the total utilization of producer milk by such handler.

    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.

of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most

handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1013.9 (b) and (c) as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk in each class as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1013.44(c) by the applicable class prices and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1013.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1013.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1013.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1013.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1013.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between

subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1013.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1013.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1013.43(d) and Sec. 1013.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1013.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1013.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1013.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1013.76(b)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1013.75;
    (d) Add an amount equal to one-half of the unobligated balance in 
the producer-settlement fund;
    (e) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and

pool plant or other order plant. Class I milk transferred from such 
nonpool plant to pool plants and other order plants shall be valued at 
the uniform price of the respective order, except that reconstituted 
skim milk (including that in filled milk), and milk or skim milk from 
producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order shall be valued 
at the Class II price. No obligation shall apply to Class I milk 
transferred to a pool plant or an other order plant if such Class I 
utilization is assigned to receipts at the partially regulated 
distributing plant from pool plants and other order plants at which such 
milk was classified and priced as Class I milk;
    (iii) Such handler's obligation shall include any charges computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1013.60(f) and any credits computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1013.71(a)(2)(ii) with respect to receipts of Class I milk from an 
unregulated supply plant, except that the credit for receipts of 
reconstituted skim milk (including that in filled milk), and milk or 
skim milk from producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any order 
shall be at the Class II price, unless an obligation with respect to 
such plant is computed as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
section;
    (iv) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, and provides with his reports pursuant to Secs. 1013.30 and 
1013.31(b) similar reports for each nonpool plant which serves as a 
supply plant for such partially regulated distributing plant by 
shipments to such plant during the month equivalent to the requirements 
of Sec. 1013.7(b) with agreement of the operator of such plant that the 
market administrator may examine the books and records of such plant for 
purposes of verification of such reports, there will be added the amount 
of the obligation computed at such nonpool supply plant in the same 
manner and subject to the same conditions as for the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (2) From this obligation, there will be deducted the sum of:
    (i) The gross payments made by such handler, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1013.74, for Grade A milk received during the month from dairy 
farmers at such plant and like payments made by the operator of a supply 
plant(s) included in the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Payments to the producer-settlement fund of another order under 
which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant.
    (b) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
disposed of

[[Page 263]]

as route disposition in the marketing area;
    (2) Deduct the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
received at the partially regulated distributing plant as follows:
    (i) Any Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that deducted under a similar provision of another order issued pursuant 
to the Act; and
    (ii) Receipts from a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat 
disposed of to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any 
order issued pursuant to the Act is classified and priced as Class I 
milk and is not used as an offset on any other payment obligation 
pursuant to any other order;
    (3) Deduct from any remainder the pounds of reconstituted milk that 
are made from nonfluid milk products and milk or skim milk contained in 
receipts from producer-handlers and exempt plants defined in any other 
order, which are then disposed of as route disposition in the marketing 
area from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (4) Combine the amounts of skim milk and butterfat remaining into 
one total; and
    (5) From the value of such milk at the Class I price applicable at 
the location of the nonpool plant, subtract its value at the uniform 
price applicable at such location, and add the amount obtained from 
multiplying the pounds of labeled reconstituted milk included in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section by the difference between the Class I 
price applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant less $1.00 (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the 
Class III price. For any reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the 
Class I price shall not be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such 
disposition, payments may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order regulating the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients at the difference between the Class I price applicable under 
the other order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk 
ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) 
and the Class III price. This payment option shall apply only if a 
majority of the total milk received at the plant that processed the 
nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders 
and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the 
nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1013.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

records, or accounts or other verification discloses errors resulting in 
moneys due (a) the market administrator from a handler, (b) a handler 
from the market administrator, or (c) any producer or cooperative 
association from a handler, the market administrator shall promptly 
notify such handler of

[[Page 264]]

any amount so due and payment thereof shall be made on or before the 
next date for making payments set forth in the provisions under which 
such error occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 1013.78  Charges on overdue accounts.

    Any unpaid obligation of a handler pursuant to Sec. 1013.71, 
1013.73, 1013.76, 1013.77, 1013.85, or 1013.86 shall be increased 1 
percent for each month or portion thereof that such obligation is 
overdue, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
charges previously computed pursuant to this section;
    (b) For the purposes of this section, any obligation that was 
determined at a date later than prescribed by the order because of a 
handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator when 
due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have 
been due if the report had been filed when due; and
    (c) All monies collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to 
the administrative assessment fund maintained by the market 
administrator.

        Administrative Assessment and Marketing Service Deduction


<R05>
Sec. 1013.85  Assessment for order administration.

    (a) As his pro rata share of the expense of administration of the 
order, each handler shall pay to the market administrator on or before 
the 15th day after the end of the month 4 cents per hundredweight or 
such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe, with respect to:
    (1) Producer milk (including such handler's own production);
    (2) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I 
use pursuant to Sec. 1013.43(d) and other source milk allocated to Class 
I pursuant to Sec. 1013.44 (a)(6), (a)(7), and (a)(11) and the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1013.44(b), except such other source milk 
that is excluded from the computations pursuant to Sec. 1013.60 (d) and 
(f); and
    (3) Class I milk disposed of in the marketing area from a partially 
regulated distributing plant that exceeds the hundredweight of Class I 
milk:
    (i) Received during the month at such plant from pool plants and 
other order plants that is not used as an offset under a similar 
provision of another order issued pursuant to the Act; and
    (ii) Specified in Sec. 1013.76(b)(2)(ii).
    (b) With respect to payments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, if a handler uses more than one accounting period in a month, 
the rate of payment per hundredweight for such handler shall be the rate 
for monthly accounting periods multiplied by the number of accounting 
periods in the month, or such lesser rate as the Secretary may determine 
is demonstrated as appropriate in terms of the particular costs of 
administering the additional accounting periods.

Sec. 1013.86  Deduction for marketing services.

    (a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
handler, in making payments to producers for milk pursuant to

amount as may be prescribed by the Secretary and shall pay such 
deductions to the market administrator on or before the 15th day after 
the end of the month. Such money shall be used by the market 
administrator to provide market information and to check the accuracy of 
the testing and weighing of their milk for producers who are not 
receiving such services from a cooperative association pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (b) In the case of producers who are members of a cooperative 
association which the Secretary has determined is actually performing 
the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, each handler 
shall (in lieu of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section) make such deductions from the payments to be made to producers

[[Page 265]]

as may be authorized by the membership agreement or marketing contract 
between the cooperative association and its members. On or before the 
15th day after the end of each month, the handler shall pay the 
aggregate amount of such deductions to the cooperative association, 
furnishing a statement showing the amount of the deductions and the 
quantity of milk on which the deduction was computed for each producer.

requirements.
    (3) The operator of a supply plant may include as qualifying 
shipments deliveries to pool distributing plants directly from farms of 
producers pursuant to Sec. 1030.13(d).
    (4) The quantity of condensed skim milk and fluid milk products

described in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section that shall count 
towards meeting the shipping requirements of this paragraph shall be a

quantity shall be computed by subtracting from the quantity of fluid 
milk products and condensed skim milk received from supply plants the 
following:
    (i) The quantity of condensed skim milk not disposed of in a fluid 
milk product and the quantity of fluid milk products in the form of bulk 
milk and skim milk moved from the pool distributing plant to pool supply 
plants plus any such bulk shipments to nonpool plants as Class II or 
Class III milk other than:
    (A) Transfers or diversions classified pursuant to 
Sec. 1030.40(b)(3); and
    (B) Transfers or diversions on New Year's Day, Memorial Day, July 4, 
Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and on any Saturday if no milk is 
received at the pool distributing plant from a supply plant, in an 
amount not in excess of 120 percent of the average daily receipts of 
producer milk pursuant to Sec. 1030.13(a) at the plant during the prior 
month, less the quantity of producer milk diverted pursuant to 
Sec. 1030.13(d) on such day. If no producer milk was received in the 
distributing plant during the prior month, the average daily receipts 
during the current month shall be used for this purpose; and
    (ii) If milk is diverted from the pool distributing plant on the 
date of the receipts from the supply plant, the quantity so diverted, 
except any diversion of milk (not to exceed 3 days' production of any 
individual producer) made because of any emergency situation such as a 
breakdown of trucking equipment or hazardous road conditions if such 
emergency is reported to the market administrator.
    (5) The shipping requirements of this paragraph may be increased or 
decreased if found necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent 
uneconomic shipments as follows, subject in either case to the 
conditions specified to paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (i) The market administrator may, for a period of up to three 
months, increase or decrease the shipping requirements of this paragraph 
by up to two percentage points;
    (ii) The Director of the Dairy Division may increase the shipping 
requirements of this paragraph by up to five percentage points or 
decrease them by up to ten percentage points;
    (iii) Before making a finding that a change is necessary for the 
purposes set forth in this section, the market administrator or the 
Director of the Dairy Division shall investigate the need for revision, 
either on such person's own initiative or at the request of interested 
persons. If such investigation shows that a revision might be 
appropriate, a notice shall be issued stating that revision is being 
considered and inviting data, views, and arguments. If a plant that 
would not otherwise qualify as a pool plant during the month does 
qualify as a pool plant because of a reduction in shipping requirements 
pursuant to this paragraph, such plant shall be a nonpool plant for such 
month if the operator of the plant files a written request for nonpool 
status with the market administrator on or before the first day of the 
following month. If an increase is required in any month of February 
through July, the increase shall also apply to any supply plant that has 
pool status for the month pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (6) Two or more plants shall be considered a unit for the purpose of 
meeting the requirements of this paragraph if the following conditions 
are met:
    (i) The plants are located within the State of Wisconsin or within 
that portion of the State of Illinois within the marketing area;
    (ii) The plants included in the unit are owned or fully leased and 
operated

[[Page 269]]

by the handler establishing the unit and such plants were pool plants 
during the month prior to being included in a unit. Two or more handlers 
may establish a unit of designated plants by certifying to the market 
administrator a marketing agreement specifying the plants to be 
considered as a unit, and specifying which handler will be responsible 
for qualification of the unit. With regard to any leased plants included 
in a unit, the handler that leases a plant(s) and is a party to a 
marketing agreement with respect to plants included in a unit, shall 
satisfy the market administrator that such handler:
    (A) Is responsible pursuant to Sec. 1030.73 for payments to 
producers whose milk is delivered to the leased plant or diverted 
therefrom by the handler;
    (B) Controls and operates the leased plant; and
    (C) Maintains in its books and records the accounts of the leased 
plant(s), including, but not limited to, records reflecting the receipt, 
sale, collection of proceeds, the gross value of the payrolls for all 
producer milk pooled by the handler operating the leased plant, and 
employee payroll or independent contractor records reflecting the 
handler's financial responsibility for operation of the plant.
    (iii) The handler or handlers establishing the unit submits a 
written request to the market administrator on or before July 15 
requesting that such plants qualify as a unit for the period of August 
through July of the following year. In the months of February through 
July, a unit shall not include any plant that was not a pool plant each 
month of the preceding period of August through January. Each plant that 
qualifies as a pool plant within a unit shall continue each month as a 
plant in the unit through the following July unless the plant 
subsequently fails to qualify for pooling or the handler or handlers 
establishing the unit submits a written request to the market 
administrator that the plant be deleted from the unit or that the unit 
be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from a unit, or that 
has failed to qualify in any month, will not be part of the unit for the 
remaining months through July. The handler or handlers that establish a 
unit may add a plant operated by such handler or handlers to a unit, if 
such plant has been a pool plant each prior month of the current unit-
operating period (August through July) and would otherwise be eligible 
to be in a unit, upon submission of a written request to the market 
administrator. Such plant will remain in the unit through the following 
July. Written requests to the market administrator to either delete a 
plant from the unit or to add a plant to the unit shall be submitted to 
the market administrator on or before the 15th day of the month 
preceding the month that such change will be effective. In the event of 
an ownership change or business failure of a handler that is a 
participant in a unit, the unit may be reorganized to reflect such 
changes by submitting a written request to file a new marketing 
agreement with the market administrator;
    (iv) If a unit fails to qualify under the requirements of this 
paragraph, the handler responsible for qualifying the unit shall notify 
the market administrator which plant or plants will be deleted from the 
unit so that the remaining plants may be pooled as a unit. If the 
handler fails to do so, the market administrator shall exclude one or 
more plants, beginning at the bottom of the list of plants in the unit 
and continuing up the list as necessary until the deliveries are 
sufficient to qualify the remaining plants in the unit; and
    (v) Each plant in a unit shall ship to a plant or plants pursuant to 
paragraph (a) or (c) of this section not less than 3 percent of the 
plant's receipts of milk from producers or 47,000 pounds, whichever is 
less, of condensed skim milk or fluid milk products in each of five 
months during the period of August through January, subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If the unit shipping 
requirements are reduced to zero pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of 
this section, shipments by each plant in a unit shall not be required.
    (c) Any plant that qualifies as a pool plant in each of the 
immediately preceding three months pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section or the shipping percentages in paragraph (b) of this section 
that is unable to meet such

[[Page 270]]

performance standards for the current month because of unavoidable 
circumstances determined by the market administrator to be beyond the 
control of the handler operating the plant, such as a natural disaster 
(ice storm, wind storm, flood), fire, breakdown of equipment, or work 
stoppage, shall be considered to have met the minimum performance 
standards during the period of such unavoidable circumstances, but such 
relief shall not be granted for more than two consecutive months.
    (d) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant or exempt distributing plant;
    (2) A plant that is fully subject to the pricing and pooling 
provisions of another order issued pursuant to the Act, unless it is 
qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this 
section and a greater volume of fluid milk products, except filled milk, 
is disposed of from such plant in this marketing area as route 
disposition and to pool plants qualified on the basis of route 
disposition in this marketing area than is so disposed of in the 
marketing area regulated pursuant to such other order; and
    (3) That portion of a plant that is physically separated from the 
Grade A portion of such plant, and is not approved by any regulatory 
agency for the receiving, processing, or packaging of any fluid milk 
product for Grade A disposition.

Sec. 1030.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1030.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant (or at all of a handler's supply plants 
and/or reserve supply plants combined or at all of a handler's 
distributing plants combined if such reports are filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1030.30) to the respective quantities of skim milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph;

    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1030.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that if the 
operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such milk 
on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm and 
butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the applicable 
percentage under this subparagraph shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

Sec. 1030.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred or 
diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream 
product from a pool plant to another pool plant (or to the pool plant of 
another handler if a combined report is filed pursuant to Sec. 1030.30 
by the transferor-handler) shall be classified as Class I milk unless 
the operators of both plants request the same classification in another 
class. The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1030.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1030.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1030.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to 
exempt distributing plants. Skim milk or butterfat in the following 
forms that is transferred from a pool plant to a producer-handler under 
this or any other Federal order or transferred or diverted from a pool 
plant to an exempt distributing plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or an exempt distributing plant shall be classified:

[[Page 278]]

    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1030.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified

[[Page 279]]

on the basis of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment 
priorities at the second plant that are set forth in this subparagraph.

Sec. 1030.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1030.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1030.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant (or 
plants, if applicable) and for each cooperative association with respect 
to milk for which it is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1030.9 (b) or (c) 
the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class in 
accordance with Secs. 1030.40, 1030.41, and 1030.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1030.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1030.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1030.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

<R05>
Sec. 1030.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in Sec. 1030.9 
(a), (b), and (c) by allocating the handler's receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat to his utilization pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (c) of 
this section. For this purpose only, a handler described in 
Sec. 1030.9(a) who operates more than one pool plant may elect to have 
his receipts allocated for each of his pool plants separately or for all 
of his pool plants combined, except that, if he has receipts that would 
be allocated pursuant to paragraph (a) (11) or (12) of this section or 
the corresponding steps of paragraph (b) of this section, his total 
receipts shall be allocated for all of his pool plants combined.
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1030.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; and
    (ii) Receipts of exempt milk;
    (iii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable

[[Page 280]]

provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately preceding 
month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1030.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1030.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1030.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1030.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1030.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from an exempt 
distributing plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (vii) Receipts of fluid milk products (other than exempt milk) from 
a government which has elected nonproducer status for the month pursuant 
to Sec. 1030.19; and
    (viii) Receipts of fluid milk products from persons described in 
Sec. 1030.12(b)(5);
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III, but not in excess of such quantities, the pounds of skim milk 
in each of the following;
    (i) Receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant 
that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a) (2)(i) and (7)(v) of 
this section:
    (A) For which the handler requests a classification other than Class 
I; or
    (B) Which are in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined by 
multiplying the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I (excluding any 
duplication of Class I utilization resulting from reported Class I 
transfers between pool plants of the handler) by 1.25 and subtracting 
the sum of the pounds of skim milk in receipts of producer milk, fluid

[[Page 281]]

milk products from other pool plants, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(iv) of this section; and
    (ii) Receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an other order plant 
that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted 
to such plant and that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II or Class III classification is 
requested by the operator of the other order plant and the handler;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1030.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(iii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
pro rata to such quantities in Class I and in Class II and Class III 
combined (excluding any duplication of utilization in each class 
resulting from transfers between pool plants of the handler), with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, the pounds of skim milk in 
receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant that 
were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a) (2)(i), (7)(v), and 
(8)(i) of this section and that were not offset by transfers or 
diversions of fluid milk products to the same unregulated supply plant 
from which fluid milk products to be allocated at this step were 
received;
    (12) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a) (7)(vi) and (8)(ii) of this 
section:
    (i) From each class, in series beginning with Class III, the pounds 
determined by multiplying the pounds of such net receipts by the larger 
of the percentage of estimated combined Class II and Class III 
utilization of skim milk announced for the month by the market 
administrator pursuant to Sec. 1030.45(a) or the percentage that the 
combined Class II and Class III utilization remaining is of the total 
remaining utilization of skim milk of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler); and
    (ii) From Class I, the remainder of such receipts;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from other pool plants (or from pool plants of 
other handlers if Sec. 1030.43(d) applies) according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1030.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1030.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1030.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1030.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the

[[Page 282]]

utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the 
month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all 
handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the most current available 
data and shall be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1030.43(d) and Sec. 1030.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 17th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association, upon request by such association, the 
percentage of the milk caused to be delivered by the cooperative 
association for its members which was utilized in each class at each 
pool plant receiving such milk. For the purpose of this report, the milk 
so received shall be allocated to each class at each pool plant in the 
same ratio as all producer milk received at such plant during the month.

Class III-A prices (this price may be negative).
    (h) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded 
to the nearest cent, shall be the Class III price less an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35.
    (i) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class III price plus an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 965 and dividing 
the resulting amount by one hundred.
    (j) Protein price. The protein price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be 1.32 times the average monthly 
price per pound for 40-pound block Cheddar cheese on the National Cheese 
Exchange as reported by the Department.
    (k) Other solids price. Other solids are herein defined as solids-
not-fat other than protein. The other solids price per

[[Page 283]]

pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the basic 
formula price at test less the average butterfat test of the basic 
formula price as reported by the Department times the butterfat price, 
less the average protein test of the basic formula price as reported by 
the Department for the month times the protein price, and dividing the 
resulting amount by the average other solids test of the basic formula 
price as reported by the Department. If the resulting price is less than 
zero, then the protein price will be reduced so that the other solids 
price equals zero.
    (l) Somatic cell adjustment. (1) The somatic cell adjustment rate 
per 1,000 somatic cells, rounded to five decimal places, shall be 
computed by multiplying .0005 times the monthly cheddar cheese price as 
defined in paragraph (j) of this section; and
    (2) The somatic cell adjustment, per hundredweight, shall be 
determined by subtracting from 350 the somatic cell count (in thousands) 
of the milk, multiplying the difference by the somatic cell adjustment 
rate, and rounding to the nearest full cent.

Sec. 1030.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1030.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values

[[Page 284]]

determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by determining the 
relative proportion that the data included in each of the following 
paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in paragraphs (d)(1) 
and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk and;
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined

    (b) For the purpose of this section and Secs. 1030.55 and 1030.75, 
the distances to be computed shall be on the basis of the shortest 
highway mileage as determined by the market administrator--with 
fractions rounded up to the next whole mile.
    (1) The market administrator shall notify each handler of the zone 
or mileage determination from the city hall in Chicago for each plant 
and for each handler's pool distributing plant the mileage to each 
transferor pool plant.
    (2) Mileage determinations are subject to redetermination at all 
times. In the event a handler requests a redetermination of the mileage 
pertaining to any plant, the market administrator shall notify the 
handler of such redetermination within 30 days after the receipt of such 
request. Any financial obligations resulting from a change in mileage 
shall not be retroactive for any period prior to the redetermination 
announced by the market administrator.
    (c) A handler who operates a pool distributing plant (or plants) 
shall receive a location adjustment computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the aggregate quantity of Class I milk, excluding 
beginning inventory of packaged fluid milk products, at such plant (or 
all pool plants of such handler for which the handler's total receipts 
are allocated for all such handler's pool plants combined pursuant to 
Secs. 1030.43(d) and 1030.44 after eliminating duplication for transfer 
between such plants);

[[Page 285]]

    (2) Subtract the receipts of exempt milk and the quantity of 
packaged fluid milk products received at the handler's pool plant(s) 
from the pool plants of other handlers (or other pool plants, if 
applicable) and from nonpool plants if assigned to Class I milk;
    (3) Subtract the quantity of bulk fluid milk products shipped from 
the handler's pool plant(s) to pool plants of other handlers (or other 
pool plants, if applicable) and to nonpool plants that are classified as 
Class I;
    (4) Subtract the Class I milk packaged by pool supply plants and 
disposed of as route disposition or to other plants;
    (5) Subtract the quantity of bulk fluid milk products received at 
the handler's pool plant(s) from other order plants and unregulated 
supply plants that are assigned to Class I pursuant to Secs. 1030.43(d) 
and 1030.44;
    (6) Assign the remaining quantity pro rata to receipts during the 
month from each source as specified in paragraphs (c)(6) (i) and (ii) of 
this section:
    (i) Receipts at the handler's pool distributing plant(s) of producer 
milk, except that if the quantity prorated to any distributing plant 
exceeds the Class I disposition from such plant, such quantity shall be 
reduced to the amount of such Class I disposition and the quantity of 
milk represented in such reduction shall be prorated to receipts of 
producer milk at other distributing plants of the handler (limited in 
each instance to the amount of Class I disposition at each such plant) 
and receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such distributing plants 
from other pool plants; and
    (ii) Receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such distributing 
plants from each other pool plant according to the quantity of such 
receipts from each such source;
    (7) If receipts during the month at such distributing plants of 
producer milk, milk diverted from other pool plants, and bulk fluid milk 
products from other pool plants are less than the quantity to be 
assigned pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section, prorate the 
amount of such excess in the same manner over such receipts in the next 
prior month in which there were receipts in excess of those assigned in 
that month pursuant to this paragraph (c)(7) of this section;
    (8) Multiply by the location adjustment rates applicable at the 
transferor plants, the quantity assigned to receipts of producer milk 
and milk diverted from other pool plants at such distributing plant 
pursuant to paragraphs (c) (6)(i) and (7) of this section;
    (9) Multiply by the location adjustment rates applicable at the 
transferor plants, the lesser of:
    (i) 110 percent of the quantities assigned to receipts from each 
other pool plant pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section; or
    (ii) Receipts specified in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section;
    (10) Multiply by the location adjustment rates applicable at the 
transferor plants, the quantities assigned pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) 
of this section to receipts from other pool plants in prior months;
    (11) Multiply the quantity of bulk fluid milk products shipped from 
the handler's pool plant(s) to nonpool plants and classified as Class I 
by the location adjustment rate applicable at the shipping plant;
    (12) Multiply the quantity of Class I milk packaged by pool supply 
plants and disposed of as route disposition or to other plants by the 
location adjustment rates applicable at the pool supply plants from 
which disposition is made; and
    (13) Add together the minus amounts obtained pursuant to paragraphs 
(c) (8), (9), (10), (11), and (12) of this section.
    (d) A handler (other than one described in paragraph (c) of this 
section) who operates a pool supply plant shall receive a location 
adjustment credit on receipts at such plant of producer milk and milk 
diverted from other pool plants that is classified as Class I but is not 
shipped as a bulk fluid milk product to a pool distributing plant.
    (e) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be 
reduced at the rates set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

plant shall be computed by the market administrator as follows, except 
that paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not apply when the Class I 
milk price adjusted for location pursuant to Sec. 1030.52(a) is higher 
at the transferor plant than at the transferee plant:
    (1) Multiply the number of hundredweights of the quantities of milk 
subject to the computations pursuant to Sec. 1030.52(c) (9) and (10) 
times the product of 0.28 cents times the number of miles between the 
transferor plant and the transferee plant; and
    (2) Subtract an amount computed by multiplying the absolute value 
difference between the location adjustment rates specified in 
Sec. 1030.52(a) applicable at the transferee and transferor plants times 
the hundredweights of milk used in the computation in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section. If the amount computed pursuant to this paragraph is 
greater than the amount computed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section the 
transportation credit will be zero.
    (b) For each handler who transfers milk from a pool plant to a pool 
distributing plant (or plants) an assembly credit shall be computed by 
the market administrator at the rate of 8 cents per hundredweight of 
such handler's transfers of milk included in the computations pursuant 
to Sec. 1030.52(c)(9) and (10).

Sec. 1030.61  Producer price differential.

    For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer 
price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1. If the unreserved cash 
balance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the 
computation is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of producer milk on 
all reports, the report of any handler who has not made the payments 
required pursuant to Sec. 1030.71 for the preceding month shall not be 
included in the computation of the producer price differential. The 
report of such handler shall not be included in the computation for 
succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding 
monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, the 
market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in 
the following manner:
    (a) Combine into one total for all handlers:
    (1) The values computed pursuant to Sec. 1030.60 (a)(1), (a)(2), 
(a)(7), and (b) through (k) for all handlers; and
    (2) Add values computed pursuant to Sec. 1030.60 (a)(3), (a)(4), 
(a)(5) and (a)(6); and subtract the values obtained by multiplying the 
handlers' total pounds of protein and total pounds of other solids 
contained in such milk by their respective prices, and the total value 
of the somatic cell adjustment;
    (b) Add an amount equal to the total value of the minus location 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1030.75(a);
    (c) Add an amount representing not less than one-half the 
unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1030.60(f); and
    (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight.

received pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and out of which he 
shall make all payments required pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (a) Payments made by handlers pursuant to Secs. 1030.71, 1030.76, 
1030.77 and 1030.78.
    (b) Payments due handlers pursuant to Secs. 1030.72 and 1030.77: 
Provided, That payments due any handler shall be offset by payments due 
from such handler pursuant to Secs. 1030.71, 1030.76, 1030.77, 1030.78,

<R05>
Sec. 1030.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 16th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay to the market administrator the amount, if any, by 
which the amount

[[Page 289]]

specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds the amount 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1030.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) An amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of 
producer milk as determined pursuant to Sec. 1030.44(c) by the producer 
price differential as adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1030.75;
    (ii) An amount obtained by multiplying the total pounds of protein 
contained in producer milk by the protein price;
    (iii) An amount obtained by multiplying the total pounds of other 
solids contained in producer milk by the other solids price;
    (iv) The total value of the somatic cell adjustment to producer 
milk; and
    (v) An amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat for which a value was computed pursuant to Sec. 1030.60(f) by 
the producer price differential as adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1030.52 for 
the location of the plant from which received.
    (b) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month each person 
who operated an other order plant that was regulated during such month 
under an order providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay to the 
market administrator an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant and the Class III price.

computed pursuant to Sec. 1030.71(a)(1): Provided, That if the balance 
in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments 
pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce 
uniformly such payments and shall complete such payments as soon as the 
necessary funds become available.


<R05>
Sec. 1030.73  Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

Sec. 1030.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1030.30(b) and 1030.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and

[[Page 292]]

    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I 
differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both prices 
to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1030.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1030.60 
shall be priced at the statistical uniform price (or at the weighted 
average price if such is provided) of the respective order regulating 
the handling of milk at the transferee-plant, with such statistical 
uniform price adjusted to the location of the nonpool plant (but not to 
be less than the lowest class price of the respective order), except 
that transfers of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be priced 
at the lowest class price of the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1030.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1030.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1030.71(a)(2)(v), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1030.60 for each

[[Page 293]]

nonpool plant that is not an other order plant which serves as a supply 
plant for such partially regulated distributing plant by making 
shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant during the month 
equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1030.7(b), subject to the 
following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1030.30(b) and 
1030.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1030.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1030.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1030.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1030.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1030.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    When verification by the market administrator of reports or payment 
of any handler discloses errors resulting in monies due (a) the market 
administrator from such handler, (b) such handler from the market 
administrator, or (c) any producer or cooperative association from such 
handler, the market administrator shall promptly notify such handler of 
any amount so due and payment thereof shall be made not later than the

increased three-fourths of one percent on the 7th day after the due date 
each month.
    (a) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
interest charges previously computed pursuant to this section;

[[Page 294]]

    (b) For the purpose of this section, any unpaid obligation that is 
determined at a date later than prescribed by the order because of a 
handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator shall 
be considered to have been due when it would have been due if such 
report had been submitted at the proper time; and
    (c) Payment of any interest obligation computed pursuant to this 
section in an amount less than $10 shall be delayed until the 
accumulated interest obligation of such handler equals or exceeds $10.

in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1032.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph (b)(2) 
shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph 
shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

Sec. 1032.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1032.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1032.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1032.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1032.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1032.44(a)(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1032.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, 
up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such 
receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk 
to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1032.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:

[[Page 304]]

    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1032.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent Sec. 1032.41(b); possible in the 
following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned,

[[Page 305]]

pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to any 
remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and then to 
Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in this subparagraph.

Sec. 1032.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1032.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1032.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1032.9(b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1032.40, 
1032.41, and 1032.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed or by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1032.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1032.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1032.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

<R05>
Sec. 1032.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1032.9(a) for each of his pool plants separately and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1032.9(b) and (c) by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1032.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk

[[Page 306]]

order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1032.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1032.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1032.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1032.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1032.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at

[[Page 307]]

the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1032.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an 
amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased

[[Page 308]]

by a like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). 
In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provision of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1032.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraphs (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraphs (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1032.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';

[[Page 309]]

    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computation pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1032.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1032.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1032.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1032.43(d) and Sec. 1032.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests, the class utilization of

handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of each handler 
described in Sec. 1032.9(b) and (c) as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk in each class as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1032.44 by the applicable class prices and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1032.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1032.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1032.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted

[[Page 312]]

from Class I and Class II pursuant to Sec. 1032.44(a)(9) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1032.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1032.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1032.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1032.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1032.44(a)(7)(v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1032.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1032.43(d) and Sec. 1032.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1032.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1032.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1032.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1032.76(a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1032.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1032.30(b) and 1032.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(but not to be less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the

nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1032.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1032.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1032.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1032.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1032.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1032.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1032.7(b) and 
(c), subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1032.30(b) and 
1032.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1032.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1032.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1032.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of an other order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply

[[Page 317]]

plant if paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1032.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

section shall continue to be a pool plant for the current month if such 
supply plant qualified as a pool plant in the three immediately 
preceding months; and
    (4) A supply plant that qualified as a pool plant in each of the 
immediately preceding months of September through February on the basis 
of its deliveries to pool distributing plants shall be a pool plant for 
each of the following months of March through August, unless the plant 
operator files a written request with the market administrator asking 
that such plant not be a pool plant. Such nonpool status shall be

request and thereafter until the plant again qualifies as a pool plant 
on the basis of its deliveries to a pool distributing plant(s).
    (c) A plant operated by a cooperative association if, during the 
month, 35 percent or more of the producer milk of members of the

another order issued pursuant to the Act, unless the plant is qualified 
as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section during 
the current month and the immediately preceding month and a greater 
volume of fluid milk products, except filled milk, is disposed of in 
each such month from such plant as route disposition in the Ohio Valley 
marketing area than is disposed of from such plant as route disposition 
in the marketing area regulated pursuant to the other order and to 
plants qualified as fully regulated plants under such other order on the 
basis of route disposition in the marketing area;
    (3) A plant qualified pursuant to Sec. 1033.7(a) which also meets 
the requirements of a fully regulated plant pursuant to the provisions 
of another Federal order on the basis of distribution in such other 
marketing area and from which the Secretary determines route 
disposition, except filled milk, during the month in this marketing area 
is greater than route disposition in such other marketing area but which 
plant is, nevertheless, fully regulated under such other Federal order.

fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1033.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1033.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1033.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1033.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred shall be classified so as to allocate the least possible 
Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1033.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of Sec. 1033.44(b), the skim 
milk or butterfat so transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall 
not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the 
case if the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant 
or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products

[[Page 330]]

shall be classified as Class I milk, and skim milk or butterfat 
allocated to the other classes shall be classified as Class III milk; 
and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1033.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat in the 
following forms that is transferred from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1033.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:

[[Page 331]]

    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

Sec. 1033.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1033.9 (b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1033.40, 
1033.41, and 1033.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1033.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association;
    (d) Bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted from a pool 
plant operated by a cooperative association to another pool plant shall 
be classified in accordance with the rules set forth in Sec. 1033.42(a) 
and the value thereof shall be used to compute the receiving handler's 
pool obligation for such milk pursuant to Sec. 1033.60(a), (b), (h), (i) 
and (j).
    (e) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1033.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1033.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (f) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

Sec. 1033.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1033.9(a) for each of its pool plants separately and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1033.9 (b) and (c) by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to its utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1033.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; and
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1033.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1033.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to, any product specified in Sec. 1033.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1033.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1033.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) and bulk 
cream for which bottling grade certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk cream from 
unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk cream from a producer-
handler, as defined under this or any other Federal order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from 
unregulated supply plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order

[[Page 333]]

plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order providing for 
individual-handler pooling, to the extent that reconstituted skim milk 
is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) Receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant 
that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(7)(v) 
of this section for which the handler requests classification other than 
Class I, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class 
II and Class III combined;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply 
plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i), 
(a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) of this section which are in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) (A) 
through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim milk to be 
subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II 
and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class 
III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such 
classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
this allocation step (exclusive of transfers between pool plants of the 
same handler) at all pool plants of the handler;
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants remaining at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) Receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an other order plant 
that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted 
to such plant and that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II or Class III classification is 
requested by the operator of the other order plant and the handler, but 
not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class 
III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1033.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (5) and (7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were 
not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk

[[Page 334]]

products to the same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk 
products to be allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1033.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler):
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and

[[Page 335]]

    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1033.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as overage;
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1033.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1033.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1033.44(b), estimate and publicly announce on or before the 
10th day of the month the utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) 
in each class during the month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk of all handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the 
most current available data and shall be final for such purpose;
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1033.43(e) and Sec. 1033.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and, thereafter, any change 
in such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the 
verification of such report; and
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order 
plant, the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report of the 
receiving handler and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association, upon request by such association, the 
percentage of the milk caused to be delivered by the cooperative 
association or its members which was utilized in each class at each pool 
plant receiving such milk. For the purpose of this report, the milk so 
received shall be allocated to each class at each pool plant in the same 
ratio as all producer milk received at such plant during the month.

Sec. 1033.50  Class and component prices.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1033.52, the class and component 
prices for the month, per hundredweight or per pound, shall be as 
follows:

[[Page 336]]

    (a) Class I price. From the effective date hereof through April 30, 
1988, and thereafter until amended, the Class I price shall be the basic 
formula price for the second preceding month plus $2.04.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound shall be the 
total of the following steps, rounded to the nearest whole cent:
    (1) The skim milk price per hundredweight for the month, computed 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, divided by 100; and
    (2) The butterfat differential for the month, computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.73 multiplied by 10.
    (e) Milk protein price. The price per pound for milk protein shall 
be computed by subtracting from the Class III price the butterfat price 
multiplied by 3.5, and dividing the result by the average protein 
content of the milk on which the basic formula price is based for the

<R05>
Sec. 1033.70  Producer-settlement fund.

    The market administrator shall maintain a separate fund, known as 
the ``producer-settlement fund'', which shall function as follows:
    (a) All payments made by handlers pursuant to Secs. 1033.71, 
1033.76, and 1033.77 shall be deposited in this fund, and all payments

fund;
    (b) The difference between the amount added pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.61(d) and the amount resulting from the subtraction pursuant

<R05>
Sec. 1033.71  Payments to the market administrator.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, each handler shall pay 
to the market administrator on or before the 26th day of each month an 
amount determined by multiplying the hundredweight of producer milk and 
bulk fluid milk products from a pool plant operated by a cooperative 
association received by such handler during the first 15 days of the 
month by the basic formula price for the preceding month less proper 
deductions and charges authorized in writing by such producers.
    (b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, each handler shall pay 
to the market administrator on or before the 15th day after the end of 
each month the value of such handler's milk pursuant to Sec. 1033.60(a) 
through (l) and the value of bulk fluid milk products received from a 
pool plant operated by a cooperative association pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.43(d) as determined pursuant to Sec. 1033.60(a), (b), (h), (i) 
and (j), less:
    (1) The amount obtained from multiplying the weighted average 
differential price applicable at the location of the plants from which 
the other source milk is received (not to be less than zero) by the 
hundredweight of other source milk for which a value is computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1033.60(g);
    (2) Partial payments made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
for such month; and
    (3) Proper deductions and charges authorized in writing by producers 
from whom the handler received milk, except that the total deductions 
and charges made under this section for the month for each producer 
shall not be greater than the total value of the milk received from such 
producer during the month.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, each handler operating 
a distributing plant that is subject to the classification and pricing 
provisions of another order which provides for individual handler 
pooling shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-
settlement fund on or before the 25th day after the end of the month an 
amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such other order plant. If reconstituted skim 
milk in filled milk is disposed of from such plant as route disposition 
in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide pool orders, the 
reconstituted skim milk assigned to Class I shall be prorated according 
to the route disposition in each marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the quantity of reconstituted skim milk 
assigned in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route

[[Page 343]]

disposition in this marketing area at the Class I price under this part 
applicable at the location of the other order plant (not to be less than 
the Class III price) and subtract its value at the Class III price.
    (d) The following conditions shall apply with respect to the 
payments prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section:
    (1) Payments to the market administrator shall be deemed not to have 
been made until such payments have been received by the market 
administrator;
    (2) If the date by which payments must be received by the market 
administrator falls on a Saturday or Sunday or any day that is a 
national holiday, payments shall be considered to have been received by 
the due date if they are received not later than the next day on which 
the market administrator's office is open for public business; and
    (3) Payments due the market administrator from a cooperative 
association as a handler may be offset by payments determined by the 
market administrator to be due the cooperative association pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.72.

<R05>
Sec. 1033.72  Payment to producers and to cooperative associations.

    (a) On or before the 28th day of the month, the market administrator 
shall make payment, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, 
to each producer for milk received from such individual producer and to 
each cooperative association for bulk fluid milk products delivered from 
its pool plant to another pool plant during the first 15 days of the 
month by handlers from whom the appropriate payments have been received 
pursuant to Sec. 1033.71(a) at a rate per hundredweight equal to the 
basic formula price for the preceding month, less the deductions 
authorized in writing by producers and charges made by handlers with 
respect to such milk.
    (b) On or before the 17th day after the end of the month, the market 
administrator shall make payment, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section, to each producer for milk received from such individual 
producer and to each cooperative association for bulk fluid milk 
products delivered from its pool plant to another pool plant during the 
month by handlers from whom the appropriate payments have been received 
pursuant to Sec. 1033.71(b) of the amount determined pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.65, less:
    (1) Partial payments made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
with respect to such milk;
    (2) Deductions for marketing services pursuant to Sec. 1033.86; and
    (3) Other deductions authorized in writing by producers and made by 
handlers with respect to such milk.
    (c) In lieu of making payments to individual producers pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the market administrator shall 
pay, on or before the day prior to the dates specified in such 
paragraphs, to each cooperative association that so requests with 
respect to those producers for whom it markets milk and who are 
certified to the market administrator as having authorized the 
cooperative association to receive such payment an amount equal to the 
sum of the individual payments otherwise payable to such producers 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) In lieu of making payments to individual producers pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the market administrator shall 
pay, on or before the day prior to the dates specified in such 
paragraphs, to each handler who so requests for milk received by the 
handler from producers for whom a cooperative association is not 
collecting payments pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section an amount 
equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable to such 
producers pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The 
handler then shall pay the individual producers the amounts due them by 
the respective dates specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. Any handler who the market administrator determines is or was 
delinquent with respect to any payment obligation under this order shall 
not be eligible to participate in this payment arrangement until the 
handler has met all prescribed payment obligations for three consecutive

[[Page 344]]

months. In making payments to the individual producers pursuant to this 
paragraph, the handler shall furnish the following information to each 
producer:
    (1) The identity of the handler and the producer and the month to 
which the payment applies;
    (2) The total pounds and, with respect to final payments, the 
average butterfat and protein content and somatic cell count of the milk 
for which payment is being made;
    (3) The minimum rate of payment required by the order and the rate 
of payment used if it is other than the applicable minimum rate;
    (4) The amount and nature of any deductions subtracted from the 
amount otherwise due the producer; and
    (5) The net amount of payment to the producer.
    (e) The following conditions shall apply with respect to the 
payments by the market administrator prescribed in paragraphs (a) 
through (d) of this section:
    (1) If the date by which such payments are to be made falls on a 
Saturday or Sunday or on any day that is a national holiday, such 
payments need not be made until the next day on which the market 
administrator's office is open for public business; and
    (2) If the application of Sec. 1033.71(d)(2) of paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section results in a delay in the partial or final payments by 
handlers to the market administrator or by the market administrator to 
producers or cooperative associations, the corresponding partial or 
final payments prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section 
may be delayed by the same number of days.
    (f) If the market administrator does not receive the full payment 
required of a handler pursuant to Sec. 1033.71, he shall reduce 
uniformly per hundredweight the payments to producers for milk received 
by such handler by a total amount not in excess of the amount due from 
such handler. The market administrator shall complete the payments to 
producers on or before the next date for making payments pursuant to 
this section following the date on which the remaining payment is 
received from such handler.
    (g) If the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund is 
insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this section, except those 
payments due producers as described in paragraph (f) of this section, 
the market administrator shall reduce uniformly per hundredweight the 
payments to producers and shall complete such payments on or before the 
next date for making payments pursuant to this section following the 
date on which the funds become available.

<R05>
Sec. 1033.73  Butterfat differential.

    For milk containing more or less than 3.5 percent butterfat, the 
uniform price shall be increased or decreased, respectively, for each 
one-tenth percent butterfat variation from 3.5 percent by a butterfat 
differential, rounded to the nearest one-tenth cent, which shall be 
0.138 times the current month's butter price less 0.0028 times the 
preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, for 
manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the ``base 
month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1033.51 (a) through (e), as 
reported by the Department. The butter price means the simple average 
for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade A butter price 
as reported by the Department.
[60 FR 18962, Apr. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1033.74  Plant location adjustments for producers and on nonpool milk.

    (a) The uniform price for producer milk at a plant outside the 
Central Zone shall be the Central Zone uniform price adjusted according 
to the location of the plant at the rates set forth in Sec. 1033.52(a); 
and
    (b) For the purpose of computations pursuant to Sec. 1033.71(b)(1), 
the weighted average price shall be adjusted at the rate set forth in 
Sec. 1033.52(a) that is applicable at the location of the nonpool plant 
from which other source milk was received.
[58 FR 27822, May 11, 1993]

[[Page 345]]


<R05>
Sec. 1033.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund 
on or before the 25th day after the end of the month either of the 
amounts (at the handler's election) calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section. If the handler fails to report pursuant to 
Secs. 1033.30(c) and 1033.31(b) the information necessary to compute the 
amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall pay the 
amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) An amount computed as follows:
    (1)(i) The obligation that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1033.60 at such plant shall be determined as though such plant were 
a pool plant. For purposes of such computation, receipts at such nonpool 
plant from a pool plant or an other order plant shall be assigned to the 
utilization at which classified at the pool plant or other order plant 
and transfers from such nonpool plant to a pool plant or an other order 
plant shall be classified as Class II or Class III milk if allocated to 
such class at the pool plant or other order plant and be valued at the 
weighted average price of the respective order if so allocated to Class 
I milk, except that reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be 
valued at the Class III price. No obligation shall apply to Class I milk 
transferred to a pool plant or an other order plant if such Class I 
utilization is assigned to receipts at the partially regulated 
distributing plant from pool plants and other order plants at which such 
milk was classified and priced as Class I milk. There shall be included 
in the obligation so computed a charge in the amount specified in 
Sec. 1033.60(e) and a credit in the amount specified in Sec. 1033.71(b) 
with respect to receipts from an unregulated supply plant, except that 
the credit for receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall 
be at the Class III price, unless an obligation with respect to such 
plant is computed as specified below in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (ii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, and provides with his reports pursuant to Secs. 1033.30(c) 
and 1033.31(b) similar reports for each nonpool plant which serves as a 
supply plant for such partially regulated distributing plant by 
shipments to such plant during the month equivalent to the requirements 
of Sec. 1033.7(b), with agreement of the operator of such plant that the 
market administrator may examine the books and records of such plant for 
purposes of verification of such reports, there will be added the amount 
of the obligation computed at such nonpool supply plant in the same 
manner and subject to the same conditions as for the partially regulated 
distributing plant.
    (2) From this obligation deduct the sum of:
    (i) The gross payments made by such handler for bottling grade milk 
(adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis pursuant to Sec. 1033.73) 
received during the month from dairy farmers at such plant and like 
payments made by the operator of a supply plant(s) included in the 
computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) Payments to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
issued pursuant to the Act under which such plant is also a partially 
regulated distributing plant.
    (b) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat in 
the plant's route disposition in the marketing area;
    (2) Deduct the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
received at the plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that deducted under a similar provision of another order issued pursuant 
to the Act; and
    (ii) From a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to the 
extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers under this or any other order issued 
pursuant to the Act is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not 
used as an offset on any other payment obligation under this or any 
other order;

[[Page 346]]

    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Combine the amounts of skim milk and butterfat remaining into 
one total and determine the weighted average butterfat content; and
    (5) From the value of such milk at the Class I price applicable at 
the location of the nonpool plant (not to be less than the Class III 
price) subtract its value at the weighted average price applicable at 
such location (not to be less than the Class III price), and add the 
amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled reconstituted 
milk included in paragraph (b)(3) of this section by the difference 
between the Class I price applicable at the location of the partially 
regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less than the 
Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted milk 
that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by $1.00. 
Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1033.43(e). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 1033.77  Correction of errors.

    Whenever audit by the market administrator of any handler's reports, 
books, records, or accounts discloses adjustments to be made, for any 
reason, which result in monies due the market administrator from such 
handler, the market administrator shall promptly notify such handler of 
any such amount due, and payment thereof shall be made on or before the 
next date for making payment set forth in the provision under which such 
error occurred following the fifth day after such notice. Any monies 
found to be due a handler from the market administrator shall be paid 
promptly to such handler except that the market administrator shall 
offset any monies due a handler against monies due from such handler.


<R05>
Sec. 1033.78  Charges on overdue accounts.

    Any unpaid obligation of a handler pursuant to Sec. 1033.57, 
1033.71, 1033.72(d), 1033.76, 1033.77, or 1033.78 shall be increased one 
(1) percent beginning on the first day after the due date, and on the 
same day of each succeeding month until such obligation is paid, subject 
to the following conditions:

[[Page 347]]

    (a) Charges on overdue accounts collected pursuant to this section 
shall be deposited into the administrative assessment fund maintained by 
the market administrator;
    (b) Amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed by 
the market administrator monthly on the unpaid balance (including any 
unpaid charges previously assessed pursuant to this section) remaining 
on each overdue obligation on such date; and
    (c) Any obligation that was determined at a date later than that 
prescribed by the order because of a handler's failure to submit a 
report to the market administrator when due, shall be considered to have 
been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been 
filed when due.

<R05>
Sec. 1033.85  Assessment for order administration.

day after the end of the month 4 cents per hundredweight, or such lesser 
amount as the Secretary may prescribe, with respect to:
    (a) Receipts of producer milk (including such handler's own farm 
production and milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1033.9(c)

steps of Sec. 1033.44(b), except such other source milk that is excluded 
from the computations pursuant to Sec. 1033.60 (d) and (e); and
    (d) Route disposition in the marketing area from a partially 
regulated distributing plant that exceeds the Class I milk:
    (1) Received during the month at such plant from pool plants and 
other order plants that is not used as an offset under a similar 
provision of another order issued pursuant to the Act; and
    (2) Specified in Sec. 1033.76(b)(2)(ii).

Sec. 1036.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1036.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(6) of this section which was received in bulk fluid form;

pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant and milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1036.9(c));
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1036.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph (b)(2) 
shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph 
shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received from unregulated supply plants, 
excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III classification is

    (c) The quantity of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
shrinkage of milk from producers for which a cooperative association is 
the handler pursuant to Sec. 1036.9(b) or (c), but not in excess of 0.5 
percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such milk. If 
the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such 
milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the 
farm, with protein and butterfat tests and somatic cell counts 
determined from farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage for 
the cooperative association shall be zero.

<R05>
Sec. 1036.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    Skim milk or butterfat in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product shall be classified:
    (a) At the utilization indicated by the operators of both plants, 
otherwise as Class I milk, if transferred or diverted from a pool plant 
to the pool plant of another handler, subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat so assigned to each class shall be 
limited to the amount thereof remaining in such class in the transferee 
plant after the computations pursuant to Sec. 1036.44(a)(13) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1036.44(b). The amount of skim milk or 
butterfat classified in each class shall include the assigned 
utilization of skim milk or butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid 
milk products;
    (2) If the transferor plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1036.44(a)(7) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1036.44(b), the skim milk and butterfat so 
transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the least 
possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1036.44(a)(12) or (13) and the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1036.44(b), the skim milk and butterfat so 
transferred or diverted up to the total of such receipts shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be applicable 
to a like quantity of such other source milk received at the transferee 
plant;
    (b) As Class I milk, if transferred from a pool plant to a producer-
handler plant;
    (c) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in bulk to a nonpool 
plant that is neither an other order plant nor a producer-handler plant, 
unless the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section are 
met, in which case the skim milk and butterfat so transferred or 
diverted shall be classified in accordance with the assignment resulting 
from paragraph (c)(3) of this section:
    (1) The transferring or diverting handler claims classification as 
Class II or Class III in his report submitted pursuant to Sec. 1036.30;
    (2) The operator of such nonpool plant maintains books and records 
showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such 
plant which are made available if requested by the market administrator 
for the purpose of verification; and
    (3) The skim milk and butterfat so transferred or diverted shall be 
classified on the basis of the following assignment of utilization at 
such nonpool plant in excess of receipts of packaged fluid milk products 
from all pool plants and other order plants:
    (i) Any route disposition in the marketing area shall be first 
assigned to the skim milk and butterfat in the fluid milk products so 
transferred or diverted from pool plants, next pro rata to receipts from 
other order plants, and thereafter to receipts from dairy farmers who 
the market administrator determines constitute regular sources of supply 
of milk (approved by a duly constituted health authority for fluid 
consumption) for such nonpool plant;
    (ii) Any route disposition in the marketing area of another order 
issued pursuant to the Act shall be first assigned to receipts from 
plants fully regulated by such order, next pro rata to receipts from 
pool plants and other order plants not regulated by such order, and 
thereafter to receipts from dairy farmers who the market administrator 
determines constitute regular sources of supply of milk (approved by

[[Page 359]]

a duly constituted health authority for fluid consumption) for such 
nonpool plant;
    (iii) Class I utilization (exclusive of that resulting from 
transfers of fluid milk products to pool plants and other order plants) 
in excess of that assigned pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section shall be assigned first to remaining receipts from dairy 
farmers who the market administrator determines constitute regular 
sources of supply of milk (approved by a duly constituted health 
authority for fluid consumption) for such nonpool plant and any 
remaining Class I utilization (including that resulting from transfers 
of fluid milk products to pool plants and other order plants) shall be 
assigned pro rata to unassigned receipts at such nonpool plant from all 
pool plants and other order plants; and
    (iv) To the extent that Class I utilization is not so assigned to 
it, the skim milk and butterfat so transferred or diverted shall be 
classified as Class II milk to the extent Class II utilization is 
available and the remainder as Class III milk; and;
    (d) As follows, if transferred to an other order plant in excess of 
receipts from such plant in the same category as described in paragraph 
(d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred in packaged form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated as fluid milk product under the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both the transferor and transferee plants so 
request in the reports of receipts and utilization filed with the 
respective market administrators, movments in bulk form shall be 
classified as Class III milk to the extent of the Class III utilization 
(or comparable utilization under such other order) available for such 
assignment pursuant to the allocation provisions of the transferee 
order;
    (4) If information concerning the classification to which allocated 
under the other order is not available to the market administrator for 
purposes of establishing classification pursuant to this paragraph, 
classification shall be as Class I, subject to adjustment when such 
information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the transferee order provides 
for only two classes of utilization, skim milk and butterfat allocated 
to a class consisting primarily of fluid milk products shall be 
classified as Class I milk, and skim milk and butterfat allocated to the 
other class shall be classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product is tranferred to an 
other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under such 
other order, classification shall be in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 1036.40.

<R05>
Sec. 1036.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1036.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1036.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1036.9(b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1036.40, 
1036.41, and 1036.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1036.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association; and
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use

[[Page 360]]

shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the reconstituted portion of 
labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a pro rata basis (except 
for any Class I use of specific concentrated receipts that is 
established by the handler) prior to any assignments under Sec. 1036.44. 
Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in concentrated receipts shall be 
assigned to uses under Sec. 1036.44 on a pro rata basis, unless a 
specific use of such receipts is established by the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

<R05>
Sec. 1036.44  Classification of producer milk.

    After making the computations pursuant to Sec. 1036.43, the market 
administrator shall determine the classification of producer milk for 
each handler as follows: Provided, That the classification of producer 
milk for which a cooperative association is the handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1036.9 (b) or (c) shall be determined separately from the 
operations of any pool plant operated by such cooperative association:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk classified as Class III milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1036.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from other order plants, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in packaged fluid cream products received from other plants, 
but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in fluid cream products in packaged form and in bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that are in inventory at the beginning 
of the month, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1036.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1036.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products

[[Page 361]]

specified in Sec. 1036.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) and bulk 
fluid cream products for which appropriate health approval is not 
established and receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, from unidentified sources;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
from a producer-handler, as defined under this or any other Federal 
order;
    (iv) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from 
unregulated supply plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from other 
order plants which are regulated under an order providing for 
individual-handler pooling, to the extent that reconstituted skim milk 
is allocated to Class I at the transferor plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) Receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant 
that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a) (2)(i) and (7)(iv) 
of this section for which the handler requests classification other than 
Class I, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class 
II and Class III combined;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply 
plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and 
(a)(7)(iv) of this section which are in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk determined pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) (A) through (C) of 
this section. Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class 
II and Class III combined exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
this allocation step (exclusive of transfers between pool plants of the 
same handler) at all pool plants of the handler;
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants remaining at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) Receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an other order plant 
that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted 
to such plant and that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(v) of this section, if Class II or Class III classification is 
requested by the operator of the other order plant and the handler, but 
not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class 
III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1036.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant,

[[Page 362]]

pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I and in 
Class II and Class III combined at this allocation step at all pool

skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply 
plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i), 
(a)(7)(iv), and (a)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:

skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by

allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler):
    (ii) Should the proportion pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class

handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from

the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class

follows:
    (a) Class I price. From the effective date hereof through April 30, 
1988, and thereafter until amended, the Class I price shall be the basic 
formula price for the second preceding month plus $2.00.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound shall be the 
total of the following steps, rounded to the nearest whole cent:
    (1) The skim milk price per hundredweight for the month, computed 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, divided by 100; and
    (2) The butterfat differential for the month, computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1036.74 multiplied by 10.
    (e) Milk protein price. The price per pound for milk protein shall 
be computed by subtracting from the Class III price the butterfat price 
multiplied by 3.5, and dividing the result by the average protein 
content of the milk on which the basic formula price is based for the 
previous month as reported by the Department and adjusted for the 
current month by the Dairy Division, and rounding the result to the 
nearest whole cent.
    (f) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight shall be 
computed by subtracting from the Class III price the butterfat 
differential computed pursuant to Sec. 1036.74 times 35, and rounding 
the result to the nearest whole cent.
    (g) Class III-A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Central States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as 
reported by the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by 
subtracting from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat 
dry milk price, plus the butterfat differential value per hundredweight 
of 3.5 percent milk and rounded to the nearest cent.

amounts (at the handler's election) calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section. If the handler fails to report pursuant to 
Secs. 1036.30 and 1036.31(b) the information necessary to compute the 
amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall pay the 
amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) The obligation that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1036.60 at such plant shall be determined as though such plant were 
a pool plant, subject to the following modifications;
    (i) Receipts at such nonpool plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be assigned to the utilization at which classified at 
the pool plant or other order plant;
    (ii) Transfers from such nonpool plants to a pool plant or other 
order plant shall be classified as Class II or Class III milk if 
allocated to such class at the pool plant or other order plant and be 
valued at the weighted average price of the respective order if so 
allocated to Class I milk, except that reconstituted skim milk in filled 
milk shall be valued at the Class III price. No obligation shall apply 
to Class I milk transferred to a pool plant or another order plant is 
such Class I utilization is assigned to receipts at the partially 
regulated distributing plant from pool plants and other order plants at 
which such milk was classified and priced as Class I milk. There shall 
be included in the obligation so computed a charge in the amount 
specified in Sec. 1036.60(e) and a credit in the amount specified in 
Sec. 1036.71(a)(2)(ii) with respect to receipts from an unregulated

[[Page 373]]

supply plant, except that the credit for receipts of reconstituted skim 
milk in filled milk shall be at the Class III price, unless an 
obligation with respect to such plant is computed as specified below in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section;
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, and provides with his report pursuant to Sec. 1036.30 a 
similar report for each nonpool plant which serves as a supply plant for 
such partially regulated distributing plant by shipments to such plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1036.7(b) and 
(c), with agreement of the operator of such plant that the market 
administrator may examine the books and records of such plant for 
purposes of verification of such reports, there will be added the amount 
of the obligation computed at such nonpool supply plant in the same 
manner and subject to the same conditions as for the partially regulated 
distributing plant.
    (2) From this obligation, deduct the sum of:
    (i) The gross payments made by such handler for milk (adjusted to a 
3.5-percent butterfat basis pursuant to Sec. 1036.74) received during 
the month from dairy farmers at such plant and like payments made by the 
operator of a supply plant(s) included in the computations pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) Payments to the producer-settlement fund of another order under 
which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant.
    (b) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat in 
the plant's route disposition in the marketing area;
    (2) Deduct the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
received at the plant;
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that deducted under a similar provision of another order issued pursuant 
to the act; and
    (ii) From a nonpool plant that is not another order plant to the 
extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under this or any 
other order issued pursuant to the act is classified and priced as Class 
I milk and is not used as an offset on any other payment obligation 
under this or any other order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price applicable at the location of the partially regulated 
distributing plant (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the 
weighted average price applicable at the location of the partially 
regulated distributing plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (b)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to

[[Page 374]]

Class I use under Sec. 1036.43(d). Payments may be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.

end of each month, pay over such deductions to the association rendering 
such services.

perform the services specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

    Pool plant means:
    (a) A distributing plant:
    (1) From which total route disposition, except filled milk, during 
the month is not less than 50 percent of the combined Grade A milk 
received in bulk at such plant direct from producers, from supply 
plants, from a cooperative association as described in Sec. 1040.9(c) or

provisions of paragraph (c) of this section:
    (i) The plant is located in the marketing area;
    (ii) The plant has total route disposition, except filled milk,

to Sec. 1040.13 as producer milk; and
    (iii) The principal activity of such plant is the processing and 
distributing of aseptically processed fluid milk products.

[[Page 377]]

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a supply 
plant which during the month meets one of the performance requirements 
specified in paragraph (b) (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section. All 
supply plants which are operated by one handler, or all the supply 
plants for which a handler is responsible for meeting the preformance 
requirements of this paragraph under a marketing agreement certified to 
the market administrator by both parties, may be considered as a unit 
for the purpose of meeting the performance requirements of paragraph (b) 
(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section upon written notice to the market 
administrator specifying the plants to be considered as a unit and the 
period during which such consideration shall apply. Such notice and 
notice of any change in designation, shall be furnished on or before the 
fifth working day following the month to which the notice applies. In 
any months of March through August a unit shall not contain any plant 
which was not qualified under this paragraph either individually or as a 
member of a unit during the previous September through February.
    (1) A supply plant from which each month not less than 30 percent of 
the total quantity of Grade A milk received at such plant from producers 
and from a handler described in Sec. 1040.9(c), or diverted therefrom by 
the plant operator or a cooperative association (as described in 
Sec. 1040.9(b)) pursuant to Sec. 1040.13, less any Class I disposition 
of fluid milk products which are processed and packaged in consumer-type 
containers in the plant, is transferred to plants described in paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section. Not more than one-half of the shipping 
percentage specified in this paragraph may be met through the diversion 
of producer milk from the supply plant to pool distributing plants.
    (2) A plant operated by a cooperative association which supplies 
distributing plants qualified under paragraph (a) of this section, if 
the amount of producer milk of members of the association delivered by 
transfer from such association's plant to plants described in paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section and by direct delivery from the farm to plants 
qualified under paragraph (a) of this section is as follows:
    (i) During the month, is not less than that percentage which is 
designated by the market administrator for the current month pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section; or
    (ii) During the second through thirteenth preceding months, was not 
less than that percentage which was designated by the market 
administrator for the second through thirteenth preceding months 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, if such plant was 
qualified under this paragraph in each of the preceding 13 months.
    (3) A plant located in the State of Michigan which has been a pool 
plant for twelve consecutive months, but is not otherwise qualified 
under this paragraph, if it has a marketing agreement with a cooperative 
association and it fulfills the following conditions:
    (i) The aggregate monthly quantity supplied by all parties to such 
an agreement as a percentage of the producer milk receipts included in 
the unit during the month is not less than that percentage designated by 
the market administrator for the current month pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(6) of this section; and
    (ii) Shipments for qualification purposes shall include both 
transfers from supply plants to plants described in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section, and deliveries made direct from the farm to plants 
qualified under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) A supply plant that qualifies as a pool plant pursuant to 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section in each of the months of 
September through February shall be a pool plant for the following 
months of March through August. The automatic pool qualification of a 
plant can be waived if the handler or cooperative requests in writing to 
the market administrator the nonpool status of such plant. The request 
must be made prior to the beginning of any month during the March 
through August period. The plant shall be a nonpool plant for such month 
and thereafter until it requalifies under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section on the basis of actual shipments therefrom. To requalify as a 
pool plant under paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section

[[Page 378]]

or on a unit basis, such plant must first have met the shipping 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for 6 consecutive 
months.
    (5) Qualifying transfers from supply plants pursuant to this 
paragraph may be made to the following plants:
    (i) Pool plants described in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (ii) Distributing plants fully regulated under other Federal orders 
except that credit for transfers to such plants shall be limited to the 
quantity of milk transferred from the supply plant to pool distributing 
plants during the month. Qualifying transfers to other order plants 
shall not include transfers made on the basis of agreed upon Class II or 
Class III utilization.
    (iii) Partially regulated distributing plants that are neither other 
order plants, producer-handler plants, nor exempt plants and from which 
there is route disposition in consumer-type packages or dispenser units 
in the marketing area during the month.
    (6) The shipping percentage that applies to a handler described in 
paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section shall be determined in the 
following manner:
    (i) The market administrator shall calculate the percentage that 
producer deliveries used in Class I represent of the total producer milk 
in that months' pool.
    (ii) The following table shall be used in determining a 
cooperative's delivery requirement in qualifying its balancing plant or 
a unit of such plants as pool plants for the same month of the following 
year:

 Producer deliveries used in class I as a percent of total     delivery 
                       producer milk                          percentage

50+........................................................           50
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) The shipping percentages determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(b)(1) or (b)(6) of this section may be increased or decreased by the 
market administrator if the market administrator finds that such 
revision is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent 
uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market 
administrator shall investigate the need for revision either on the 
market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested 
parties. If the investigation shows that a revision of the shipping 
requirements might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue 
a notice stating that the revision is being considered and invite data, 
views, and arguments. Any request for revision of shipping percentages 
shall be filed with the market administrator no later than the 15th day 
of the month prior to the month for which the requested revision is 
desired to be effective.
    (c) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) An exempt plant;
    (3) A distributing plant from which the Secretary determines there 
is a greater proportion of route disposition (except filled milk) in 
another marketing area regulated by another order issued pursuant to the 
Act than in the Southern Michigan marketing area and such plant is fully 
subject to regulation of such other order: Provided, That a distributing 
plant which was a pool plant under this order in the immediately 
preceding month shall continue to be subject to all of the provisions of 
this part until the third consecutive month in which it has a greater 
proportion of its route disposition (except filled milk) in such other 
marketing area, unless, notwithstanding the provisions of this 
subparagraph, it is regulated by such other order;
    (4) A distributing plant which meets the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another 
order on the basis of its route disposition in such other marketing area 
and from which the Secretary determines there is a greater quantity of 
route disposition (except filled milk) during the month in this 
marketing area than in such other marketing area but which plant is 
nevertheless fully regulated under such other order; and
    (5) A supply plant which during the month is fully subject to the 
pricing and pooling provisions of another order issued pursuant to the 
Act, unless such plant is qualified as a pool plant pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section and

[[Page 379]]

a greater volume of fluid milk products (except filled milk) is moved to 
pool distributing plants than is moved to plants qualified as fully 
regulated plants under such other order on the basis of route 
disposition in the other marketing area.

Sec. 1040.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant except as 
provided in Sec. 1040.43(d) shall be classified as Class I milk unless 
the operators of both plants request the same classification in another 
class. In either case the classification of such transfers or diversions 
shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations

[[Page 385]]

pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1040.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1040.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.44(a)(11) or Sec. 1040.44(a)(12) or the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1040.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted 
up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such 
receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk 
to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section;
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers, or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified as Class II or Class III to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For the purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides 
for a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for 
under this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1040.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:

[[Page 386]]

    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1040.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred form such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the

[[Page 387]]

same assignment priorities at the second plant that are set forth in 
this paragraph.

Sec. 1040.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.30 and shall compute the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1040.40, 1040.41, 
and 1040.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1040.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association; and
    (d) Milk in bulk delivered by a cooperative association as a handler 
under Sec. 1040.9(c) or from the pool plant of a cooperative association 
to a handler's pool plant shall be classified according to use or 
disposition by the latter handler and the value thereof at the class 
prices shall be included in his value of milk pursuant to Sec. 1040.60.
    (e) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1040.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1040.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (f) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources

Sec. 1040.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler by allocating the 
handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as 
follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1040.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:

[[Page 388]]

    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1040.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Except for the first month that a pool plant is subject to this 
paragraph, subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II 
the pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1040.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1040.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1040.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1040.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) and bulk 
cream for which Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk cream from 
unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk cream from a producer-
handler, as defined under this or any other Federal order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step

[[Page 389]]

at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
this allocation step (exclusive of transfers between pool plants of the 
same handler) at all pool plants of the handler;
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants remaining at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1040.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs 1040.44(a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that 
were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the 
same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be 
allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;

[[Page 390]]

    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(12)(ii), (iii) and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1040.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler):
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products from another pool plant according to the classification of such 
products pursuant to Sec. 1040.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk received 
pursuant to Sec. 1040.43(d), subtract such excess from the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with Class III. 
Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a)(14)

Sec. 1040.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1040.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1040.43(e) and Sec. 1040.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.

<R05>
Sec. 1040.50  Class and component prices.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1040.52, the class prices per 
hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat and the component 
prices per hundredweight or per pound for the month shall be as follows:
    (a) Class I price. The Class I price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $1.75.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Class III-A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Central States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as 
reported by the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by 
subtracting from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat 
dry milk price, plus the butterfat differential times 35 and rounded to 
the nearest cent.
    (e) Class I differential price. The Class I differential price shall 
be the difference between the current month's Class I and Class III 
price (this price may be negative).
    (f) Class II differential price. The Class II differential price 
shall be the difference between the current month's Class II and Class 
III price (this price may be negative).
    (g) Class III-A differential price. The Class III-A differential 
price shall be the difference between the current month's Class III-A 
and Class III price (this price may be negative).
    (h) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded 
to the nearest cent, shall be the Class III price less an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35.
    (i) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class III price plus an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 965 and dividing 
the resulting amount by one hundred.
    (j) Protein price. The protein price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be 1.32 times the average monthly 
price per pound for 40-pound block Cheddar cheese on the National Cheese 
Exchange as reported by the Department.
    (k) Fluid carrier price. The fluid carrier price per hundredweight, 
rounded

[[Page 392]]

to the nearest whole cent, shall be the Class III price, less the sum of 
the butterfat price times 3.5 and the protein price times the average 
protein test of the basic formula price as reported by the Department 
for the month (this price may be negative).
    (l) Somatic cell adjustment. For each producer, an adjustment to the 
protein price for the somatic cell count of the producer's milk shall be 
determined by multiplying the constant associated with the appropriate 
somatic cell count interval in the following table by the simple average 
price for the month of 40-pound blocks of Cheddar cheese at the National 
Cheese Exchange as reported by the Department. If a handler has not 
determined a monthly average somatic cell count, it will be determined 
by the market administrator.

Sec. 1040.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1040.51 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per

[[Page 393]]

hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the current 
month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for the 
preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for the 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

    (b) For fluid milk products transferred in bulk from a pool plant to 
a pool plant described in Sec. 1040.7(a), the operator of the 
transferee-plant shall receive credit at the applicable zone or mileage 
rate, based on the location of the transferor-plant. The total volume on 
which such credit is computed shall be limited to the amount by which 
108 percent of Class I disposition at the transferee-plant is in excess 
of the sum of receipts at such plant:
    (1) From producers, (2) from cooperative associations pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.9(c), and (3) from other order plants and unregulated supply 
plants which are assigned in Class I, such assignment of receipts from 
the transferor-plant to be

Sec. 1040.60  Handler's value of milk.

    For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer 
milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value 
of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool 
plants and of each handler described in Sec. 1040.9 (b) and (c), as 
follows:
    (a) Calculate the following values:
    (1) Multiply the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class I as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(c) by the Class I differential price 
for the month;
    (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of 
producer milk in Class II as determined pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(c) by 
the Class II differential price for the month;
    (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of 
producer milk eligible to be priced as Class III-A by the Class III-A 
differential price for the month;
    (4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk in Class I as determined pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a) by the skim 
milk price;
    (5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a) by the 
average protein content of producer skim milk received by the handler, 
and multiplying the resulting pounds of protein by the protein price for 
the month computed pursuant to Sec. 1040.50(j) and adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.50(l) for the weighted average somatic cell content of the 
handler's receipts of milk; and
    (6) Add a fluid carrier value calculated as follows: Subtract from 
the pounds of skim milk allocated to Class II and Class III pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.44(a) the protein pounds contained therein, determined by 
multiplying the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III by the 
average protein content of producer skim milk received by the handler; 
then multiply the resulting pounds (in hundredweight) of fluid carrier 
by the fluid carrier price.
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1040.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1040.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class

[[Page 395]]

II price, as the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight 
of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant 
to Sec. 1040.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1040.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1040.43(e) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.44(a)(7)(i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1040.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a)(7)(v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1040.44(b);
    (f) Add an amount obtained from multiplying the Class I differential 
price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply 
plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of 
skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products 
assigned to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1040.43(e) and 
Sec. 1040.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1040.44(a)(11) and the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1040.44(b), excluding such skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or 
butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is 
not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1040.43(e);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1040.76(a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

    (1) The values computed pursuant to Sec. 1040.60 (a)(1), (a)(2), 
(a)(3) and (b) through (i) for all handlers who made reports pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.30 for the month and who made payments pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.71 for the preceding month;
    (2) Add the values computed pursuant to Sec. 1040.60 (a)(4), (a)(5), 
and (a)(6); and subtract the values obtained by multiplying the 
handlers' total pounds of protein and total hundredweight of fluid 
carrier contained in such milk by their respective prices;
    (3) Add an amount equal to the total value of the applicable 
location adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1040.75(a)(1); and

[[Page 396]]

    (4) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance in the producer-settlement fund.
    (b) Divide the aggregate value computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section by the sum of the following:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1040.60(f).

such month pursuant to Sec. 1040.72 he may reduce such payments 
uniformly per hundredweight for all producers, by an amount not in 
excess of the per hundredweight reduction in payment from the market 
administrator; however, the handler shall make such balance of payment

Sec. 1040.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1040.30(b) and 1040.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I 
differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both prices 
to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant (but not to be less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1040.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are

[[Page 400]]

classified in the corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section. Any such transfers remaining after the above allocation 
which are classified in Class I and for which a value is computed for 
the handler operating the partially regulated distributing plant 
pursuant to Sec. 1040.60 shall be priced at the statistical uniform 
price (or at the weighted average price if such is provided) of the 
respective order regulating the handling of milk at the transferee-
plant, with such statistical uniform price adjusted to the location of 
the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class price of the 
respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted skim milk in 
filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of the respective 
order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1040.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1040.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1040.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1040.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1040.7(b)(1), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1040.30(b) and 
1040.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received

administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1040.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments (adjusted to 3.5 percent butterfat value 
using the butterfat differential pursuant to Sec. 1040.74) by the 
operator of such partially regulated distributing plant for milk 
received at the plant during the month that would have been producer 
milk if the plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments (adjusted to 3.5 percent butterfat value using the butterfat 
differential pursuant to Sec. 1040.74) by the operator of such nonpool 
supply plant for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order

and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1040.43(e). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the

nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1044.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1044.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each fluid milk plant to the respective quantities of 
skim milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(6) of this section which was received in bulk fluid form;
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant and milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1044.10(c));
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1044.10(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another fluid milk plant, except that, in 
either case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph (b)(2) 
shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph 
shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other fluid milk 
plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

<R05>
Sec. 1044.42  Classification of transfers.

    (a) Transfers to fluid milk plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream 
product from a fluid milk plant to another fluid milk plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1044.44(a)(11) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1044.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1044.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1044.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1044.44(a)(11) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1044.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if 
the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers to other order plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream 
product from a fluid milk plant to an other order plant shall be 
classified in the following manner. Such classification shall apply only 
to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any receipts at the 
fluid milk plant from the other order plant of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products, 
respectively, that are in the same category as described in paragraph 
(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers in bulk form shall be classified as Class II 
or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization available for such 
classification pursuant to the allocation provisions of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers 
were allocated under the other order is not available to the market 
administrator for the purpose of establishing classification under this 
paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to adjustment 
when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and

[[Page 410]]

    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1044.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and to exempt plants. Skim milk 
or butterfat in the following forms that is transferred from a fluid 
milk plant to a producer-handler under this or any other Federal order 
or to an exempt plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonfluid milk plants. Skim 
milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a 
fluid milk plant to a nonfluid milk plant that is not an other order 
plant, a producer-handler plant or an exempt plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonfluid milk plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1044.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonfluid milk plant operator maintains books and records 
showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such 
plant which are made available for verification purposes if requested by 
the market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonfluid milk plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonfluid milk plant to plants fully regulated 
thereunder shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonfluid milk plant from fluid milk plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonfluid milk plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such 
nonfluid milk plant from fluid milk plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonfluid milk plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonfluid milk plant shall be assigned to the extent 
possible pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonfluid milk plant from fluid milk plants and 
other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonfluid milk 
plant to a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the 
extent that such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of 
fluid milk products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the 
transferee-plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the 
following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonfluid 
milk plant from fluid milk plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonfluid milk plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonfluid 
milk plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:

[[Page 411]]

    (A) To such nonfluid milk plant's receipts from dairy farmers who 
the market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade 
A milk for such nonfluid milk plant; and
    (B) To such nonfluid milk plant's receipts of Grade A milk from 
plants not fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonfluid milk plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonfluid milk plant from fluid milk plants and other order plants 
shall be assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible 
first to any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II 
utilization, and then to Class III utilization at such nonfluid milk 
plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonfluid milk 
plant from fluid milk plants and other order plants shall be assigned, 
pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to any 
remaining Class II utilization, then to any remaining Class III 
utilization, and then to Class I utilization at such nonfluid milk 
plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonfluid milk plant's utilization for 
purposes of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonfluid milk plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.

Sec. 1044.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1044.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1044.30 and shall compute separately for each fluid milk plant and 
for each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is 
the handler pursuant to Sec. 1044.10 (c) or (d) the pounds of skim milk 
and butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with 
Secs. 1044.40, 1044.41, and 1044.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1044.10 (c) or (d) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any fluid milk plant 
operated by such cooperative association;
    (d) Bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted from a fluid 
milk plant operated by a cooperative association to another fluid milk 
plant shall be classified in accordance with the rules set forth in 
Sec. 1044.42(a) and the value thereof at class prices (applicable at the 
location of the transferee-plant) shall be used to compute the receiving 
handler's net obligation for such milk pursuant to Sec. 1044.60; and
    (e) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1044.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1044.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (f) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

<R05>
Sec. 1044.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk at each fluid milk plant described in 
Sec. 1044.10(a) by allocating the plant's receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat to its utilization pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (c) of 
this section.
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1044.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; and
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the fluid milk plant was 
subject to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of 
another Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from any other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1044.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1044.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph (a)(5) shall apply 
only if the fluid milk plant was subject to the provisions of this 
paragraph or comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the 
immediately preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to, any product specified in Sec. 1044.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1044.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1044.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from 
unregulated supply plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that

[[Page 413]]

reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) Receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant 
that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(7)(v) 
of this section for which the handler requests classification other than 
Class I, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class 
II and Class III combined;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply 
plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i), 
(a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) of this section which are in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) (A) 
through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim milk to be 
subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II 
and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class 
III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such 
classes at the nearest other fluid milk plant of the handler, and then 
at each successively more distant fluid milk plant of the handler) by an 
amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of 
skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, 
the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step 
at the handler's other fluid milk plants shall be adjusted in the 
reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
this allocation step (exclusive of transfers between fluid milk plants 
of the same handler) at all fluid milk plants of the handler;
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all fluid milk plants of the handler of producer 
milk, fluid milk products from fluid milk plants of other handlers, and 
bulk fluid milk products from other order plants that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants remaining at this fluid milk plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all fluid milk plants of the 
handler; and
    (iii) Receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an other order plant 
that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted 
to such plant and that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II or Class III classification is 
requested by the operator of the other order plant and the handler, but 
not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class 
III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1044.40(b)(1) in inventory

price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for

    (i) A plant that qualifies as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph 
(a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section and a greater volume of fluid milk 
products, except filled milk, is disposed of from such plant in the

I price that would be applicable at the plant if regulated under the 
order for the Federal order marketing area in which the plant has the 
greatest route disposition; and

of this section and which also meets the requirements of a fully 
regulated plant pursuant to the provisions of another Federal order on

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1046.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The total shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, at 
each pool plant, which shall be assigned pro rata to:
    (1) The quantity of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, that is 
equal to 50 times the maximum amount that may be computed pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) The quantity of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in other 
source milk received in bulk form as fluid milk products or bulk fluid 
cream products, excluding any such receipts used in the computations 
pursuant to paragraphs (b) (5) and (6) of this section;
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in

producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant);
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1046.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph (b)(2) 
shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph 
shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;

[[Page 428]]

    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;

applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 1046.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant or by a 
handler described in Sec. 1046.9(c) to another handler's pool plant 
shall be classified as Class I milk unless both handlers request the 
same classification in another class. In either case, the classification 
of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1046.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1046.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1046.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1046.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk;
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1046.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of Sec. 1046.44(b), the skim 
milk or butterfat, so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source 
milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than 
would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee-plant; and
    (4) If a specified classification is not claimed by both handlers in 
the case of transfers or diversions by such a cooperative association, 
such skim milk and butterfat shall be classified pro rata to the 
respective amounts remaining in each class at the pool plant of the 
transferee- or divertee-handler after making the assignments pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1046.44(b), and 
after the assignment of milk for which a specified classification has 
been claimed pursuant to this paragraph.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as

[[Page 429]]

described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1046.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1046.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence;
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;

[[Page 430]]

    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in this paragraph.

Sec. 1046.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1046.9(b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1046.40, 
1046.41, and 1046.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1046.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to

[[Page 431]]

the reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, 
on a pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1046.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1046.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

<R05>
Sec. 1046.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1046.9(a) for each of his pool plants separately and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1046.9(b) and (c) by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1046.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1046.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1046.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1046.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1046.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form

[[Page 432]]

of an unconcentrated fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section applies, packaged inventory at the beginning of the month 
of products specified in Sec. 1046.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted 
pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor plant; 
and
    (vii) Receipts of milk from a dairy farmer described in 
Sec. 1046.12(b)(4);
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) (2)(i), and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1046.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1046.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the

[[Page 433]]

month that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), 
(a)(5), and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II 
and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class 
III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such 
classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an 
amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1046.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;

[[Page 434]]

    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraphs (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant or a handler described in 
Sec. 1046.9(c) according to the classification of such products pursuant 
to Sec. 1046.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage.''
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1046.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1046.44 (a)(12) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1046.44(b), estimate and publicly announce 
the utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during 
the month, of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of 
all handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the most current 
available data and shall be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1046.43(d) and Sec. 1046.44 on 
the basis of such report (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report

[[Page 435]]

by the receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such 
allocation arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 15th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association, which so requests, with respect to milk 
delivered by such association or by its members to each handler during 
the month:
    (1) The percentage of such receipts classified in each class; and 
(2) the percentage relationship of such receipts to the total pounds of 
Class I milk available to assign to such receipts exclusive of the Class 
I milk disposed of by such handler to the pool plant(s) of other 
handlers and to nonpool plants. For the purpose of these reports, the 
milk received from such association shall be treated on a pro rata basis 
of the total producer milk received by such handler during the month.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1046.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:

    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average

[[Page 436]]

for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported by the 
Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this

Sec. 1046.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of each handler 
described in Sec. 1046.9(b) and (c) as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk in each class as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1046.44 by the applicable class prices and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1046.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1046.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1046.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1046.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1046.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and (vii) and the corresponding step 
of Sec. 1046.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from 
an other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1046.44(a)(7)(v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1046.44(b); and
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1046.43(d) and Sec. 1046.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1046.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of

[[Page 438]]

bulk fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent 
that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such 
plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is 
classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for 
any other payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1046.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1046.76(a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

    (2) A copy of each such request, promise to reimburse and certified 
list of members shall be filed simultaneously with the market 
administrator by the cooperative association and shall be subject to 
verification at his discretion through audit of the records of the 
cooperative association pertaining thereto. Exceptions, if any, to the 
accuracy of such certification by a producer claimed to be a member, or 
by a handler, shall be made by written notice to the market 
administrator and shall be subject to his determination.
    (d) In making the payments to producers pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section, each handler shall furnish each producer a supporting 
statement which shall show the following:
    (1) The month and identity of the producer;
    (2) The total pounds and the average butterfat content of milk 
received from such producer;
    (3) [Reserved].
    (4) The minimum rate at which payment to the producer is required 
under the order;
    (5) The rate used in making the payment if such rate(s) is other 
than the applicable minimum rate;
    (6) The amount or rate per hundredweight and nature of each 
deduction claimed by the handler; and
    (7) The net amount of payment to such producer.
    (e) In making payments to a cooperative association pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section, each handler shall report to such 
cooperative association for each such producer on forms approved by the 
market administrator as follows:
    (1) On or before the 20th day of the month, the total pounds of milk 
received during the first 15 days of such month;
    (2) On or before the 7th day of the following month, the total 
pounds of milk received each month, together with the butterfat content 
of such milk and the amount of deductions claimed by such handler; and
    (3) On or before the 7th day after the end of each month of March 
through June, the total pounds of base milk received.
    (f) Each handler shall pay to the cooperative association for milk 
received from it as a handler described in Sec. 1046.9(c) as follows:
    (1) On or before 2 days prior to the last day of the month for milk 
received during the first 15 days of the month, an amount computed at 
not less than the applicable rate pursuant to paragraph (a) of this

Sec. 1046.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1046.30(b) and 1046.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(but not to be less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating

[[Page 442]]

the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plants;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1046.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1046.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1046.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1046.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1046.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1046.7(b) and 
(c), subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1046.30(b) and 
1046.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1046.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1046.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month

[[Page 443]]

that would have been producer milk if the plant had been fully 
regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1046.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1046.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1046.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    (a) Whenever verification by the market administrator of payments by 
any handler discloses errors made in payments to the producer-settlement 
fund pursuant to Sec. 1046.71 or to the transportation credit balancing 
fund pursuant to Sec. 1046.81, the market administrator shall promptly 
bill such handler for any unpaid amount and such handler shall, within 
15 days, make payment to the market administrator of the amount so 
billed. Whenever verification discloses that payment is due from the 
market administrator to any handler pursuant to Sec. 1046.72 or 
Sec. 1046.82, the market administrator shall make payment to such 
handler within 15 days or, in the case of the transportation credit 
balancing fund, as soon as funds become available. If a handler is due 
additional payment for a month in which payments to handlers were 
prorated pursuant to Sec. 1046.82(a), the additional payment pursuant to 
this section shall be multiplied by the final proration percentage 
computed in Sec. 1046.82(a)(2).
    (b) Whenever verification by the market administrator of the payment 
by a handler to any producer or cooperative association for milk 
received by such handler discloses payment of less than is required by 
Sec. 1046.73, the handler shall pay such balance due such producer or 
cooperative association not later than the time of making payment to 
producers or cooperative associations next following such disclosure.

    The market administrator shall maintain a separate fund known as the 
Transportation Credit Balancing Fund into which shall be deposited the 
payments made by handlers pursuant to Sec. 1046.81 and out of which 
shall be made the payments due handlers pursuant to Sec. 1046.82.

Sec. 1046.81  Payments to the transportation credit balancing fund.

    (a) On or before the 15th day after the end of the month, each 
handler operating a pool plant and each handler specified in Sec. 1046.9 
(b) and (c) shall pay to the market administrator a transportation 
credit balancing fund assessment determined by multiplying the pounds of 
Class I producer milk assigned pursuant to Sec. 1046.44 by $0.06 per 
hundredweight or such lesser amount as the market administrator deems 
necessary to maintain a balance in the fund equal to the total 
transportation credits disbursed during the prior June-January period. 
In the event that during any month of the June-January period the fund 
balance is insufficient to cover the amount of credits that are due, the 
assessment should be based upon the amount of credits that would have 
been disbursed had the fund balance been sufficient.
    (b) The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before 
the 5th day of the month the assessment pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section for the following month.

<R05>
Sec. 1046.82  Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund.

    (a) Payments from the transportation credit balancing fund to 
handlers and cooperative associations requesting transportation credits 
shall be made as follows:
    (1) On or before the 16th day after the end of each of the months of 
July through December and any other month in which transportation 
credits are in effect pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the 
market administrator shall pay to each handler that received, and 
reported pursuant to Sec. 1046.30(a)(5), bulk milk transferred from 
another order plant as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or 
that received, and reported pursuant to Sec. 1046.30(a)(6), milk 
directly from producers' farms as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, a preliminary amount determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of 
this section to the extent that funds are available in the 
transportation credit balancing fund. If an insufficient balance exists 
to pay all of the credits computed pursuant to this section, the market 
administrator shall distribute the balance available in the 
transportation credit balancing fund by reducing payments prorata using 
the percentage derived by dividing the balance in the fund by the total 
credits that are due for the month. The amount of credits resulting from 
this initial proration shall be subject to audit adjustment pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (2) The market administrator shall accept adjusted requests for 
transportation credits on or before the 20th day of the month following 
the month for which such credits were requested pursuant to 
Sec. 1046.32(c). After such date, a preliminary audit will be conducted 
by the market administrator, who will recalculate any necessary 
proration of transportation credit payments for the preceding month 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Handlers will be promptly 
notified of an overpayment of credits based upon this final computation 
and remedial payments to or from the transportation credit balancing 
fund will be made on or before the next payment date for the following 
month;
    (3) Transportation credits paid pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) and 
(2) of this section shall be subject to final verification by the market 
administrator pursuant to Sec. 1046.77. Adjusted payments to or from the 
transportation credit balancing fund will remain subject to the final 
proration established pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and
    (4) In the event that a qualified cooperative association is the 
responsible party for whose account such milk is received and written 
documentation of this fact is provided to the market administrator 
pursuant to Sec. 1046.30(c)(3) prior to the date payment is due, the 
transportation credits for such milk computed pursuant to this section 
shall be made to such cooperative association by the pool plant operator 
pursuant to Sec. 1046.73(f)(2).

[[Page 445]]

    (b) The market administrator may extend the period during which 
transportation credits are in effect (i.e., the transportation credit 
period) to the months of January and June if a written request to do so 
is received 15 days prior to the beginning of the month for which the 
request is made and, after conducting an independent investigation, 
finds that such extension is necessary to assure the market of an 
adequate supply of milk for fluid use. Before making such a finding, the 
market administrator shall notify the Director of the Dairy Division and 
all handlers in the market that an extension is being considered and 
invite written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to extend the 
transportation credit period must be issued in writing prior to the 
first day of the month for which the extension is to be effective.
    (c) Transportation credits shall apply to the following milk:
    (1) Bulk milk received from a plant regulated under another Federal 
order, except Federal Orders 1005, 1007, and 1011, and allocated to 
Class I milk pursuant to Sec. 1046.44(a)(12); and
    (2) Bulk milk received directly from the farms of dairy farmers at 
pool distributing plants subject to the following conditions:
    (i) The quantity of such milk that shall be eligible for the 
transportation credit shall be determined by multiplying the total 
pounds of milk received from producers meeting the conditions of this 
paragraph by the lower of:
    (A) The marketwide estimated Class I utilization of all handlers for 
the month pursuant to Sec. 1046.45(a); or
    (B) The Class I utilization of all producer milk of the pool plant 
operator receiving the milk after the computations described in 
Sec. 1046.44;
    (ii) The dairy farmer was not a ``producer'' under this order during 
more than 2 of the immediately preceding months of January through June 
and not more than 50 percent of the production of the dairy farmer 
during those 2 months, in aggregate, was received as producer milk under 
this order during those 2 months. However, if January and/or June are 
months in which transportation credits are disbursed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, these months shall not be included in the 
2-month limit provided in this paragraph; and
    (iii) The farm on which the milk was produced is not located within 
the specified marketing area of this order or the marketing areas of 
Federal Orders 1005, 1007, or 1011, or within the Kentucky counties of 
Allen, Barren, Metcalfe, Monroe, Simpson, and Warren.
    (d) Transportation credits shall be computed as follows:
    (1) The market administrator shall subtract from the pounds of milk 
described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section the pounds of 
bulk milk transferred from the pool plant receiving the supplemental 
milk if milk was transferred to a nonpool plant on the same calendar day 
that the supplemental milk was received. For this purpose, the 
transferred milk shall be subtracted from the most distant load of 
supplemental milk received, and then in sequence with the next most 
distant load until all of the transfers have been offset;
    (2) With respect to the pounds of milk described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section that remain after the computations described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the market administrator shall:
    (i) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between the 
shipping plant and the receiving plant;
    (ii) Multiply the number of miles so determined by 0.35 cent;
    (iii) Subtract the other order's Class I price applicable at the 
shipping plant's location from the Class I price applicable at the 
receiving plant as specified in Sec. 1046.52;
    (iv) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section; and
    (v) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this 
section by the hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(2) 
introductory text of this section.
    (3) For milk described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the 
market administrator shall:
    (i) Determine an origination point for each load of milk by locating 
the nearest city to the last producer's farm

[[Page 446]]

 from which milk was picked up for delivery to the receiving pool plant. 
Alternatively, the milk hauler that is transporting the milk of 
producers described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may establish an 
origination point following the last farm pickup by stopping at the 
nearest independently-operated truck stop with a certified truck scale 
and obtaining a weight certificate indicating the weight of the truck 
and its contents, the date and time of weighing, and the location of the 
truck stop;
    (ii) Determine the shortest hard-surface highway distance between 
the receiving pool plant and the truck stop or city, as the case may be;
    (iii) Subtract 85 miles from the mileage so determined;
    (iv) Multiply the remaining miles so computed by 0.35 cent;
    (v) If the origination point determined pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section is in a Federal order marketing area, subtract 
the Class I price applicable at the origination point pursuant to the 
provisions of such other order (as if the origination point were a plant 
location) from the Class I price applicable at the distributing plant 
receiving the milk. If the origination point is not in any Federal order 
marketing area, determine the Class I price at the origination point 
based upon the provisions of this order and subtract this price from the 
Class I price applicable at the distributing plant receiving the milk;
    (vi) Subtract any positive difference computed in paragraph 
(d)(3)(v) of this section from the amount computed in paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv) of this section; and
    (vii) Multiply the remainder computed in paragraph (d)(3)(vi) by the 
hundredweight of milk described in paragraph (d)(3) introductory text of 
this section.

    (a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
handler, in making payments to producers pursuant to Sec. 1046.73(b), 
shall deduct 5 cents per hundredweight, or such amount not in excess 
thereof as the Secretary may prescribe, with respect to all milk 
received by such handler from producers (other than such handler's own 
farm production) during the month and shall pay such deductions to the 
market administrator on or before the 15th day after the end of such 
month. Such moneys shall be used by the market administrator to verify 
weights, samples, and tests of milk received from such producers and to 
provide such producers with market information. Such services shall be 
performed in whole or in part by the market administrator or by an agent 
engaged by and responsible to him.
    (b) Each cooperative association which is actually performing the 
services described in paragraph (a) of this section, as determined by 
the market administrator, may file with a handler a claim for authorized 
deductions from

 the payments otherwise due to its producer members for milk delivered 
to such handler. Such claim shall contain a list of the producers for 
whom such deductions apply, an agreement to indemnify the handler in the 
making of the deductions, and a certification that the association has 
an unterminated membership contract with each producer. In making 
payments to producers for milk received during the month, each handler 
shall make, in lieu of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section, deductions in accordance with the association's claim and shall 
pay the amount deducted to the association within 15 days after the end 
of the month.

<R05>
Sec. 1049.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A distributing plant with:
    (1) Total route disposition of not less than 40 percent during each 
of the months of September through February, 35 percent during each of 
the months of March through July, and 30 percent during the month of 
August, of its total receipts of fluid milk products (including milk 
diverted from such plant but excluding bulk fluid milk products received 
by transfer or diversion from other plants as Class II or Class III 
milk) that are approved by a duly constituted health authority for fluid 
consumption, subject to the following conditions:
    (i) In making the percentage computations in paragraphs (a) (1) and 
(2) of this section, a plant's route disposition and receipts shall be 
exclusive of filled milk and of packaged fluid milk products received 
from other pool or other Federal order plants;

[[Page 449]]

    (ii) A plant meeting such percentage requirement for the two 
immediately preceding months and the requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section for the current month may remain qualified under this 
paragraph in the current month; and
    (iii) A plant meeting the requirements of this paragraph in each of 
the months of September through May, inclusive, shall continue to have 
pool plant status in the months of June and July immediately following 
if the plant meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (2) Route disposition within the marketing area during the month of 
at least 10 percent of such receipts, such route disposition to be 
exclusive of packaged fluid milk products received from other plants and

months of September through February and not less than 35 percent during 
the months of March through August, of the Grade A milk received from 
producers (including producer milk diverted from the plant but excluding 
milk diverted to such plant) and from handlers described in 
Sec. 1049.9(c) at such plant during the month is shipped to plants 
qualifying for the month pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. A 
plant qualified pursuant to this paragraph in each of the immediately 
preceding months of September through February shall remain so qualified 
for the months of April through August unless written application is 
filed with the market administrator on or before the first day of any 
such month to designate such plant as a nonpool plant for such month and 
for each subsequent month through August during which it would otherwise 
not qualify under this paragraph. Pool supply plant qualification shall 
be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The operator of a supply plant may include milk diverted from 
such plant to pool distributing plants as qualifying deliveries in 
meeting up to one-half of the required deliveries;
    (2) Shipments to be used in determining qualifying percentages shall 
be milk transferred or diverted and physically received by distributing 
pool plants, less any transfers or diversions of bulk fluid milk 
products from such distributing pool plants; and
    (3) The shipping percentage requirements of this paragraph may be 
increased or decreased temporarily by up to 10 percentage points by the 
market administrator if such person finds that such revision is 
necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. 
Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate 
the need for revision on either such person's own initiative or at the 
request of interested persons. If the investigation shows that a 
temporary revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall 
issue a notice stating that revision is being considered and invite 
data, views, or arguments in favor of or in opposition to the proposed 
temporary revision.
    (c) Any plant that qualifies as a pool plant in each of the 
immediately preceding three months pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section or by meeting the shipping percentages in paragraph (b) of this 
section that is unable to meet such performance standards for the 
current month because of unavoidable circumstances determined by the 
market administrator to be beyond the control of the handler operating 
the plant, such as a natural disaster (ice storm, wind storm, flood) 
fire, breakdown of equipment, or work stoppage, shall be considered to 
have met the minimum performance standards during the period of such 
unavoidable circumstances, but such relief shall not be granted for more 
than two consecutive months.
    (d) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A distributing plant from which the Secretary determines there 
is a greater proportion of route disposition (except filled milk) in 
another marketing area regulated by another order issued pursuant to the 
Act and such plant is fully subject to regulation of such other order: 
Provided, That a distributing plant which was a pool plant under this 
order in the immediately preceding month shall continue to be subject to 
all of the provisions of this part until the third consecutive month in 
which it has a greater proportion of its route disposition (except 
filled

[[Page 450]]

milk) in such other marketing area, unless, notwithstanding the 
provisions of this paragraph, it is regulated by such other order;
    (3) A distributing plant which meets the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section which also meets the requirements of another order 
on the basis of its route disposition in such other marketing area and 
from which the Secretary determines there is a greater quantity of route 
disposition (except filled milk) during the month in this marketing area 
than in such other marketing area but which plant is nevertheless fully 
regulated under such other order;
    (4) A supply plant which during the month is fully subject to the 
pricing and pooling provisions of another order issued pursuant to the 
Act, unless such plant is qualified as a pool plant pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section and a greater volume of fluid milk 
products (except filled milk) is moved to pool distributing plants 
qualified on the basis of route disposition in this marketing area; and
    (5) That portion of a plant that is physically separated from the 
Grade A portion of such plant, is operated separately and is not 
approved by any health authority for the receiving, processing or 
packaging of any fluid milk product for Grade A disposition.

    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through

milk received from a handler pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(c), except that if 
the handler operating the pool plant files notice with the market 
administrator that he is purchasing such milk on the basis of weights 
determined from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests 
determined from farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under 
this paragraph shall be 2.0 percent;
    (3) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that if 
the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such 
milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm 
and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage under this paragraph (b)(3) shall be 2 percent;
    (4) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the

<R05>
Sec. 1049.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk and butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product to a pool 
plant from another pool plant or by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(b) 
or (c) and skim milk and butterfat transferred in the form of a bulk 
fluid cream product between pool plants shall be classified as Class I 
milk unless both parties to each such transfer or diversion request the 
same classification in another class. In either case, the classification 
of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1049.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1049.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1049.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1049.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1049.44(a)(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1049.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, 
up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such 
receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk 
to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which

[[Page 457]]

allocated under the other order (including allocation under the 
conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under such 
other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 1049.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product; unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1049.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products

[[Page 458]]

from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible pro rata 
to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk products at 
such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in this paragraph.

Sec. 1049.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1049.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1049.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and each 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1049.40, 
1049.41 and 1049.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1049.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1049.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of

[[Page 459]]

such receipts is established by the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III--A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

<R05>
Sec. 1049.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
pool plant the classification of milk received from producers and from 
handlers pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(b) or (c) and the classification of 
milk received from producers by each handler pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(b) 
or (c) that was not received at a pool plant, as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1049.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1049.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1049.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph (a)(5) shall apply 
only if the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph 
or comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the 
immediately preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1049.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1049.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1049.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;

[[Page 460]]

    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and then Class III combined shall be increased (increasing 
as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in decreased by a like amount. In such case, each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk at all pool plants of the handler in producer milk, receipts of 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, from handlers 
pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(b) and (c), and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated

of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;

Sec. 1049.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1049.44 (a)(12) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1049.44(b), estimate and publicly announce 
the utilization (to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during 
the month of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of 
all handlers. Such estimate shall be based upon the most current 
available data and shall be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1049.43(d) and Sec. 1049.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association, upon request by such association, the 
percentage of the milk caused to be delivered by the cooperative 
association or its members which was utilized in each class at each pool 
plant receiving such milk. For the

[[Page 463]]

purpose of this report, the milk so received shall be allocated to each 
class at each pool plant in the same ratio as all producer milk received 
at such plant during the month.

prices for the month, per hundredweight or per pound, shall be as 
follows:
    (a) Class I. The Class I price shall be the basic formula price for 
the second preceding month plus $1.90.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound shall be the 
total of the following steps, rounded to the nearest whole cent:
    (1) The skim milk price per hundredweight for the month, computed 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, divided by 100; and
    (2) The butterfat differential for the month, computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1049.74 multiplied by 10.
    (e) Milk protein price. The price per pound for milk protein shall 
be computed by subtracting from the Class III price the butterfat price 
multiplied by 3.5, and dividing the result by the average protein 
content of the milk on which the basic formula price is based for the 
previous month as reported by the Department and adjusted for the 
current month by the Dairy Division, and rounding the result to the 
nearest whole cent.
    (f) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight shall be 
computed by subtracting from the Class III price the butterfat 
differential computed pursuant to Sec. 1049.74 times 35, and rounding 
the result to the nearest whole cent.
    (g) Class III--A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Central States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as 
reported by the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by 
subtracting from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat 
dry milk price, plus the butterfat differential value per hundredweight 
of 3.5 percent milk and rounded to the nearest cent.

    For each month the market administrator shall compute the weighted 
average differential value for milk received from all producers as 
follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1049.60, paragraphs (a) through (g) and (j) and (k), for all 
handlers who made reports pursuant to Sec. 1049.30 and who made payments 
pursuant to Sec. 1049.71 for the preceding month;
    (b) Add an amount equal to the total value of the minus location 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1049.75(a);
    (c) Subtract an amount equal to the total value of the plus location 
differentials computed pursuant to Sec. 1049.75(a);
    (d) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half the unobligated 
balance in the producer-settlement fund;

Sec. 1049.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 15th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay to the market administrator the amount, if any, by 
which the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds 
the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (1) The total obligation of the handler for such month as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1049.60.
    (2) The sum of:

[[Page 469]]

    (i) The value of such handler's receipts of producer milk at the 
weighted average differential price adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1049.75;
    (ii) The value of the protein in such handler's receipts of producer 
milk at the producer protein price computed pursuant to Sec. 1049.62; 
and
    (iii) The value at the weighted average differential price 
applicable at the location of the plant from which received of other 
source milk for which a value is computed pursuant to Sec. 1049.60(g).
    (b) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month each person 
who operated an other plant that was regulated during such month under 
an order providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay to the 
market administrator an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.

administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the 
amount computed pursuant to Sec. 1049.71(a)(2) exceeds the amount 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1049.71(a)(1). If the balance in the producer-
settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this 
section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments 
and shall complete such payments as soon as the necessary funds become 
available.


<R05>
Sec. 1049.73  Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

    (a) Each handler shall pay each producer for producer milk for which 
payment is not made to a cooperative association pursuant to paragraph

received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than the 
Class III price for the preceding month; and
    (2) On or before the 18th day after the end of the month to each 
producer, not less than the value determined pursuant to Sec. 1049.65, 
less any payment made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and 
less the deduction for advertising and promotion made pursuant to 
Sec. 1049.107. If by such date the handler has not received full payment 
from the market administrator pursuant to Sec. 1049.72 for such month, 
he may reduce pro rata his payments to producers by not more than the 
amount of such underpayment. Payment to producers shall be completed 
thereafter not later than the date for making payments pursuant to this 
paragraph next following receipt of the balance due from the market 
administrator.
    (b) Each handler shall make payment to the cooperative association 
for producer milk, if such cooperative association is authorized to

amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise payable for 
such producer milk, as follows:
    (1) On or before two days prior to the last day of each month for 
producer milk received during the first 15 days of the month; and
    (2) On or before the 16th day after the end of each month for milk 
received during such month.
    (c) Each handler shall pay a cooperative association for milk 
received by the handler from the cooperative association as follows:

[[Page 470]]

    (1) In the case of milk received from a pool plant(s) operated by a 
cooperative association:
    (i) For milk received during the first 15 days of the month, the 
handler shall pay the cooperative association on or before two days 
prior to the last day of such month not less than the Class III price 
for the preceding month;
    (ii) For milk received during the month the handler shall pay the 
cooperative association on or before the 10th day of the following month 
not less than the applicable class prices pursuant to Sec. 1049.50 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1049.74 and 
less any payments made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section; 
and
    (2) Each handler pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(a) who receives milk from a 
cooperative association as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1049.9(b) or (c), 
including the milk of producers who are not members of such association, 
and who the market administrator determines have authorized such 
cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, shall pay 
such cooperative for such milk as follows:
    (i) On or before two days prior to the last day of the month for 
milk received during the first 15 days of the month, not less than the 
Class III price for the preceding month;
    (ii) On or before the 16th day of the following month for milk 
received during the month, not less than the value of milk determined

Sec. 1049.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1049.30(b) and 1049.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(except that the Class I price and the weighted average price shall not 
be less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1049.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the

[[Page 472]]

fully regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1049.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order) except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1049.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1049.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1049.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1049.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1049.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1049.30(b) and 
1049.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1049.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1049.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1049.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1049.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the

[[Page 473]]

nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

    (4) As long as the Dairy Research and Promotion Order is in effect, 
remit to any qualified programs any refunds designated by producers to 
be paid to such programs no later than the last day of the month 
following the month in which the milk was marketed. If a refund request 
does not designate a qualified program to receive such money, the refund

during the 12-month period beginning with April of the current year: 
Provided, That the rate shall be 10 cents per hundredweight as long as 
the Dairy Research and Promotion Order is in effect.
    (f) As soon as possible after the rate of withholding is computed,

    (b) Represented by the difference between the quantity of milk 
received by a handler described in Sec. 1050.9(c) at producers' farms 
and the quantity of such milk delivered to pool plants. For the purposes 
of Secs. 1050.52 and 1050.75, such milk shall be deemed to have been 
received by such handler at the pool plant to which all other producer 
milk in the same tank truck was delivered;
    (c) Diverted by a handler from a pool plant for the account of the 
plant operator to another pool plant(s) for not more days of production 
of such producer's milk than is physically received at a pool plant(s) 
from which diverted. For pricing purposes such diverted milk shall be 
deemed to be received by the diverting handler at the location of the 
plant to which diverted;
    (d) Diverted from a pool plant to a nonpool plant that is not a 
producer-handler plant, subject to the conditions of this paragraph. For 
pricing purposes, milk so diverted shall be deemed to be received at the 
plant from which diverted, unless the plant to which the milk is 
diverted is located more than 110 miles from the city hall in Peoria, 
Ill. (by shortest highway distance as determined by the market 
administrator) in which case the milk shall be deemed to be received by 
the diverting handler at the location of the plant to which diverted:
    (1) During May, June and July the operator of a pool plant or a 
cooperative association may divert the milk production of a producer on 
any number of days;
    (2) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section, during the months of August through April the operator of a 
pool plant may divert the milk of a producer for not more days of 
production of such producer's milk than it is physically received at the 
pool plant from which diverted: Provided, That the total quantity of 
producer milk diverted does not exceed 35 percent of the physical 
receipts of producer milk at the handler's pool plant during the month, 
exclusive of milk of producers who are members of a cooperative 
association that is diverting milk and the milk of other producers that 
is diverted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
    (3) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section, during the months of August through April a cooperative 
association may divert the milk of producers for not more days of 
production of each producer's milk than is physically received at a pool 
plant: Provided, That the total quantity of producer milk does not 
exceed 35 percent of (i) its member milk physically received at pool 
plants during such month and (ii) other producer milk for which the 
cooperative association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1050.9(c) during 
such month;
    (4) In the case where a cooperative association has notified the 
market administrator and the handler in writing prior to the first day 
of the month that milk of specified member producers will not be 
diverted by the cooperative and is not to be included in computing the 
cooperative association's diversion percentage for the month, milk of 
such producers shall be deducted from the cooperative's total receipts 
of member milk for the purposes specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section and added to the total milk receipts included in computing the 
diversions of the pool plant handler who receives their milk for the 
purposes specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and
    (5) When milk is diverted in excess of the limits specified in 
paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, eligibility as producer milk 
under this section shall be forfeited on the excess quantity. In such 
event the diverting handler shall specify the dairy farmers whose milk 
is

[[Page 482]]

ineligible as producer milk. If a handler fails to designate such dairy 
farmers whose milk is ineligible, producer milk status shall be 
forfeited with respect to all milk diverted to nonpool plants by such 
handler.

    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through

    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1050.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph (b)(2) 
shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph 
shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

Sec. 1050.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1050.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1050.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1050.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1050.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.44(a)(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1050.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so tranferred or diverted, 
up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such 
receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk 
to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other

[[Page 487]]

order is not available to the market administrator for the purpose of 
establishing classification under this paragraph, classification shall 
be as Class I, subject to adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1050.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1050.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:

[[Page 488]]

    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;

Sec. 1050.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1050.9(b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1050.40, 
1050.41, and 1050.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1050.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1050.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1050.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

Sec. 1050.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1050.9(a) for each of his pool plants separately and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1050.9(b) and (c) by allocating the handler's 
receipts of

[[Page 489]]

skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1050.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1050.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1050.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1050.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1050.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1050.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an

[[Page 490]]

unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler requests a 
classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1050.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II 
and Class III

[[Page 491]]

combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then 
Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the 
nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively 
more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I 
shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's 
other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like 
amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an 
amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1050.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse directions by a like 
amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall

[[Page 492]]

be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount beginning with the 
nearest plant at which Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1050.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1050.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1050.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1050.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1050.43(d) and Sec. 1050.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operation a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests, the class utilization of 
producer milk received by each handler from a cooperative association or 
from members of the association. For the purpose of this report, the 
milk caused to be so delivered by an association shall be prorated to 
each class in the proportion that the total receipts of milk received 
from producers by such handler were used in each class.

Sec. 1050.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1050.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and

Sec. 1050.52  Plant location adjustments for handlers.

    (a) The Class I price for producer milk at a plant located outside 
the State of Illinois or in the State of Illinois but north of the 
northernmost boundaries of the counties of Mercer, Henry, Bureau, La 
Salle, Grundy, and Kankakee shall be reduced 10 cents if such plant is 
50 miles or more from the City Hall in Peoria, Illinois, plus an 
additional 2.0 cents for each 10 miles or fraction thereof that such 
distance exceeds 60 miles. Distances applied pursuant to this paragraph 
shall be the shortest hard-surfaced highway distances as determined by 
the market administrator from the latest Mileage Guide as published by 
the Household Goods Carrier's Bureau.
    (b) For purposes of calculating such adjustment, bulk transfers 
between pool plants shall be assigned Class I disposition at the 
transferee-plant only to the extent that 105 percent of Class I 
disposition at the transferee-plant exceeds the sum of receipts at such 
plant from producers and cooperative associations pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.9(c), and the volume assigned as Class I to receipts from 
other order plants and unregulated supply plants; such assignment to be 
made first to transferor-plants at which no location adjustment credit 
is applicable and then in sequence beginning with the plant at which the 
least location adjustment would apply.
    (c) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be 
adjusted at the rates set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, except 
that the adjusted Class I price shall not be less than the Class III 
price.

<R05>
Sec. 1050.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of each handler 
described in Sec. 1050.9 (b) and (c) as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk in each class as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1050.44 by the applicable class prices and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1050.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1050.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1050.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1050.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the

[[Page 495]]

Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class 
III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1050.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1050.44(a)(7) (i) 
through (iv) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1050.44(b), excluding 
receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an other order plant and bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, other order plants 
and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1050.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1050.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1050.43(d) and Sec. 1050.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1050.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1050.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1050.76 (a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1050.61  Computation of uniform price (including weighted average price).

    For each month the market administrator shall compute the uniform 
price per hundredweight of milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content which 
is received from producers at plants at which no location adjustment 
pursuant to Sec. 1050.52 is applicable as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.60 for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed by 
Sec. 1050.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.71 for the preceding month;
    (b) Add an amount equal to the sum of the location and zone 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1050.75;
    (c) Add an amount equal to one-half of the unobligated balance in 
the producer-settlement fund;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1050.60(f);
    (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight.

the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1050.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) The value at the uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.75, of such handler's receipts of producer milk; and
    (ii) The value at the weighted average price applicable at the 
location of the plant from which received of other source milk for which 
a value is computed pursuant to Sec. 1050.60(f).
    (b) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month each person 
who operated an other order plant that was regulated during such month 
under an order providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay to the 
market administrator an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III

    (i) Less deductions for marketing services made pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.86;
    (ii) Plus or minus adjustments for errors made in previous payments 
made to such producer; and
    (iii) Less proper deductions authorized in writing by such producer: 
Provided, That, if by such date, such handler has not received full 
payment from the market administrator pursuant to Sec. 1050.72 for such 
month, he may reduce pro rata his payments to producers by not more than 
the amount of such underpayment. Payments to producers shall be 
completed thereafter not later than the date for making payments 
pursuant to this paragraph next following after the receipt of the 
balance due from the market administrator;
    (b) Payments required in paragraph (a) of this section for milk 
caused to be delivered to such handler by a cooperative association 
qualified under Sec. 1050.18 shall be made to such association, or its

determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, less any 
deductions authorized in writing by such association: Provided, That the 
association has provided the handler with a written promise to reimburse 
the handler the amount of any actual loss incurred by such handler 
because of any improper claim on the part of the cooperative 
association;
    (c) On or before the 18th day after the end of each month, each 
handler shall pay to each cooperative association for milk the handler 
received at his pool plant from a pool plant(s) operated by such 
association, not less than the minimum prices for milk in each class, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1050.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the handler's pool plant;
    (d) On or before the 18th day of the following month, each handler, 
in his capacity as operator of a pool plant, who receives milk for which 
a cooperative association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1050.9(c), 
including the milk of producers who are not members of such association, 
and who the market administrator determines have authorized such 
cooperative association to collect payments for their milk, shall pay 
such cooperative association for such milk at the uniform price as 
adjusted pursuant to Secs. 1050.74 and 1050.75; and
    (e) Each handler who received milk during the month from producers 
for which payment is to be made to a cooperative association pursuant to

differential, rounded to the nearest one-tenth cent, which shall be 
0.138 times the current month's butter price less 0.0028 times the 
preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, for 
manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the ``base 
month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1050.51 (a) through (e), as

Sec. 1050.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1050.30(b) and 1050.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(but not to be less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1050.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same

[[Page 499]]

class in which such products were classified at the fully regulated 
plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1050.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1050.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1050.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1050.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1050.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1050.7 (b) and 
(c), subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1050.30(b) and 
1050.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1050.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1050.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1050.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1050.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of

[[Page 500]]

the total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

    Route disposition means a delivery (either direct or through a 
distributing facility such as a distribution point, a plant store, a 
vendor, or vending machine), other than a delivery to a poll plant or a 
nonpool plant, of a fluid milk product classified as Class I milk.


<R05>
Sec. 1064.5  Distributing plant.

    Distributing plant means a plant from which during the month there 
is route disposition in the marketing area of Grade A fluid milk 
products that are processed or packaged in such plant.


<R05>
Sec. 1064.6  Supply plant.

    Supply plant means a plant from which a Grade A fluid milk product 
is shipped during the month to a pool plant.


<R05>
Sec. 1064.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A distributing plant from which during the month or the 
immediately preceding month there is:
    (1) Route disposition, except filled milk, in the marketing area 
that is not less than 15 percent of the total Grade A fluid milk 
products, except filled milk, received at such plant, including producer 
milk diverted to other plants pursuant to Sec. 1064.13 by the handler 
operating such plant; and
    (2) Route disposition, except filled milk, that is not less than the 
following percentage of the total Grade A fluid milk products, except 
filled milk, received at such plant, including producer milk diverted to 
other plants pursuant to Sec. 1064.13 by the handler operating such 
plant: Provided, That the combined receipts and disposition of each 
handler who operates more than one distributing plant, each of which 
meets the performance requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
shall be used in determining the percentages specified in this 
subparagraph:
    (i) April through June, 35 percent;
    (ii) September and October, 50 percent; and
    (iii) All other months, 45 percent.
    (b) A supply plant from which during the month 50 percent or more of 
the Grade A milk received at such plant from dairy farmers and handlers 
described in Sec. 1064.9(c) (including milk diverted from such plant 
pursuant to Sec. 1064.13(c) but excluding milk diverted to such plant 
pursuant to Sec. 1064.13(c)) is shipped from such plant as fluid milk 
products, except filled milk, to and received at pool distributing 
plants, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) A supply plant which is a pool plant under this paragraph during 
each month of September through January shall be pooled for the 
following months of February through August if the required percentage 
pursuant to this paragraph is not met, unless the plant operator files a 
written request with the market administrator that such plant not be a 
pool plant, such nonpool status to be effective the first month 
following such request and thereafter until the plant qualifies as a 
pool plant on the basis of shipments;
    (2) The shipping percentage specified in this paragraph may be 
increased or decreased temporarily for any of the months of September 
through January up to 20 percentage points by the Director of the Dairy 
Division if the Director finds such revision is necessary to obtain 
needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. For any of the 
months of February through August, a minimum shipping percentage of up 
to 20 percent may be established by the Director for all pool supply 
plants that are qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section. Before making such a finding the Director shall 
investigate the need for revision, either at the Director's initiative 
or at the request of interested persons. If the investigation shows that 
a revision might be appropriate, the Director shall issue a notice 
stating that revision is being considered and inviting data, views, and 
arguments. If a plant which would not otherwise qualify as a pool plant 
during the month qualifies as a pool plant because of a reduction in 
shipping requirements pursuant to this subparagraph, such plant shall be 
a nonpool plant for such month if the operator of the plant files

[[Page 503]]

a written request for nonpool plant status with the market administrator 
at the time the report is filed for such plant pursuant to Sec. 1064.30,
    (c) A supply plant operated by a cooperative association in any 
month in which the member producer milk of such cooperative association 
received at pool distributing plants during the current month, or 
immediately preceding 12-month period ending with the current month, 
either by transfer from such supply plant or directly from member 
producers' farms, is 50 percent or more of such cooperative's total 
member producer milk. Such direct deliveries from member producers' 
farms shall be considered as having been received first at the plant of 
such cooperative association for the purpose of determining the 
qualification of such plant as a pool plant pursuant to this paragraph. 
If two or more cooperative associations desire to qualify a supply plant 
operated by one of the associations as a pool plant on the basis of 
their combined deliveries to pool distributing plants and have filed a 
written request to this effect with the market administrator on or 
before the first day of the month the agreement is effective, such a 
supply plant shall be a pool plant during the month if the above 
specified percentage of the total member producer milk of such 
cooperative associations was received at pool distributing plants during 
the current month, or the immediately preceding 12-month period ending 
with the current month.
    (d) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A distributing plant or supply plant operated by a State 
educational institution;
    (3) A plant from which there is route disposition in the marketing 
area of less than an average of 600 pounds per day;
    (4) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal 
order and from which during the month a greater volume of fluid milk 
products, except filled milk, was disposed of as route disposition in 
such other marketing area and to pool plants qualified on the basis of 
route disposition in such other marketing area than was so disposed of 
in this marketing area except that if such plant was subject to all the 
provisions of this part in the immediately preceding month, it shall 
continue to be subject to all the provisions of this part until the 
third consecutive month in which a greater proportion of its fluid 
product disposition, except filled milk, is made in the above described 
manner in such other marketing area, unless, notwithstanding the 
provisions of this subparagraph, it is regulated under such other order;
    (5) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal 
order and from which during the month a greater volume of fluid milk 
products, except filled milk, was disposed of as route disposition in 
this marketing area and to pool plants qualified on the basis of route 
disposition in this marketing area than was so disposed of in such other 
Federal order marketing area but which plant is, nevertheless, fully 
regulated under such other Federal order;
    (6) A supply plant meeting the pooling requirements of paragraph (b) 
of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another 
Federal order, and which has greater qualifying shipments to plants 
regulated under such other order than are made under this order, unless 
during any month of February through August automatic pool plant status 
for such plant is retained under this part for such month; and
    (7) A supply plant which would be subject to the classification and 
pricing provisions of another order issued pursuant to the Act, unless 
such plant also qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section.

Sec. 1064.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1064.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:

[[Page 509]]

    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(6) of this section which was received in the form of a bulk fluid milk 
product or a bulk fluid cream product;
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant and milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1064.9(c));
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1064.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this subparagraph shall be 
2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this 
subparagraph shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received from unregulated supply plants, 
excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III classification is 
requested by the handler; and
    (7) Less 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products transferred to other plants that is not in 
excess of the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat to which 
percentages are applied in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) of 
this section; and
    (c) The quantity of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
shrinkage of milk from producers for which a cooperative association is 
the handler pursuant to Sec. 1064.9 (b) or (c), but not in excess of 0.5 
percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such milk. If 
the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such 
milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm 
and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 1064.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant (to a pool 
supply plant, in the case of diversion) shall be classified as Class I 
milk unless the operators of both plants request the same classification 
in another class. In either case, the classification of such transfers 
or diversions shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1064.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1064.44(b). The

[[Page 510]]

amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall include 
the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat in transfers of 
concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1064.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1064.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.44(a)(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1064.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, 
up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such 
receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk 
to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators; transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1064.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to a 
State educational institution plant. Skim milk or butterfat in the 
following forms that is transferred from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order or transferred or diverted 
from a pool plant to a plant of a handler described in Sec. 1064.9(h) 
shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product, except that if a handler described in Sec. 1064.9(h) certifies 
that the fluid milk product is acquired for use in Class II or Class III 
products for research or educational purposes, such fluid milk product 
shall be classified in the applicable lower class; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat,

[[Page 511]]

respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or a plant of a handler pursuant to Sec. 1064.9(h) shall 
be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1064.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of package fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization,

[[Page 512]]

then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to Class I 
utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in this subparagraph.

Sec. 1064.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1064.9 (b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1064.40, 
1064.41, and 1064.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1064.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1064.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1064.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

<R05>
Sec. 1064.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1064.9(a) for each of his pool plants separately and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1064.9 (b) and (c) by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1064.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and

[[Page 513]]

    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1064.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1064.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This subparagraph shall apply only 
if the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this subparagraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1064.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1064.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1064.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from a handler 
described in Sec. 1064.9(h);
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall

[[Page 514]]

be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1064.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;

[[Page 515]]

    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1064.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1064.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14)

Sec. 1064.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1064.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1064.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Secs. 1064.43(d) and 1064.44 on the 
basis of such report (including any reclassification of inventories of 
bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests the amount and class 
utilization of milk received by each handler from such cooperative 
association in its capacity as a handler described in Sec. 1064.9(c) and 
directly from members of such cooperative association. For the purpose 
of this report, the milk so received shall be prorated to each class in 
proportion to the utilization by such handler in each class remaining 
after the allocation pursuant to Sec. 1064.44(a)(1) through (13) and the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1064.44(b).

<R05>
Sec. 1064.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1064.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph(b) of this section and 
annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:

[[Page 517]]

    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

Sec. 1064.52  Plant location adjustments for handlers.

    (a) For milk received from producers at a plant located outside the 
marketing area and more than 70 miles by the shortest highway distance 
as determined by the market administrator, from the nearer of the City 
Hall in Kansas City, Missouri, or Topeka, Kansas, which is classified as 
Class I milk or assigned Class I location adjustment credit pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, the price computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.50(a) shall be reduced by a per hundredweight rate of 1.7 
cents for each 10 miles or fraction thereof that such plant is located 
from the nearer City hall.
    (b) For purposes of calculating such adjustment, bulk transfers 
between pool plants shall be assigned to the Class I disposition at the 
transferee-plant prorated with the sum of receipts at such plant of 
producer milk and the pounds assigned as Class I to receipts

[[Page 518]]

from other order plants and unregulated supply plants.

Sec. 1064.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of each handler 
described in Sec. 1064.9(b) and (c) as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk in each class as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1064.44 by the applicable class prices and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1064.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1064.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1064.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1064.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1064.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1064.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1064.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1064.44(b); and
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Secs. 1064.43(d) and 1064.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1064.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk

[[Page 519]]

products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more than the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are 
allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1064.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1064.76 (a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

<R05>
Sec. 1064.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant, 
except a plant described in Sec. 1064.7(d)(3), shall pay on or before 
the 25th day after the end of the month to the market administrator for 
the producer-settlement fund the amount computed pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section. If the handler submits pursuant to Secs. 1064.30(b) 
and 1064.31(b) the information necessary for making the computations, 
such handler may elect to pay in lieu of such payment the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(except that the Class I price and the weighted average price shall not 
be less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1064.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a

[[Page 523]]

pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1064.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1064.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1064.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1064.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1064.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1064.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1064.30(b) and 
1064.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1064.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1064.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1064.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1064.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the

[[Page 524]]

nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the Class I price 
applicable under the other order at the location of the plant where the 
nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the 
Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment option shall 
apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the plant that 
processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more 
Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement 
fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the 
nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the 
source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk 
products cannot be determined by the market administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 1064.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever audit by the market administrator of any handler's reports, 
books, records, or accounts discloses errors resulting in moneys due the 
market administrator or any producer or cooperative association from 
such handler, the market administrator shall promptly notify such 
handler of the amount due and payment therefor shall be made within 5 
days if such amount is due the market administrator, or on or before the 
next date for making payments to producers or a cooperative association, 
if such amount is due them. Whenever such audit discloses errors 
resulting in moneys due such handler from the market administrator, 
payment shall be made within 5 days.


<R05>
Sec. 1064.78  Charges on overdue accounts.

    Any unpaid obligation of a handler pursuant to Secs. 1064.71, 
1064.73, 1064.77, 1064.85, and 1064.86 shall be increased one-half of 1 
percent on the first day of the month next following the due date of 
such obligation and on the first day of each month thereafter until such 
obligation is paid.

        Administrative Assessment and Marketing Service Deduction


<R05>
Sec. 1064.85  Assessment for order administration.

    As his pro rata share of the expense of administration of the order, 
each handler shall pay to the market administrator on or before the 12th 
day after the end of the month 3 cents per hundredweight, or such lesser 
amount as the Secretary may prescribe, of:
    (a) Producer milk (including such handler's own production);
    (b) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I 
use pursuant to Sec. 1064.43(d) and other source milk allocated to Class 
I pursuant to Sec. 1064.44 (a)(7) and (a)(11) and the corresponding 
steps of Sec. 1064.44(b), except such other source milk that is excluded 
from the computations pursuant to Sec. 1064.60 (d) and (f); and
    (c) Class I milk disposed of from a partially regulated distributing 
plant (except from a plant described in Sec. 1064.7(d)(3)) as route 
disposition in the marketing area that exceeds the skim milk and 
butterfat subtracted pursuant to Sec. 1064.76(a)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 1064.86  Deduction for marketing services.

    (a) Deductions. Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section, each handler in making payments to producers other than himself 
pursuant to Sec. 1064.73(a), shall deduct 6 cents per hundredweight or 
such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe with respect to all 
milk received by such handler from producers during the month, and shall 
pay such deductions to the market administrator on or before the 12th 
day after the end of such month. Such moneys shall be used by the market 
administrator to verify weights, samples, and tests of milk received 
from and to provide market information to such producers.
    (b) Deductions with respect to members of a cooperative association. 
In the case of producers for whom a cooperative association is actually 
performing, as

[[Page 525]]

determined by the Secretary, the services set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section, each handler shall, in lieu of the deductions specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, make such deductions from the payments to 
be made directly to producers pursuant to Sec. 1064.73(a), as are 
authorized by such producers, and on or before the 12th day after the 
end of each month, pay over such deductions to the association of which 
such producers are members, accompanied by a statement showing the 
amount of the deduction and the quantity of milk for which it was 
computed for each such producer.

    Editorial Note: At 57 FR 45563, Oct. 2, 1992, in Sec. 1065.6, the 
words ``during the month'' were suspended indefinitely, effective Sept. 
1, 1992.


<R05>
Sec. 1065.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A distributing plant from which there is:
    (1) Route disposition (except filled milk) in the marketing area 
during the month equal to not less than 15 percent of the Grade A milk 
received at such plant from dairy farmers, supply plants (exclusive of 
transfers and diversions from plants qualifying as pool plants pursuant 
to this paragraph), and handlers described in Sec. 1065.9(c); and
    (2) Total route disposition (except filled milk) during the month or 
the immediately preceding month equal to not less than 35 percent of the 
Grade A milk received at the plant during such month from the sources 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) A supply plant from which during the month the volume of fluid 
milk products, except filled milk, transferred and diverted to pool 
distributing plants is 30 percent or more of the total

[[Page 527]]

Grade A milk received at the plant from dairy farmers (including 
producer milk diverted from the plant but excluding producer milk 
diverted to the plant pursuant to Sec. 1065.13) and handlers described 
in Sec. 1065.9(c), subject to the following additional conditions:
    (1) Not more than one-half of the shipping percentage specified in 
this paragraph may be met through the diversion of milk from the supply 
plant to pool distributing plants;
    (2) The volume of fluid milk products included as qualifying 
shipments to any pool distribution plant pursuant to this paragraph 
shall be reduced by the volume of any fluid milk products transferred or 
diverted by the operator of such pool distributing plant to the supply 
plant or to any other plant operated by the operator of the supply 
plant.
    (3) The shipping requirements of this paragraph may be increased or 
decreased up to 20 percentage points by the Director of the Dairy 
Division if that person finds such revision is necessary to obtain 
needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such 
a finding, the Director shall investigate the need for revision either 
at the Director's own initiative or at the request of interested 
persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be 
appropriate, the Director shall issue a notice stating that the revision 
is being considered and invite data, views, and arguments; and
    (4) A supply plant that qualifies as a pool plant in each of the 
months of September through March shall be a pool plant for the 
following months of April through August unless written application is 
filed with the market administrator by the plant operator requesting the 
plant be designated a nonpool plant. In such case, nonpool status will 
be effective the first month following such notice and thereafter until 
the plant again qualifies as a pool plant on the basis of transfers and 
diversions. Any plant that qualifies as a pool plant pursuant to this 
paragraph will be subject to any shipping requirement announced pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (c) A supply plant operated by a cooperative association if, during 
the month, 51 percent or more of the producer milk of members of the 
association is received at a pool distributing plant(s) of another 
handler(s), or is transferred to such plant(s) from the association's 
supply plant.
    (d) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section from 
which a lesser volume of fluid milk products (not including filled milk) 
is disposed of in the Nebraska-Western Iowa marketing area than in the 
marketing area of another marketing agreement or order issued pursuant 
to the Act and which is fully subject to the classification and pricing 
provisions of such other agreement or order;
    (3) Any plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
for any portion of the period of April through August, inclusive, that

at the Director's own initiative or at the request of interested 
persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be 
appropriate, the Director shall issue a notice stating that the revision 
is being considered and invite data, views, and arguments;
    (5) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in 
paragraphs (d) (2), (3), and (4) of this section shall not be producer 
milk. The diverting handler may designate the dairy farmers whose 
diverted milk will not be producer milk. Otherwise, the total milk 
diverted on the last day of the month, then the second-to-last day, and

Sec. 1065.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless both handlers request the same 
classification in another class. In either case, the classification of 
such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1065.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1065.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1065.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1065.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least

[[Page 534]]

possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1065.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding step of Sec. 1065.44(b), the skim milk 
or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, 
shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would 
be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to another order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1065.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk products; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set

forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1065.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;

Sec. 1065.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1065.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports

[[Page 536]]

filed pursuant to Sec. 1065.30 and shall compute separately for each 
pool plant and for each cooperative association with respect to milk for 
which it is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1065.9 (b) or (c) the pounds of 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with 
Secs. 1065.40, 1065.41, and 1065.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1065.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1065.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1065.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

<R05>
Sec. 1065.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1065.9(a) for each of his pool plants separately and of each 
handler described in Sec. 1065.9 (b) and (c) by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1065.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1065.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the

[[Page 537]]

pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1065.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This subparagraph shall apply only 
if the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this subparagraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1065.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1065.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1065.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers and diversions between pool plants of the 
handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in

[[Page 538]]

receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, fluid milk 
products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk 
products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1065.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers and diversions 
between pool plants of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class 
II and Class III combined being subtracted first from Class III and then 
from Class II, the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted 
pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this 
section and that were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid 
milk products to the same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk 
products to be allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in

[[Page 539]]

Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the quantity 
prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted first from 
Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever of the 
following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1065.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers and 
diversions between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1065.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after 
the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1065.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order

[[Page 540]]

plants pursuant to Sec. 1065.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1065.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization (to the 
nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim milk 
and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Secs. 1065.43(d) and 1065.44 on the 
basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories of 
bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests the class utilization of 
producer milk received by each handler from a cooperative association or 
from members of the association. For the purpose of this report, the 
milk caused to be so delivered by an association shall be prorated to 
each class in the proportion that the total receipts of milk received 
from producers by such handler were used in each class.

                              Class Prices


<R05>
Sec. 1065.50  Class and component prices.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1065.52, the class prices per 
hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat and the component 
prices for the month shall be as follows:
    (a) Class I price. The Class I price for the month per hundredweight 
of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $1.75.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Class III-A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Central States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as 
reported by the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by 
subtracting from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat 
dry milk price, plus the butterfat differential times 35 and rounded to 
the nearest cent.
    (e) Class I differential price. The Class I differential price shall 
be the difference between the current month's Class I and Class III 
prices (this price may be negative).
    (f) Class II differential price. The Class II differential price 
shall be the difference between the current month's Class II and Class 
III prices (this price may be negative).
    (g) Class III-A differential price. The Class III-A differential 
price shall be the difference between the current month's Class III and 
Class III-A prices (this price may be negative).
    (h) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded 
to the nearest cent, shall be the Class III price less an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35.
    (i) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class III price plus an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 965 and dividing 
the resulting amount by one hundred.
    (j) Protein price. The protein price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be 1.32 times the average monthly 
price per pound for 40-pound block Cheddar cheese on the National Cheese 
Exchange as reported by the Department.

[[Page 541]]

    (k) Other solids price. Other solids are herein defined as solids 
not fat other than protein. The other solids price per pound, rounded to 
the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the basic formula price at test 
less the average butterfat test of the basic formula price as reported 
by the Department times the butterfat price, less the average protein 
test of the basic formula price as reported by the Department for the 
month times the protein price, and dividing the resulting amount by the 
average other solids test of the basic formula price as reported by the 
Department. If the resulting price is less than zero, then the protein 
price will be reduced so that the other solids price equals zero.
    (l) Somatic cell adjustment. (1) The somatic cell adjustment rate, 
per 1,000 somatic cells, rounded to five decimal places, shall be 
computed by multiplying .0005 times the monthly cheddar cheese price as 
defined in paragraph (j) of this section; and
    (2) The somatic cell adjustment, per hundredweight, shall be 
determined by subtracting from 350 the somatic cell count (in thousands) 
of the milk, multiplying the difference by the somatic cell adjustment

Sec. 1065.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1065.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.

[[Page 542]]

    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

Sec. 1065.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1065.30(b) and 1065.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I 
differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both prices 
to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant, with the difference to be not less than zero; and

[[Page 549]]

    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1065.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1065.60 
shall be priced at the statistical uniform price (or at the weighted 
average price if such is provided) of the respective order regulating 
the handling of milk at the transferee-plant, with such statistical 
uniform price adjusted to the location of the nonpool plant (but not to 
be less than the lowest class price of the respective order), except 
that transfers of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be priced 
at the lowest class price of the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1065.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1065.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1065.71(a)(2)(v), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1065.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1065.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1065.30(b) and 
1065.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1065.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the

[[Page 550]]

same manner prescribed for computing the obligation of such partially 
regulated distributing plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1065.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1065.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1065.44(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1065.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    Adjustments of accounts shall be made as follows:
    (a) Whenever verification by the market administrator of reports or 
payments of any handler discloses errors made in payments to or from the 
producer-settlement fund pursuant to Secs. 1065.71 and 1065.72, the 
market administrator shall promptly bill such handler for any unpaid 
amount and such handler shall, within 5 days, make payment to the market 
administrator of the account so billed. Whenever verification discloses 
that payment is due from the market administrator to any handler, the 
market administrator shall, within 5 days, make such payment to such 
handler; and
    (b) Whenever verification by the market administrator of the 
payments by a handler to any producer or cooperative association, 
discloses payments of less than is required by Sec. 1065.73, the handler 
shall make up such payment to the producer or cooperative association 
not later than the time of making payments next following such 
disclosure.

(or, if mailed, postmarked) by the date specified for such payment, 
shall be increased one percent, and any remaining amount due shall be 
increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of each month 
thereafter until paid. The amounts payable pursuant to this section 
shall include unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this section. 
For the purpose of this section, any obligation that was determined at a 
date later than prescribed by the order because of a handler's failure 
to submit a report to the market administrator when due

[[Page 551]]

shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been 
due if the report had been filed when due.

    (b) Each month deposit into an advertising and promotion fund, 
separately accounted for, an amount equal to the funds received from 
handlers pursuant to Sec. 1065.107. The amount deposited shall be 
disbursed as follows:
    (1) To the Agency each month, all such funds less any necessary 
amount held in reserve to cover refunds pursuant to paragraphs (b) (3) 
or (4) of this section, and payments to cover expenses of the market 
administrator incurred in the administration of the advertising and 
promotion program (including audit).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) As long as the Dairy Research and Promotion Order is in effect, 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall apply in lieu of this paragraph. 
After the end of each calender quarter, make a refund to each producer 
who has made application for such refund pursuant to Sec. 1065.120. Such 
refund shall be that amount which was obtained pursuant to Sec. 1065.107 
for each calendar quarter.
    (4) As long as the Dairy Research and Promotion Order is in effect, 
remit to any qualified programs any refunds designated by producers to 
be paid to such programs no later than the last day of the month 
following the month in which the milk was marketed. If a refund request 
does not designate a qualified program to receive such money, the refund 
shall be remitted to the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, 
which is defined in the Dairy Research and Promotion Order.
    (c) Promptly after the effective date of this amending order, and 
thereafter with respect to new producers, forward to each producer a 
copy of the provisions of the advertising and promotion program 
(Secs. 1065.105 through 1065.122).
    (d) Make necessary audits to establish that all agency funds are 
used only for authorized purposes.
    (e) As soon as possible after the beginning of each year, compute 
the rate of withholding by multiplying the simple average of the monthly

percent and rounding the result to the nearest whole cent. This rate 
shall apply during the 12-month period beginning with April of the 
current year: Provided, That the rate shall be 10 cents per 
hundredweight as long as the Dairy Research and Promotion Order is in 
effect.
    (f) As soon as possible after the rate of withholding is computed, 
notify in writing each producer currently on the market and any new 
producer that subsequently enters the market of the withholding rate. 
This notification shall be repeated annually thereafter only if there is 
any change in the rate from the previous period.

[[Page 557]]


<R05>
Sec. 1068.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) Any plant (which, if qualified pursuant to this paragraph, shall 
be known as a ``pool distributing plant'') from which during the month:
    (1) The total route disposition (except filled milk) as a percent of 
the total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such 
plant or diverted therefrom by the plant operator is at least equal to 
the marketwide Class I utilization percentage for the same month of the 
preceding year; and
    (2) Not less than 15 percent of such receipts are disposed of as 
route disposition (except filled milk) in the marketing area.
    (3) A unit consisting of at least one pool distributing plant and 
one or more additional plants of a handler shall be considered as one 
plant for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (i) For each plant within the unit which does not qualify as a pool 
distributing plant pursuant to paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this 
section, the combined disposition of skim milk and butterfat in products 
specified in Sec. 1068.40(a), Sec. 1068.40(b)(1) in packaged form, and 
Sec. 1068.40(b)(4)(i) is 50 percent or more of the total Grade A fluid 
milk products received in bulk form at such plant or diverted therefrom 
by the plant operator;
    (ii) All plants within the unit are located within the marketing 
area; and
    (iii) The operator of the unit has filed a written request with the 
market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which such 
status is desired to be effective. The unit shall continue from month-
to-month thereafter without further notification. The handler shall 
notify the market administrator in writing prior to the first day of any 
month for which termination or any change of the unit is desired.
    (b) Any plant (which, if qualified pursuant to this paragraph, shall 
be known as a ``pool supply plant'') that is approved by a duly 
constituted regulatory agency for the handling of Grade A milk, subject 
to the following conditions:
    (1) The volume of fluid milk products delivered to pool distributing 
plants as a percent of the total Grade A milk received at the plant from 
dairy farmers during the month (including milk delivered to the plant 
from dairy farms for the account of a cooperative association and milk 
diverted from the plant by the plant operator but excluding milk 
diverted to the plant from another pool plant) is not less than the 
marketwide Class I utilization percentage for the same month of the 
preceding year, subject to the following conditions:
    (i) These shipping percentages may be increased or decreased by the 
market administrator if the market administrator finds that such 
revision is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent 
uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market 
administrator shall investigate the need for revision either on the 
market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested 
parties. If the investigation shows that a revision of the shipping 
percentage might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a 
notice stating that the revision is being considered and invite data, 
views, and arguments. Any request for revision of shipping percentages 
shall be filed with the market administrator no later than the 15th day 
of the month prior to the month for which the requested revision is 
desired effective;
    (ii) A cooperative association that operates a supply plant may 
include as qualifying shipments its deliveries to pool distributing 
plants directly from farms of producers pursuant to Sec. 1068.9(c);
    (iii) A proprietary handler may include as qualifying shipments milk 
diverted to pool distributing plants pursuant to Sec. 1068.13(d);
    (2) In order to meet the requirements of this paragraph, two or more 
supply plants operated by one or more handler(s) may qualify for pooling 
as a unit during the following months of August through July by meeting 
the applicable percentage requirements of this paragraph in the same 
manner as a single plant, provided that:
    (i) The handler(s) file a request with the market administrator for 
such unit

[[Page 558]]

status no later than July 15 of each year. Such a request should specify 
the order in which plants would cease to be considered part of the unit 
if the unit fails to meet the applicable percentage requirements of this 
paragraph. Any plant that ceases to be part of a unit will not be 
eligible to rejoin a unit until the following August. No plant may 
become part of a unit after the unit is formed and the market 
administrator has been notified; and
    (ii) Each handler operating supply plant(s) for which the shipping 
percentages are met as part of a unit must ship at least 5 percent of 
the Grade A milk received at its plant(s) from dairy farmers during the 
month (including milk delivered to the handler's plant(s) from dairy 
farms for the account of a cooperative association pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.9(c) and milk diverted from the plant(s) by the plant operator 
but excluding milk diverted to the plant(s) from another pool plant) to 
pool distributing plant(s) in one of the months of August through 
December in order for the handler's plant(s) to be a supply plant(s) for 
the month of December; and
    (iii) Each plant in the unit is located in the marketing area, or 
was a pool plant pursuant to Sec. 1068.7(b) for each of the three months 
immediately preceding the effective date of this paragraph so long as it 
continues to maintain pool status.
    (3) The quantity of fluid milk products moved from a supply plant to 
a pool distributing plant or pool distributing plant unit that shall 
count toward meeting the shipping requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section shall be a net quantity which shall exclude the 
pounds by which the quantity specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
section exceeds the quantity specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section:
    (i) The pounds of bulk fluid milk products transferred from the pool 
distributing plant or pool distributing plant unit during the month that 
are not to another pool distributing plant or pool distributing plant 
unit or to a commercial food processing establishment pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.40(b)(3).
    (ii) 1,000,000 pounds.
    (c) Any plant that qualified as a pool plant in each of the 
immediately preceding three months on the basis of performance standards 
described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.
    (d) Any plant (which, if qualified pursuant to this paragraph, shall 
be known as a ``pool reserve supply plant'') that is located in the 
marketing area and that is approved by a duly constituted regulatory 
agency for the handling of Grade A milk, subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1)--(2) [Reserved]
    (3) The operator of the plan has filed a request with the market 
administrator for pool reserve supply status no later than July 15 of 
each year. Once qualified as a pool plant pursuant to this paragraph, 
such status shall be effective for August and continue through the 
following July unless the operator requests nonpool status for the plant 
prior to the first day of the month for which nonpool status is 
requested, the plant subsequently fails to meet all of the conditions of 
this paragraph, or the plant qualifies as a pool plant under another 
order;
    (4) The volume of bulk fluid milk products shipped from the plant to 
pool distributing plants as a percent of the total Grade A milk received 
at the plant from dairy farmers during the month (including milk 
delivered to the plant from dairy farms for the account of a cooperative 
association pursuant to Sec. 1068.9(c) and milk diverted from the plant 
by the plant operator but excluding milk diverted to the plant from 
another pool plant) is not less than 10 percent for each of the months 
of January through June and, for each of the months of July through 
December, is not less than the marketwide Class I utilization percentage 
for the same month of the preceding year, subject to the following 
conditions:
    (i) These shipping percentages may be decreased by the market 
administrator on the basis that such revision is necessary to prevent 
uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market 
administrator shall investigate the need for revision either on the 
market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested 
persons. If the investigation shows that a revision of the shipping 
percentage

[[Page 559]]

might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice 
stating that the revision is being considered and invite data, views, 
and arguments. Any request for revision of shipping percentages shall be 
filed with the market administrator no later than the 15th day of the 
month prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired 
effective;
    (ii) A cooperative association that operates a reserve supply plant 
may include as qualifying shipments its deliveries to pool distributing 
plants directly from farms of producers pursuant to Sec. 1068.9(c);
    (iii) A proprietary handler may include as qualifying shipments milk 
diverted to pool distributing plants pursuant to Sec. 1068.13(d);
    (iv) Shipments from a reserve supply plant to a distributing plant 
regulated under another Federal order may count as if delivered to a 
pool distributing plant if the market administrator is notified of the 
amount of any such commitments to ship milk no later than the fifteenth 
day of the prior month. Total credit for shipments to plants regulated 
under other Federal orders shall be limited to the quantity of milk 
delivered from the plant to pool distributing plants during the month. 
Qualifying shipments to an other order plant may not be classified 
pursuant to Sec. 1068.42(b)(3).
    (5) The operator of the plant supplies fluid milk products to pool 
distributing plants located within an area designated by the market 
administrator as the ``call area'' in compliance with any announcement 
by the market administrator requesting a minimum level of shipments, as 
further provided below:
    (i) The market administrator may require such supplies of fluid milk 
products from operators of any pool reserve supply plants within the 
call area whenever he finds that milk supplies for Class I use at pool 
distributing plants within the call area are needed from plants 
qualifying under this paragraph. Before making such a finding, the 
market administrator shall investigate the need for such shipments 
either on his own initiative or at the request of interested persons. If 
his investigation shows that such shipments might be appropriate, he 
shall issue a notice stating that a shipping announcement is being 
considered and inviting data, views, and arguments with respect to the 
proposed shipping announcement;
    (ii) For the purpose of meeting any shipping requirement announced 
by the market administrator;
    (A) Qualifying shipments to pool distributing plants within the call 
area may originate from any plant or producer milk supplies of the 
handler provided that shipments from sources other than the plant(s) 
subject to the call and milk supplies for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1068.9(c) must be in 
addition to any shipments already being made by the handler and may not 
result from shifting milk supplies from a pool distributing plant 
outside the call area to one within the call area; and
    (B) Shipments from a reserve supply plant within the call area to a 
pool distributing plant outside the call area or to a comparable plant 
regulated under another Federal order may count as if delivered to a 
pool distributing plant within the call area if the market administrator 
is notified of the amount of any such commitments to ship milk prior to 
announcement of a shipping requirement pursuant to this paragraph. Total 
credit for shipments to plants regulated under other Federal orders 
shall be limited to the quantity of milk delivered from the plant to 
pool distributing plants during the month. Qualifying shipments to an 
other order plant may not be classified pursuant to Sec. 1068.42(b)(3); 
and
    (iii) Failure of a handler to comply with any announced shipping 
requirement pursuant to Sec. 1068.7(d)(5), including making any 
significant change in his marketing operations that the market 
administrator determines has the impact of evading or forcing such an 
announcement, shall result in immediate loss of pool status for the 
plant pursuant to Sec. 1068.7(d). A plant losing pool status in this 
manner or a plant that requests nonpool status may not again qualify as 
a pool plant pursuant to Sec. 1068.7(d) until the following August;
    (6) In order to meet the requirements of paragraphs (d)(4) and 
(d)(5) of this

[[Page 560]]

section, two or more reserve supply plants operated by one or more 
handler(s) may qualify for pooling as a unit during the following months 
of August through July by meeting the applicable percentage requirements 
of this paragraph in the same manner as a single plant, provided that:
    (i) The handler(s) file a request with the market administrator for 
such unit status no later than July 15 of each year. Such a request 
should specify the order in which the plants would cease to be 
considered part of the unit if the unit fails to meet the applicable 
percentage requirements of Sec. 1068.7(d) (4) and (5). Any plant that 
ceases to be part of a unit will not be eligible to rejoin a unit until 
the following August. No plant may become part of a unit after the unit 
is formed and the market administrator has been notified; and
    (ii) Each handler operating reserve supply plant(s) for which the 
shipping percentages in Sec. 1068.7(d)(4) are met as part of a unit 
described in Sec. 1068.7(d)(6) must ship at least 5 percent of the Grade 
A milk received at its plant(s) from dairy farmers during the month 
(including milk delivered to the handler's plant(s) from dairy farms for 
the account of a cooperative association pursuant to Sec. 1068.9(c) and 
milk diverted from the plant(s) by the plant operator but excluding milk 
diverted to the plant(s) from another pool plant) to pool distributing 
plants in one of the months of August through December in order for the 
handler's plant(s) to be a reserve supply plant(s) for the month of 
December.
    (7) The quantity of fluid milk products moved from the reserve 
supply plant to a pool distributing plant or pool distributing plant 
unit that shall count toward meeting the shipping requirements of 
paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section shall be a net 
quantity which shall exclude the pounds by which the quantity specified 
in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section exceeds the quantity specified in 
paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The pounds of bulk fluid milk products transferred from the pool 
distributing plant or pool distributing plant unit during the month that 
were not to another pool distributing plant or pool distributing plant 
unit or to a commercial food processing establishment pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.40(b)(3).
    (ii) 1,000,000 pounds.
    (8) A plant must have been a pool plant under this order pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.7 (a), (b) or (d) during each of the preceding months of 
August through December to be a pool reserve supply plant during the 
following months of January through July.
    (e) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A governmental agency plant;
    (3) A plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to this section if 
the conditions of paragraph (e)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section are met. 
Such plant shall be exempt from the provisions of this part except for 
reports that may be required pursuant to Sec. 1068.30(d) and 
verification of such reports by the market administrator in accordance 
with Sec. 1000.5 of this chapter:
    (i) The Secretary determines that a greater quantity of milk in 
fluid form is disposed of from such plant to a regulated marketing area 
as defined in another order issued pursuant to the Act either as route 
disposition, excluding filled milk, or to other order plants qualified 
on the basis of route disposition, than is disposed of from such plant 
in the Upper Midwest marketing area either as route disposition, 
excluding filled milk, or to pool plants qualified on the basis of route 
disposition; and
    (ii) Such milk would be subject to the class price and producer 
payment provisions of the other marketing agreement or order upon being 
made exempt from this part; and
    (4) That portion of a plant that is physically separated from the 
Grade A portion of such plant, is operated separately, and is not 
approved by any regulatory agency for the receiving, processing, or 
packaging of any fluid milk product for Grade A disposition.

    (b) Received by a handler described in Sec. 1068.9(c);
    (c) Picked up from the producer's farm tank in a tank truck owned 
and operated by, or under the control of, the operator of a pool plant 
but which is not received at a plant until the following month. Such 
milk shall be considered as having been received by the handler during 
the month in which it is picked up at the producer's farm and shall be 
priced at the location of the plant where it is physically received in 
the following month. This paragraph shall apply in like manner to milk 
received by the operator of a pool plant who, in accordance with 
Sec. 1068.9(c), is the handler for such milk;
    (d) Diverted from the pool plant of a proprietary handler for the 
account of the handler operating such plant to another pool plant or 
diverted from a pool plant to a nonpool plant (other than a producer-
handler plant) for the account of the handler operating such pool plant 
or for the account of a handler described in Sec. 1068.9(b), subject to 
the following conditions:
    (1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion until 
milk of such dairy farmer is physically received as producer milk at a 
pool plant;
    (2) The total quantity of milk diverted by a cooperative association 
during the month as a percent of the producer milk that the cooperative 
association causes to be delivered to or diverted from pool plants 
during the month shall not exceed the market's combined Class II and III 
utilization percentage for the same month of the prior year;
    (3) The operator of a pool plant that is not a cooperative 
association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a 
cooperative association that diverts milk pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section. The total quantity of milk so diverted during the month 
as a percent of the producer milk physically received at or diverted 
from such pool plant during the month that is eligible to be diverted by 
the plant operator shall not exceed the market's combined Class II and 
III utilization percentage for the same month of the prior year;
    (4) The diversion limitations specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market 
administrator on the basis that such revision is necessary to prevent 
uneconomic handling or shipments of milk. Before making such a finding, 
the market administrator shall investigate the need for revision either 
on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of 
interested persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be 
appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that 
the revision is being considered and invite data, views, and arguments. 
Any request for revision of diversion limitations shall be filed with 
the market administrator no later than the 15th day of the month prior 
to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective;
    (5) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in 
paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this section shall not be producer milk. 
The diverting handler may

[[Page 563]]

designate the dairy farmers whose diverted milk will not be producer 
milk, otherwise the milk last diverted--in lots of an entire day's 
production--shall be excluded first in determining which milk should not 
be producer milk; and
    (6) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to 
which diverted.

Sec. 1068.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1068.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraph (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph;

plant);
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1068.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this subparagraph shall be 
2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this 
subparagraph shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm 
and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 1068.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless both handlers request the same 
classification in another class. In either case, the classification of 
such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1068.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1068.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1068.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1068.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.44(a)(11) or (12) of the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1068.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted 
up to the total of the skim milk, shall not be classified as Class I 
milk to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk 
had been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other

[[Page 568]]

order is not available to the market administrator for the purpose of 
establishing classification under this paragraph, classification shall 
be as Class I, subject to adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1068.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1068.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the

Sec. 1068.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk, the following 
rules shall apply;
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1068.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1068.40, 1068.41, and 1068.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1068.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1068.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association; and
    (d) For classification purposes, pursuant to Secs. 1068.40 through 
1068.45, butterfat in skim milk either disposed of to others or used in 
the manufacture of milk products shall be accounted for at a butterfat 
content of 0.065 percent, unless the handler has adequate records of the 
actual butterfat content of such skim milk.
    (e) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to

[[Page 570]]

the reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, 
on a pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1068.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1068.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (f) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

<R05>
Sec. 1068.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1068.9(a) for each of his separate pool plants 
the classification of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1068.9(c) by allocating the handler's receipts of skim 
milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1068.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1068.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1068.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This subparagraph shall apply only 
if the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this subparagraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1068.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1068.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form

[[Page 571]]

of an unconcentrated fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section applies, packaged inventory at the beginning of the month 
of products specified in Sec. 1068.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted 
pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from a 
governmental agency plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1068.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1068.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the

[[Page 572]]

month that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) 
and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1068.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;

[[Page 573]]

    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computation pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1068.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, and milk received from 
a handler described in Sec. 1068.9(c), subtract such excess from the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1068.9(c) in each class shall be the combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the 
computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1068.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1068.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Secs. 1068.43(e) and 1068.44 on the 
basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories of 
bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the

[[Page 574]]

other order on the basis of the report by the receiving handler, and, as 
necessary, any changes in such allocation arising from the verification 
of such report.

<R05>
Sec. 1068.50  Class and component prices.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1068.52, the class prices per 
hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat and the component 
prices for the month shall be as follows:
    (a) Class I price. The Class I price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $1.20.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Class III-A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Central States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as 
reported by the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by 
subtracting from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat 
dry milk price, plus the butterfat differential times 35 and rounded to 
the nearest cent.
    (e) Class I differential price. The Class I differential price shall 
be the difference between the current month's Class I and Class III 
prices (this price may be negative).
    (f) Class II differential price. The Class II differential price 
shall be the difference between the current month's Class II and Class 
III prices (this price may be negative).
    (g) Class III-A differential price. The Class III-A differential 
price shall be the difference between the current month's Class III and 
Class III-A prices (this price may be negative).
    (h) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded 
to the nearest cent, shall be the Class III price less an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35.
    (i) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class III price plus an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 965 and dividing 
the resulting amount by one hundred.
    (j) Protein price. The protein price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be 1.32 times the average monthly 
price per pound for 40-pound block Cheddar cheese on the National Cheese 
Exchange as reported by the Department.
    (k) Other solids price. Other solids are herein defined as solids-
not-fat other than protein. The other solids price per pound, rounded to 
the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the basic formula price at test 
less the average butterfat test of the basic formula price as reported 
by the Department times the butterfat price, less the average protein 
test of the basic formula price as reported by the Department for the 
month times the protein price, and dividing the resulting amount by the 
average other solids test of the basic formula price as reported by the 
Department. If the resulting price is less than zero, then the protein 
price will be reduced so that the other solids price equals zero.
    (l) Somatic cell adjustment. (1) The somatic cell adjustment rate, 
per 1,000 somatic cells, rounded to five decimal places, shall be 
computed by multiplying .0005 times the monthly cheddar cheese price as 
defined in paragraph (j) of this section; and
    (2) The somatic cell adjustment per hundredweight shall be 
determined by subtracting from 350 the somatic cell count (in thousands) 
of the milk, multiplying the difference by the somatic cell adjustment 
rate, and rounding to the nearest full cent.

Sec. 1068.51  Basic formula price.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1068.74 and rounded

[[Page 575]]

to the nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by 
the butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula 
computed pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:

    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.

Sec. 1068.60  Handler's value of milk.

    For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer 
milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value 
of milk of each handler described in Sec. 1068.9 (a), (b), and (c).
    (a) The handler's obligation for producer milk shall be computed as 
follows:
    (1) Multiply the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class I as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.43(a) and Sec. 1068.44(c) by the Class 
I differential price for the month;
    (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of 
producer milk in Class II as determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.43(a) and 
Sec. 1068.44(c)

[[Page 577]]

by the Class II differential price for the month;
    (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk in Class I as determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.43(a) and 
Sec. 1068.44(a) by the skim milk price;
    (4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.43(a) and 
Sec. 1068.44(a) by the average protein content of producer skim milk 
received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of protein 
by the protein price;
    (5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.43(a) and 
Sec. 1068.44(a) by the average other solids content of producer skim 
milk received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of 
other solids by the other solids price;
    (6) Add an adjustment for somatic cell content determined by 
multiplying the value reported pursuant to Sec. 1068.30(a)(1) by the 
percentage of the total producer milk assigned to Class II and Class III 
pursuant to Secs. 1068.43(a) and 1068.44(c); and
    (7) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of 
producer milk eligible to be priced as Class III-A by the Class III-A 
differential price for the month;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1068.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1068.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1068.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1068.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1068.43(e) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.44(a)(7)(i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1068.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1068.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1068.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I 
differential price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated 
supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk 
products assigned to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1068.43(e) and 
Sec. 1068.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1068.44(a)(11) and the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1068.44(b), excluding such skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or 
butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is 
not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for a handler described in Sec. 1068.9(c), the amount 
charged the preceding month for the skim milk and butterfat contained in 
inventory at the beginning of the month that was delivered to a pool 
plant during the month;
    (h) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the

[[Page 578]]

hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.43(e);
    (i) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1068.76 (a)(5) or (c); and
    (j) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

    (1) The estimated values computed pursuant to Sec. 1068.60 (a)(1), 
(a)(2), (a)(7), and (b) through (j) for all handlers; and
    (2) Add the estimated values computed pursuant to Sec. 1068.60 
(a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6); and subtract the values obtained by 
multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total pounds of 
other solids contained in such milk by their respective prices, and the 
total value of the somatic cell adjustment;
    (b) Add an amount equal to the estimated value of the producer 
location adjustments;
    (c) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance in the producer-settlement fund;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by:
    (1) The estimated hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The estimated hundredweight of other source milk for which a 
value is computed pursuant to Sec. 1068.60(f); and

    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) The value of such handler's receipts of producer milk and milk 
received from a handler described in Sec. 1068.9(c). In the case of a 
handler described in Sec. 1068.9(c), less the amount due from other 
handlers pursuant to Sec. 1068.73(d). The value of producer milk shall 
be computed as follows:

    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler

necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I 
differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both prices 
to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant, with the difference to be not less than zero; and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph

(a)(3) of this section by the difference between the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
less $1.00 (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. For any reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the Class 
I price shall not be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such 
disposition, payments may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order regulating the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients at the difference between the Class I price applicable under 
the other order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk 
ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) 
and the Class III price. This payment option shall apply only if a 
majority of the total milk received at the plant that processed the 
nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders 
and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the 
nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing 
plants from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in 
the corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. 
Any such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are 
classified in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler 
operating the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to 
Sec. 1068.60 shall be priced at the statistical uniform price (or at the 
weighted average price if such is provided) of the respective order 
regulating the handling of milk at the transferee-plant, with such 
statistical uniform price adjusted to the location of the nonpool plant 
(but not to be less than the lowest class price of the respective 
order), except that transfers of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
shall be priced at the lowest class price of the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1068.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1068.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1068.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1068.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1068.30(b) and 
1068.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1068.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and

[[Page 583]]

    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1068.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1068.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1068.43(e). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 1068.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    (a) Whenever verification by the market administrator of reports or 
payments by any handler discloses errors in payments to the producer-
settlement fund pursuant to Sec. 1068.71, the market administrator shall 
promptly bill such handler for any unpaid amount and such handler shall, 
within 5 days of such billing, make payment to the market administrator 
of the amount so billed. Whenever verification discloses that payment is 
due from the market administrator to any handler, the market 
administrator shall, within 5 days, make payments to such handler.
    (b) Whenever verification by the market administrator of the 
payments by a handler to any producer or cooperative association 
discloses payment of less than is required by Sec. 1068.73, the handler 
shall pay the balance due such producer or cooperative association not 
later than the time for making payments next following such disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 1068.78  Charges on overdue accounts.

    Any unpaid obligation of a handler pursuant to Secs. 1068.71, 
1068.76, and 1068.77(a), for which remittance has not been made by the 
close of business on the next day following the date specified for such 
payment shall be increased three-fourths of 1 percent for each month and 
any remaining amount due shall be increased at a similar rate on the 
corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. The amounts 
payable pursuant to this section shall be computed monthly on each 
unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid charges previously 
made pursuant to this section; and for the purpose of this section any 
obligation that was determined at a date later than prescribed by the 
order because of a handler's failure to submit a report to the market 
administrator when due shall be considered to have been payable by the 
date it would have

[[Page 584]]

been due if the report had been filed when due.

Sec. 1076.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless both handlers request the same 
classification in another class. In either case, the classification of 
such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1076.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1076.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1076.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1076.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1076.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding step of Sec. 1076.44(b), the skim milk 
or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, 
shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would 
be the case if the other source milk had been received at the transferee 
plant or divertee plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an

[[Page 593]]

other order plant shall be classified in the following manner. Such 
classification shall apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in 
excess of any receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products, respectively, that are in the same category as 
described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1076.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d) (2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1076.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to

[[Page 594]]

the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in this subparagraph.
    (e) Transfers by a handler described in Sec. 1076.9(c) to pool 
plants. Skim milk and butterfat transferred in the form of bulk milk by 
a handler described in Sec. 1076.9(c) to a pool plant shall be 
classified pursuant to Sec. 1076.44 pro rata with producer milk received 
at the transferee-handler's plant.

Sec. 1076.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk, the following 
rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1076.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1076.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1076.40, 1076.41 and 1076.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1076.9 (b) or (c) shall be the 
classification of producer milk for such handler;

[[Page 595]]

    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1076.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1076.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1076.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

Sec. 1076.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1076.9(a) for each of its separate pool plants 
the classification of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1076.9(c) by allocating the handler's receipts of skim 
milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1076.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk

the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of

of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an

[[Page 596]]

unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1076.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class

(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:

in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in

other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from

transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not subtracted 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II or Class 
III classification is requested by the operator of the other order plant 
and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1076.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were 
not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at

direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk

(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1076.45(a); or

remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the

be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and

[[Page 599]]

utilization for the month is received from a handler who has received 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products from an other order 
plant, the class to which such receipts are allocated pursuant to 
Secs. 1076.43(d) and 1076.44 on the basis of such report, (including any 
reclassification of inventories of bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products), and thereafter, any change in such allocation required to 
correct errors disclosed in the verification of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association, which so requests, the percentage of the 
milk caused to be delivered by the cooperative association or its 
members to the pool plant(s) of each handler during the month, which was 
utilized in each class. For the purpose of this report, the milk so 
delivered shall be allocated to each class for each handler in the same 
ratio as all producer milk received by such handler during the month.

prices for the month shall be as follows:
    (a) Class I price. The Class I price for the month per hundredweight 
of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $1.50.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Class I differential price. The Class I differential price shall 
be the difference between the current month Class I and Class III prices 
(this price may be negative).
    (f) Class II differential price. The Class II differential price 
shall be the difference between the current month Class II and Class III 
prices (this price may be negative).
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded 
to the nearest cent, shall be the Class III price less an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35.
    (i) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class III price plus an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 965 and dividing 
the resulting amount by one hundred.
    (j) Protein price. The protein price per pound, rounded to the

test of the basic formula price as reported by the Department for the 
month times the protein price, and dividing the resulting amount by the 
average other solids test of the basic formula price as reported by the 
Department. If the resulting price is less than zero, then the protein 
price will be reduced so that the other solids price equals zero.
    (l) Somatic cell adjustment. (1) The somatic cell adjustment rate, 
per 1,000 somatic cells, rounded to five decimal places, shall be 
computed by multiplying .0005 times the monthly Cheddar cheese price as 
defined in paragraph (j) of this section; and

[[Page 600]]

    (2) The somatic cell adjustment, per hundredweight, shall be

Sec. 1076.60  Handler's value of milk.

    For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for milk, the 
market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of 
each handler described in Sec. 1076.9(a) with respect to each of its 
pool plants and each handler described in Sec. 1076.9 (b) and (c).
    (a) The handler's obligation for producer milk and milk received 
from a handler described in Sec. 1076.9(c) shall be computed as follows:
    (1) Multiply the total hundredweight of milk in Class I as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1076.43(a) and Sec. 1076.44(c) by the Class 
I differential price for the month;
    (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of 
milk in Class II as determined pursuant to Sec. 1076.43(a) and 
Sec. 1076.44(c) by the Class II differential price for the month;
    (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk in Class I as determined pursuant to Sec. 1076.43(a) and 
Sec. 1076.44(a) by the skim milk price;
    (4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to Sec. 1076.43(a) and 
Sec. 1076.44(a) by the average protein content of the skim milk received 
by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of protein by the 
protein price;
    (5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to Sec. 1076.43(a) and 
Sec. 1076.44(a) by the average other solids content of the skim milk 
received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of other 
solids by the other solids price; and
    (6) Add an adjustment for somatic cell content determined by

the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1076.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1076.44(b);

differential price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated 
supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk 
products assigned to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1076.43(d) and 
Sec. 1076.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1076.44(a)(11) and the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1076.44(b), excluding such skim milk and

month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1076.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1076.30(b) and 1076.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:

[[Page 607]]

    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I 
differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both price 
to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant, with the difference to be not less than zero; and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations;
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1070.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1076.60 
shall be priced at the statistical uniform price (or at the weighted 
average price if such is provided) of the respective order regulating 
the handling of milk at the transferee-plant, with such statistical 
uniform price adjusted to the location of the nonpool plant (but not to 
be less than the lowest class price of the respective order), except 
that

[[Page 608]]

transfers of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at 
the lowest class price of the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1076.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1076.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1076.71(a)(2)(v), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1076.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1076.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1076.30(b) and 
1076.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1076.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1076.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1076.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1076.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 1079.3  Route disposition.

    Route disposition means any delivery (including any delivery by a 
vendor or disposition at a plant store) of a fluid milk product 
classified as Class I milk, other than bulk fluid milk products 
transferred to other plants.


<R05>
Sec. 1079.4  Plant.

    Plant means the land, buildings, facilities, and equipment 
constituting a single operating unit or establishment at which milk or 
milk products (including filled milk) are received, processed, or 
packaged. Separate facilities used only as a distribution point for 
storing packaged fluid milk products in transit or separate facilities 
at which milk is only reloaded from one tank truck to another for 
transshipment shall not be a ``plant'' under this definition.


<R05>
Sec. 1079.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) Any plant (which, if qualified pursuant to this paragraph, shall 
be known as a ``pool distributing plant'') that is approved by a duly 
constituted regulatory agency for the processing or packaging of Grade A 
milk and from which during the month:
    (1) The total route disposition (excluding packaged fluid milk 
products received from other plants and filled milk) as a percent of the 
total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such plant or 
diverted therefrom by the plant operator is equal to 40 percent or more 
during each of the months of September through November and 35 percent 
or more during all other months;
    (2) Not less than 15 percent of such receipts are disposed of as 
route disposition (except filled milk) in the marketing area; and
    (3) A unit consisting of at least two plants operated by a handler 
shall be considered as one distributing plant for the purpose of meeting 
the requirements of this paragraph if:
    (i) Fluid milk products are processed and packaged at each plant;
    (ii) Each plant meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section; and
    (iii) The handler notified the market administrator in writing 
before the first day of the month that the plants should be considered 
as a unit. The unit shall continue from month to month thereafter 
without further notification. To add plants to the unit, to drop them, 
or to discontinue the unit, the handler shall notify the market 
administrator in writing on or before the first day of the month such 
change is to be made.
    (b) Any plant (which, if qualified pursuant to this paragraph, shall 
be known as a ``pool supply plant'') that is approved by a duly 
constituted regulatory agency for the handling of Grade A milk and from 
which during the month the volume of bulk fluid milk products 
transferred to pool distributing plants during each of the months of 
September through November is 35 percent or more and during each of the 
months of December through August is 30 percent or more of the total 
Grade A milk received at the plant from dairy farmers and handlers 
described in Sec. 1079.9(c), including milk diverted therefrom by the 
plant operator pursuant to Sec. 1079.13, subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The shipping percentages of this paragraph may be increased or 
decreased up to 10 percentage points by the Director of the Dairy 
Division if he finds that such revision is necessary to result in needed 
shipments to pool distributing plants for Class I use, or to prevent 
uneconomic shipments, subject to the following conditions:
    (i) Before making such a finding, the Director shall investigate the 
need for revision either on his own initiative or at the request of 
interested persons. If the investigation shows that a revision of the 
shipping percentage might be appropriate, he shall issue a notice 
stating that the revision is being considered and invite data, views, 
and arguments; and
    (ii) No plant may qualify as a pool plant due to a reduction in the 
shipping percentage pursuant to this subparagraph unless it had been a 
pool supply plant during each of the immediately preceding three months.
    (2) For plants located within the States of Iowa, Minnesota, 
Wisconsin, or that portion of Illinois north of

[[Page 612]]

Interstate 80, the shipping requirements of this paragraph may also be 
met in the following ways:
    (i) A cooperative association that operates a supply plant may 
include as qualifying shipments its deliveries to pool distributing 
plants directly from farms of producers pursuant to Sec. 1079.9(c);
    (ii) A proprietary handler may include as qualifying shipments milk 
diverted pursuant to Sec. 1079.13(d) to pool distributing plants;
    (iii) The operator of a supply plant may include as qualifying 
shipments transfers of fluid milk products to distributing plants 
regulated under other Federal orders, except that credit for such 
transfers shall be limited to the amount of milk, including milk shipped 
directly from producers' farms, delivered to pool distributing plants 
under this order; and
    (iv) Two or more supply plants operated by the same handler or by 
one or more cooperative associations may qualify for pooling as a unit 
by meeting the applicable percentage requirements of this paragraph in 
the same manner as a single plant if the handler submits a written 
request to the market administrator prior to the first day of September 
requesting that such plants qualify as a unit for the period of 
September through August of the following year.

The request shall list the plants to be included in the unit in the 
sequence in which they shall qualify for pool plant status based on the 
minimum deliveries required. If the deliveries made are insufficient to 
qualify the entire unit for pooling, the plant last on the list shall be 
excluded from the unit, followed by the plant next-to-last on the list, 
and continuing in this sequence until remaining plants on the list have 
met the minimum shipping requirements. Each plant that qualifies as a 
pool plant within a unit shall continue each month as a plant in the 
unit through the following August unless the plant fails subsequently to 
qualify for pooling or the handler submits a written request to the 
market administrator prior to the first day of the month that the plant 
be deleted from the unit or that the unit be discontinued. Any plant 
that has been so deleted from the unit, or that has failed to qualify in 
any month, will not be part of the unit for the remaining months through 
August. No plant may be added in any subsequent month through the 
following August to a unit that qualifies in September.
    (c) Any plant, except a plant included in a unit, that qualified as 
a pool plant in each of the immediately preceding three months on the 
basis of performance standards described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section.
    (d) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A governmental agency plant;
    (3) A plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) in 
this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another 
Federal order and from which during the month a greater quantity of 
fluid milk products, except filled milk, was disposed of as route 
disposition, in such other marketing area and to pool plants qualified 
on the basis of route disposition in such other marketing area than was 
so disposed of from such plant in the Iowa marketing area as route 
disposition, or to pool plants qualified on the basis of route 
disposition, except that if such plant was subject to all the provisions 
of this part in the immediately preceding month, it shall continue to be 
subject to all the provisions of this part until the third consecutive 
month in which a greater proportion of its fluid milk products 
disposition, except filled milk, is made in the above described manner 
in such other marketing area, unless, notwithstanding the provisions of 
this paragraph, it is regulated by such other order;
    (4) A plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to this section which 
also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from 
which during the month a greater quantity of fluid milk products, except 
filled milk, was disposed of as route disposition in this marketing 
area, and to pool plants qualified on the basis of route disposition in 
this marketing area than was so disposed of in such other Federal order 
marketing area but which plant is, nevertheless, fully regulated under 
such other Federal order; and

[[Page 613]]

    (5) That portion of a plant that is physically separated from the 
Grade A portion of such plant, is operated separately, and is not 
approved by any regulatory agency for the receiving, processing, or 
packaging of any fluid milk product for Grade A disposition.

receives for its account from the farm of a producer for delivery to a 
pool plant in a tank truck owned and operated by, or under the control 
of, such cooperative association. If the milk is delivered to the pool

milk if both the cooperative association and the operator of the pool 
plant notify the market administrator prior to the time that such milk 
is delivered to the pool plant that the plant operator will purchase 
such milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurements at 
the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples.

so moved is assigned to Class I under the provisions of such other 
order; and
    (4) Any government institution which produces milk in conjunction 
with the operation of a plant exempt from all provisions of this part 
pursuant to Sec. 1079.8(e).

the following conditions:
    (1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion under 
this section unless during the month at least one day's production of 
milk of such dairy farmer is physically received as producer milk at a 
pool plant;
    (2) The total quantity of milk diverted by a cooperative association 
during the month may not exceed 50 percent in the months of September 
through November and 70 percent in other months, of the producer milk

day's production--shall be excluded first in determining which milk 
should not be producer milk; and
    (5) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to

    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through

plant);
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1079.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that, if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this 
subparagraph shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 1079.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless both handlers request the same 
classification in another class. In either case, the classification of 
such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1079.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1079.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1079.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1079.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1079.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding step of Sec. 1079.44(b), the skim milk 
or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, 
shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would 
be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraphs (b) (1), (2) or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other

[[Page 620]]

order is not available to the market administrator for the purpose of 
establishing classification under this paragraph, classification shall 
be as Class I, subject to adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1079.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to 
governmental agency plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in the 
following forms from a pool plant to a producer-handler under this or 
any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
fluid milk product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1079.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition of fluid milk products in the marketing area 
of each Federal milk order from the nonpool plant and transfers of 
packaged fluid milk products from such nonpool plant to plants fully 
regulated thereunder shall be assigned to the extent possible in the 
following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to

[[Page 621]]

the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (e) Transfers by a handler described in Sec. 1079.9(c) to pool 
plants. Skim milk and butterfat transferred in the form of bulk milk by 
a handler described in Sec. 1079.9(c) to a pool plant shall be 
classified pursuant to Sec. 1079.44 pro rata with producer milk received 
at the transferee-handler's plant.

Sec. 1079.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk, the following 
rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1079.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1079.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1079.40, 1079.41, and 1079.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1079.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1079.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1079.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall

[[Page 622]]

be assigned to uses under Sec. 1079.44 on a pro rata basis, unless a 
specific use of such receipts is established by the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

Sec. 1079.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1079.9(a) for each of his separate pool plants 
the classification of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1079.9(c) by allocating the handler's receipts of skim 
milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1079.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1079.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) For a pool plant that was subject to Sec. 1079.40(b)(1) or 
comparable provisions of another Federal order in the immediately 
preceding month, subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in 
Class II the pounds of skim milk in products specified in 
Sec. 1079.40(b)(1) in packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products that were in inventory at the beginning of the month, but not 
in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1079.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1079.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.

(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1079.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;

[[Page 623]]

    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from a 
governmental agency plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1079.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1079.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section,

subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at the 
plant pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I and 
in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation step at all pool 
plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of utilization in each 
class resulting from transfers between pool plants of the handler), with 
the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being 
subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, the pounds of 
skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply 
plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), 
and (8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were not offset by 
transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same unregulated 
supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated at this step 
were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section 
exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased 
(increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of 
available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of 
the handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of 
the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by 
a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(11) of this section exceed the pounds of skim

be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be 
subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III 
combined shall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount, 
beginning with the nearest plant at which Class I utilization is 
available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk

this section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) (12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1079.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class

Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III 
and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes 
at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section,

Sec. 1079.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1079.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1079.44(b), estimate and publicly announce on or before the 
12th day of the month the Class I utilization (to the nearest whole 
percentage) during the previous month of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such estimate shall be 
based upon the most current available data and shall be final for such 
purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Secs. 1079.43(d) and 1079.44 on the 
basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories of 
bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.

[[Page 626]]

    (d) On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests, the class utilization of 
producer milk received by each handler from a cooperative association or 
from members of the association. For the purpose of this report, the 
milk caused to be delivered by an association shall be prorated to each 
class in the proportion that the total receipts of milk received from 
producers by such handler were used in each class.

<R05>
Sec. 1079.50  Class and component prices.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1079.52, the class prices per 
hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat and the component 
prices for the month shall be as follows:
    (a) Class I price. The Class I price for the month per hundredweight 
of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $1.55.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Class III-A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Central States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as 
reported by the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by 
subtracting from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat 
dry milk price, plus the butterfat differential times 35 and rounded to 
the nearest cent.
    (e) Class I differential price. The Class I differential price shall 
be the difference between the current month Class I and Class III prices 
(this price may be negative).
    (f) Class II differential price. The Class II differential price 
shall be the difference between the current month Class II and Class III 
prices (this price may be negative).
    (g) Class III-A differential price. The Class III-A differential 
price shall be the difference between the current month's Class III and 
Class III-A prices (this price may be negative).
    (h) Skim milk price. The skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded 
to the nearest cent, shall be the Class III price less an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35.
    (i) Butterfat price. The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class III price plus an amount 
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 965 and dividing 
the resulting amount by one hundred.
    (j) Protein price. The protein price per pound, rounded to the 
nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be 1.32 times the average monthly 
price per pound for 40-pound block Cheddar cheese on the National Cheese 
Exchange as reported by the Department.
    (k) Other solids price. Other solids are herein defined as solids 
not fat other than protein. The other solids price per pound, rounded to 
the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the basic formula price at test 
less the average butterfat test of the basic formula price as reported 
by the Department times the butterfat price, less the average protein 
test of the basic formula price as reported by the Department for the 
month times the protein price, and dividing the resulting amount by the 
average other solids test of the basic formula price as reported by the 
Department. If the resulting price is less than zero, then the protein 
price will be reduced so that the other solids price equals zero.
    (l) Somatic cell adjustment. (1) The somatic cell adjustment rate, 
per 1,000 somatic cells, rounded to five decimal places, shall be 
computed by multiplying .0005 times the monthly cheddar cheese price as 
defined in paragraph (j) of this section; and
    (2) The somatic cell adjustment, per hundredweight, shall be 
determined by subtracting from 350 the somatic cell count (in thousands) 
of the milk, multiplying the difference by the somatic cell adjustment 
rate, and rounding to the nearest full cent.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1079.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed,

    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.

average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined

Sec. 1079.60  Handler's value of milk.

    For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for milk the 
market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of 
each handler described in Sec. 1079.9(a) with respect to each of its 
pool plants, and each handler described in Sec. 1079.9 (b) and (c).
    (a) The handler's obligation for producer milk and milk received 
from a handler described in Sec. 1079.9(c) shall be computed as follows:
    (1) Multiply the total hundredweight of milk in Class I as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1079.43(a) and Sec. 1079.44(c) by the Class 
I differential price for the month;
    (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of 
milk in Class II as determined pursuant to Sec. 1079.43(a) and 
Sec. 1079.44(c) by the Class II differential price for the month;
    (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk in Class I as determined pursuant to Sec. 1079.43(a) and 
Sec. 1079.44(a) by the skim milk price;
    (4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to Sec. 1079.43(a) and 
Sec. 1079.44(a) by the average protein content of the skim milk received 
by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of protein by the

products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1079.61  Producer price differential.

    For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer 
price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1. If the unreserved cash 
balance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the 
computation is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of producer milk on 
all reports, the report of any handler who has not made the payments 
required pursuant to Sec. 1079.71 for the preceding month shall not be 
included in the computation of the producer price differential. The 
report of such handler shall not be included in the computation for 
succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding 
monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, the 
market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in 
the following manner:
    (a) Combine into one total for all handlers:
    (1) The values computed pursuant to Sec. 1079.60 (a)(1), (a)(2), 
(a)(7), and (b) through (j) for all handlers; and
    (2) Add values computed pursuant to Sec. 1079.60 (a)(3), (a)(4), 
(a)(5) and (a)(6); and subtract the values obtained by multiplying the 
handlers' total pounds of protein and total pounds of other solids 
contained in such milk by their respective prices, and the total value 
of somatic cell adjustments;

[[Page 631]]

    (b) Add an amount equal to the sum of the location adjustments 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1079.75;
    (c) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
cash balance in the producer-settlement fund;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1079.60(f); and
    (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the 
price computed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The result 
shall be known as the ``producer price differential.''

Sec. 1079.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1079.30(b) and 1079.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition of fluid milk products 
in the marketing area from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I 
differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both prices 
to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing 
plant, with the difference to be not less than zero; and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1079.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:

[[Page 635]]

    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1079.60 
shall be priced at the statistical uniform price (or at the weighted 
average price if such is provided) of the respective order regulating 
the handling of milk at the transferee-plant, with such statistical 
uniform price adjusted to the location of the nonpool plant (but not to 
be less than the lowest class price of the respective order), except 
that transfers of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be priced 
at the lowest class price of the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1079.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1079.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1079.71(a)(2)(v), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1079.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1079.7(b) 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1079.30(b) and 
1079.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1079.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1079.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1079.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1079.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the

[[Page 636]]

nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the Class I price 
applicable under the other order at the location of the plant where the 
nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the 
Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment option shall 
apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the plant that 
processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more 
Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement 
fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the 
nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the 
source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk 
products cannot be determined by the market administrator.

such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe with respect to all 
milk received from the producers' farms during the month, and shall pay 
such deductions to the market administrator on or before the 15th day 
after the end of such month. Such moneys shall be expended by the market 
administrator to provide for market information and to verify the 
weights, samples, and tests of milk of producers who are not receiving 
such services from a cooperative association.
    (b) In the case of producers for whom a cooperative association is 
actually performing the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, each handler shall make, in lieu of the deduction specified in 
pargrah (a) of this section, such deductions from the payments to be 
made to such producers as may be authorized by the membership agreement 
or marketing contract between such cooperative association and such 
producers and on or before the 15th day after the end of each month

    Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A distributing plant (other than one described in paragraph (e) 
of this section), from which during the month there is:
    (1) Total route disposition (except filled milk) in an amount not 
less than 50 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products 
(except filled milk) received at such plant, including producer milk 
diverted from the plant; and
    (2) Route disposition (except filled milk) in the marketing area in 
an amount not less than 10 percent of such receipts.
    (b) A supply plant from which during the month not less than 50 
percent of the total quantity of milk that is received from dairy 
farmers (including producer milk diverted from the plant pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.13, but excluding milk diverted to such plant) and handlers 
described in Sec. 1106.9(c) is transferred or diverted pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section to plants described in paragraph (a) or

    (1) A supply plant that has qualified as a pool plant during each of 
the immediately preceding months of September through January shall 
continue to so qualify in each of the following

[[Page 640]]

months of February through August until any month of such period in 
which less than 20 percent of the milk received or diverted as 
previously specified, is shipped to plants described in paragraph (a) or 
(e) of this section. A plant not meeting such 20 percent requirement in 
any month of such February-August period shall be qualified in any 
remaining month of such period only if transfers and deversions pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(2) of this section to plants described in paragraph (a) 
or (e) of this section are not less than 50 percent of receipts or 
diversions, as previously specified.
    (2) The operator of a supply plant that is located in the marketing 
area or in a county adjacent to the marketing area may include milk 
diverted pursuant to Sec. 1106.13(c) from such plant to plants described 
in paragraph (a) or (e) of this section as qualifying shipments in 
meeting the supply plant's monthly shipping percentages. The diverted 
milk used in meeting such qualifying shipments shall be limited to the 
milk of dairy farmers from whom at least one day's production is 
physically received during the month at such supply plant. Diversions in 
excess of three-fifths of the shipping requirement shall not be included 
as qualifying shipments.
    (c) Any plant located in the marketing area or in a county adjacent 
to the marketing area that is operated by a cooperative association if 
pool plant status under this paragraph is requested by the cooperative 
association and during the month, or the 12-month period ending with the 
immediately preceding month, 35 percent or more of the producer milk of 
members of the cooperative association (and any producer milk of 
nonmembers and members of another cooperative association which may be 
marketed by the cooperative association) is physically received in the 
form of bulk fluid milk products at plants specified in paragraph (a) or 
(e) of this section either directly from farms or by transfer from 
supply plants operated by the cooperative association and from plants of 
the cooperative association for which pool plant status has been 
requested under this paragraph subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The plant does not qualify as a pool plant under paragraph (a), 
(b) or (e) of this section or under comparable provisions of another 
Federal order; and
    (2) The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency 
for the handling of milk approved for fluid consumption in the marketing 
area.
    (d) The shipping standards in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section 
may be increased or decreased temporarily up to 10 percentage points by 
the Director of the Dairy Division if the Director finds such revision 
is necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic 
shipments. Before making such a finding the Director shall investigate 
the need for revision, either at the Director's initiative or at the 
request of interested persons. If the investigation shows that a 
revision might be appropriate, the Director shall issue a notice stating 
that revision is being considered and inviting data, views, and 
arguments. If a plant which would not otherwise qualify as a pool plant 
during the month qualifies as a pool plant because of a reduction in 
shipping standards pursuant to this paragraph, such plant shall be a 
nonpool plant for such month if the operator files a written request for 
nonpool plant status with the market administrator at the time the 
report is filed for such plant pursuant to Sec. 1106.30.
    (e) A distributing plant that meets the following conditions:
    (1) The plant is located in the marketing area;
    (2) The plant has route disposition (except filled milk) during the 
month in an amount not less than 50 percent of the total quantity of 
fluid milk products (except filled milk) received at such plant, 
including producer milk diverted from such plant; and
    (3) The principal activity of such plant is the processing and 
distribution of aseptically processed fluid milk products.
    (f) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant or governmental agency plant;
    (2) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section

[[Page 641]]

which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and 
from which there is a greater quantity of route disposition, except 
filled milk, during the month in such other Federal order marketing area 
than in this marketing area, except that if such plant was subject to 
all the provisions of this part in the immediately preceding month, it 
shall continue to be subject to all the provisions of this part until 
the third consecutive month in which a greater proportion of its route 
disposition, except filled milk, is made in such other marketing area 
unless, notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, it is 
regulated under such other order. On the basis of a written application 
made by the plant operator at least 15 days prior to the date for which 
a determination of the Secretary is to be effective, the Secretary may 
determine that the route disposition in the respective marketing areas 
to be used for purposes of this paragraph shall exclude (for a specified 
period of time) route disposition made under limited term contracts to 
governmental bases and institutions;
    (3) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal 
order and from which there is a greater quantity of route disposition, 
except filled milk, during the month in this marketing area than in such 
other Federal order marketing area but which plant is, nevertheless, 
fully regulated under such other Federal order;
    (4) A supply plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal 
order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made during the 
month to plants regulated under such other order than are made to plants 
regulated under this part;
    (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
which has automatic pooling status under another Federal order; or
    (6) That portion of a plant that is not approved by a duly 
constituted regulatory agency for the receiving, processing or packaging 
of any fluid milk product for fluid disposition and is physically 
separated from the portion of the plant having such approval.
[53 FR 15796, May 4, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 48939, Oct. 29, 1992]

    Effective Date Note: At 58 FR 60543, Nov. 17, 1993, in Sec. 1106.7, 
paragragh (b)(1) was amended by temporarily suspending in part the words 
beginning with ``of February through August'' and continuing through to 
the end of the paragraph, effective Oct. 1, 1993, through Jan. 30, 1994. 
At 59 FR 11182, Mar. 10, 1964, the same words were suspended, effective 
Feb. 1, 1994, through Aug. 31, 1996. At 61 FR 35597, July 8, 1996, the

Sec. 1106.13  Producer milk.

    Producer milk means the skim milk and butterfat in milk from a 
producer that is:
    (a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from such 
producer. Any milk picked up from the producer's farm tank in a tank 
truck owned and operated by, or under the control of, the operator of a 
pool plant but which is not received at a plant until the following 
month, shall be considered as having been received by the handler during

[[Page 643]]

accordance with Sec. 1106.9(c), is the handler for such milk.
    (b) Received by a handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c).
    (c) Diverted from a pool plant for the account of the handler 
operating such plant to another pool plant, without limit in any month. 
Such milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which 
diverted.
    (d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or by a cooperative 
association from a pool plant to a nonpool plant (other than a producer-
handler plant), subject to the following conditions:
    (1) In any month, milk of a producer shall not be eligible for 
diversion from a pool plant under this section unless at least one day's 
production from such producer is physically received at a pool plant 
during the month;
    (2) The total quantity of milk diverted by a cooperative association 
in any month shall not exceed the total quantity of producer milk that 
the cooperative association caused to be delivered to and was physically 
received at pool plants during the month;
    (3) The operator of a pool plant other than a cooperative 
association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a 
cooperative association that is diverting milk during the month pursuant 
to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The total quantity of milk so 
diverted in any month shall not exceed the total quantity of milk that 
was physically received at pool plant(s) as producer milk for which the 
plant operator is the handler;
    (4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in 
paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section shall not be producer milk. 
In such event, the diverting handler may designate the dairy farmer 
deliveries that shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to so 
designate, milk diverted on the last day of the month, then the second-
to-last-day of the month, and so on, shall be excluded until all 
diversions in excess of the prescribed limits are accounted for;
    (5) The quantity of milk diverted for the account of a cooperative 
association from a pool plant of another handler that would cause the 
pool plant to become a nonpool plant shall not be producer milk. In such 
event, the diverting handler may designate the dairy farmer deliveries 
that shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to so designate, 
milk diverted on the last day of the month, then the second-to-last-day 
of the month, and so on, shall be excluded until all diversions in 
excess of the prescribed limit are accounted for;
    (6) If a dairy farmer loses his producer status under this order 
(except as a result of temporary loss of approval from a duly 
constituted regulatory agency for the production of milk for fluid 
consumption), his milk shall not be eligible for diversion until milk of 
such dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a 
pool plant; and
    (7) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to 
which diverted.

<R05>
Sec. 1106.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1106.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat;
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through 
(6) of this section which was received in the form of a bulk fluid milk 
product or a bulk fluid cream product;
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant);
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurements at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this subparagraph shall be 
2 percent;

[[Page 648]]

    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this 
subparagraph shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received from unregulated supply plants,

the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such 
milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm 
and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 1106.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1106.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1106.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1106.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1106.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1106.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of Sec. 1106.44(b), the skim 
milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source 
milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than 
would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as

[[Page 649]]

described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1106.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to 
governmental agency plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in the 
following forms from a pool plant to a producer-handler under this or 
any other Federal order or transferred or diverted from a pool plant to 
a governmental agency plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or a governmental agency plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1106.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant

Sec. 1106.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1106.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1106.40, 1106.41, and 1106.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1106.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;

[[Page 651]]

    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1106.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1106.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1106.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

Sec. 1106.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1106.9(a) for each pool plant of the handler 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c), by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to [the utilization of such receipts 
by such handler as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1106.41(b).;
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts.
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1106.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1106.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was

[[Page 652]]

subject to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of 
another Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1106.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1106.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1106.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order and from a 
governmental agency plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant; 
and
    (vii) Receipts of fluid milk products from a person described in 
Sec. 1106.12(b)(5);
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not

[[Page 653]]

subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1106.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a) (7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then

[[Page 654]]

from Class II, with respect to whichever of the following quantities 
represents the lower proportion of Class I milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1106.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1106.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c), subtract such excess from the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1106.9(c) in each class shall be the combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the 
computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

estimate and publicly announce the utilization (to the nearest whole 
percentage) in each class during the month of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such estimate shall be 
based upon the most current available data and shall be final for such 
purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1106.43(d) and Sec. 1106.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests, the amount and class 
utilization of milk received by each handler from producers whose milk

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1106.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:

be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined

[[Page 658]]

receipts of packaged fluid milk products from other pool plants;
    (2) Multiply the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I by 105 
percent;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of skim milk in receipts of milk at the 
transferee-plant from producers, handlers described in Sec. 1106.9(c), 
and diverted milk from other pool plants;
    (4) Assign any remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I at the 
transferee-plant to the skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from other pool plants, first to the transferor-plants at which 
the highest Class I price applies and then to other plants in sequence 
beginning with the plant at which the next highest Class I price 
applies;
    (5) Compute the total amount of location adjustment credits to be 
assigned to transferor-plants by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk assigned pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section to each 
transferor-plant at which the Class I price is lower than the Class I 
price at the transferee-plant by the difference in Class I prices 
applicable at the transferor-plant and transferee-plant, and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (6) Assign the total amount of location adjustment credits computed 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section to those transferor-plants 
that transferred fluid milk products containing skim milk classified as 
Class I milk pursuant to Sec. 1106.42(a) and at which the applicable 
Class I price is less than the Class I price at the transferee-plant, in 
sequence beginning with the plant at which the highest Class I price 
applies. Subject to the availability of such credits, the credit 
assigned to each plant shall be equal to the hundredweight of such Class 
I skim milk multiplied by the applicable adjustment rate determined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section for such plant. If the 
aggregate of this computation for all plants having the same adjustment 
rate as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section exceeds 
the credits that are available to those plants, such credits shall be 
prorated to the volume of skim milk in Class I transfers from such 
plants; and
    (7) Location adjustment credit for butterfat shall be determined in 
accordance with the procedure outlined for skim milk in paragraphs (b) 
(1) through (6) of this section.
    (c) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be 
adjusted at the rates set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, except 
that the adjusted Class I price shall not be less than the Class III 
price.

<R05>
Sec. 1106.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of each handler 
described in Sec. 1106.9 (b) and (c) with respect to milk that was not 
received at a pool plant as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c) that were classified in each class 
pursuant to Secs. 1106.43 (a) and 1106.44 (c) by the applicable class 
prices, and add the resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1106.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1106.44(b) by the respective

[[Page 659]]

class prices, as adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1106.74, that are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1106.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1106.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and (vii), and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1106.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products 
from an other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from 
pool plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1106.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1106.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Secs. 1106.43(d) and 1106.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1106.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract for a handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c) the amount 
obtained from multiplying the Class III price for the preceding month by 
the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in inventory at 
the beginning of the month that was delivered to another handler's pool 
plant during the month;
    (h) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1106.43(d);
    (i) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1106.76 (a)(5) or (c); and
    (j) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1106.60 for all

[[Page 660]]

handlers who filed the reports prescribed in Sec. 1106.30 for the month 
and who made the payments pursuant to Sec. 1106.71 for the preceding 
month;
    (b) Add not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the 
producer-settlement fund;
    (c) Add the aggregate of all minus location adjustments and subtract

    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations;
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1106.60(f); and

<R05>
Sec. 1106.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, each handler shall pay 
to the market administrator on or before the 14th day after the end of 
the month the amount, if any, by which the amount specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section exceeds the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section:

amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.
    (c) Any handler who the market administrator determines was more 
than 3 days late in making any payment obligation under part 1106 shall

payments shall continue until the handler has met all payment 
obligations for 3 consecutive months.
    (d) The following conditions shall apply with respect to payments 
prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section:
    (1) Payments to the market administrator shall be deemed not to have 
been made until such payments have been received by the market 
administrator.
    (2) If the date by which payments must be received by the market 
administrator falls on a Saturday or Sunday or any day that is a 
national holiday, payments shall not be due until the next day on which 
the market administrator's office is open for public business.
    (3) Payments due the market administrator from a cooperative 
association handler may be offset by payments determined by the market 
administrator to be due the cooperative association pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.73 (b) and (d).

computed pursuant to Sec. 1106.71(a)(2) exceeds the amount computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1106.71(a)(1).
    (b) If the market administrator received payment from a handler(s) 
pursuant to Sec. 1106.71(c), he shall distribute such amount plus any 
amount due such handler(s) pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to 
producers and to cooperative associations in the same manner as provided 
in Sec. 1106.73. In the event the handler fails to transmit the total 
amount due, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly the payments 
due to producers of such handler and complete such payments when the 
remaining amount is received.
    (c) If at any time the balance in the producer-settlement fund is 
insufficient to make all payments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments 
and shall complete such payments as soon as the appropriate funds are 
available.

adjusted by the zone or location adjustment applicable at the receiving 
plant multiplied by the hundredweight of milk received from such 
producer during the first 15 days of the month, less proper deductions 
authorized in writing by the producer from whom the handler received 
milk, except that the amount deducted shall not exceed the value of the 
milk received during the partial payment period and provided that the

milk and from whom the handler received milk during the month, a written 
statement showing:
    (1) The identity of the handler and the producer and the month to 
which the payment applies;
    (2) The total pounds, and, with respect to final payments, the 
average butterfat content of the milk for which payment is being made;
    (3) The minimum rate of payment required by the order and the rate 
of payment used if such rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;
    (4) The amount and nature of any deductions from the amount 
otherwise due the producer; and
    (5) The net amount of payment to the producer.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 1106.71(c) and paragraph (f) of this 
section, each handler pursuant to Sec. 1106.9(a) who receives milk from 
a cooperative association as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1106.9(c), 
including the milk of producers who are not members of such association, 
and who the market administrator determines have authorized such 
cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, shall pay 
such cooperative for such milk as follows:
    (1) On or before the 2nd day prior to the last day of the month for 
milk received during the first 15 days of the month, not less than the 
applicable partial payment rate specified for such month in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section; and
    (2) On or before the 15th day of the following month for milk 
received during the month, not less than the uniform price as adjusted 
pursuant to Secs. 1106.74 and 1106.75, less any payments made pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

amount determined by multiplying such receipts during the first 15 days 
of the month by the applicable partial payment rate specified for such 
month in

[[Page 663]]

paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the handler so elects, such price 
may be adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1106.74 
for the preceding month.
    (2) On or before the 15th day after the end of each month, an amount 
determined by multiplying the quantity of such receipts during the month 
that was classified in each class pursuant to Sec. 1106.42(a) by the 
applicable class price, as adjusted by the butterfat differential 
specified in Sec. 1106.74, less any payments made by the handler 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section for such month. For the 
purpose of such computation, the applicable Class I price shall be the 
Class I price applicable at the transferee plant including the 
applicable administrative assessment rate.
    (f) If the application of Sec. 1106.71(d)(2) results in a delay in 
payment by the market administrator to handlers, the payments prescribed 
in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of this section may be delayed by the 
same number of days.
    (g) If the market administrator does not receive the full payment 
required of a handler pursuant to Sec. 1106.71(c), he shall reduce 
uniformly per hundredweight the payments due producers and cooperative 
associations for their milk received by such handler by a total amount 
not in excess of the amount due from such handler. The market 
administrator shall complete such payments on or before the next date 
for making payments pursuant to this section following the date on which 
the remaining payment is received from such handler.


<R05>
Sec. 1106.74  Butterfat differential.

    For milk containing more or less than 3.5 percent butterfat, the 
uniform price shall be increased or decreased, respectively, for each 
one-tenth percent butterfat variation from 3.5 percent by a butterfat 
differential, rounded to the nearest one-tenth cent, which shall be 
0.138 times the current month's butter price less 0.0028 times the 
preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, for 
manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the ``base 
month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1106.51 (a) through (e), as 
reported by the Department. The butter price means the simple average 
for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade A butter price 
as reported by the Department.

Sec. 1106.75  Plant location adjustments for producers and on nonpool milk.

    (a) In making payments required pursuant to Sec. 1106.73, the 
uniform price computed pursuant to Sec. 1106.61 shall be adjusted by the 
amounts set forth in Sec. 1106.52 according to the location of the plant 
where the milk being priced was received.
    (b) For the purpose of computations pursuant to Secs. 1106.71 and 
1106.72, the uniform price shall be adjusted by the amount set forth in 
Sec. 1106.52 that is applicable at the location of the nonpool plant 
from which the milk was received (except that the adjusted uniform price 
shall not be less than the Class III price).


<R05>
Sec. 1106.76  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Sec. 1106.30(b) and Sec. 1106.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and

[[Page 664]]

    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the uniform price, both prices to be applicable at the 
location of the partially regulated distributing plant (except that the 
Class I price and uniform price shall not be less than the Class III 
price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1106.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1106.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1106.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1106.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1106.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1106.60 for each

[[Page 665]]

nonpool plant that is not an other order plant which serves as a supply 
plant for such partially regulated distributing plant by making 
shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant during the month 
equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1106.7(b) subject to the 
following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with its reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1106.30(b) and 
1106.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1106.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1106.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1106.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1106.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 1106.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever audit by the market administrator of any handler's reports, 
books, records, or accounts discloses adjustments to be made, for any 
reason, which results in monies due the market administrator from such 
handler, the market administrator shall promptly notify such handler of 
any such amount due, and payment thereof shall be made on or before the 
next date for making payment set forth in the provision under which the 
error occurred. Any monies found to be due a handler from the market 
administrator shall be paid promptly to such handler, except that the 
market administrator shall offset any monies due a handler against 
monies due from such handler. Whenever verification by the market 
administrator of the payment by a handler to any producer or cooperative 
association for milk received by such handler discloses payment of less 
than is required pursuant to Sec. 1106.73, the handler shall pay such 
balance due such producer or cooperative association not later than the 
time of making payment to producers or cooperative associations next 
following such disclosure.

[[Page 666]]


<R05>
Sec. 1106.78  Charges on overdue accounts.

    Any unpaid obligation of a handler pursuant to Secs. 1106.71, 
1106.73,

1106.76, 1106.77, 1106.85, or 1106.86 shall be increased 1 percent 
beginning on the first day after the due date, and on the same day of 
each subsequent month until such obligation is paid, subject to the 
following conditions:
    (a) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
charges previously computed pursuant to this section; and
    (b) For the purpose of this section, any obligation that was 
determined at a date later than prescribed by the order because of a 
handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator when 
due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have 
been due if the report had been filed when due.
    (c) All monies collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to 
the administrative assessment fund maintained by the market 
administrator.

        Administrative Assessment and Marketing Service Deduction


<R05>
Sec. 1106.85  Assessment for order administration.

    As his pro rata share of the expense of administration of the order, 
each handler shall pay to the market administrator on or before the 15th 
day after the end of the month 6 cents per hundredweight or such lesser 
amount as the Secretary may prescribe with respect to:
    (a) Receipts of producer milk (including such handler's own 
production) other than such receipts by a handler described in 
Sec. 1106.9(c) that were delivered to pool plants of other handlers or 
held in inventory at the end of the month;
    (b) Receipts from a handler described in Sec. 1106.9(c);
    (c) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I 
use pursuant to Sec. 1106.43(d) and other source milk allocated to Class 
I pursuant to Sec. 1106.44 (a)(7) and (a)(11) and the corresponding 
steps of Sec. 1106.44(b), except such other source milk that is excluded 
from the computations pursuant to Sec. 1106.60 (d) and (f); and
    (d) Route disposition from a partially regulated distributing plant 
in the marketing area that exceeds the skim milk and butterfat specified 
in Sec. 1106.76(a)(2).
[47 FR 53694, Nov. 29, 1982, as amended at 58 FR 27882, May 11, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 1106.86  Deduction for marketing services.

    (a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
handler, in making payments to producers pursuant to Sec. 1106.73, shall 
deduct 7 cents per hundredweight, or such lesser amount as the Secretary 
may prescribe, with respect to the milk of such producer (except a 
handler's own farm production) for whom the marketing services set forth 
in this paragraph are not being performed by a cooperative association 
as determined by the Secretary. Each handler making such deductions 
shall pay the deductions to the market administrator on or before the 
15th day after the end of the month. The monies shall be used by the 
market administrator to verify or establish weights, samples and tests 
of producer milk and provide producers with market information. The 
services shall be performed by the market administrator or an agent 
engaged by and responsible to him.
    (b) In the case of producers for whom a cooperative association is 
actually performing the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, each handler shall make, in lieu of the deduction specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, such deductions from the payments to be 
made to such producers as may be authorized by the membership agreement 
or marketing contract between such cooperative association and such 
producers, and on or before the 15th day after the end of each month, 
pay such deduction to the cooperative association rendering such 
services accompanied by a statement showing the quantity of milk for 
which such deduction was computed for each such producer.

<R05>
Sec. 1124.3  Route disposition.

    Route disposition means any delivery of a fluid milk product 
classified as Class I milk from a plant to a retail or wholesale outlet 
(including any delivery through a distribution point as provided by this 
section, by a vendor, from a plant store or through a vending machine). 
The term ``route disposition'' does not include:
    (a) A delivery to a plant. However, packaged fluid milk products 
that are transferred to a pool distributing plant from another pool 
distributing plant, and classified as Class I under Sec. 1124.42(a), 
shall be considered route disposition from the transferor-plant for the 
sole purpose of qualifying it as a pool distributing plant under 
Sec. 1124.7(a), and the transferor-plant shall be assigned in-area 
dispositions but not in excess of the in-area dispositions of the 
transferee plant;
    (b) A delivery in bulk to a commercial food processing establishment 
pursuant to Sec. 1124.40(b)(3); or
    (c) A delivery to a military or other ocean transport vessel leaving

any pool plant.


<R05>
Sec. 1124.4  Plant.

    Plant means the buildings, facilities and equipment, whether owned 
or operated by one or more persons, constituting a single operating unit 
or establishment, which is maintained and operated primarily for the 
receiving, handling and/or processing of milk or milk products 
(including filled milk). Separate facilities used only as a distribution 
point for storing packaged fluid milk products in transit for route 
disposition or separate facilities used only as a reload point for 
transferring bulk milk from one tank truck to another shall not be a 
``plant'' under this definition.


<R05>
Sec. 1124.5  Distributing plant.

    Distributing plant means a plant in which a fluid milk product 
approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency for fluid consumption, 
or filled milk, is processed or packaged and that has route disposition 
in the marketing area during the month.


<R05>
Sec. 1124.6  Supply plant.

    Supply plant means a plant from which a fluid milk product approved 
by a duly constituted regulatory agency for fluid consumption or filled 
milk, is transferred during the month to a pool distributing plant.


<R05>
Sec. 1124.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A distributing plant from which there is route disposition 
(except filled milk) in the marketing area during the month equal to not 
less than 10 percent of receipts of Grade A milk at such plant 
(exclusive of transfers of packaged fluid milk products from plants 
qualifying as pool plants pursuant to this paragraph, filled milk, and 
milk received at such plant as diverted milk from another plant, which 
milk is classified in Class III under this order and is subject to the 
pricing and pooling provisions of this or another order issued pursuant 
to the Act) or diverted therefrom pursuant to Sec. 1124.13;
    (b) A supply plant from which during any month not less than 20 
percent of the total quantity of milk that is physically received at 
such plant from dairy farmers eligible to be producers pursuant to 
Sec. 1124.12 (excluding milk received at such plant as diverted milk 
from another plant, which milk is classified in Class III under this 
order and is subject to the pricing and pooling provisions of this or 
another order issued pursuant to the Act) or diverted as producer milk 
to another plant pursuant to Sec. 1124.13, is shipped in the form of a 
fluid milk product (except as filled

[[Page 669]]

milk) to a pool distributing plant or is a route disposition in the 
marketing area of fluid milk products (except filled milk) processed and 
packaged at such plant; Provided, That:
    (1) With respect to a supply plant operated by a cooperative 
association, the producer milk of its members which it caused to be 
delivered directly from their farms to pool distributing plants, shall 
for the purpose of this paragraph, be considered as a receipt at the 
cooperative's supply plant and a shipment from the supply plant to pool 
distributing plants;
    (2) A plant which qualified as a pool plant pursuant to this 
paragraph in each month of September through February shall be a pool 
plant in each of the following months of March through August unless a 
written application is filed with the Market Administrator prior to the 
first day of any such month requesting that the plant be designated a 
nonpool plant for such month and each subsequent month through August 
during which it would not otherwise qualify as a pool plant; and
    (3) For the purpose of this paragraph, the operations of two or more 
supply plants may be combined and considered as the operation of one 
plant if so requested in writing to the Market Administrator by the 
handler(s) operating such plants prior to the first day of the month for 
which such consideration is requested.
    (c) The Director of the Dairy Division may reduce or increase up to 
10 percentage points from the levels set forth therein the pool plant 
performance standards in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, if the 
Director finds such revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments or 
to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the 
Director shall investigate the need for revision either at the 
Director's own initiative or at the request of interested persons. If 
the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the 
Director shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being 
considered and invite data, views, and arguments.
    (d) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal Order and 
from which, the Secretary determines, there is a greater quantity of 
route disposition during the month in such other Federal Order marketing 
area than in this marketing area, except that if such plant was subject 
to all the provisions of this part in the immediately preceding month it 
shall continue to be subject to all the provisions of this part until 
the fourth consecutive month in which a greater proportion of its route 
disposition is made in such other marketing area unless, notwithstanding 
the provisions of this paragraph, it is regulated under such other 
order;
    (3) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal Order on 
the basis of route disposition in such other marketing area and from 
which, the Secretary determines, there is a greater quantity of route 
disposition in this marketing area than in such other marketing area but 
which plant maintains pooling status for the month under such other 
Federal Order;
    (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
which also meets the pool plant requirements of another Federal Order 
and from which greater shipments are made during the month to plants 
regulated under such other order than are made to plants regulated under 
this order;
    (5) A distributing plant from which total route disposition (except 
filled milk) in the marketing area during the month averages 300 pounds 
or less per day; or
    (6) That portion of a plant that is physically separated from the 
Grade A portion of such plant, is operated separately, and is not 
approved by any regulatory agency for the receiving, processing, or 
packaging of any fluid milk products for Grade A disposition.

Sec. 1124.10  Producer-handler.

    Producer-handler means a person who is engaged in the production of 
milk and also operates a plant from which during the month an average of 
more than 300 pounds daily of fluid milk products, except filled milk, 
is disposed of as route disposition within the marketing area and who

that all of the requirements of this section have been met, and that 
none of the conditions therein for cancellation of such designation 
exists. All designations shall remain in effect until canceled pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section. Any state institution shall be a 
producer-handler exempt from the provisions of this section and 
Secs. 1124.30 and 1124.32 with respect to milk of its own production and 
receipts from pool plants processed or received for consumption in State 
institutions and with respect to movements of milk to or from a pool 
plant.
    (a) Requirements for designation. (1) The producer-handler has and 
exercises (in its capacity as a handler) complete and exclusive control 
over the operation and management of a plant at which it handles and 
processes milk received from its milk production resources and 
facilities (designated as such pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section), the operation and management of which are under the complete 
and exclusive control of the producer-handler (in its capacity as a 
dairy farmer).

[[Page 671]]

    (2) The producer-handler neither receives at its designated milk 
production resources and facilities nor receives, handles, processes or 
distributes at or through any of its milk handling, processing or 
distributing resources and facilities (designated as such pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) milk products for reconstitution into 
fluid milk products, or fluid milk products derived from any source 
other than (i) its designated milk production resources and facilities, 
(ii) pool plants within the limitation specified in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, or (iii) nonfat milk solids which are used to fortify 
fluid milk products.
    (3) The producer-handler is neither directly nor indirectly 
associated with the business control or management of, nor has a 
financial interest in, another handler's operation; nor is any other 
handler so associated with the producer-handler's operation.
    (4) Designation of any person as a producer-handler following a 
cancellation of its prior designation shall be preceded by performance 
in accordance with paragraph (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section for a 
period of 1 month.
    (b) Resources and facilities. Designation of a person as a producer-
handler shall include the determination and designation of the milk 
production, handling, processing and distributing resources and 
facilities, all of which shall be deemed to constitute an integrated 
operation, as follows:
    (1) As milk production resources and facilities: All resources and 
facilities (milking herd(s), buildings housing such herd(s), and the 
land on which such buildings are located) used for the production of 
milk:
    (i) Which are directly, indirectly or partially owned, operated or 
controlled by the producer-handler;
    (ii) In which the producer-handler in any way has an interest 
including any contractual arrangement; and
    (iii) Which are directly, indirectly or partially owned, operated or 
controlled by any partner or stockholder of the producer-handler. 
However, for purposes of this paragraph any such milk production 
resources and facilities which the producer-handler proves to the 
satisfaction of the market administrator do not constitute an actual or 
potential source of milk supply for the producer-handler's operation as 
such shall not be considered a part of the producer-handler's milk 
production resources and facilities; and
    (2) As milk handling, processing and distributing resources and 
facilities: All resources and facilities (including store outlets) used 
for handling, processing and distributing any fluid milk product:
    (i) Which are directly, indirectly or partially owned, operated or 
controlled by the producer-handler; or
    (ii) In which the producer-handler in any way has an interest, 
including any contractual arrangement, or with respect to which the 
producer-handler directly or indirectly exercises any degree of 
management or control.
    (c) Cancellation. The designation as a producer-handler shall be 
canceled under any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) (1) and 
(2) of this section or upon determination by the market administrator 
that any of the requirements of paragraph (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this 
section are not continuing to be met, such cancellation to be effective 
on the first day of the month following the month in which the 
requirements were not met, or the conditions for cancellation occurred.
    (1) Milk from the designated milk production resources and 
facilities of the producer-handler is delivered in the name of another 
person as producer milk to another handler.
    (2) The producer-handler handles fluid milk products from sources 
other than the milk production facilities and resources specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section, except as specified as follows:
    (i) A producer-handler, other than a State institution, may receive 
fluid milk products from pool plants if such receipts do not exceed a 
daily average of 100 pounds during the month; and
    (ii) A State institution that otherwise qualifies as a producer-
handler, but which processes or receives milk for consumption outside of 
a State institution, may receive fluid milk products from pool plants if 
such receipts do not exceed a daily average of 1,000 pounds per day 
during the month.
    (d) Public announcement. The market administrator shall publicly 
announce

[[Page 672]]

the name, plant location and farm location(s) of persons designated as 
producer-handlers, of those whose designations have been canceled and 
the effective dates of producer-handler status or loss of producer-
handler status for each. Such announcements shall be controlling with 
respect to the accounting at plants of other handlers for fluid milk 
products received from any producer-handler.
    (e) Burden of establishing and maintaining producer-handler status. 
The burden rests upon the handler who is designated as a producer-
handler to establish through records required pursuant to Sec. 1000.5 of 
this chapter that the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section have been and are continuing to be met, and that the conditions 
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for cancellation of 
designation do not exist.

Sec. 1124.11  Cooperative reserve supply unit.

    Cooperative reserve supply unit means any cooperative association or 
its agent that is a handler pursuant to Sec. 1124.9 (b) or (c) that does 
not own or operate a plant, if such cooperative has been qualified to 
receive payments pursuant to Sec. 1124.73 and has been a handler of 
producer milk under this or its predecessor order(s) during each of the 
12 previous months, and if a majority of the cooperative's member 
producers are located within 125 miles of a pool distributing plant. A 
cooperative reserve supply unit shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (a) The cooperative shall file a request with the market 
administrator for cooperative reserve supply unit status at least 15 
days prior to the first day of the month in which such status is desired 
to be effective. Once qualified as a cooperative reserve supply unit 
pursuant to this paragraph, such status shall continue to be effective 
unless the cooperative requests termination prior to the first day of 
the month that change of status is requested, or the cooperative fails 
to meet all of the conditions of this section;
    (b) The cooperative reserve supply unit supplies fluid milk products 
to pool distributing plants located within 125 miles of a majority of 
the cooperative's member producers in compliance with any announcement 
by the market administrator requesting a minimum level of shipments as 
further provided below:
    (1) The market administrator may require such supplies of bulk fluid 
milk from cooperative reserve supply units whenever the market 
administrator finds that milk supplies for Class I use at pool 
distributing plants are needed for plants defined in Sec. 1124.7(a). 
Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate 
the need for such shipments either on the market administrator's own 
initiative or at the request of interested persons. If the market 
administrator's investigation shows that such shipments might be 
appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that 
a shipping announcement is being considered and inviting data, views and 
arguments with respect to the proposed shipping announcement.
    (2) Failure of a cooperative reserve supply unit to comply with any 
announced shipping requirements, including making any significant change 
in the unit's marketing operation that the market administrator 
determines has the impact of evading or forcing such an announcement, 
shall result in immediate loss of cooperative reserve supply unit status 
until such time as the unit has been a handler pursuant to Sec. 1124.9 
(b) and (c) for at least 12 consecutive months.

forth in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) Milk for which the cooperative association is a handler pursuant 
to Sec. 1124.9(c) to the following extent:
    (i) For purposes of reporting pursuant to Secs. 1124.30(c) and

and
    (ii) For all purposes, with respect to any such milk which is not 
delivered to the pool plant of another handler.
    (c) The following conditions shall apply to diverted producer milk:
    (1) A cooperative association or its agent may divert for its

producer milk which the associations cause to be delivered to pool 
plants or diverted during the month if each association has filed a 
request in writing with the market administrator on or before the first 
day of the month the agreement is to be effective. This request shall

deliveries of each cooperative according to a method approved by the 
market administrator;
    (5) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant or 
commercial food processing establishment to which diverted; and
    (d) In the case of any bulk tank load of milk originating at farms 
and subsequently divided among plants, the proportion of the load 
received at each plant shall be prorated among the individual producers 
involved on the basis of their respective percentage of the total load.

Sec. 1124.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. The classification of such 
transfers and diversions shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to

[[Page 679]]

the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, remaining in such 
class at the receiving handler's plant after the computation pursuant to 
Sec. 1124.44(a)(13) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1124.44(b). The 
amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall include 
the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat in transfers of 
concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1124.44(a)(8) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1124.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred shall be classified so as to allocate the least possible 
Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1124.44(a) 
(12) or (13) or the corresponding steps of Sec. 1124.44(b), the skim 
milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted up to the total of the skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, 
shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would 
be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustments when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1124.40.
    (c) Transferor and diversions to producer-handlers. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a producer-handler under this or any other Federal order shall 
be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
fluid milk product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to the transferee's receipts of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata 
to each source.

[[Page 680]]

    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in its report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1124.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and

[[Page 681]]

    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in this paragraph.

Sec. 1124.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1124.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1124.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1124.9 (b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1124.40, 
1124.41, and 1124.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids;
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1124.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association; and
    (d) For classification purposes, pursuant to Secs. 1124.40 through 
1124.45, butterfat in skim milk, either disposed of to others or used in 
the manufacture of milk products shall be accounted for at a butterfat 
content of 0.060 percent unless the handler has adequate records of the 
actual butterfat content of such skim milk.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III use at the plant.
    (f) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1124.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1124.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

Sec. 1124.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1124.9(a) for each of the handler's pool plants separately and of 
each handler described in Sec. 1124.9 (b) or (c) by allocating the 
handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to its utilization as 
follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1124.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim 
milk disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any 
federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not 
used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the

[[Page 682]]

pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(8)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the 
beginning of the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool 
plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable 
provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately preceding 
month;
    (5) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1124.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1124.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (7) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1124.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1124.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(6) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1124.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(5), (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products received or acquired for 
distribution from a producer-handler as defined under this or any other 
Federal Order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant; 
and
    (vii) Receipts of fluid milk products from a person described in 
Sec. 1124.12(b)(5);
    (9) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) and (8)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2), (8)(v), and (9)(i) of this section which are in excess 
of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(9)(ii) 
(A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim milk to be 
subtracted from Class II and

[[Page 683]]

Class III combined exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in such 
classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
fluid milk products from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid 
milk products from other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(8)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentages 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant are of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (10) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1124.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(6) and (a)(8)(i) of this section;
    (11) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (12) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(12) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity pro rated, to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2), (8)(v), (9) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received;
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II 
and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class 
III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such 
classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of

estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1124.43(f) and Sec. 1124.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report by the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests the amount and class 
utilization of producer milk delivered by members of such cooperative 
association to each handler receiving such milk. For the purpose of this 
report the milk so received shall be prorated to each class in 
accordance with the total utilization of producer milk by such handler.

    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) The Class III price shall be the basic formula price for the 
month.
    (d) The Class III-A price for the month shall be the average Western 
States nonfat dry milk price for the month, as reported by the 
Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by subtracting 
from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat dry milk

nearest cent.
    (e) The skim milk price per hundredweight shall be the basic formula 
price for the month pursuant to Sec. 1124.51(a) less an amount computed 
by multiplying the butterfat differential computed pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section by 35.
    (f) The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-
hundredth cent, shall be the total of:
    (1) The skim price computed in paragraph (e) of this section divided 
by 100; and

[[Page 686]]

    (2) The butterfat differential computed pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section multiplied by 10.
    (3) Compute a butterfat differential rounded to the nearest one-
tenth cent, by multiplying the current month's butter price by 0.138, 
and subtract from the result an amount determined by multiplying 0.0028 
by the preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, 
for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the 
``base month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1124.51 (a) through

hundredth cent, shall be 1.32 times the average monthly price per pound 
for 40-pound block Cheddar cheese on the National Cheese Exchange as 
reported by the Department.
    (h) The other solids price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-
hundredth cent, shall be the basic formula price at test less the 
average butterfat test of the basic formula price as reported by the 
Department times the butterfat price, less the average protein test of 
the basic formula price as reported by the Department for the month 
times the protein price, and dividing the resulting amount by the 
average other solids test of producer milk pooled under Part 1124 for 
the month, as determined by the Market Administrator. If the resulting 
price is less than zero, then the protein price will be reduced so that 
the other solids price equals zero.

Exchange Grade A butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for

total hundredweight of producer milk and the total hundredweight for 
which a value is computed pursuant to Sec. 1124.60(k); and
    (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents per hundredweight nor more than 5 
cents per hundredweight. The result shall be the producer price 
differential.

from subtracting the sum computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section from the sum computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) The sum of:
    (1) The total handler's value of milk for such month as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1124.60; and
    (2) For a cooperative association handler, the amount due from other 
handlers pursuant to Sec. 1124.73(d).
    (b) The sum of:

another order which provides for individual handler pooling, shall pay 
to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund an amount 
computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such other order plant. If reconstituted skim 
milk in filled milk is disposed of from such plant as route disposition 
in the marketing areas regulated by two or more market pool orders, the 
reconstituted skim milk assigned to Class I shall be prorated according 
to such disposition in each area.

differential for the month as adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1124.74(a);
    (v) Subtract payments made to the producer pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section;
    (vi) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the 
producer; and
    (vii) Subtract any deduction required pursuant to Sec. 1124.86 or by 
statute; and
    (3) If by the 19th day after the end of the month a handler has not 
received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 1124.72, the payments to producers required pursuant to paragraph

Sec. 1124.75  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund 
on or before the 25th day after the end of the month either of the 
amounts (at the handler's election) calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section. If the handler fails to report pursuant to 
Secs. 1124.30(d) and 1124.31(b) the information necessary to compute the 
amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the handler shall pay 
the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:
    (a) An amount computed as follows:
    (1)(i) The obligation that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1124.60 at such plant shall be determined as though such plant were 
a pool plant. For purposes of such computation, receipts at such nonpool 
plant from a pool plant or an other order plant shall be assigned to the 
utilization at which classified at the pool plant or other order plant 
and transfers from such nonpool plant to a pool plant or an other order 
plant shall be classified as Class II or Class III milk if allocated to 
such class at the pool plant or other order plant and be valued at the 
uniform price or estimated uniform price or statistical uniform price of 
the respective order if so allocated to Class I milk, except that 
reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be valued at the Class III 
price. No obligation shall apply to Class I milk transferred to a pool 
plant or another order plant if such Class I utilization is assigned to 
receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant from pool plants 
and other order plants at which an equivalent amount of milk was 
classified and priced as Class I milk. There shall be included in the 
obligation so computed a charge in the amount specified in 
Sec. 1124.60(j) and a credit in the amount specified in 
Sec. 1124.71(b)(3) with respect to receipts from an unregulated supply

[[Page 694]]

plant, except that the credit for receipts of reconstituted skim milk in 
filled milk shall be at the Class III price, unless an obligation with 
respect to such plant is computed as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section; and
    (ii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, and provides with reports filed pursuant to 
Secs. 1124.30(d) and 1124.31(b) similar reports with respect to the 
operations of any other nonpool plant which serves as a supply plant for 
such partially regulated distributing plant by shipments to such plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1124.7(b), with 
agreement of the operator of such plant that the market administrator 
may examine the books and records of such plant for purposes of 
verification of such reports, there will be added the amount of the 
obligation computed at such nonpool supply plant in the same manner and 
subject to the same conditions as for the partially regulated 
distributing plant.
    (2) From this obligation there will be deducted the sum of:
    (i) The gross payments made by such handler for Grade A milk 
received during the month from dairy farmers at such plant adjusted to a 
3.5 percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential pursuant to 
Sec. 1124.50(f)(3), and like payments made by the operator of a supply 
plant(s) included in the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Any payments to the producer-settlement fund of an other order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant.
    (b) An amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the respective amounts of skim milk and butterfat 
disposed of as route disposition of Class I milk within the marketing 
area;
    (2) Deduct the respective amount of skim milk and butterfat received 
at the plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that deducted under a similar provision of another order issued pursuant 
to the Act; and
    (ii) From a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to the 
extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under this or any 
other order issued pursuant to the Act is classified and priced as Class 
I milk and is not used as an offset on any payment obligation under this 
or any other order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) From the value of such milk at the Class I price applicable at 
the location of the nonpool plant, subtract its value at the statistical 
uniform price applicable at such location (not to be less than the Class 
III price), and add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of 
labeled reconstituted milk included in paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
by the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any 
reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not 
be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1124.43(f). Payments

[[Page 695]]

may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have 
been due if the report had been filed when due.

considered together for the purpose of meeting the total route 
disposition requirement, each such plant shall be deemed to have met the 
total disposition requirement of this paragraph if the combined route

this paragraph in three or more of the immediately preceding months of 
September through January.
    (d) Any plant during the months of February through July, other than 
a plant described in paragraph (a) of this section, that was a pool 
plant under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section during each of the 
immediately preceding months of September through January and is 
approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency for the disposition of 
Grade A milk in the marketing area, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) For the months of February through July 1975, the required 
qualification under paragraph (b) of this section in prior months shall 
be deemed to have been met if the plant was a pool supply plant under 
the Austin-Waco, West Texas, Corpus Christi, North Texas, San Antonio, 
or South Texas orders (or any combination thereof) during the months of 
September, October, and November 1974; and
    (2) If the plant operator files with the market administrator prior 
to any of the months of February through July a written request for 
nonpool status, a plant shall not be a pool plant under this paragraph 
during any of such remaining months through July.
    (e) Any plant located in the marketing area that is operated by a 
cooperative association if pool plant status under this paragraph is 
requested for such plant by the cooperative association and 60 percent 
or more of the producer milk of members of the cooperative association 
(excluding such milk that is received at or diverted from pool plants

received during the month in the form of a bulk fluid milk product at 
pool plants described in paragraph (a) of this section either directly 
from farms or by transfer from plants of the cooperative association for 
which pool plant status under this paragraph has been requested, subject

which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and 
from which there is a greater quantity of route disposition, except 
filled milk, during the month in such other Federal order marketing area 
than in this marketing area, except that if such plant was subject to 
all the provisions of this part in the immediately preceding month, it 
shall continue to be subject to all the provisions of this part until 
the third consecutive month in which a greater proportion of its route 
disposition, except filled milk, is made in such other marketing area;
    (4) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order on 
the basis of route disposition in such other marketing area and from 
which there is a greater quantity of route disposition, except filled 
milk, in this marketing area than in such other marketing area but which 
plant is, nevertheless, fully regulated under such other Federal order; 
and
    (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section which has automatic pooling status under another Federal order.

and operated by, or under the control of, the operator of a pool plant 
but which is not received at a plant until the following month. Such 
milk shall be considered as having been received by the handler during 
the month in which it is picked up at the producer's farm and shall be 
priced at the location of the plant where it is physically received in

continuously retained producer status

[[Page 702]]

since that time and further, during each of the months of September 
through January not less than 15 percent of the milk of such dairy 
farmer is physically received as producer milk at a pool plant. If a 
dairy farmer loses his producer status under this order (except as a 
result of a temporary loss of Grade A approval), his milk shall not be 
eligible for diversion until milk of such dairy farmer has been 
physically received as producer milk at a pool plant;
    (2) The total quantity of milk so diverted during the month by a 
cooperative association shall not exceed one-third of the producer milk 
that the cooperative association causes to be delivered during the month 
to pool plants described in Sec. 1126.7(a), (b), (c), and (d) and that 
is physically received thereat;
    (3) The operator of a pool plant that is not a cooperative 
association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a 
cooperative association that diverts milk during the month pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The total quantity of milk so diverted 
during the month shall not exceed one-third of the producer milk 
physically received at such pool plant during the month that is eligible 
to be diverted by the plant operator;
    (4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in 
paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section shall not be producer milk. 
If the diverting handler fails to designate the dairy farmers' 
deliveries that are not to be producer milk, no milk diverted by the 
handler during the month to a nonpool plant shall be producer milk;
    (5) The quantity of milk diverted for the account of a cooperative 
association from a pool plant of another handler that would cause the 
pool plant to become a nonpool plant shall not be producer milk; and
    (6) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to 
which diverted.

Sec. 1126.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1126.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through 
(6) of this section which was received in the form of a bulk fluid milk 
product or a bulk fluid cream product;
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant);
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
face, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph shall be 2 
percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph 
shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;

[[Page 707]]

    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received from unregulated supply plants, 
excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III classification is

the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such 
milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm 
and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 1126.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless both handlers request the same 
classification in another class. In either case, the classification of 
such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computations pursuant to Sec. 1126.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1126.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1126.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1126.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.44(a)(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of 
Sec. 1126.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, 
up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such 
receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk 
to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had 
been received at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective

[[Page 708]]

market administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such 
utilization available for such classification pursuant to the allocation 
provisions of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1126.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to 
governmental agency plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in the 
following forms from a pool plant to a producer-handler under this or 
any other Federal order or transferred or diverted from a pool plant to 
a governmental agency plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or a governmental agency plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1126.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence;
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at

[[Page 709]]

such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in this paragraph.
    (e) Transfers by a handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c) to pool 
plants. Skim milk and butterfat transferred in the form of bulk milk by 
a handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c) to another handler's pool plant 
shall be classified pursuant to Sec. 1126.44 pro rata with producer milk 
received at the transferee-handler's plant.

Sec. 1126.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk, the following 
rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1120.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1126.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1126.40, 1126.41, and 1126.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1126.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1126.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products

[[Page 710]]

that are reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, 
up to the reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk 
products, on a pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific 
concentrated receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any 
assignments under Sec. 1126.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1126.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

Sec. 1126.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1126.9(a) for each of his pool plants 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c), by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1126.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated

percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1126.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of

    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1126.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1126.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1126.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim

(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at

milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of

[[Page 712]]

skim milk in fluid milk products and products specified in 
Sec. 1126.40(b)(1) in inventory at the beginning of the month that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) 
of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a) (2)(i), (7)(v), and (8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were 
not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an 
amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a) (7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1126.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in

[[Page 713]]

Class I after such proration at the pool plants at which such other 
source milk was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk, remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1126.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c), subtract such excess from the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1126.9(c) in each class shall be the combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the 
computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the 
corresponding step of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1126.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1126.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1126.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1126.43(d) and Sec. 1126.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products

[[Page 714]]

to an other order plant the class to which such shipments were allocated 
by the market administrator of the other order on the basis of the 
report by the receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such 
allocation arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests the amount and class 
utilization of milk received by each handler from producers who are 
members of such cooperative association. For the purpose of this report 
the milk so received shall be prorated to each class in the proportion 
that the total receipts of milk from producers by such handler were used 
in each class.

determined by the Market Administrator.)
    (b) For fluid milk products transferred in bulk from a pool plant to 
a pool distributing plant at which a higher Class I price applies and 
which are classified as Class I milk, the Class I price shall be the 
Class I price applicable at the location of the transferee-plant subject 
to a location adjustment credit for the transferor-plant which shall be 
determined by the market administrator for skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, as follows:
    (1) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at 
the transferee-plant after the computations pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.44(a)(12) plus the pounds of skim milk in receipts of 
concentrated fluid milk products from other pool plants that are 
assigned to Class I use, an amount equal to:
    (i) 95 percent of the pounds of skim milk in receipts of milk at the 
transferee-plant from producers and handlers described in 
Sec. 1126.9(c); and
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products from other pool plants;
    (2) Assign any remaining pounds of skim milk in Class I at the 
transferee-plant to the skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from other pool plants, first to the transferor-plants at which 
the highest Class I price applies and then to other plants in sequence 
beginning with the plant at which the next highest Class I price 
applies;
    (3) Compute the total amount of location adjustment credits to be 
assigned to transferor-plants by multiplying the hundredweight of skim 
milk assigned pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section to each 
transferor-plant at which the Class I price is lower than the Class I 
price at the transferee-plant by the difference in Class I prices 
applicable at the transferor-plant and transferee-plant, and add the 
resulting amounts;
    (4) Assign the total amount of location adjustment credits computed 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section to those transferor-plants 
that transferred fluid milk products containing skim milk classified as 
Class I milk pursuant to Sec. 1126.42(a) and at which the applicable 
Class I price is less than the Class I price at the transferee-plant, in 
sequence beginning with the plant at which the highest Class I price 
applies. Subject to the availability of such credits, the credit 
assigned to each plant shall be equal to the hundredweight of such Class 
I skim milk multiplied by the applicable adjustment rate determined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section for such plant. If the 
aggregate of this computation for all plants having the same adjustment 
rate as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section exceeds 
the credits that are available to those plants, such credits shall be 
prorated to the volume of skim milk in Class I transfers from such 
plants; and
    (5) Location adjustment credit for butterfat shall be determined in 
accordance with the procedure outlined for skim milk in paragraphs (b) 
(1) through (4) of this section.
    (c) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be

Sec. 1126.55  Credits to handlers for transporting surplus milk.

    For each of the months of March through June and December 16-31, a 
transportation credit shall be computed for each handler on the amount 
of producer milk that is classified as Class II or Class III pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.42 (b)(3) or (d)(2) that such handler transfers or diverts to 
nonpool plants located outside the State of Texas. Credits established 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be computed at 
the rate of 2.4 cents per hundredweight for each 10 miles, or fraction 
thereof, for the shortest hard-surfaced highway distance, as determined 
by the market administrator. The amount of milk eligible for a 
transportation credit and the amount of such credit shall be established 
in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section subject 
to the limitations specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (a) A transfer credit shall apply to bulk fluid milk products 
transferred by a handler from a pool plant located in Zone 1 of the 
marketing area for the distance between the transferor pool plant and 
the transferee nonpool plant.
    (b) A credit for diverted milk shall apply to milk produced in Zone 
1, 1-A, or 3 of the marketing area or the Oklahoma counties of Atoka, 
Bryan, Carter, Choctaw, Comanche, Cotton, Greer, Harmon, Jackson, 
Jefferson, Johnston, Kiowa, Love, Marshall, McCurtain, Murray, 
Pushmataha, Stephens, or Tillman that is diverted to a nonpool plant for 
the distance in excess of 100 miles between the nonpool plant and the 
nearer of the city hall in Dallas, Texas, the pool plant of last receipt 
for the major portion of the milk on the route, or the courthouse of the 
county where the major portion of the milk on the load was produced.
    (c) A credit for diverted milk produced in the area specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section shall also include an amount per 
hundredweight equal to the difference between the location adjustment 
(excluding any plus adjustment) applicable in the area where the milk 
was produced and any greater minus location adjustment applicable at the 
location of the nonpool plant where the milk was received.
    (d) No credit shall apply to the total quantity of milk moved to a 
given nonpool plant by a handler during each of the credit periods if 
any portion of the milk is assigned to Class I. Also, the amount of milk 
to which a credit would be applicable during each of the credit periods 
pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be offset 
by the amount of milk that a handler or any affiliate of the handler 
causes to be received at plants located in the marketing area from 
outside the State of Texas during each of the credit periods, with such 
offset to be applied in sequence beginning with the nonpool plant at 
which the greatest credit would apply.

<R05>
Sec. 1126.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of

[[Page 718]]

each handler described in Sec. 1126.9(b) and (c) with respect to milk 
that was not received at a pool plant as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c) that were classified in each class 
pursuant to Secs. 1126.43(a) and 1126.44(c) by the applicable class 
prices, and add the resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1126.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1126.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1126.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1126.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1126.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and (vii), and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1126.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products 
from an other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from 
pool plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1126.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1126.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1126.43(d) and Sec. 1126.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1126.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract for a handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c) the amount 
obtained from multiplying the Class III price for the preceding month, 
as adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1126.74, by 
the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in inventory at 
the beginning of the month that was delivered to another handler's pool 
plant during the month;
    (h) Deduct any credit applicable pursuant to Sec. 1126.55;
    (i) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1126.43(d);
    (j) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1126.76(a)(5) or (c); and
    (k) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price

[[Page 719]]

change shall be applied to the plant that used the concentrated milk in 
the event that the concentrated fluid milk products were made from bulk 
unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the plant during the 
prior month.

Sec. 1126.61  Computation of uniform price (including weighted average price).

    For each month the market administrator shall compute the ``uniform 
price'' (and ``weighted average price'') per hundredweight for milk of 
3.5 percent butterfat content at pool plants at which no location 
adjustment applies as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.60 for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed in 
Sec. 1126.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.71 for the preceding month;
    (b) Add not less than one-fourth of the unobligated balance in the 
producer-settlement fund;
    (c) Add the aggregate of all minus location adjustments and subtract 
the aggregate of all plus location adjustments pursuant to Sec. 1126.75;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1126.60(f); and
    (e) Subtract not more than 5 cents per hundredweight. The result 
shall be the ``weighted average price.''
    (f) The weighted average price shall be the ``uniform price'' for 
milk received from producers.

deposit the payments made by handlers pursuant to Secs. 1126.71, 
1126.76, and 1126.77 and from which he shall make all payments pursuant 
to Secs. 1126.73 (a) through (f) and 1126.77, except that payments to a 
cooperative association pursuant to Sec. 1126.73(c) shall be offset by 
any payments due from such cooperative association pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.1 that have not been received by the market administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1126.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, each handler 
shall pay to the market administrator on or before the 26th day of each 
month an amount determined by multiplying the handlers receipts during 
the first 18 days of such month of producer milk (excluding, in the case 
of a handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c), producer milk delivered to a 
pool plant) and milk from a handler described in Sec. 1126.9(c) by the 
Class III price for the preceding month, less:
    (1) Payments made by the handler on or before such date to producers 
for milk received during the 18-day period; and
    (2) Proper deductions authorized in writing by producers from whom 
the handler received milk, except that the amount deducted for each 
producer shall not exceed the value (at the Class III price) of the milk 
received from the producer during the 18-day period.
    (b) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, each handler 
shall pay to the market administrator on or before the 16th day after 
the end of each month an amount equal to such handler's value of milk 
for such month determined pursuant to Sec. 1126.60(a), as adjusted by 
the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1126.74, and pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.60(b) through (g), less:

[[Page 720]]

    (1) Payments made by the handler pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section for such month;
    (2) Payments, other than those specified in Sec. 1126.73(d), that 
were made by the handler on or before such date to producers for milk 
received during such month;
    (3) Proper deductions for the month that were authorized in writing 
by producers from whom the handler received milk, except that the amount 
deducted for each producer shall not exceed the value of the milk 
received from the producer during the month; and
    (4) The value at the weighted average price applicable at the 
location of the plant from which received of other source milk for which 
a value was computed pursuant to Sec. 1126.60(f).
    (c) The following conditions shall apply with respect to the 
payments prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
    (1) Payments to the market administrator shall be deemed not to have 
been made until such payments have been received by the market 
administrator; and
    (2) If the date by which payments must be received by the market 
administrator falls on a Saturday or Sunday or on any Monday that is a 
national holiday, payments shall not be due until the next day on which 
the market administrator's office is open for public business.
    (d) Payments due the market administrator from a cooperative 
association handler may be offset by payments determined by the market 
administrator to be due the cooperative association pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.73(c).
    (e) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month, each 
person who operated an other order plant that was regulated during such 
month under an order providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay 
to the market administrator an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.

    (a) Subject to paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, the 
market administrator shall pay each producer on or before the 28th day 
of each month for milk for which payment pursuant to Sec. 1126.71(a) has 
been received by the market administrator. Such payment shall be at a 
rate per hundredweight equal to the Class III price for the preceding 
month less the amounts specified in Sec. 1126.71(a)(1) and (2).
    (b) Subject to paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, the 
market administrator shall pay each producer on or before the 18th day 
after the end of each month for milk for which payment pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.71(b) has been received by the market administrator or offset 
pursuant to Sec. 1126.71(d). Such payment shall be at the uniform price 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1126.61 for the month, subject to the 
following adjustments:
    (1) Any applicable adjustments pursuant to Secs. 1126.74 and 
1126.75;

(a) of this section;
    (3) Less deductions for marketing services pursuant to Sec. 1126.86;
    (4) Less the authorized deductions specified in Sec. 1126.71(b)(3); 
and
    (5) Any adjustments for errors in calculating payments to an 
individual producer for past months.
    (c) In making payments to producers pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, the market administrator,

[[Page 721]]

on or before the day prior to the dates specified in such paragraphs, 
shall pay to each cooperative association that so requests with respect 
to those producers for whom it markets milk and who are certified to the 
market administrator by the cooperative association as having authorized 
the cooperative association to receive such payment an amount equal to 
the sum of the individual payments otherwise due such producers pursuant 
to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) In making payments to producers pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, the market administrator, on or before the day 
prior to the dates specified in such paragraphs, shall pay to each 
handler who so requests for milk received by the handler from producers 
for whom a cooperative association is not collecting payments pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section an amount equal to the sum of the 
individual payments otherwise due such producers pursuant to paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section. The handler then shall pay the individual 
producers the amounts due them by the respective dates specified in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Any handler who the market 
administrator determines is or was delinquent with respect to any 
payment obligation under this order shall not be eligible to participate 
in this payment arrangement until the handler has met all prescribed 
payment obligations for three consecutive months. In making payments to 
producers pursuant to this paragraph, the handler shall furnish each 
producer the following information:
    (1) The identity of the handler and the producer and the month to 
which the payment applies;
    (2) The total pounds and, with respect to final payments, the 
average butterfat content of the milk for which payment is being made;
    (3) The minimum rate of payment required by the order and the rate 
of payment used if such rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;
    (4) The amount and nature of any deductions from the amount 
otherwise due the producer; and
    (5) The net amount of payment to the producer.
    (e) The following conditions shall apply with respect to the 
payments prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section:
    (1) If the date by which such payments are to be made falls on a 
Saturday or Sunday or on any Monday that is a national holiday, such 
payments need not be made until the next day on which the market 
administrator's office is open for public business; and
    (2) If the application of Sec. 1126.71(c)(2) or paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section results in a delay in the partial or final payments by 
handlers to the market administrator or by the market administrator to 
handlers, the corresponding partial or final payments prescribed in 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section may be delayed by the same 
number of days.
    (f) If the market administrator does not receive the full payment 
required of a handler pursuant to Sec. 1126.71, he shall reduce 
uniformly per hundredweight the payments due producers for their milk 
received by such handler by a total amount not in excess of the amount 
due from such handler. The market administrator shall complete such 
payments on or before the next date for making payments pursuant to this 
section following the date on which the remaining payment is received 
from such handler.
    (g) Subject to Sec. 1126.71(c)(1) and (2), each handler who receives 
bulk fluid milk products from a pool plant operated by a cooperative 
association shall pay the following amounts for such milk to the market 
administrator, who in turn shall transmit such money to the cooperative 
association:
    (1) On or before the 26th day of each month, an amount determined by 
multiplying such receipts during the first 18 days of the month by the 
Class III price for the preceding month. If the handler so elects, such 
price may be adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1126.74 for the preceding month; and
    (2) On or before the 16th day after the end of each month, an amount 
determined by multiplying the quantity of such receipts during the month 
that was classified in each class pursuant to Sec. 1126.42(a) by the 
applicable class price,

[[Page 722]]

as adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1126.74, 
less any payment made by the handler pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section for such month. For the purpose of such computation, the 
applicable Class I price shall be the higher of the Class I prices 
applicable at the transferee-plant and the transferor-plant.

Sec. 1126.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1126.30(b) and 1126.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the weighted average price, both prices to be 
applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant 
(except that the Class I price and the weighted average price shall not 
be less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference

[[Page 723]]

between the Class I price applicable at the location of the partially 
regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less than the 
Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted milk 
that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by $1.00. 
Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1126.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1126.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1126.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1126.71(b)(4), a value of milk determined pursuant to 
Sec. 1126.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distibuting plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1126.7(b) and 
the corresponding provisions of Sec. 1126.7(d), subject to the following 
conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1126.30(b) and 
1126.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1126.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and

[[Page 724]]

    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1126.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1126.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1126.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

handler, the market administrator shall promptly notify such handler of 
any such amount due, and payment thereof shall be made on or before the

error occurred. Any monies found to be due a handler from the market 
administrator shall be paid promptly to such handler, except that the 
market administrator shall offset any monies due a handler against 
monies due from such handler.

1126.73(g), 1126.76, 1126.77, or 1126.85 shall be increased three-
fourths of 1 percent per month beginning on the first day after the due 
date, and on each date of subsequent months following the day on which 
such type of obligation is normally due, subject to the following 
conditions:
    (a) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
interest charges previously computed pursuant to this section; and
    (b) For the purpose of this section, any obligation that was 
determined at a date later than that prescribed by the order because of 
a handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator when 
due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have 
been due if the report had been filed when due.

the market administrator to verify or establish weights, samples, and 
tests of producer milk and to provide producers with market information. 
The services shall be performed by the market administrator or an agent 
engaged by and responsible to him.
    (b) In the case of producers for whom a cooperative association is 
actually performing the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this

specified in paragraph (a) of this section, such deductions from the 
payments to be made to such producers as may be authorized by the 
membership agreement or marketing contract between such cooperative 
association and such producers and on or before the 18th day after the 
end of each month shall pay such deductions to the cooperative 
association rendering such services, accompanied by a statement showing

that, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph shall be 2 
percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this paragraph 
shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

<R05>
Sec. 1131.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in 
the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a 
pool plant to another pool plant or by a handler described in 
Sec. 1131.9(c) to another handler's pool plant shall be classified as 
Class I milk unless both handlers request the same classification in 
another class. In either case, the classification of such transfers 
shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1131.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1131.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1131.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1131.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk;
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1131.44(a)(11) or (12) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1131.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if 
the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant; and
    (4) Unless a different utilization is claimed by both handlers, skim 
milk and butterfat transferred to the pool plant of another handler by a 
cooperative association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1131.9(c) or as the operator of a pool plant described in 
Sec. 1131.7(c) shall be classified pro rata to the respective quantities 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class for such month at the 
pool plant(s) of the receiving handler after the computations pursuant 
to Sec. 1131.44(a)(13)(i) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1131.44(b).
    (b) Transfers or diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to another order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3), of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and

[[Page 735]]

    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to another order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under such 
other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 1131.40.
    (c) Transfers and diversions to producer-handlers. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted from a pool plant or diverted from a 
handler described in Sec. 1131.9(b) to a producer-handler under this or 
any other order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
fluid milk product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the producer-handler's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not another order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1131.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:

[[Page 736]]

    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in this paragraph.

Sec. 1131.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1131.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1131.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1131.9(b) or (c) the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with Secs. 1131.40, 
1131.41, and 1131.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1131.9(b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1131.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1131.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;

percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1131.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of

to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1131.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1131.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:

in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted,

other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk

products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1131.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk poducts from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of 
skim milk

[[Page 739]]

remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an 
amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a) (7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1131.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraphs (a)(12) (i) and (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraphs (a)(12) (i) and (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk

[[Page 740]]

in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract in the following order from the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid 
milk products and bulk fluid cream products from:

Sec. 1131.7(c) according to the classification of such products pursuant 
to Sec. 1131.42(a)(4); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess 
from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning 
with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the

estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1131.43(d) and Sec. 1131.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1131.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the

    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA

average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual

yield factor for nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in 
hundredweights) of milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry 
milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.

    (a) For milk received from producers at a pool plant located outside 
Pima County and more than 30 miles by shortest highway distance as 
measured by the market administrator, from the nearer of the Courthouses 
in Maricopa and Graham Counties, Ariz., and classified as Class I milk 
or assigned Class I location adjustment credit pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section, the price computed pursuant to Sec. 1131.50(a) shall be 
reduced by 10 cents if such plant is located not more than 130 miles 
from the nearer courthouse and by an additional cent for each 10 miles 
or fraction thereof that such distance exceeds 130 miles.
    (b) For purposes of calculating such adjustment, transfers between 
pool plants shall be assigned to Class I disposition at the transferee-
plant, in excess of the sum of receipts at such plant from producers and 
handlers described in Sec. 1131.9(c), plus the pounds assigned as Class

Such assignment is to be made first to transferor-plants at which no 
location adjustment credit is applicable and then in sequence beginning 
with the plant at which the least location adjustment would apply.
    (c) For other source milk to which a location adjustment is 
applicable and for milk received from producers at a plant located in 
Pima County, Ariz., and which is classified as Class I milk, the price 
computed under Sec. 1131.50(a) shall be increased 12 cents.

Sec. 1131.61  Computation of uniform price.

    For each month the market administrator shall compute the uniform 
price per hundredweight of milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content 
received from producers as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1131.60 for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed by 
Sec. 1131.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to 
Secs. 1131.71 and 1131.73 for the preceding month;
    (b) Add an amount equal to the total value of the minus location 
adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location 
adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1131.75;
    (c) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance in the producer-settlement fund;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1131.60(f).
    (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight. The result shall be the ``uniform price'' for milk 
received from producers.

<R05>
Sec. 1131.70  Producer-settlement fund.

    The market administrator shall establish and maintain a separate 
fund known as the ``producer-settlement fund'' into which he shall 
deposit all payments made by handlers pursuant to Secs. 1131.71 and 
1131.76 and out of which he shall make all payments pursuant to 
Sec. 1131.72: Provided, That payments due to any handler shall be offset 
by any payments due from such handler.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 13th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay to the market administrator the amount, if any, by 
which the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds 
the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1131.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) The value at the uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1131.75, of such handler's receipts of producer milk; and
    (ii) The value at the uniform price applicable at the location of 
the plant from which received of other source milk for which a value is 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1131.60(f).
    (b) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month each person 
who operated an other order plant that was regulated during such month 
under an order providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay to the 
market administrator an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.

<R05>
Sec. 1131.73  Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
handler shall make payment to each producer from whom milk is received 
during the month as follows:
    (1) On or before the 27th day of each month to each producer who did 
not discontinue shipping milk to such handler before the 25th day of the 
month, an amount not less than 1.3 times the Class III price for the 
preceding month multiplied by the hundredweight of milk received from 
such producer during the first 15 days of the month, less proper 
deductions authorized by such producer to be made from payments due 
pursuant to this paragraph; and
    (2) On or before the 15th day of the following month, an amount 
equal to not less than the appropriate uniform price as adjusted 
pursuant to Secs. 1131.74 and 1131.75, multiplied by the hundredweight 
of milk received from such producer during the month, subject to the 
following adjustments:
    (i) Less payments made to such producer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, (ii) less deductions made for marketing services 
pursuant to Sec. 1131.86, (iii) plus or minus adjustments for errors 
made in previous payments made to such producer, and (iv) less proper 
deductions authorized in writing by such producer: Provided, That if by 
such date such handler has not received full payment from the market 
administrator pursuant to Sec. 1131.72 for such month, he may reduce pro 
rata his payments to producers by not more than the amount of such 
underpayment. Payments to producers shall be completed thereafter not 
later than the date for making payments pursuant to this paragraph next 
following after the receipt of the balance due from the market 
administrator;
    (b) In the case of a cooperative association which the market 
administrator determines is authorized by its members to collect payment 
for their milk and which has so requested any handler in writing, such 
handler shall on or before the second day prior to the date on which 
payments are due individual producers, pay the cooperative association 
for milk received during the month from the producer-members of such 
association as determined by the market administrator an amount equal to 
not less than the total due such producer-members as determined pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section;
    (c) Each handler who receives milk during the month from producers 
for which payment is to be made to a cooperative association pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section shall report to such cooperative 
association or to the market administrator for transmittal to such 
cooperative association for each such producer as follows:
    (1) On or before the 25th day of the month, the total pounds of milk 
received during the first 15 days of such month; and
    (2) On or before the seventh day of the following month (i) the 
pounds of milk received each day and the total for the month, together 
with the butterfat content of such milk, (ii) the amount or rate and 
nature of any authorized deductions to be made from payments, and (iii)

its capacity as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1131.9(c) or as the operator 
of a pool plant shall, on or before the second day prior to the date 
payments are due individual producers, pay such cooperative association 
for such milk as follows:

[[Page 746]]

    (1) A partial payment for milk received from such cooperative 
association during the first 15 days of the month at not less than 1.3 
times the Class III price for the preceding month; and
    (2) In final settlement, the value of such milk as classified 
pursuant to Sec. 1131.44 at the class prices, as adjusted by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1131.74, that are applicable at 
the location of the receiving handler's pool plant, less payment made 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.74  Butterfat differential.

    For milk containing more or less than 3.5 percent butterfat, the 
uniform price shall be increased or decreased, respectively, for each 
one-tenth percent butterfat variation from 3.5 percent by a butterfat 
differential, rounded to the nearest one-tenth cent, which shall be 
0.138 times the current month's butter price less 0.0028 times the 
preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, for 
manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the ``base 
month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1131.51 (a) through (e), as 
reported by the Department. The butter price means the simple average 
for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade A butter price 
as reported by the Department.

<R05>
Sec. 1131.75  Plant location adjustments for producers and on nonpool milk.

    (a) The uniform price for producer milk received at a pool plant 
shall be adjusted according to the location of the pool plant, at the 
rates set forth in Sec. 1131.52; and
    (b) The uniform price applicable to other source milk shall be 
subject to the same adjustments applicable to the uniform price under 
paragraph (a) of this section, except that the adjusted uniform price 
shall not be less than the Class III price.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.76  Payments by handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1131.30(b) and 1131.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the uniform price, both prices to be applicable at the 
location of the partially regulated distributing plant (but not to be 
less than the Class III price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I

[[Page 747]]

price shall not be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such 
disposition, payments may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order regulating the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients at the difference between the Class I price applicable under 
the other order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk 
ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) 
and the Class III price. This payment option shall apply only if a 
majority of the total milk received at the plant that processed the 
nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders 
and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the 
order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk 
ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the 
nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1131.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1131.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1131.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1131.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1131.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1131.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1131.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1131.30(b) and 
1131.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1131.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent

[[Page 748]]

butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1131.74, 
for milk received at the plant during the month that would have been 
producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1131.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payment by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1131.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1131.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever audit by the market administrator of any reports, books, 
records, or accounts or other verification discloses errors resulting in 
monies due (a) the market administrator from a handler, (b) a handler 
from the market administrator, or (c) any producer or cooperative 
association from a handler, the market administrator shall promptly 
notify such handler of any amount so due and payment thereof shall be 
made on or before the next date for making payments set forth in the 
provisions under which such error occurred.

be increased one-half of 1 percent on the second day following the due 
date of such obligation and on the 15th day of each month thereafter 
until such obligation is paid.

<R05>
Sec. 1131.85  Assessment for order administration.

    (a) As his pro rata share of the expense of administration of the 
order, each handler shall pay to the market administrator on or before 
the 15th day after the end of the month 4 cents per hundredweight, or 
such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe, with respect to:
    (1) Producer milk (including such handler's own production);
    (2) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I 
use pursuant to Sec. 1131.43(d) and other source milk allocated to Class 
I pursuant to Sec. 1131.44 (a)(7) and (a)(11) and the corresponding 
steps of Sec. 1131.44(b), except such other source milk that is excluded 
from the computations pursuant to Sec. 1131.60 (d) and (f); and
    (3) Class I milk disposed of from a partially regulated distributing 
plant as route disposition in the marketing area that exceeds the skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted pursuant to Sec. 1131.76(a)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 1131.86  Deduction for marketing services.

    (a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
handler, in making payments to producers for milk (other than milk of 
his own production) pursuant to Sec. 1131.73, shall deduct 5 cents per 
hundredweight, or such amount not exceeding 5 cents per hundredweight as 
may be prescribed by the Secretary, and shall pay such deductions to the 
market administrator on or before the 15th day after the end of the 
month. Such money shall be used by the market administrator to provide 
market information and to check the accuracy of the testing and weighing 
of their milk for producers who are not receiving such service from a 
cooperative association; and
    (b) In the case of producers who are members of a cooperative 
association which the Secretary has determined is actually performing 
the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, each handler 
shall (in lieu of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section), make such deductions from the payments to be made to such 
producers as may be authorized by the membership agreement or marketing 
contract between such cooperative association and such producers, and on 
or before the 13th day after the end of each month, pay such deductions

Sec. 1134.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of 
this section, skim milk or butterfat transferred in the form of a fluid 
milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to another 
pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk unless both handlers 
request the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1134.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1134.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1134.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1134.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1134.44(a) (11) or (12) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1134.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if 
the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant 
shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall 
apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set

[[Page 758]]

forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1134.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1134.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts

[[Page 759]]

of packaged fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from pool plants 
and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in this paragraph.
    (e) Transfers by a cooperative association to pool plants. Skim milk 
and butterfat transferred in the form of bulk milk by a handler 
described in Sec. 1134.9(c) and from a pool plant operated by a 
cooperative association to another handler's pool plant shall be 
classified pursuant to Sec. 1134.44 pro rata with producer milk received 
at the transferee-plant and the value thereof at the class prices shall 
be included in his value of milk pursuant to Sec. 1134.60.

Sec. 1134.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1134.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1134.40, 1134.41, and 1134.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1134.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1134.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool

[[Page 760]]

plant operated by such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1134.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1134.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

<R05>
Sec. 1134.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1134.9(a) for each of his pool plants 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1134.42(e) by allocating the handler's receipts of 
skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1134.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1134.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1134.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1134.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1134.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the

[[Page 761]]

beginning of the month of products specified in Sec. 1134.40(b)(1) that 
was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of 
this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk subject to the provisions of Sec. 1134.42(e), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from another order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1134.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of

[[Page 762]]

skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) and (ii) of this section and that were not 
offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1134.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in

[[Page 763]]

a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III 
combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be 
increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the 
extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest other 
pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more distant 
pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to 
be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased 
by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
each class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants 
shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1134.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1134.42(e), subtract such excess from the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with Class III. 
Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk subject to the provisions 
of Sec. 1134.42(e) in each class shall be the combined pounds of skim 
milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the computations 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the corresponding step 
of paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 1134.45  Market administrator's reports and announcements concerning classification.

    The market administrator shall make the following reports and 
announcements concerning classification:
    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1134.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1134.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1134.43(d) and Sec. 1134.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order 
plant, the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report of the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation

[[Page 764]]

arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests the amount and class 
utilization of producer milk delivered by members of such association to 
each handler receiving such milk. For the purpose of this report, the 
milk so received shall be prorated to each class in accordance with the 
total utilization of producer milk by such handler.

    The basic formula price shall be the preceding month's average pay 
price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using the 
``base month'' series, as reported by the Department, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis using the butterfat differential for the 
preceding month computed pursuant to Sec. 1134.74 and rounded to the 
nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Grade AA butter price by 4.27;
    (ii) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by 8.07; and
    (iii) Multiply the dry buttermilk price by 0.42.
    (2) The gross value of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese shall 
be the sum of the following computations:
    (i) Multiply the Cheddar cheese price by 9.87; and
    (ii) Multiply the Grade A butter price by 0.238.
    (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (1) Grade AA butter price. Grade AA butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade AA 
butter price, as reported by the Department.
    (2) Nonfat dry milk price. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Nonfat Dry Milk Low/Medium Heat 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (3) Dry buttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple 
average for the month of the Western Dry Buttermilk price, as reported 
by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.

[[Page 765]]

    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk; and
    (2) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
Cheddar cheese, 9.87, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of 
milk used in the production of American cheese.
    (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per 
hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

Sec. 1134.52  Plant location adjustments for handlers.

    (a) For milk received from producers and from handlers described in 
Sec. 1134.9(c) at a pool plant, located more than 100 miles by shortest 
highway distance as measured by the market administrator, from the 
courthouse in Grand Junction, Colorado, and which is classified as Class 
I milk or assigned Class I location adjustment credit under paragraph 
(b) of this section, the price computed pursuant to Sec. 1134.50(a) 
shall be reduced by 15 cents if such plant is located more than 100 
miles but not more than 110 miles from such courthouse, and by an 
additional 1.5 cents for each 10 miles or fraction thereof that such 
distance exceeds 110 miles.
    (b) For purposes of calculating such adjustment, transfers between 
pool plants shall be assigned to Class I disposition at the transferee 
plant, in excess of the sum of receipts at such plant from producers and 
handlers described in Sec. 1134.9(c), and the pounds assigned as Class I 
to receipts from other order plants and unregulated supply plants. Such 
assignment is to be made first to transferor plants at which no location 
adjustment credit is applicable and then in sequence beginning with the 
plant at which the least location adjustment would apply.
    (c) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be 
adjusted at the rates set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, except 
that the adjusted Class I price shall not be less than the Class III 
price.


<R05>
Sec. 1134.53  Announcement of class prices.

    The market administrator shall announce publicly on or before the

<R05>
Sec. 1134.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of each handler 
described in Sec. 1134.9 (b) and (c) with respect to milk that was not 
received at a pool plant as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk and milk subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1134.42(e) that were classified in each class 
pursuant to Secs. 1134.43(a) and 1134.44(c) by the applicable class 
prices, and add the resulting amounts;

[[Page 766]]

    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1134.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1134.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1134.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1134.44(b);
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1134.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.44(a)(7)(i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1134.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1134.44(a)(7) (v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1134.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1134.43(d) and Sec. 1134.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1134.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1134.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1134.76 (a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

received from producers as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.60 for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed in 
Sec. 1134.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to

[[Page 767]]

Sec. Sec. 1134.71 and 1134.73 for the preceding month;
    (b) Add an amount equal to the sum of the deductions to be made for 
location adjustments pursuant to Sec. 1134.75;
    (c) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance in the producer-settlement fund;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1134.60(f); and
    (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight. The result shall be the ``uniform price'' for milk 
received from producers.

<R05>
Sec. 1134.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 13th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay to the market administrator the amount, if any, by 
which the total amount specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
exceeds the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1134.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) The value at the uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.75, of such handler's receipts of producer milk and milk 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 1134.42(e). In the case of a 
cooperative association which is a handler, less the amount due from 
other handlers pursuant to Sec. 1134.73(a), exclusive of differential 
butterfat values; and
    (ii) The value at the uniform price applicable at the location of 
the plant from which received (not to be less than the Class III price) 
of other source milk for which a value is computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.60(f).
    (b) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month each person 
who operated an order plant that was regulated during such month under 
an order providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay to the 
market administrator an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable to the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.
    (c) Each vendor shall pay the market administrator on or before the 
25th day after the end of the month at the difference between the value 
of the skim milk and butterfat in fluid milk products received from a 
producer-handler during the month at the Class I price applicable at the 
location of the producer-handler's plant (but not less than the Class 
III price) and its value at the

[[Page 768]]

Class III price subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The quantities of skim and butterfat milk products on which 
payment shall be made pursuant to this section shall not exceed the 
vendor's Class I disposition in the marketing during the month; and
    (2) This section shall not apply to a vendor whose total Class I 
disposition is obtained from a producer-handler, or whose total receipts 
and disposition of fluid milk products are considered as a part of the 
receipts and disposition of the producer-handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.10(b)(3).

Sec. 1134.72  Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

    On or before the 14th day after the end of each month, the market 
administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the 
amount computed pursuant to Sec. 1134.71(a)(2) exceeds the amount 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1134.71(a)(1). If, at such time, the balance 
in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments 
pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce 
uniformly such payments and shall complete such payments as soon as 
funds are available.


<R05>
Sec. 1134.73  Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

    Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each handler 
shall make payment to each producer from whom milk is received as 
follows:
    (a) Not later than the last day of the month, to each producer from 
whom he received milk during the first 18 days of the month, a partial 
payment for the milk received during the first 15 days of the month, at 
the Class III price for the preceding month.
    (b) Not later than the 16th day of the month, for milk received 
during the preceding month, an amount computed at not less than the 
uniform price, per hundredweight, pursuant to Sec. 1134.61, as adjusted 
by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1134.74, location 
adjustment specified in Sec. 1134.75 and adjustments for errors made in 
previous payments minus:
    (1) Payments made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) Deductions for marketing services pursuant to Sec. 1134.86; and
    (3) Deductions approved by the market administrator and authorized 
in writing by the producer. If the handler has not received full payment 
for the delivery period from the market administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.72, he may reduce his total payments to all producers 
uniformly by the amount owing to him by the market administrator. The 
handler shall, however, complete all payments not later than the 16th 
day of the month following receipt of the balance from the market 
administrator.
    (c)(1) Upon receipt of a written request from a cooperative 
association which the market administrator determines is authorized by 
its members to collect payment for their milk, and receipt of a written 
promise to reimburse the handler the amount of any actual loss incurred 
by him because of any improper claim by the cooperative association, 
each handler shall pay to the cooperative association on or before the 
second day preceding the dates set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section an amount equal to the sum of the individual payments otherwise 
payable to the producer members of such organization. This payment shall 
be made for all milk of such producer certified by the cooperative 
association as a member, beginning the first day of the month following 
receipt of the certification and ending the last day of the month next 
preceding the date on which a written notice from the cooperative 
association terminating the membership was received.
    (2) A copy of the request for payment, promise to reimburse, and 
certified list of members, shall be filed simultaneously with the market 
administrator. He may verify the information by auditing the records of 
the cooperative association. Exceptions to the accuracy of the 
membership certification, by a producer or by a handler, shall be made 
in writing to the market administrator for his determination.
    (d) In making the payments to producers under paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section, each handler shall furnish each producer or cooperative 
association from whom he has received milk,

[[Page 769]]

a supporting statement which shall show for each month;
    (1) The month and the identity of the handler and of the producer;
    (2) The total pounds and the average butterfat content of milk 
received from such producer;
    (3) The minimum rate or rates at which payment to such producer is 
required under this part;
    (4) The rate which is used in making the payment if such rate is 
other than the applicable minimum rate;
    (5) The amount or the rate per hundredweight and nature of each 
deduction claimed by the handler; and
    (6) The net amount of payment to such producer.
    (e) For milk received from a pool plant operated by a cooperative 
association or from a handler described in Sec. 1134.9(c), each handler 
shall on or before the second day prior to the date payments are due 
individual producers, pay such cooperative association for milk as 
follows:
    (1) A partial payment for milk received during the first 15 days of 
the month at not less than the Class III price for the preceding month; 
and
    (2) A final settlement equal to the value of such milk at the 
uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to Secs. 1134.74 and 1134.75, less 
payment made pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

Sec. 1134.74  Butterfat differential.

    For milk containing more or less than 3.5 percent butterfat, the 
uniform price shall be increased or decreased, respectively, for each 
one-tenth percent butterfat variation from 3.5 percent by a butterfat 
differential, rounded to the nearest one-tenth cent, which shall be 
0.138 times the current month's butter price less 0.0028 times the 
preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, for 
manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the ``base 
month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1134.51 (a) through (e), as 
reported by the Department. The butter price means the simple average

    (a) The uniform price to be paid for milk received at a pool plant 
from producers, in bulk from a pool plant operated by a cooperative 
association, and from a handler described in Sec. 1134.9(c) may be 
reduced by the amount of the location adjustment applicable at the 
location of the pool plant at which such milk was first physically 
received from producers, and the uniform price for producer milk 
diverted to a nonpool plant shall be reduced according to the location 
of the pool plant from which diverted, each at the rates set forth in 
Sec. 1134.52; and
    (b) For purposes of computations pursuant to Secs. 1134.71 and

Sec. 1134.76  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1134.30(b) and 1134.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid

[[Page 770]]

milk products disposed of to such nonpool plant by handlers fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class 
I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation 
under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the uniform price, both prices to be applicable at the 
location of the partially regulated distributing plant (except that the 
Class I price and the uniform price shall not be less than the Class III 
price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1134.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1134.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1134.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1134.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1134.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1134.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply

[[Page 771]]

plant for such partially regulated distributing plant by making 
shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant during the month 
equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1134.7(b) subject to the 
following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with its reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1134.30(b) and 
1134.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1134.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1134.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1134.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1134.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1134.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever audit by the market administrator of any handler's reports, 
books, records, or accounts, or other verification discloses errors 
resulting in moneys due a producer or the market administrator from such 
handler or due such handler from the market administrator, the market 
administrator shall promptly notify such handler of any amount so due 
and payment thereof shall be made on or before the next date for making 
payments as set forth in the provisions under which such error occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 1134.78  Charges on overdue accounts.

    The unpaid obligation of a handler pursuant to Secs. 1134.71,

each month or portion thereof beginning with the third day following the 
date by which such obligation was payable: Provided, That:
    (a) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
interest charges previously made pursuant to this section; and
    (b) For the purpose of this section, any obligation that was 
determined at

[[Page 772]]

a date later than that prescribed by the order because of a handler's 
failure to submit a report to the market administrator when due shall be 
considered to have been payable by the date it would have been due if 
the report had been filed when due.

Sec. 1134.42(e) but excluding such milk in the case of a cooperative 
association which is a handler of milk subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1134.42(e)) and such handler's own production;
    (b) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I

the Secretary has determined is actually performing the services set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall make, in lieu 
of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this section, such 
deductions from the payments to be made to producers as may be 
authorized by the membership agreement or marketing contract between the 
cooperative association and its members, and on or before the 14th day

single operating unit or establishment at which milk or milk products 
(including filled milk) are received, processed, or packaged. Separate 
facilities used only as a distribution point for storing

[[Page 774]]

packaged fluid milk products in transit or used only for reloading milk 
from one tank truck to another for transshipment shall not be a 
``plant'' under this definition.


<R05>
Sec. 1135.5  Distributing plant.

    Distributing plant means a plant that is approved by a duly

    Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) A distributing plant from which there is:
    (1) Route disposition (except filled milk) in the marketing area 
during the month equal to not less than 10 percent of the Grade A fluid 
milk products received at such plant (including milk diverted from such 
plant by the plant operator pursuant to Sec. 1135.13); and
    (2) Total route disposition (except filled milk) during the month 
equal to not less than 25 percent of such receipts. A unit consisting of 
two or more distributing plants operated by a handler shall be 
considered as one distributing plant for the purpose of meeting this 
requirement if the handler notifies the market administrator in writing 
before the first day of the month that the plants should be considered 
as a unit. The unit shall continue from month to month thereafter 
without further notification. If, however, there is any change in the 
composition of the unit, the handler shall notify the market 
administrator in writing on or before the first day of the month such 
change is to be made.
    (b) A supply plant from which during the month the volume of fluid 
milk products, except filled milk, transferred to pool distributing 
plants is 25 percent or more of the Grade A milk received at the plant 
from dairy farmers (including producer milk diverted from the plant by 
the plant operator but excluding producer milk diverted to the plant 
pursuant to Sec. 1135.13), subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Any supply plant that has qualified as a pool plant in each of 
the immediately preceding months of September through February shall be 
a pool plant in each of the following months of March through August 
unless written request for nonpool status for any such month is filed by 
the plant operator with the market administrator prior to the first day 
of any such month. In such case, nonpool status will be effective until 
the plant again qualifies as a pool plant by meeting the transfer 
requirements; and
    (2) The volume of fluid milk products included as qualifying 
shipments to a distributing plant pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
reduced by the volume of any fluid milk products transferred or diverted 
by such pool distributing plant operator to the supply plant or to any 
other plant under the control of the supply plant operator.
    (c) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section that also meets the pool plant requirements of another Federal 
order and from which, the Secretary determines, a greater quantity of 
Class I milk, except filled milk, was disposed of as route disposition 
during the month in such other Federal marketing area than was disposed 
of as route disposition in this marketing area, and which is fully 
subject to the classification and pricing provisions of such other 
order;
    (3) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section that also meets the pool plant requirements of another Federal 
order on the basis of route disposition in such other marketing area, 
and from which, the Secretary determines, a greater quantity of Class I 
milk, except filled milk, is disposed of during the month as route 
disposition in this marketing area than is disposed of in such other 
marketing area but which plant is,

[[Page 775]]

nevertheless, fully regulated under such other Federal order;
    (4) A supply plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section that also meets the pool plant requirements of another Federal 
order and from which greater qualifying transfers are made during the 
month to plants regulated under such other order than are made to plants 
regulated under this order, unless during the months of March through 
August the transfers to the other order plant are classified as Class II 
or Class III milk and the operator of the supply plant elects to retain 
automatic pooling under this part;
    (5) A distributing plant from which less than an average of 300 
pounds of Class I milk per day, except filled milk, is disposed of in 
the marketing area during the month; or
    (6) Milk receiving and storage facilities that are on the same 
premises as a pool plant and are not approved by any regulatory agency 
for the receiving, processing or packaging of any fluid milk product for 
Grade A disposition.

    (6) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in 
paragraphs (f) (3), (4), and (5) of this section shall not be producer 
milk. The diverting handler may designate the dairy farmers whose 
diverted milk will not be producer milk. Otherwise, the total milk 
diverted by the handler on the last day of the month, then the second-

Sec. 1135.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions (including deliveries by a handler 
described in Sec. 1135.9(d)) to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant or from a 
handler described in Sec. 1135.9(d) to a pool plant shall be classified 
as Class I milk unless both handlers request the same classification in 
another class. In either case, the classification of such transfers or 
diversions shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk, and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or divertee-plant after 
the computation pursuant to Sec. 1135.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1135.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified 
in each class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or 
butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1135.44(a)(7) 
and the corresponding step of Sec. 1135.44(b), the skim milk or 
butterfat so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to 
allocate the least possible Class I utilization to such other source 
milk; and

[[Page 782]]

    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1135.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding steps of Sec. 1135.44(b), the skim 
milk or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source 
milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than 
would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant 
to an other order plant shall be classified in the following manner. 
Such classification shall apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that 
is in excess of any receipts at the pool plant from the other order 
plant of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products 
and bulk fluid cream products, respectively, that are in the same 
category as described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustments when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1135.40.
    (c) Transfers and diversions to producer-handlers and to exempt 
distributing plants. Skim milk or butterfat in the following forms that 
is transferred or diverted by a handler described in Sec. 1135.9 (a), 
(b), or (d) to a producer-handler under this or any other Federal order 
or to an exempt distributing plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if moved in the form of a fluid milk product; 
and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or an exempt distributing plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream 
product, unless the following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions

[[Page 783]]

in bulk form shall be classified on the basis of the assignment of the 
nonpool plant's utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs 
(d)(2) (ii) through (viii) of this section;
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1135.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in this paragraph.

Sec. 1135.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1135.44, the following rules shall apply:

[[Page 784]]

    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1135.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each handler pursuant to Sec. 1135.9 (b), (c), and (d) the pounds of 
skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with 
Secs. 1135.40, 1135.41, and 1135.42;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk of a handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1135.9 (b), (c), or (d) shall be determined separately from the 
operations of any pool plant operated by such handler.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1135.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1135.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.
    (e) Class III-A milk shall be allocated in combination with Class 
III milk and the quantity of producer milk eligible to be priced in 
Class III-A shall be determined by prorating receipts from pool sources 
to Class III-A use on the basis of the quantity of total receipts of 
bulk fluid milk products allocated to Class III milk at the plant.

Sec. 1135.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine the 
classification of producer milk of each handler described in 
Sec. 1135.9(a) for each of the handler's pool plants separately and of 
each handler described in Sec. 1135.9 (b), (c), and (d) by allocating 
the handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to its utilization as 
follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1135.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject

products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1135.40(b)(1) in inventory

step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were 
not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received.
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1) exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and

section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount;

Sec. 1135.51(a) for the second preceding month plus $1.50.
    (b) Class II price. The Class II price shall be the basic formula 
price for the second preceding month plus $0.30.
    (c) Class III price. The Class III price shall be the basic formula 
price for the month.
    (d) Class III-A price. The Class III-A price for the month shall be 
the average Western nonfat dry milk price for the month, as reported by 
the Department, less 12.5 cents, times an amount computed by subtracting 
from 9 an amount calculated by dividing .4 by such nonfat dry milk 
price, plus the butterfat differential times 35 and rounded to the 
nearest cent.
    (e) The skim milk price per hundredweight shall be the basic formula 
price for the month pursuant to Sec. 1135.51(a) less an amount computed 
by multiplying the butterfat differential computed pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section by 35.
    (f) The butterfat price per pound shall be the total of:
    (1) The skim price computed in paragraph (e) of this section divided 
by 100; and
    (2) The butterfat differential computed pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section multiplied by 10.
    (3) Compute a butterfat differential rounded to the nearest one-
tenth cent, by multiplying the current month's butter price by 0.138, 
and subtract from the result an amount determined by multiplying 0.0028 
by the preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, 
for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the 
``base month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1135.51 (a) through 
(e), as reported by the Department. The butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade A butter 
price as reported by the Department.
    (g) The milk protein price per pound shall be computed by 
subtracting the butterfat price, multiplied by 3.5, from the basic 
formula price and dividing the result by the percentage of protein in 
the milk on which the basic formula price is based, as announced by the 
Dairy Division. The resulting price shall be rounded to the nearest 
whole cent.

collect payments on their behalf an amount equal to the sum of the 
individual payments otherwise payable to such producers pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) In the event a handler has not received full payment from the 
market administrator pursuant to Sec. 1135.72 by the 19th day of the

Sec. 1135.74  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Secs. 1135.30(b) and 1135.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants, handlers pursuant to 
Sec. 1135.9 (b) and (d), and other order plants, except that subtracted 
under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the estimated uniform price; and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the

[[Page 794]]

nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the Class I price 
applicable under the other order at the location of the plant where the 
nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be less than the 
Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment option shall 
apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the plant that 
processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more 
Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement 
fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the 
nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the 
source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk 
products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1135.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant, a handler 
described in Sec. 1135.(b) and (d), and an other order plant shall be 
allocated at the partially regulated distributing plant to the same 
class in which such products were classified at the fully regulated 
plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1135.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price or estimated uniform price of the 
respective order regulating the handling of milk at the transferee-
plant, with such uniform price or estimated uniform price adjusted to 
the location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest 
Class price of the respective order), except that transfers of 
reconstituted skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest 
class price of the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1135.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1135.60(j) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1135.71(b)(2), a value of milk determined pursuant to 
Sec. 1135.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1135.7(b), 
subject to the following conditions:
    (A) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with his reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1135.30(b) and 
1135.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (B) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (C) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1135.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1135.50(f)(3), for milk 
received at the plant during the month that would have been producer

[[Page 795]]

milk if the plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1135.50(f)(3), for milk received at the plant during the month that 
would have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1135.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

each unpaid obligation and shall include any unpaid charges previously 
made pursuant to this section. For the purpose of this section, any

administrator when due shall be considered to have been payable by the 
date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due.

Sec. 1137.3  Route disposition.

    Route disposition means any delivery to retail or wholesale outlets 
(including a delivery by a vendor or a sale from a plant or plant store) 
of any fluid milk product classified as Class I milk, other than a 
delivery to a pool plant or a nonpool plant: Provided, That packaged 
fluid milk products, except filled milk, that are transferred to a 
distributing plant from a plant with route disposition in the marketing 
area, and which are classified as Class I under Sec. 1137.40(a), shall 
be considered as a route disposition from the transferor plant, rather 
than from the transferee plant, for the single purpose of qualifying it 
as a pool distributing plant under Sec. 1137.7(a)(1).

<R05>
Sec. 1137.7  Pool plant.

    Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, pool plant 
means:
    (a) Any plant, hereinafter referred to as a ``distributing pool 
plant'', in which during the month fluid milk products are processed or 
packaged and from which:
    (1) An amount equal to 50 percent or more of the total receipts of 
Grade A milk (except receipts from distributing pool plants) is disposed 
of as route disposition, except filled milk. A unit consisting of two or 
more distributing plants operated by a handler shall be considered as 
one distrubuting plant for the purpose of meeting the requirements of 
this subparagraph if each plant separately meets the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the handler notifies the market 
administrator in writing before the first day of the month that the 
plants should be considered as a unit. The unit shall continue from 
month to month thereafter without further notification. If, however, 
there is any change in the composition of the unit, the handler shall 
notify the market administrator in writing on or before the first day of 
the month such change is to be made; and
    (2) Ten percent or more of such receipts, or 12,000 pounds per day, 
whichever is less, are disposed of as route disposition, except filled 
milk, in the marketing area.
    (b) Any plant, hereinafter referred to as a ``supply pool plant'' 
from which during the month 50 percent of its

[[Page 798]]

dairy farm supply of Grade A milk is moved to distributing pool plant(s) 
as fluid milk products, except filled milk. Any supply plant which has 
qualified as a pool plant in each of the months of September through 
February shall be a pool plant in each of the following months of March 
through August unless written request for nonpool status for any such 
month(s) is furnished in advance to the market administrator. A plant 
withdrawn from supply pool plant status may not be reinstated for any 
subsequent month of March through August unless it fulfills the shipping 
requirements of this paragraph for such month.
    (c) The term ``pool plant'' shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant;
    (2) A plant meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal 
order and from which, the Secretary determines, there is a greater 
quantity of route disposition, except filled milk, during the month in

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of 
this section, skim milk or butterfat transferred in the form of a fluid 
milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to another

classification of such transfers shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computations 
pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1137.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1137.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a) (11) or (12) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1137.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if 
the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant.

    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to another order plant

apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any 
receipts at the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustment when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1137.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to his receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant or a producer-
handler plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) 
of this section are met, tranfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1137.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;

    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata

Sec. 1137.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1137.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1137.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1137.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant,

[[Page 807]]

the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class in 
accordance with Secs. 1137.40, 1137.41, and 1137.42. The combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each class for a handler 
described in Sec. 1137.9 (b) or (c) shall be such handler's 
classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat solids contained in such product 
plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1137.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1137.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1137.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

<R05>
Sec. 1137.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1137.9(a) for each of his pool plants 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1137.42(e) by allocating the handler's receipts of 
skim milk and butterfat to his utilization as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1137.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1137.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1137.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the

[[Page 808]]

pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1137.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1137.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1137.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
Grade A certification is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated top Class I at the transferor-
plant;
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III:
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (a) through (c) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk subject to the provisions of Sec. 1137.42(e), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and

[[Page 809]]

    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from another order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1137.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were 
not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received. For purposes of this subtraction at a pool 
plant operated by a cooperative association, skim milk in fluid milk 
products transferred to the pool plant of another handler shall be added 
to the remaining pounds of skim milk in each class pro rata to the 
market average utilization announced pursuant to Sec. 1137.45(a):
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary 
Class III and then Class II to the extent of available utilization in 
such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at 
each successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim 
milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then

[[Page 810]]

from Class II, with respect to whichever of the following quantities 
represents the lower proportion of Class I milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1137.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler). For purposes of such computation at 
a pool plant of a cooperative association, the pounds remaining shall 
include any remainder of the quantity added pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(11) of this section;
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class II and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class 
III combined shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II to the extent of available utilization in such classes at 
the nearest other pool plant of the handler, and then at each 
successively more distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class I shall be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at the 
handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction 
by a like amount; and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) of 
this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
Class I that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal 
to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in 
Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a like amount 
(decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In such case the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step at 
the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse 
direction by a like amount beginning with the nearest plant at which 
Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1137.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1137.42(e), subtract such excess from the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with Class III. 
Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk subject to the provisions 
of Sec. 1137.42(e) in each class shall be the combined pounds of skim 
milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the computations 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the corresponding step 
of paragraph (b) of this section.

    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1137.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1137.43(d) and Sec. 1137.44 on 
the basis of such report, (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order 
plant, the class to which such shipments were allocated by the market 
administrator of the other order on the basis of the report of the 
receiving handler, and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation 
arising from the verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, report to 
each cooperative association which so requests the amount and class 
utilization of producer milk delivered by members of such association to 
each handler receiving such milk. For the purpose of this report, the 
milk so received shall be prorated to each class in acccordance with the 
total utilization of producer milk by such handler.

nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price data determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:
    (1) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry 
milk shall be the sum of the following computations:

Sec. 1137.52  Plant location adjustments for handlers.

    (a) For milk received from producers and from handlers described in 
Sec. 1137.9(c) at a pool plant, or diverted to a nonpool plant, located 
more than 50 miles by shortest highway distance as measured by the 
market administrator, from the plant to the nearest County Courthouse 
located in Denver, Colo.; Pueblo, Colo.; or Colorado Springs, Colo., and 
classified as Class I milk or assigned Class I location adjustment 
credit pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the price computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1137.50(a) shall be reduced by 10 cents if such plant 
is located more than 50 miles but not more than 75 miles from such 
courthouse, and by an additional 1.5 cents for each 10 miles or fraction 
thereof that such distance exceeds 75 miles.
    (b) For purposes of calculating such adjustment, transfers between 
pool plants shall be assigned to Class I disposition at the transferee 
plant, in excess of the sum of receipts at such plant from producers and 
handlers described in Sec. 1137.9(c), and the pounds assigned as Class I 
to receipts from other order plants and unregulated supply plants. Such 
assignment is to be made first to transferor plants at which no location 
adjustment credit is applicable and then in sequence beginning with the 
plant at which the least location adjustment would apply.
    (c) The Class I price applicable to other source milk shall be 
adjusted at the rates set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, except 
that the adjusted Class I price shall not be less than the Class III 
price.

<R05>
Sec. 1137.60  Handler's value of milk for computing uniform price.

    For the purpose of computing the uniform price, the market 
administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each 
handler with respect to each of his pool plants and of each handler 
described in Sec. 1137.9(b) and (c) with respect to milk that was not 
received at a pool plant as follows:
    (a) Multiply the pounds of producer milk and milk subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1137.42(e) that were classified in each class 
pursuant to Secs. 1137.43(a) and 1137.44(c) by the applicable class 
prices and add the resulting amounts;
    (b) Add the amounts obtained from multiplying the pounds of overage 
subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1137.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1137.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the following:
    (1) The amount obtained from multiplying the difference between the 
Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price applicable 
at the location of the pool plant for the current month by the 
hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1137.44(b); and
    (2) The amount obtained from multiplying the difference between the 
Class III price for the preceding month and the Class II price for the 
current month by the lesser of:
    (i) The hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from 
Class II pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1137.44(b) for the current month; or
    (ii) The hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat remaining in Class 
III after the computations pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(12) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1137.44(b) for the preceding month, less the 
hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat specified in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section;
    (d) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the 
Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned 
to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1137.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1137.44(a)(7) (i) through (iv) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1137.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an 
other order plant and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool 
plants, other order plants and unregulated supply plants;
    (e) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class I price applicable at the location of the transferor-plant and 
the Class III price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat 
subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1137.44(a)(7)(v) and (vi) and 
the corresponding step of Sec. 1137.44(b);
    (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from 
which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and 
butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to 
Class I pursuant to Sec. 1137.43(d) and Sec. 1137.44(a)(7)(i) and the 
pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
Sec. 1137.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1137.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent

[[Page 814]]

that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such 
plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is 
classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for 
any other payment obligation under any order;
    (g) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1137.43(d);
    (h) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of 
another order under Sec. 1137.76(a)(5) or (c); and
    (i) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1137.61  Computation of uniform price.

    For each month the market administrator shall compute the uniform 
price per hundredweight for milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content 
received from producers as follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1137.60 for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed by 
Sec. 1137.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to 
Secs. 1137.71 and 1137.73 for the preceding month;
    (b) Add an amount equal to the sum of the deductions to be made for 
location adjustments pursuant to Sec. 1137.75;
    (c) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated 
balance in the producer-settlement fund;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1137.60(f); and
    (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per 
hundredweight. The result shall be the ``uniform price'' per 
hundredweight of producer milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content 
delivered to plants at which no location adjustment is applicable.

Sec. 1137.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 14th day after the end of the month, each 
handler shall pay to the market administrator the amount, if any, by 
which the total amount specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
exceeds the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:

[[Page 815]]

    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1137.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) The value at the uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1137.75, of such handler's receipts of producer milk and milk 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 1137.42(e). In the case of a 
cooperative association which is a handler, less the amount due from 
other handlers pursuant to Sec. 1137.73(c), exclusive of differential 
butterfat values; and
    (ii) The value at the uniform price applicable at the location of 
the plant from which received of other source milk for which a value is 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1137.60(f).
    (b) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month each person 
who operated an other order plant that was regulated during such month 
under an order providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay to the 
market administrator an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.


<R05>
Sec. 1137.72  Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

    On or before the 15th day after the end of each month, the market

computed pursuant to Sec. 1137.71(a)(1). If, at such time, the balance 
in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments 
pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce 
uniformly such payments and shall complete such payments as soon as the 
funds are available.


<R05>
Sec. 1137.73  Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

    Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each 
handler except a cooperative association shall make payment as specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section to each producer from whom milk is 
received:
    (a)(1) On or before the last day of each month, to each producer who 
had not discontinued shipping milk to such handler before the 18th day

first 15 days of the month at the Class III price for the preceding 
month.
    (2) On or before the 16th day after the end of each month, for milk 
received during such month, an amount computed at not less than the 
uniform price per hundredweight pursuant to Sec. 1137.61, as adjusted by 
the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1137.74 and location 
adjustments specified in Sec. 1137.75, plus or minus adjustments for 
errors made in previous payments to such producers and less:
    (i) Payments made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Deductions for marketing services pursuant to Sec. 1137.86; and

his total payment to all producers uniformly by not more than the amount 
of reduction in payment from the market administrator; the handler 
shall, however, complete such payments not later than the date for 
making such payments pursuant to this paragraph next following receipt 
of the balance from the market administrator.
    (b)(1) Upon receipt of a written request from a cooperative 
association which the market administrator determines is authorized by 
its members to collect payment for their milk and receipt of a written 
promise to reimburse

[[Page 816]]

the handler the amount of any actual loss incurred by him because of any 
improper claim on the part of the cooperative association each handler 
shall pay to the cooperative association on or before the second day 
prior to the date of payment to producers in lieu of payments pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal to the sum of the 
individual payments otherwise payable to such producers. The foregoing 
payment shall be made with respect to milk of each producer whom the 
cooperative association certifies is a member effective on and after the 
first day of the calendar month next following receipt of such 
certification through the last day of the month next preceding receipt 
of notice from the cooperative association of a termination of 
membership or until the original request is rescinded in writing by the 
cooperative association; and
    (2) A copy of each such request, promise to reimburse and certified 
list of members shall be filed simultaneously with the market 
administrator by the cooperative association and shall be subject to 
verification at his discretion through audit of the records of the 
cooperative association pertaining thereto. Exceptions, if any, to the 
accuracy of such certification by a producer claimed to be a member, or 
by a handler, shall be made by written notice to the market 
administrator and shall be subject to his determination.
    (c) For milk received from a pool plant operated by a cooperative 
association or from a cooperative association that is a handler pursuant 
to Sec. 1137.9(c), each handler shall on or before the second day prior 
to the date payments are due individual producers, pay such cooperative 
association for such milk as follows:

the month at not less than the Class III price for the preceding month; 
and
    (2) A final settlement equal to the value of such milk at the 
uniform price pursuant to Sec. 1137.61, as adjusted pursuant to 
Secs. 1137.74 and 1137.75, less payment made pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (d) In making the payments to producers pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (b) of this section, each handler shall furnish each producer 
or cooperative association from whom he has received milk with a 
supporting statement which shall show for each month:
    (1) The month and identity of the handler and of the producer;
    (2) The total pounds and the average butterfat content of milk 
received from such producer;
    (3) The minimum rate or rates at which payment to such producer is

Sec. 1137.76  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Sec. 1137.30(b) and 1137.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not another order plant to 
the extent that the equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the uniform price, both prices to be applicable at the 
location of the partially regulated distributing plant (except that the 
Class I price and the uniform price shall not be less than the Class III 
price); and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted 
fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1137.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;

[[Page 818]]

    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1137.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1137.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1137.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1137.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1137.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1137.7(b) 
subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with its reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1137.30(b) and 
1137.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (b) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (c) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1137.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1137.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated;
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1137.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1137.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only

[[Page 819]]

be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality 
of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment 
option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in 
reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market 
administrator.

association which is a handler of milk subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1137.42(e)) and such handler's own production;
    (b) Receipts of concentrated fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants and receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I

hundredweight, or such lesser amount as may be prescribed by the 
Secretary, and shall pay such deductions to the market administrator on 
or before the 14th day after the end of the month. Such money shall be

check the accuracy of the testing and weighing of their milk for 
producers who are not receiving such services from a cooperative 
association.
    (b) In the case of producers who are members of a cooperative 
association which the Secretary has determined is actually performing 
the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, each handler 
shall make, in lieu of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section, such deductions from the payments to be made to producers as 
may be authorized by the membership agreement or marketing contract 
between the cooperative association and its members, and on or before 
the 16th day after the end of each month, the handler shall pay the

Sec. 1138.7  Pool plant.

    Pool plant means: (a) A distributing plant: (1) From which during 
the month there is total route disposition (except filled milk) in an 
amount not less than 50 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk 
products (except filled milk) received at such plant, including producer 
milk diverted from the plant, and not less than 10 percent of such 
receipts are disposed of as fluid milk products on routes in the 
marketing area; or
    (2) Located in the marketing area that qualifies pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section so long as this order's Class I price 
applicable at such plant location is not less than an other order's 
Class I price applicable at the same location even though the plant may 
meet the pooling requirements of the other Federal order and have 
greater route disposition in the other marketing area than in the New 
Mexico-West Texas marketing area.
    (b) A supply plant from which during the month not less than 50 
percent of the total quantity of milk that is received from dairy 
farmers (including producer milk diverted from the plant pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.13, but excluding milk diverted to such plant) and handlers 
described in Sec. 1138.9(c) is transferred to plants described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the following. A supply plant 
that has qualified as a pool plant during each of the immediately 
preceding months of September through January shall continue to qualify 
in each of the following months of February through August.
    (c) Any plant located in the marketing area that is operated by a 
cooperative association if pool plant status under this paragraph is 
requested by the cooperative association and 35 percent or more of the 
producer milk of members of the cooperative association (and any 
producer milk of nonmembers and members of another cooperative 
association which may be marketed by the cooperative association) is 
physically received during the month in the form of bulk fluid milk 
products at plants specified in paragraph (a) of this

[[Page 822]]

section either directly from farms or by transfer from supply plants 
operated by the cooperative association and from plants of the 
cooperative association for which pool plant status has been requested 
under this paragraph subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The plant does not qualify as a pool plant under paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section or under comparable provisions of another Federal 
order; and
    (2) The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency 
for the handling of milk approved for fluid consumption in the marketing 
area.
    (d) The shipping standards in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section 
may be increased or decreased up to 10 percentage points by the Director 
of the Dairy Division if the Director finds such revision is necessary 
to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before 
making such a finding the Director shall investigate the need for 
revision, either at the Director's initiative or at the request of 
interested persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be 
appropriate, the Director shall issue a notice stating that revision is 
being considered and inviting data, views, and arguments. If a plant 
which would not otherwise qualify as a pool plant during the month 
qualifies as a pool plant because of a reduction in shipping standards 
pursuant to this paragraph, such plant shall be a nonpool plant for such 
month if the operator files a written request for nonpool plant status 
with the market administrator at the time the report is filed for such 
plant pursuant to Sec. 1138.30.
    (e) The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:
    (1) A producer-handler plant, a governmental agency plant, or an 
exempt plant.
    (2) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another 
Federal order and from which there is a greater quantity of route 
disposition, except filled milk, during the month in such other Federal 
order marketing area than in this marketing area, except that if such 
plant was subject to all the provisions of this part in the immediately 
preceding month, it shall continue to be subject to all the provisions 
of this part until the third consecutive month in which a greater 
proportion of its route disposition, except filled milk, is made in such 
other marketing area unless, notwithstanding the provisions of this 
paragraph, it is regulated under such other order. On the basis of a 
written application made by the plant operator at least 15 days prior to 
the date for which a determination of the Secretary is to be effective, 
the Secretary may determine that the route disposition in the respective 
marketing areas to be used for purposes of this paragraph shall exclude 
(for a specified period of time) route disposition made under limited 
term contracts to governmental bases and institutions;
    (3) A distributing plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal 
order and from which there is a greater quantity of route disposition, 
except filled milk, during the month in this marketing area than in such 
other Federal order marketing area but which plant is, nevertheless, 
fully regulated under such other Federal order;
    (4) A supply plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal 
order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made during the 
month to plants regulated under such other order than are made to plants 
regulated under this part; or
    (5) A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
which has automatic pooling status under another Federal order.

market administrator prior to the time that such milk is delivered to 
the pool plant that the plant operator will be the handler for such milk 
and will purchase such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk

Sec. 1138.13  Producer milk.

    Producer milk means the skim milk and butterfat in milk from a 
producer that is:
    (a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from such 
producer. Any milk picked up from the producer's farm tank in a tank

pool plant but which is not received at a plant until the following 
month, shall be considered as having been received by the handler during 
the month in which it is picked up at the producer's farm and shall be 
priced at the location of the plant where it is physically received in 
the following month. This paragraph shall apply in like manner to milk 
received by the operator of a pool plant who, in accordance with 
Sec. 1138.9(c), is the handler for such milk.
    (b) Received by a handler described in Sec. 1138.9(c).
    (c) Diverted from a pool plant for the account of the handler 
operating such plant to another pool plant, without limit in any month. 
Such milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which 
diverted.
    (d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or by a cooperative 
association from a pool plant to a nonpool plant (other than a producer-
handler plant), subject to the following conditions:
    (1) In each of the months of September through January, milk of a 
producer shall not be eligible for diversion from a pool plant under 
this section unless at least one day's production from such producer is 
physically received at a pool plant during the month;
    (2) The total quantity of milk diverted by a cooperative association 
in any month shall not exceed the total quantity of producer milk that 
the cooperative association caused to be delivered to and was physically 
received at pool plants during the month;
    (3) The operator of a pool plant other than a cooperative 
association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a 
cooperative association that is diverting milk during the month pursuant 
to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The total quantity of milk so 
diverted in any month shall not exceed the total quantity of milk that 
was physically received at pool plant(s) as producer milk for which the 
plant operator is the handler;
    (4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in 
paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section shall not be producer milk. 
In such event, the diverting handler may designate the dairy farmer 
deliveries that shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to so 
designate, milk diverted on the last day of the month, then the second-
to-last-day of the month, and so on, shall be excluded until all 
diversions in excess of the prescribed limits are accounted for;
    (5) The quantity of milk diverted from a pool plant that would cause 
the pool plant to become a nonpool plant shall not be producer milk. 
Diversions in excess of the prescribed limit shall be prorated among the 
diverting handlers;
    (6) If a dairy farmer loses producer status under this order (except 
as a result of temporary loss of approval from a duly constituted 
regulatory agency for the production of milk for fluid

[[Page 825]]

consumption), such dairy farmer's milk shall not be eligible for 
diversion until it has been physically received as producer milk at a 
pool plant; and
    (7) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to 
which diverted.

    Effective Date Note: At 62 FR 50486, Sept. 26, 1997, in 
Sec. 1138.13, paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (5) were suspended, effective

<R05>
Sec. 1138.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1138.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective quantities of skim 
milk and butterfat;
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraph (b) (1) through 
(6) of this section which was received in the form of a bulk fluid milk 
product or a bulk fluid cream product;
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator to another 
plant);
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from a handler described in Sec. 1138.9(c) and in milk 
diverted to such plant from another pool plant, except that, in either 
case, if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk 
tank samples, the applicable percentage under this subparagraph shall be 
2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted from such plant by the plant operator to 
another plant, except that if the operator of the plant to which the 
milk is delivered purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined 
from its measurement at the farm and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage under this 
subparagraph shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat respectively, in 
bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other order 
plants, excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III 
classification is requested by the operators of both plants;
    (6) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received from unregulated supply plants, 
excluding the quantity for which Class II or Class III classification is 
requested by the handler; and
    (7) Less 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

percentages are applied in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) of 
this section; and
    (c) The quantity of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
shrinkage of milk from producers for which a cooperative association is 
the handler pursuant to Sec. 1138.9 (b) or (c), but not in excess of 0.5 
percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such milk. If 
the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such 
milk on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm 
and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage under this paragraph for the cooperative 
association shall be zero.

Sec. 1138.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk 
fluid cream product from a pool plant to another pool plant shall be 
classified as Class I milk unless the operators of both plants request 
the same classification in another class. In either case, the 
classification of such transfers or diversions shall be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant or

[[Page 830]]

divertee-plant after the computations pursuant to Sec. 1138.44(a)(12) 
and the corresponding step of Sec. 1138.44(b). The amount of skim milk 
or butterfat classified in each class shall include the assigned 
utilization of skim milk or butterfat in transfers of concentrated fluid 
milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant or divertor-plant received during the 
month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1138.44(a)(7) 
or the corresponding step of Sec. 1138.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat 
so transferred or diverted shall be classified so as to allocate the 
least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler received during 
the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1138.44(a) 
(11) or (12) or the corresponding step of Sec. 1138.44(b), the skim milk 
or butterfat so transferred or diverted, up to the total of the skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, 
shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would 
be the case if the other source milk had been received at the 
transferee-plant or divertee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to an other order plant shall 
be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall apply 
only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any receipts at 
the pool plant from the other order plant of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products, 
respectively, that are in the same category as described in paragraph 
(b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred in bulk form, classification shall be in the 
classes to which allocated under the other order (including allocation 
under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the class to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification 
under this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I subject to 
adjustment when such information is available.
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1138.40.
    (c) Transfers to producer-handlers and transfers and diversions to 
exempt plants and governmental agency plants. Skim milk or butterfat 
transferred in the following forms from a pool plant to a producer-
handler under this or any other Federal order or transferred or diverted 
from a pool plant to an exempt plant or and a governmental agency plant 
shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and
    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose the transferee's utilization of skim milk and butterfat 
in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be assigned to 
the extent possible to its receipt of skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each source.

[[Page 831]]

    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, an exempt handler plant, or a governmental agency plant 
shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product, unless the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) If the conditions described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (A) and (B) 
of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (A) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1138.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (B) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator.
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (C) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (D) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (B) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (A) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (B) To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not 
fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to 
any remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and 
then to Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and

[[Page 832]]

    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this subparagraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream 
products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully 
regulated under any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis 
of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities 
at the second plant that are set forth in this subparagraph.
    (e) Transfers by a handler described in Sec. 1138.9(c) to pool 
plants. Skim milk and butterfat transferred in the form of bulk milk by 
a handler described in Sec. 1138.9(c) to another handler's pool plant 
shall be classified pursuant to Sec. 1138.44 pro rata with producer milk 
received at the transferee-handler's plant and the value thereof at the 
class prices shall be included in the pool plant handler's value of milk 
pursuant to Sec. 1138.60.

Sec. 1138.43  General classification rules.

    In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.44, the following rules shall apply:
    (a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for 
mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.30 and shall compute separately for each pool plant, and for 
each cooperative association with respect to milk for which it is the 
handler pursuant to Sec. 1138.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a 
pool plant, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each 
class in accordance with Secs. 1138.40, 1138.41 and 1138.42. The 
combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat so determined in each Class 
for a handler described in Sec. 1138.9 (b) or (c) shall be such 
handler's classification of producer milk;
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids; 
and
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1138.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1138.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in

Sec. 1138.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler described in Sec. 1138.9(a) for each pool plant of the handler 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1138.9(c), by allocating the handler's 
receipts of skim milk and butterfat to the utilization of such receipts 
by such handler as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1138.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:

[[Page 833]]

    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;

the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts.
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1138.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds of 
skim milk remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1138.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1138.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1138.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies,

(a)(2)(i) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant; 
and
    (vii) Receipts of fluid milk products from a person described in 
Sec. 1138.12(b)(5);
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with

paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8)(i) of this section which are in 
excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii) (A) through (C) of this section. Should the pounds of skim 
milk to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount;
    (A) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (B) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1138.9(c), fluid milk products

other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (C) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1138.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5) and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining 
in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation 
step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity pro-rated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (7)(v), and (8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that were 
not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the same 
unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated 
at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing

[[Page 835]]

as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; and
    (ii) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining 
in such class, the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds 
of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall be decreased by a 
like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then Class II). In 
such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in 
the reverse direction by a like amount, beginning with the nearest plant 
at which Class I utilization is available;
    (12) Subtract in the manner specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk 
fluid milk products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk 
fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were 
not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk;
    (A) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1138.45(a); or
    (B) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class II 
and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined 
shall be increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II 
to the extent of available utilization in such classes at the nearest 
other pool plant of the handler, and then at each successively more 
distant pool plant of the handler) by an amount equal to such excess 
quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at the handler's other 
pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount; 
and
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) or (ii) of this 
section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class I 
that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, the pounds 
of skim milk in Class I shall be increased by an amount equal to such 
excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class 
II and Class III combined shall

[[Page 836]]

be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and 
then Class II). In such case the pounds of skim milk remaining in each 
class at this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall 
be adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount beginning with the 
nearest plant at which Class I utilization is available;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such product pursuant to Sec. 1138.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1138.9(c), subtract such excess from the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1138.9(c) in each class shall be the combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the 
computations pursuant to paragraph (a)(14) of this section and the

    (a) Whenever required for the purpose of allocating receipts from 
other order plants pursuant to Sec. 1138.44(a)(12) and the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1138.44(b), estimate and publicly announce the utilization 
(to the nearest whole percentage) in each class during the month of skim 
milk and butterfat, respectively, in producer milk of all handlers. Such 
estimate shall be based upon the most current available data and shall 
be final for such purpose.
    (b) Report to the market administrator of the other order, as soon 
as possible after the report of receipts and utilization for the month 
is received from a handler who has received fluid milk products or bulk 
fluid cream products from an other order plant, the class to which such 
receipts are allocated pursuant to Sec. 1138.43(d) and Sec. 1138.44 on 
the basis of such report (including any reclassification of inventories 
of bulk concentrated fluid milk products), and thereafter, any change in 
such allocation required to correct errors disclosed in the verification 
of such report.
    (c) Furnish to each handler operating a pool plant who has shipped 
fluid milk products or bulk fluid cream products to an other order plant 
the class to which shipments were allocated by the market administrator 
of the other order on the basis of the report by the receiving handler, 
and, as necessary, any changes in such allocation arising from the 
verification of such report.
    (d) On or before the 12th day after the end of the each month, 
report to each cooperative association which so requests, the amount and 
class utilization of milk received by each handler from producers whose 
milk is being marketed by such cooperative association. For the purpose 
of this report, the milk caused to be so delivered by a cooperative 
association shall be pro-rated to each class in the proportion that the 
total receipts of producer milk by such handler were used in each class.

nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the 
butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese product price formula computed 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of milk used to 
manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and Cheddar cheese shall be computed, 
using price date determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for the 
current month as follows:

by the Department.
    (4) Cheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple 
average for the month of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block 
Cheddar cheese price, as reported by the Department.
    (5) Grade A butter price. Grade A butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade A butter 
price, as reported by the Department.
    (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight 
of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value 
per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture Cheddar cheese for the 
current month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for 
the preceding month.
    (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross 
values determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section by 
determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of 
the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section:
    (1) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department, for the most 
recent preceding period, and divide by the annual yield factor for 
nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of

subtracted from each class pursuant to Sec. 1138.44(a)(14) and the 
corresponding step of Sec. 1138.44(b) by the respective class prices, as 
adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1138.74, that 
are applicable at the location of the pool plant;
    (c) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the difference between 
the Class III price for the preceding month and the Class I price 
applicable at the location of the pool plant or the Class II price, as 
the case may be, for the current month by the hundredweight of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I and Class II pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1138.44(b);

Sec. 1138.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of Sec. 1138.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an 
equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by 
handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and 
priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other 
payment obligation under any order;

    (h) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid 
milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more 
than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location 
of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the hundredweight of skim 
milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that 
are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1138.43(d);
    (i) Exclude, for pricing purposes under this section, receipts of 
nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted 
milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of an 
other order under Sec. 1138.76(a)(5) or (c); and
    (j) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk 
products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract 
the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous 
month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. 
Any such applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant 
that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid 
milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products 
received at the plant during the prior month.

Sec. 1138.61  Computation of uniform price.

    The market administrator shall compute for each month the uniform 
price per hundredweight for milk of 3.5 percent butterfat content as 
follows:
    (a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.60 for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed in 
Sec. 1138.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.71 for the preceding month;
    (b) Add not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the 
producer-settlement fund;
    (c) Add the aggregate of all minus location adjustments and subtract 
the aggregate of all plus location adjustments computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.75;
    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in the computations;
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk; and
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1138.60(f); and

<R05>
Sec. 1138.70  Producer-settlement fund.

    The market administrator shall establish and maintain a separate 
fund known as the ``producer-settlement fund'' into which he shall 
deposit all payments made by handlers pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1138.71, 
1138.76 and 1138.77 and from which he shall make all payments pursuant 
to Sec. Sec. 1138.72 and 1138.77, except that payments to a cooperative 
association pursuant to Sec. 1138.72 shall be offset by any payments due 
from such cooperative association pursuant to Sec. 1138.71 that have not 
been received by the market administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 1138.71  Payments to the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, each handler shall pay 
to the market administrator on or before the 14th day after the end of 
the month the amount, if any, by which the amount specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section exceeds the amount specified in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section:
    (1) The total value of milk of the handler for such month as 
determined pursuant to Sec. 1138.60.
    (2) The sum of:
    (i) The value at the uniform price, as adjusted pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.75, of such handler's receipts of producer milk and milk 
received from handlers pursuant to Sec. 1138.9(c). In the case of a 
cooperative association which is a handler, less the amount due from 
other handlers pursuant to Sec. 1138.73(d), exclusive of differential 
butterfat values; and
    (ii) The value at the uniform price applicable at the location of 
the plant from which received of other source milk for which a value is 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1138.60(f).
    (b) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, each person who 
operated a plant that was regulated during such month under an order 
providing for individual-handler pooling shall pay to the market 
administrator on or before the 25th day after the end of each month an 
amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
in route disposition from such plant in the marketing area which was 
allocated to Class I at such plant. If there is such route disposition 
from such plant in marketing areas regulated by two or more marketwide 
pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk allocated to Class I shall be 
prorated to each order according to such route disposition in each 
marketing area; and
    (2) Compute the value of the reconstituted skim milk assigned in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to route disposition in this marketing 
area by multiplying the quantity of such skim milk by the difference 
between the Class I price under this part that is applicable at the 
location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III 
price) and the Class III price.
    (c) Any handler who the market administrator determines was more 
than 3 days late in making any payment obligation under part 1138 shall 
pay to the market administrator the amount the handler would have 
otherwise been required to pay to producers and cooperative associations 
pursuant to Sec. 1138.73. Payment shall be made to the market 
administrator on or before the day prior to the dates specified in 
Sec. 1138.73 and such payments shall continue until the handler has met 
all payment obligations for 3 consecutive months.
    (d) The following conditions shall apply with respect to payments 
prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section:
    (1) Payments to the market administrator shall be deemed not to have 
been made until such payments have been received by the market 
administrator.
    (2) If the date by which payments must be received by the market 
administrator falls on a Saturday or Sunday or any day that is a 
national holiday, payment shall not be due until the next day on which 
the market administrator's office is open for public business.
    (3) Payments due the market administrator from a cooperative 
association handler may be offset by payments determined by the market 
administrator to be due the cooperative association pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.73 (b) and (d).

Sec. 1138.72  Payments from the producer-settlement fund.

    (a) On or before the 15th day after the end of each month the market 
administrator shall pay to each handler except one making payment 
pursuant to Sec. 1138.71(c) the amount, if any, by which the amount 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1138.71(a)(2) exceeds the amount computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1138.71(a)(1).
    (b) If the market administrator received payment from a handler(s) 
pursuant to Sec. 1138.71(c), he shall distribute such amount plus any 
amount due such handler(s) pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to 
producers and to cooperative associations in the same manner as provided 
in Sec. 1138.73. In the event the handler fails to transmit the total 
amount due, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly the payments 
due to producers of such handler and complete such payments when the 
remaining amount is received.
    (c) If at any time the balance in the producer-settlement fund is 
insufficient to make all payments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments 
and shall complete such payments as soon as the appropriate funds are 
available.

Sec. 1138.73  Payments to producers and to cooperative associations.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 1138.71(c) and paragraphs (b), (d) 
and (f) of this section, each handler shall make payment to each 
producer from whom milk is received during the month as follows:
    (1) On or before the last day of each month each producer who did 
not discontinue shipping milk to such handler before the 23rd day of the 
month, an amount equal to not less than the previous month's uniform 
price (adjusted for location of such plant) multiplied by the 
hundredweight of milk received from such producer during the first 15 
days of the month, less proper deductions authorized in writing by the 
producer, provided that the deductions do not exceed the value of the 
milk received during the partial payment period and the handler has paid 
such deductions to assignees by the date payment is otherwise due the 
producer.
    (2) On or before the 17th day of the following month, an amount 
equal to not less than the appropriate uniform price adjusted by the 
butterfat differential and location adjustments to producers multiplied 
by the hundredweight of milk received from such producer during the 
month, subject to the following adjustments:
    (i) Less payments made to such producer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section;
    (ii) Less deductions for marketing services made pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.86;
    (iii) Plus or minus adjustments for errors made in previous payments 
made to such producer; and
    (iv) Less proper deductions authorized in writing by such producer, 
provided that the deductions do not exceed the value of the milk 
received during the final payment period and the handler has paid such 
deductions to assignees by the date payment is otherwise due to the 
producer: Provided, That if by such date such handler had not received 
full payment from the market administrator pursuant to Sec. 1138.72(a) 
for such month, he may reduce pro rata his payments to producers by not 
more than the amount of such underpayment. Payments to producer shall be 
completed thereafter not later than the date for making payments 
pursuant to this paragraph next following after the receipt of the 
balance due from the market administrator.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, in the case 
of a cooperative association which the market administrator determines 
is authorized by those producers for whom it markets milk to collect 
payment for their milk and which has so requested any handler in 
writing, such handler other than one specified in Sec. 1138.71(c) shall 
on or before the 2nd day prior to the date on which payments are due 
individual producers pay the cooperative association for milk received 
during the month from those producers for whom it markets milk as 
determined by the market administrator an amount equal to not less than 
the amount due such producers as determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section.

[[Page 842]]

    (c) In making payments to producers pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, or to a cooperative association pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section, each handler shall furnish such producer or cooperative 
association with respect to each of the producers for whom it markets 
milk and from whom the handler received milk during the month, a written 
statement showing:
    (1) The identity of the handler and the producer and the month to 
which the payment applies;
    (2) The total pounds, and, with respect to final payments, the 
average butterfat content of the milk for which payment is being made;
    (3) The minimum rate of payment required by the order and the rate 
of payment used if such rate is other than the applicable minimum rate;
    (4) The amount and nature of any deductions from the amount 
otherwise due the producer; and
    (5) The new amount of payment to the producer.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 1138.71(c) and paragraph (f) of this 
section, each handler pursuant to Sec. 1138.9(a) who receives milk from 
a cooperative association as a handler pursuant to Sec. 1138.9(c), 
including the milk of producers who are not members of such association, 
and who the market administrator determines have authorized such 
cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, shall pay 
such cooperative for such milk as follows:
    (1) On or before the 2nd day prior to the last day of the month for 
milk received during the first 15 days of the month, not less than the 
applicable partial payment rate specified for such month in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section; and
    (2) On or before the 15th day of the following month for milk 
received during the month, not less than the uniform price as adjusted 
pursuant to Sec. 1138.74 and Sec. 1138.75, less any payments made 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 1138.71(c), each handler who received 
bulk fluid milk or bulk fluid cream products from a pool plant operated 
by a cooperative association shall pay the following amounts for such 
products to the cooperative association:
    (1) On or before the 2nd day prior to the last day of each month, an 
amount determined by multiplying such receipts during the first 15 days 
of the month by the applicable partial payment rate specified for such 
month in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the handler so elects, 
such price may be adjusted by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1138.74 for the preceding month.
    (2) On or before the 15th day after the end of each month, an amount 
determined by multiplying the quantity of such receipts during the month 
that was classified in each class pursuant to Sec. 1138.42(a) by the 
applicable class price, as adjusted by the butterfat differential 
specified in Sec. 1138.74, less any payments made by the handler 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section for such month. For the 
purpose of such computation, the applicable Class I price shall be the 
Class I price applicable at the transferee plant including the 
applicable administrative assessment rate.
    (f) If the application of Sec. 1138.71(d)(2) results in a delay in 
payment by the market administrator to handlers, the payments prescribed 
in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of this section may be delayed by the 
same number of days.
    (g) If the market administrator does not receive the full payment 
required of a handler pursuant to Sec. 1138.71(c), he shall reduce 
uniformly per hundredweight the payments due producers and cooperative 
associations for their milk received by such handler by a total amount 
not in excess of the amount due from such handler. The market 
administrator shall complete such payments on or before the next date 
for making payments pursuant to this section following the date on which 
the remaining payment is received from such handler.

Sec. 1138.76  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing plant 
shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month to the 
market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the handler 
submits pursuant to Sec. 1138.30(b) and Sec. 1138.31(b) the information 
necessary for making the computations, such handler may elect to pay in 
lieu of such payment the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (a) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant:
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (4) Multiply the remaining pounds by the difference between the 
Class I price and the uniform price, both prices to be applicable at the 
location of the partially regulated distributing plant; and
    (5) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the 
difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the 
partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be less 
than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any reconstituted 
milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not be reduced by 
$1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may be made to the 
producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used 
to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the difference between the 
Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the 
plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment 
option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the 
plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under 
one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-
settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to 
produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not 
apply if the source of the

[[Page 844]]

nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (b) The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting 
from the following computations:
    (1) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1138.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (i) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the 
fully regulated plant;
    (ii) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any 
such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are classified 
in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler operating 
the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to Sec. 1138.60 
shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted average price 
if such is provided) of the respective order regulating the handling of 
milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price adjusted to the 
location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest class 
price of the respective order), except that transfers of reconstituted 
skim milk in filled milk shall be priced at the lowest class price of 
the respective order; and
    (iii) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
so requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1138.60 for 
such handler shall include, in lieu of the value of other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1138.60(f) less the value of such other source milk 
specified in Sec. 1138.71(a)(2)(ii), a value of milk determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1138.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1138.7(b) 
subject to the following conditions:
    (A) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with its reports filed pursuant to Secs. 1138.30(b) and 
1138.31(b) similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;
    (B) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (C) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1138.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (2) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:
    (i) The gross payments by the operator of such partially regulated 
distributing plant, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis by the 
butterfat differential specified in Sec. 1138.74, for milk received at 
the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the 
plant had been fully regulated.
    (ii) If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, adjusted to a 3.5 
percent butterfat basis by the butterfat differential specified in 
Sec. 1138.74, for milk received at the plant during the month that would 
have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (iii) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies.

[[Page 845]]

    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1138.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1138.77  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever audit by the market administrator of any handler's reports, 
books, records, or accounts discloses adjustments to be made, for any 
reason, which results in monies due the market administrator from such 
handler, the market administrator shall promptly notify such handler of 
any such amount due, and payment thereof shall be made on or before the 
next date for making payment set forth in the provision under which the 
error occurred. Any monies found to be due a handler from the market 
administrator shall be paid promptly to such handler, except that the 
market administrator shall offset any monies due a handler against 
monies due from such handler. Whenever verification by the market 
administrator of the payment by a handler to any producer or cooperative 
association for milk received by such handler discloses payment of less 
than is required pursuant to Sec. 1138.73, the handler shall pay such 
balance due such producer or cooperative association not later than the 
time of making payment to producers or cooperative associations next 
following such disclosure.

percent beginning on the first day after the due date, and on the same 
day of each subsequent month until such obligation is paid, subject to 
the following conditions:
    (a) The amounts payable pursuant to this section shall be computed 
monthly on each unpaid obligation, which shall include any unpaid 
charges previously computed pursuant to this section; and
    (b) For the purpose of this section, any obligation that was 
determined at a date later than prescribed by the order because of a 
handler's failure to submit a report to the market administrator when 
due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have 
been due if the report had been filed when due.

Sec. 1138.86  Deduction for marketing services.

    (a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, each 
handler, in making payments to producers pursuant to Sec. 1138.73, shall 
deduct 6 cents per hundredweight, or such lesser amount as the Secretary 
may prescribe, with respect to the milk of such producer (except a

in this paragraph are not being performed by a cooperative association 
as determined by the Secretary. Each handler making such deductions 
shall pay the deductions to the market administrator on or before the 
15th day after the end of the month. The monies shall be used by the 
market administrator to verify or establish weights, samples and tests

disposed of as route disposition; and

[[Page 848]]

    (2) 15 percent of such receipts are disposed of as route disposition 
in the marketing area during the month.
    (3) If a handler operates more than one distributing plant, the 
combined receipts and fluid milk product dispositions of such plants may

which such consolidation is desired.
    (b) A distributing plant that meets the following conditions:
    (1) The plant is located in the marketing area;

paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this section, located within the marketing 
area at which milk is received from producers and which is owned and 
operated by a cooperative association or federation which delivers at

products transferred from its own plant pursuant to this paragraph that 
is not in excess of the amount in producer milk actually received at

other order plant) other than as a diversion from a pool plant after the 
first delivery of milk from such dairy farmer in any month was received

milk.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.13  Producer milk.

    Producer milk means the skim milk and butterfat in milk of a 
producer that is:
    (a) Received or diverted by a handler defined in Sec. 1139.9(a) 
under one of the following conditions:
    (1) Received at such handler's pool plant directly from the farm of 
such producer;
    (2) Received at such handler's pool plant from a handler defined in 
Sec. 1139.9(c); or
    (3) Diverted to a nonpool plant subject to the conditions set forth 
in paragraph (d) of this section;
    (b) Diverted by a handler defined in Sec. 1139.9(b) to a nonpool 
plant subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section;
    (c) Received by a handler defined in Sec. 1139.9(c) from the 
producer's farm in excess of the producer's milk that is received at 
pool plants pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Such producer 
milk shall be deemed to have been received by the handler at the 
location of the pool plant to which the milk was delivered;
    (d) The following conditions shall apply to producer milk diverted 
to a nonpool plant:
    (1) The weighted average differential applicable to such milk shall 
be adjusted based on the location of the plant to which delivered, but 
it shall not be adjusted to a lower figure than is applicable at the 
location determined pursuant to Sec. 1139.52 (a) or (b)

[[Page 851]]

based on the location of the county seat or the county courthouse of the 
county in which such producer's farm is located.
    (2) A cooperative association or federation may divert for its 
account the milk of any of its producers from whom at least one day's 
milk production is received during the month at a pool plant. The total 
quantity of milk diverted by a cooperative association during any month 
may not exceed 75 percent of the producer milk that the cooperative 
association causes to be delivered to or diverted from pool plants 
during the month. Two or more cooperative associations may have their 
allowable diversions computed on the basis of their combined deliveries 
of the producer milk which the cooperative associations cause to be 
delivered to pool plants or diverted pursuant to this section if each 
association has filed a request in writing with the market administrator 
before the first day of the month the agreement is effective. This 
request shall specify the basis for assigning over-diverted milk to the 
producer deliveries of each cooperative association according to a 
method approved by the market administrator.
    (3) The operator of a pool plant (other than a cooperative 
association or federation) may divert for its account the milk of any 
producer (other than milk diverted pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section) from whom at least one day's milk production is received during 
the month at a pool plant. The total quantity of milk so diverted may 
not exceed 70 percent in the months of April through August, and 60 
percent in other months of the producer milk received at or diverted 
from such pool plant for which the operator of such plant is the handler 
during the month. The milk for which the operator of such plant is the 
handler for the month may not duplicate milk diverted pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
    (4) The diversion limits of this paragraph may be increased or 
decreased by up to 10 percentage points by the Director of the Dairy 
Division if that person finds such revision is necessary to obtain 
needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such 
a finding, the Director shall investigate the needs for revision either 
at the Director's own initiative or at the request of interested 
persons. If the investigation shows that a revision might be 
appropriate, the Director shall issue a notice stating that the revision 
is being considered and invite data, views, and arguments;
    (5) Diversions in excess of the percentages in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of this section shall not be producer milk, and the diverting 
handler shall designate the milk which is not producer milk. If the 
handler fails to make such designation, no milk diverted by the handler 
shall be producer milk. In the event some of the milk of any producer is 
determined not to be producer milk pursuant to this paragraph, other 
milk delivered by the producer during the month as producer milk will 
not be subject to Sec. 1139.12(b)(4); and
    (6) Milk of a dairy farmer who was not a producer in the preceding 
month shall not be eligible for diversion until after one day's milk 
production from such farmer has been received at a pool plant.

Sec. 1139.41  Shrinkage.

    For purposes of classifying all skim milk and butterfat to be 
reported by a handler pursuant to Sec. 1139.30, the market administrator 
shall determine the following:
    (a) The pro rata assignment of shrinkage of skim and butterfat, 
respectively, at each pool plant to the respective qualities of skim 
milk and butterfat:
    (1) In the receipts specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through (6) of 
this section on which shrinkage is allowed pursuant to such paragraph; 
and
    (2) In other source milk not specified in paragraphs (b) (1) through 
(6) of this section which was received in the form of a bulk fluid milk 
product or a bulk fluid cream product.
    (b) The shrinkage of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, assigned 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to the receipts specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is not in excess of:
    (1) Two percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in 
producer milk (excluding milk diverted by the plant operator, or 
received from handlers defined in Sec. 1139.9(c));
    (2) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in milk received from handlers defined in Sec. 1139.9(c), except if the 
operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered purchases such milk 
on the basis of weights determined from its measurement at the farm and 
protein and butterfat tests determined from farm bulk tank samples, the 
applicable percentage shall be 2 percent;
    (3) Plus 0.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in producer milk diverted by the plant operator to another plant, except 
that if the operator of the plant to which the milk is delivered 
purchases such milk on the basis of weights determined from its 
measurement at the farm and protein and butterfat tests determined from 
farm bulk tank samples, the applicable percentage shall be zero;
    (4) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
in bulk fluid milk products received by transfer from other pool plants;
    (5) Plus 1.5 percent of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively,

Sec. 1139.42  Classification of transfers and diversions.

    (a) Transfers to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred in 
the form of a fluid milk product or a bulk fluid cream product from a 
pool plant to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk 
unless both handlers request the same classification in another class. 
In either case, the classification of such transfers shall be subject to 
the following conditions:
    (1) The skim milk or butterfat classified in each class shall be 
limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, 
remaining in such class at the transferee-plant after the computation 
pursuant to Sec. 1139.44 (a)(12) and the corresponding step of 
Sec. 1139.44(b). The amount of skim milk or butterfat classified in each 
class shall include the assigned utilization of skim milk or butterfat 
in transfers of concentrated fluid milk products;
    (2) If the transferor-plant received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1139.44(a)(7) or the corresponding 
step of Sec. 1139.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall 
be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization 
to such other source milk; and
    (3) If the transferor-handler received during the month other source 
milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec. 1139.44(a)(11) or (12) or the 
corresponding steps of Sec. 1139.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so 
transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, 
respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be 
classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if 
the other source milk had been received at the transferee-plant.
    (b) Transfers and diversions to other order plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or 
transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant 
to an other order plant shall be classified in the following manner. 
Such classification shall apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that 
is in excess of any receipts at the pool plant from the other order 
plant of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products 
and bulk fluid cream products, respectively, that are in the same 
category as described in paragraph (b)(1),(2), or (3) of this section:
    (1) If transferred as packaged fluid milk products, classification 
shall be in the classes to which allocated as a fluid milk product under 
the other order;
    (2) If transferred or diverted in bulk form, classification shall be 
in the classes to which allocated under the other order (including 
allocation under the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section);
    (3) If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of 
receipts and utilization filed with their respective market 
administrators, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified 
as Class II or Class III milk to the extent of such utilization 
available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions 
of the other order;
    (4) If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or 
diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the 
market administator for the purpose of establishing classification under 
this paragraph, classification shall be as Class I, subject to 
adjustments when such information is available;
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, if the other order provides for 
a different number of classes of utilization than is provided for under 
this part, skim milk or butterfat allocated to a class consisting 
primarily of fluid milk products shall be classified as Class I milk, 
and skim milk or butterfat allocated to the other classes shall be 
classified as Class III milk; and
    (6) If the form in which any fluid milk product that is transferred 
to an other order plant is not defined as a fluid milk product under 
such other order, classification under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1139.40.
    (c) Transfers and diversions to producer-handlers and to exempt 
plants. Skim milk or butterfat in the following forms that is 
transferred or diverted to a producer-handler under this or any other 
Federal order or to an exempt distributing plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if so moved in the form of a fluid milk 
product; and

[[Page 857]]

    (2) In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market 
administrator, if transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product. 
For this purpose, the transferee's utilization of skim milk and 
butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class III, shall be 
assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and 
butterfat, respectively, in bulk fluid cream products, pro rata to each 
source.
    (d) Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or 
butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool 
plant to a nonpool plant that is not an other order plant, a producer-
handler plant, or an exempt distributing plant shall be classified:
    (1) As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid 
milk product; and
    (2) As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a 
bulk fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream 
product, unless the following conditions apply:
    (i) If the transferor-handler or divertor-handler so requests and 
the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (a) and (b) of this 
section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be 
classified on the basis of the assignments of the nonpool plant's 
utilization to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) 
through (viii) of this section:
    (a) The transferor-handler or divertor-handler claims such 
classification in his report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant 
to Sec. 1139.30 for the month within which such transaction occurred; 
and
    (b) The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing 
the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant 
which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the 
market administrator;
    (ii) Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk 
order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk 
products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder 
shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such 
nonpool plant from pool plants;
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid 
milk products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (c) Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (d) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (iii) Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk 
products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible 
pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants;
    (iv) Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to 
a plant fully regulated under any Federal milk order, to the extent that 
such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk 
products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the transferee-
plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool 
plant from pool plants; and
    (b) Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk 
products at such nonpool plant from other order plants;
    (v) Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool 
plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following 
sequence:
    (a) To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the 
market administrator determines constitute regular sources of approved 
milk for such nonpool plant; and
    (b) To such nonpool plant's receipts of approved milk from plants 
not fully regulated under any Federal milk order which the market 
administrator determines constitute regular sources of approved milk for 
such nonpool plant;
    (vi) Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products 
at the nonpool plant from pool plants and other order plants shall be 
assigned,

[[Page 858]]

pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to any 
remaining Class I utilization, then to Class II utilization, and then to 
Class III utilization at such nonpool plant;
    (vii) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant 
from pool plants and other order plants shall be assigned, pro rata 
among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class 
II utilization, then to any remaining Class III utilization, and then to 
Class I utilization at such nonpool plant; and
    (viii) In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes 
of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products 
transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under 
any Federal milk order shall be classified on the basis of the second 
plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second 
plant that are set forth in this paragraph.

Sec. 1139.43  General accounting and classification rules.

    (a) Each month the market administrator shall:
    (1) Correct for mathematical and other obvious errors all reports 
filed pursuant to Sec. 1139.30; and
    (2) Compute separately for each pool plant and for each cooperative 
association with respect to milk for which it is the handler pursuant to 
Sec. 1139.9 (b) or (c) that was not received at a pool plant, the pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance 
with Secs. 1139.40, 1139.41, and 1139.42. The combined pounds of skim 
milk and butterfat so determined in each class for a handler described 
in Sec. 1139.9 (b) or (c) shall be such handler's classification of 
producer milk.
    (b) If any of the water contained in the milk from which a product 
is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by a 
handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be 
considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall 
be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such 
product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids.
    (c) The classification of producer milk for which a cooperative 
association is the handler pursuant to Sec. 1139.9 (b) or (c) shall be 
determined separately from the operations of any pool plant operated by 
such cooperative association.
    (d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk 
concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are 
reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the 
reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a 
pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated 
receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments 
under Sec. 1139.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in 
concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under Sec. 1139.44 on a 
pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by 
the handler.

Sec. 1139.44  Classification of producer milk.

    For each month the market administrator shall determine for each 
handler defined in Sec. 1139.9(a) for each pool plant of the handler 
separately the classification of producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1139.9(c) by allocating the handler's receipts 
of skim milk and butterfat to the utilization of such receipts by such 
handler as follows:
    (a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:
    (1) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk in shrinkage specified in Sec. 1139.41(b);
    (2) Subtract from the total pounds of skim milk in Class I the 
pounds of skim milk in:
    (i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated 
supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk 
disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of 
the

[[Page 859]]

month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject to 
the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another 
Federal milk order in the immediately preceding month;
    (3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products received in packaged form 
from an other order plant, except that to be subtracted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) From Class III milk, the lesser of the pounds remaining or 2 
percent of such receipts; and
    (ii) From Class I milk, the remainder of such receipts;
    (4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of 
skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1139.40(b)(1) that were received 
in packaged form from other plants, but not in excess of the pounds 
remaining in Class II;
    (5) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in products specified in Sec. 1139.40(b)(1) in 
packaged form and in bulk concentrated fluid milk products that were in 
inventory at the beginning of the month, but not in excess of the pounds 
of skim milk remaining in Class II. This paragraph shall apply only if 
the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or 
comparable provisions of another Federal milk order in the immediately 
preceding month;
    (6) Subtract from the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class II the 
pounds of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in 
other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an 
unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used 
to produce, or added to any product specified in Sec. 1139.40(b) 
(excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class 
III milk pursuant to Sec. 1139.40(c)(6)), but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II.
    (7) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class III, the 
pounds of skim milk in each of the following:
    (i) Bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk 
(except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated 
fluid milk product) and, if paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies, 
packaged inventory at the beginning of the month of products specified 
in Sec. 1139.40(b)(1) that was not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Receipts of fluid milk products (except filled milk) for which 
approved milk status is not established;
    (iii) Receipts of fluid milk products from unidentified sources;
    (iv) Receipts of fluid milk products from a producer-handler as 
defined under this or any other Federal milk order, or from an exempt 
distributing plant;
    (v) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section;
    (vi) Receipts of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk from an 
other order plant that is regulated under any Federal milk order 
providing for individual-handler pooling, to the extent that 
reconstituted skim milk is allocated to Class I at the transferor-plant; 
and
    (vii) Receipts of milk from a dairy farmer pursuant to 
Sec. 1139.12(b)(4);
    (8) Subtract in the order specified below from the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III, in sequence beginning with 
Class III;
    (i) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(7)(v) of this section for which the handler 
requests a classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (ii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from 
an unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8)(i) of this section which are 
in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(a) through (c) this section. Should the pounds of skim milk 
to be subtracted from Class II and Class III combined exceed the

[[Page 860]]

pounds of skim milk remaining in such classes, the pounds of skim milk 
in Class II and Class III combined shall be increased (increasing as 
necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent of available 
utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the 
handler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the 
handler) by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, 
and the pounds of skim milk in Class I shall be decreased by a like 
amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at 
this allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be 
adjusted in the reverse direction by a like amount:
    (a) Multiply by 1.25 the sum of the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler 
(excluding any duplication of Class I utilization resulting from 
reported Class I transfers between pool plants of the handler);
    (b) Subtract from the above result the sum of the pounds of skim 
milk in receipts at all pool plants of the handler of producer milk, 
milk from a handler described in Sec. 1139.9(c), fluid milk products 
from pool plants of other handlers, and bulk fluid milk products from 
other order plants that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(7)(vi) of this section; and
    (c) Multiply any plus quantity resulting above by the percentage 
that the receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from unregulated 
supply plants that remain at this pool plant is of all such receipts 
remaining at this allocation step at all pool plants of the handler; and
    (iii) The pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk 
products from an other order plant that are in excess of bulk fluid milk 
products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(vi) of this section, if Class II 
or Class III classification is requested by the operator of the other 
order plant and the handler, but not in excess of the pounds of skim 
milk remaining in Class II and Class III combined;
    (9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, 
in series beginning with Class III, the pounds of skim milk in fluid 
milk products and products specified in Sec. 1139.40(b)(1) in inventory 
at the beginning of the month that were not subtracted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(5), and (a)(7)(i) of this section;
    (10) Add to the remaining pounds of skim milk in Class III the 
pounds of skim milk subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (11) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this 
section, subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
at the plant, pro rata to the total pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class I and in Class II and Class III combined at this allocation step 
at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any duplication of 
utilization in each class resulting from transfers between pool plants 
of the handler), with the quantity prorated to Class II and Class III 
combined being subtracted first from Class III and then from Class II, 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products from an 
unregulated supply plant that were not subtracted pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(7)(v), and (a)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section and that 
were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the 
same unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be 
allocated at this step were received:
    (i) Should the pounds of skim milk to be subtracted from any class 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
such class, the pounds of skim milk in such class shall be increased by 
an amount equal to such quantity to be subtracted and the pounds of skim 
milk in the other classes (beginning with the higher priced class) shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at other pool plants of 
the handler shall be adjusted to the extent possible in the reverse 
direction by a like amount. Such adjustment shall be made at the other 
plants in sequence beginning with the plant having the least minus 
location adjustment;

milk products transferred or diverted to such plant and that were not 
subtracted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(7)(vi) and (a)(8)(iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(12) (ii) and (iii) 
of this section, such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds of 
skim milk in Class I and in Class II and Class III combined, with the 
quantity prorated to Class II and Class III combined being subtracted 
first from Class III and then from Class II, with respect to whichever 
of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I 
milk:
    (a) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each 
class as announced for the month pursuant to Sec. 1139.45(a); or
    (b) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this 
allocation step at all pool plants of the handler (excluding any 
duplication of utilization in each class resulting from transfers 
between pool plants of the handler);
    (ii) Should the proration pursuant to paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this 
section result in the total pounds of skim milk at all pool plants of 
the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation step from Class 
II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk remaining in 
Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such excess 
shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I 
after such proration at the pool plants at which such other source milk 
was received; and
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section, 
should the computations pursuant to either paragraph (a)(12) (i) or (ii) 
of this section result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from 
any class that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in such class, 
the pounds of skim milk in such class shall be increased by an amount 
equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted and the pounds of skim 
milk in the other classes (beginning with the higher priced class) shall 
be decreased by a like amount. In such case, the pounds of skim milk 
remaining in each class at this allocation step at other pool plants of 
the handler shall be adjusted to the extent possible in the reverse 
direction by a like amount. Such adjustment shall be made at the other 
plants in sequence beginning with the plant having the least minus 
location adjustment;
    (13) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class 
the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk 
fluid cream products from another pool plant according to the 
classification of such products pursuant to Sec. 1139.42(a); and
    (14) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes 
exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk and milk received from a 
handler described in Sec. 1139.9(c), subtract such excess from the 
pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with 
Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be known as ``overage'';
    (b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure 
outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (c) The quantity of producer milk and milk received from a handler 
described in Sec. 1139.9(c) in each class shall be the combined pounds 
of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the

total of paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section computed as 
follows:
    (1) Compute a butterfat differential rounded to the nearest one-
tenth cent, by multiplying the current month's butter price by 0.138, 
and subtract from the result an amount determined by multiplying 0.0028 
by the preceding month's average pay price per hundredweight, at test, 
for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin, using the 
``base month'' series, adjusted pursuant to Sec. 1139.51 (a) through 
(e), as reported by the Department. The butter price means the simple 
average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Grade A butter 
price as reported by the Department.

    (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all 
handlers included in these computations:
    (1) The total hundredweight of producer milk;
    (2) The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant 
to Sec. 1139.60(g).
    (e) Subtract not more than 5 cents per hundredweight. The result is 
the ``Weighted Average Differential Price''.

<R05>
Sec. 1139.76  Payments by a handler operating a partially regulated distributing plant.

    (a) Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing 
plant that is not subject to a milk classification and pricing program 
that provides for marketwide pooling of producer returns and is enforced 
under the authority of a state government shall pay on or before the 
25th day after the end of the month to the market administrator for the 
producer-settlement fund the amount computed pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, or, if the handler submits pursuant to 
Secs. 1139.30(b) and 1139.31(b) the information necessary for making the 
appropriate computations, and so elects, the amount computed pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (1) An amount computed as follows:
    (i) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;

[[Page 870]]

    (ii) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant;
    (a) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order; 
and
    (b) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an 
offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (iii) Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk that are made from 
nonfluid milk products and which are then disposed of as route 
disposition in the marketing area from the partially regulated 
distributing plant;
    (iv) Multiply the remaining pounds by the amount the Class I-Class 
III price difference exceeds the weighted average differential computed 
pursuant to Sec. 1139.61 as adjusted by the appropriate location or zone 
differential (but in no case less than 0);
    (v) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled 
reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by 
the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of 
the partially regulated distributing plant less $1.00 (but not to be 
less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. For any 
reconstituted milk that is not so labeled, the Class I price shall not 
be reduced by $1.00. Alternatively, for such disposition, payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the 
total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.
    (2) An amount computed as follows:
    (i) Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to 
Sec. 1139.60 for the partially regulated distributing plant if the plant 
had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:
    (a) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at 
the partially regulated distributing plant from a pool plant or an other 
order plant shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing 
plant to the same class in which products were classified at the fully 
regulated plant;
    (b) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred 
from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or an 
other order plant shall be classified at the partially regulated 
distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully 
regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent 
possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant 
from pool plants and other order plants that are classified in the 
corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(a) of this section. 
Any such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are 
classified in Class I and for which a value is computed for the handler 
operating the partially regulated distributing plant pursuant to 
Sec. 1139.60(e) shall be priced at the uniform price (or at the weighted 
average price if such is provided) of the respective order regulating 
the handling of milk at the transferee-plant, with such uniform price 
(or weighted average price) adjusted to the location of the nonpool 
plant (but not to be less than the lowest class price of the respective 
order), except that transfers of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk 
shall be priced at the lowest class price of the respective order;
    (c) If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant so 
requests, the value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1139.60 for such 
handler

[[Page 871]]

shall include in lieu of the value of other source milk specified in 
Sec. 1139.60(g) less the value of such other source milk specified in 
Sec. 1139.71(a)(2)(iii) a value of milk determined pursuant to 
Sec. 1139.60 for each nonpool plant that is not an other order plant 
which serves as a supply plant for such partially regulated distributing 
plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant 
during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. 1139.7(c) 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant 
submits with reports filed for the month pursuant to Secs. 1139.30(b) 
and 1139.31(b) similar reports for each nonpool supply plant;
    (2) The operator of such nonpool supply plant maintains books and 
records showing the utilization of all milk and milk products received 
at such plant which are made available if requested by the market 
administrator for verification purposes; and
    (3) The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. 1139.60 for such 
nonpool supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed 
for computing the obligation of such partially regulated distributing 
plant; and
    (ii) From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk 
computed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, subtract:
    (a) The gross payment made by the operator of such partially 
regulated distributing plant, less the value of the butterfat at the 
butterfat price specified in Sec. 1139.50(d), for milk received at the 
plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the plant 
had been fully regulated;
    (b) If paragraph (a)(2)(i)(c) of this section applies, the gross 
payments by the operator of such nonpool supply plant, less the value of 
the butterfat at the butterfat price specified in Sec. 1139.50(d), for 
milk received at the plant during the month that would have been 
producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and
    (c) The payments by the operator of the partially regulated 
distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another order 
under which such plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant, 
and like payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant if 
paragraph (a)(2)(i)(c) of this section applies.
    (b) Each handler who operates a partially regulated distributing 
plant which is subject to marketwide pooling of returns under a milk 
classification and pricing program that is imposed under the authority 
of the state government shall pay on or before the 25th day after the 
end of the month to the market administrator for the producer-settlement 
fund an amount computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the pounds of route disposition in the marketing area 
from the partially regulated distributing plant;
    (2) Subtract the pounds of fluid milk products received at the 
partially regulated distributing plant;
    (i) As Class I milk from pool plants and other order plants, except 
that subtracted under a similar provision under another Federal milk 
order;
    (ii) From another nonpool plant that is not an other order plant to 
the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of 
to such nonpool plants by handlers fully regulated under any Federal 
milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;
    (3) Determine the value of the remaining pounds according to the 
difference between the appropriate Class prices applicable at the 
location of the partially regulated distributing plant (but not to be 
less than zero) as announced by the State order and as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1139.50.
    (c) Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant 
status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk 
ingredients assigned to Class I use under Sec. 1139.43(d). Payments may 
be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the 
producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the 
difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at 
the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were 
processed (but not to be less than the Class III price) and the Class 
III price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of

[[Page 872]]

the total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk 
ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment 
may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a 
plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. 
This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid 
ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be 
determined by the market administrator.

Sec. 1150.155  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever the Board or the Department determines through an audit of 
a person's reports, records, books or accounts or through some other 
means that additional money is due the Board or that money is due such 
person from the Board, such person shall be notified of the amount due. 
The person shall then remit any amount due the Board by the next date

and shall be applied against amounts due in succeeding months.

remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges previously 
made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at the same rate on 
the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. For the 
purpose of this section, any assessment that was determined at a date 
later than prescribed by this subpart because of a person's failure to 
submit a report to the Board when due shall be considered to have been 
payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed 
when due. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based

[[Page 881]]

on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the 
Board, whichever is earlier.
    (b) Penalties. Any person who willfully violates any provision of 
this subpart shall be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not 
more than $1,000 for each such violation and, in the case of a willful 
failure to pay, collect, or remit the assessment as required by this 
subpart, in addition to the amount due, a penalty equal to the amount of 
the assessment on the quantity of milk as to which the failure applies. 
The amount of any such penalty shall accrue to the United States and may 
be recovered in a civil suit brought by the United States. The remedies 
provided in this section shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, 
other remedies that may be available by law or in equity.

respect to the sale, distribution, marketing and utilization of milk and 
dairy products and the creation of new products thereof, to the end that

periodically reviewed or evaluated by the Board to insure that the plan 
or project contributes to an effective program of promotion, research 
and nutrition education. If it is found by the Board that any such plan 
or project does not further the purposes of the Act, the Board shall 
terminate such plan or project.
    (c) No plan or project authorized under Sec. 1150.161(a) shall make 
use of unfair or deceptive acts or practices with respect to the

    (a) (1) Each fluid milk processor shall pay to the Board or its 
designated agent an assessment of $.20 per hundredweight of fluid milk 
products processed and marketed commercially in consumer-type packages 
in the United States by such fluid milk processor. Producer-handlers 
required to pay assessments under section 113(g) of the Dairy Production 
Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4504(g)), and not exempt under 
Sec. 1160.108, shall also pay the assessment under this subpart. No 
assessments are required on fluid milk products exported from the United 
States. The Secretary shall have the authority to receive assessments on 
behalf of the Board.
    (2) The Secretary shall announce the establishment of the assessment 
each month in the Class I price announcement in each milk marketing area 
by adding it to the Class I price for the following month. In the event 
the assessment is suspended for a given month, the Secretary shall 
inform all fluid milk processors of the suspension in the Class I price 
announcement for that month. The Secretary shall also inform fluid milk 
processors marketing fluid milk in areas not subject to milk marketing 
orders administered by the Secretary of the establishment or suspension 
of the assessment.
    (3) Each processor responsible for remitting an assessment shall 
remit it to the Board not later than the last day of the month following 
the month that the assessed milk was marketed.
    (b) Such assessments shall not:
    (1) Reduce the prices paid under the Federal milk marketing orders 
issued under section 8c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 
608c), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement 
Act of 1937;
    (2) Otherwise be deducted from the amounts that handlers must pay to 
producers for fluid milk products sold to a processor; or
    (3) Otherwise be deducted from the price of milk paid to a producer 
by a handler, as determined by the Secretary.
    (c) Money remitted to the Board or the Board's designated agent 
shall be in the form of a negotiable instrument made payable to the 
Board or its agent, as the case may be. Processors must mail remittances 
and reports specified in Secs. 1160.108, 1160.211(a)(1), 1160.213, 
1160.214, and 1160.401 to the location designated by the Board or its

manner be used for the purpose of influencing governmental policy or 
action, except to recommend to the Secretary amendments to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.213  Adjustment of accounts.

    Whenever the Board or the Secretary determines through an audit of a 
processor's reports, records, books or accounts or through some other 
means that additional money is due the Board or to such processor from 
the Board, the Board shall notify that person of the amount due or 
overpaid. If the processor owes money to the Board, it shall remit that 
amount by the next date for remitting assessments as provided in 
Sec. 1160.211. If the processor has overpaid, that amount shall be 
credited to its account and applied against amounts due in succeeding 
months.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.214  Charges and penalties.

    (a) Late-payment charge. Any unpaid assessments shall be increased 
1.5 percent each month beginning with the day following the date such 
assessments were due. Any remaining amount due, which shall include any 
unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be 
increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of each month 
thereafter until

[[Page 892]]

paid. For the purpose of this section, any assessment determined at a 
date later than prescribed by this subpart because of the failure of a 
processor to submit a report to the Board when due shall be considered 
to have been payable by the date it would have been due if the report 
had been filed when due. The receipt of a payment by the Board will be 
based on the earlier of the postmark date or the actual date of receipt.
    (b) Penalties. The Secretary may assess any person who violates any 
provision of this subpart a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more 
than $5,000 for each such violation. In the case of a willful failure to 
pay an assessment as required by this subpart, in addition to the amount 
due, the Secretary may assess an additional penalty of not less than 
$10,000 nor more than $100,000 for each such violation. The amount of 
any such penalty shall accrue to the United States, which may recover 
such amount in a civil suit. The remedies provided in this section are 
in addition to, and not exclusive of, other remedies that may be 
available by law or in equity.

    (a) The Board shall receive and evaluate, or on its own initiative 
develop, and submit to the Secretary for approval any plans or projects 
authorized in Secs. 1160.208 and 1160.209. Such plans or projects shall 
provide for:
    (1) The establishment, issuance, effectuation, and administration of 
consumer education, promotion and research activities with respect to 
fluid milk products; and
    (2) The evaluation of consumer education, promotion and research 
activities implemented under the direction of the Board, and the 
communication of such evaluation to fluid milk processors and the 
public.
    (b) The Board shall periodically review or evaluate each plan or 
project authorized under Sec. 1160.301(a) to ensure that it contributes 
to an effective program of promotion, consumer education and research. 
If the Board finds that any such plan or project does not further the 
purposes of the Act, the Board shall terminate that plan or project.
    (c) No plan or project authorized under Sec. 1160.301(a) may employ 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices with respect to the quality, value 
or use of any competing product.
    (d) No plan or project authorized under Sec. 1160.301(a) may make 
use of a brand or trade name of a fluid milk product, except that this 
paragraph does not preclude the Board from offering program material to 
commercial parties to use under such terms and conditions as the Board 
may prescribe, subject to approval by the Secretary.

prescribed in this subpart. The referendum agent may utilize such 
personnel or agencies of the Department as are deemed necessary by the 
Administrator. There shall be no voting except within the time specified 
by the referendum agent.
    (b) The referendum agent shall mail to each fluid milk processor 
that has properly registered to participate in the referendum:
    (1) A ballot containing a description of the question(s) upon which

<R05>
Sec. 1160.603  Who may vote.

representative period, as determined by the Secretary, and who at the 
time of voter registration and when voting is processing and marketing 
commercially fluid milk products in consumer-type packages in the United 
States shall be entitled to vote in a referendum, and no such person 
shall be refused a ballot. Any person casting more than one ballot with 
conflicting votes shall thereby invalidate all ballots cast by such 
person in such referendum. Each person voting shall have registered with 
the referendum agent prior to the voting period. Each ballot cast shall 
contain a certification by the person casting the ballot

[[Page 896]]

that such person is qualified to vote. All information required on the 
ballot pertinent to the identification of the person voting must be 
supplied and certified to as being correct in order for the ballot to be 
valid.
    (b) Voting by proxy or agent will not be permitted. However, the 
ballot of a fluid milk processor who is other than an individual may be 
cast by a person who is duly authorized to do so, and such ballot shall 
contain a certification by such person that the entity on whose behalf 
the ballot is cast was a fluid milk processor during the representative 
period. All information required on the ballot pertinent to the 
identification of the fluid milk processor on whose behalf the ballot is 
cast must be supplied and certified to as being correct in order for the 
ballot to be valid.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.604  Duties of the referendum agent.

    The referendum agent, in addition to any other duties imposed by 
this subpart, shall:
    (a) For the purpose of adjusting the rate of assessment, determine 
and publicly announce prior to the voting period the total volume of 
fluid milk products marketed by all processors of fluid milk in the 
United States during the representative period and the portion of such 
volume that must be represented by those fluid milk processors voting in 
favor of the question included on the ballot if the referendum question 
is to pass.
    (b)(1) Within 12 days after the deadline for registering to vote in 
the referendum, the referendum agent shall make available upon request a 
list of those fluid milk processors that properly registered. Any 
challenge of a processor's eligibility to vote must be received by the 
referendum agent within 17 days of the deadline for voter registration.
    (2) If the voting eligibility of any fluid milk processor is 
challenged within the timeframe specified in Sec. 1160.604(b)(1), the 
referendum agent shall review the challenge and make a final 
determination regarding the processor's eligibility to vote.
    (3) Prior to the time of mailing ballots to fluid milk processors, 
the referendum agent shall prepare a final list of eligible voters and 
make such list available upon request.
    (c) Verify the eligibility of all persons voting in the referendum 
by reviewing all ballots cast to assure that each ballot:
    (1) Was mailed within the prescribed time;
    (2) Contains all certifications required attesting to the 
eligibility of the person to vote, and that the person voting filed with 
the referendum agent prior to the voting period the advance registration 
required pursuant to Sec. 1160.606(a)(1); and
    (3) Was completed with respect to all necessary information 
pertinent to the identification of the person voting so that additional 
verification can be conducted by the referendum agent to substantiate 
the eligibility of each such person to vote.
    (d) Conduct further verification, as necessary, to determine the 
eligibility of each person to vote. Such verification may be completed 
by reviewing readily available sources of information, including the 
following:
    (1) Records of the Department;
    (2) Fluid milk processors' records; and
    (3) Any other reliable sources of information which may be available 
to the referendum agent.
    (e) Further verify ballots to avoid a duplication of votes. The 
following criteria shall serve as a guide:
    (1) Each fluid milk processor that is other than an individual shall 
be regarded as one person for voting purposes;
    (2) No more than one vote may be cast on behalf of any one fluid 
milk processor; and
    (3) In the event that more than one individual claim the right to 
vote and cast a ballot for a fluid milk processor, concurring votes of 
such individuals shall be treated as one vote while any conflicting 
votes shall thereby invalidate all ballots cast by such individuals.

other pertinent information; and
    (2) By such other means as the referendum agent may deem advisable.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.607  Tabulation of ballots.

    (a) The referendum agent shall verify the validity of all ballots 
cast in accordance with the instructions and requirements specified in

marked ``disqualified'' with a notation on the ballot as to the reason 
for the disqualification.
    (b) The total number of ballots cast, including the disqualified 
ballots, shall be ascertained. The number of ballots cast approving, the 
number of ballots cast disapproving, and the pounds of fluid milk 
products distributed during the representative period by the processors 
represented in each grouping of ballots, shall also be ascertained. The 
ballots marked ``disqualified'' shall not be considered as approving or 
disapproving, and the persons who cast such ballots shall not be 
regarded as participating in the referendum.
    (c) The referendum agent shall notify the Administrator of the 
number of ballots cast, the count of the votes, the number of 
disqualified ballots, and the volume of fluid milk products associated 
with the ballots cast as prescribed in Sec. 1160.607(b). The referendum 
agent shall seal the ballots and transmit to the Administrator a 
complete detailed report of all actions taken in connection with the 
referendum and all other information furnished to or compiled by the 
referendum agent.
    (d) Announcement of the results of the referendum will be made only 
at the direction of the Secretary. The referendum agent or others who 
assist in the referendum shall not disclose the results of the 
referendum or the total number of ballots and votes cast.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.608  Confidential information.

    The ballots cast, the identity of any person who voted, or the 
manner in which any person voted and all information furnished to, 
compiled by, or in the possession of the referendum agent,

[[Page 898]]

except the list of eligible voters, shall be regarded as confidential.


<R05>
Sec. 1160.609  Supplementary instructions.

    The Administrator is authorized to issue instructions and to 
prescribe forms and ballots, not inconsistent with the provisions of 
this subpart, to govern the conduct of referenda by referendum agents.
