                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2000, consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R04>
                         Subpart 1601--Planning


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to establish in regulations a process 
for the development, approval, maintenance, amendment and revision of 
resource management plans, and the use of existing plans for public 
lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-2  Objective.

    The objective of resource management planning by the Bureau of Land 
Management is to maximize resource values for the public through a 
rational, consistently applied set of regulations and procedures which 
promote the concept of multiple use management and ensure participation 
by the public, state and local governments, Indian tribes and 
appropriate Federal agencies. Resource management plans are designed to 
guide and control future management actions and the development of 
subsequent, more detailed and limited scope plans for resources and 
uses.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-3  Authority.

    These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 201 and 
202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 
1711-1712); the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 
1901); section 3 of the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976 (30 
U.S.C. 201(a)); sections 522, 601, and 714 of the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.); and the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-4  Responsibilities.

    (a) National level policy and procedure guidance for planning shall 
be

[[Page 12]]

provided by the Secretary and the Director.
    (b) State Directors shall provide quality control and supervisory 
review, including plan approval, for plans and related environmental 
impact statements and shall provide additional guidance, as necessary, 
for use by District and Area managers. State Directors shall file draft 
and final environmental impact statements associated with resource 
management plans and amendments.
    (c) Resource management plans, amendments, revisions and related 
environmental impact statements shall be prepared by District or Area 
Managers, and approved by State Directors. In general, Area Managers 
will be responsible for directly supervising the preparation of the 
plan, and the District Manager for providing general direction and 
guidance to the planning effort.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    (a) Areas of Critical Environmental Concern or ACEC means areas 
within the public lands where special management attention is required 
(when such areas are developed or used or where no development is 
required) to protect and prevent irreparable damage to important 
historic, cultural, or scenic values, fish and wildlife resources, or 
other natural systems or processes, or to protect life and safety from 
natural hazards. The identification of a potential ACEC shall not, of 
itself, change or prevent change of the management or use of public 
lands.
    (b) Conformity or conformance means that a resource management 
action shall be specifically provided for in the plan, or if not 
specifically mentioned, shall be clearly consistent with the terms, 
conditions, and decisions of the approved plan or plan amendment.
    (c) Consistent means that the Bureau of Land Management plans will 
adhere to the terms, conditions, and decisions of officially approved 
and adopted resource related plans, or in their absence, with policies 
and programs, subject to the qualifications in Sec. 1615.2 of this 
title.
    (d) Guidance means any type of written communication or instruction 
that transmits objectives, goals, constraints, or any other direction 
that helps the District and Area Managers and staff know how to prepare 
a specific resource management plan.
    (e) Local government means any political subdivision of the State 
and any general purpose unit of local government with resource planning, 
resource management, zoning, or land use regulation authority.
    (f) Multiple use means the management of the public lands and their 
various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination 
that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people; 
making the most judicious use of the lands for some or all of these 
resources or related services over areas large enough to provide 
sufficient latitude for periodic adjustments in use to conform to 
changing needs and conditions; the use of some lands for less than all 
of the resources; a combination of balanced and diverse resource uses 
that takes into account the long term needs of future generations for 
renewable and non-renewable resources, including, but not limited to, 
recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish, and 
natural scenic, scientific and historical values; and harmonious and 
coordinated management of the various resources without permanent 
impairment of the productivity of the lands and the quality of the 
environment with consideration being given to the relative values of the 
resources and not necessarily to the combination of uses that will give 
the greatest economic return or the greatest unit output.
    (g) Officially approved and adopted resource related plans means 
plans, policies, programs and processes prepared and approved pursuant 
to and in accordance with authorization provided by Federal, State or 
local constitutions, legislation, or charters which have the force and 
effect of State law.
    (h) Public means affected or interested individuals, including 
consumer organizations, public land resource users, corporations and 
other business entities, environmental organizations and other special 
interest groups and officials of State, local, and Indian tribal 
governments.

[[Page 13]]

    (i) Public lands means any lands or interest in lands owned by the 
United States and administered by the Secretary of the Interior through 
the Bureau of Land Management, except lands located on the Outer 
Continental Shelf and lands held for the benefit of Indians, Aleuts and 
Eskimos.
    (j) Resource area means a geographic portion of a Bureau of Land 
Management district. It is the administrative subdivision whose manager 
has primary responsibility for day-to-day resource management activities 
and resource use allocations and is, in most instances, the area for 
which resource management plans are prepared and maintained.
    (k) Resource management plan means a land use plan as described by 
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The resource management plan 
generally establishes in a written document:
    (1) Land areas for limited, restricted or exclusive use; 
designation, including ACEC designation; and transfer from Bureau of 
Land Management Administration;
    (2) Allowable resource uses (either singly or in combination) and 
related levels of production or use to be maintained;
    (3) Resource condition goals and objectives to be attained;
    (4) Program constraints and general management practices needed to 
achieve the above items;
    (5) Need for an area to be covered by more detailed and specific 
plans;
    (6) Support action, including such measures as resource protection, 
access development, realty action, cadastral survey, etc., as necessary 
to achieve the above;
    (7) General implementation sequences, where carrying out a planned 
action is dependent upon prior accomplishment of another planned action; 
and
    (8) Intervals and standards for monitoring and evaluating the plan 
to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the need for amendment or 
revision.

It is not a final implementation decision on actions which require 
further specific plans, process steps, or decisions under specific 
provisions of law and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-6  Environmental impact statement policy.

    Approval of a resource management plan is considered a major Federal 
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The 
environmental analysis of alternatives and the proposed plan shall be 
accomplished as part of the resource management planning process and, 
wherever possible, the proposed plan and related environmental impact 
statement shall be published in a single document.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-7  Scope.

    (a) These regulations apply to all public lands.
    (b) These regulations also govern the preparation of resource 
management plans when the only public land interest is the mineral 
estate.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.0-8  Principles.

    The development, approval, maintenance, amendment and revision of 
resource management plans will provide for public involvement and shall 
be consistent with the principles described in section 202 of the 
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Additionally, the impact 
on local economies and uses of adjacent or nearby non-Federal lands and 
on non-public land surface over federally-owned mineral interests shall 
be considered.


<R04>
               Subpart 1610--Resource Management Planning


<R05>
Sec. 1610.1  Resource management planning guidance.

    (a) Guidance for preparation and amendment of resource management 
plans may be provided by the Director and State Director, as needed, to 
help the District and Area Manager and staff prepare a specific plan. 
Such guidance may include the following:
    (1) National level policy which has been established through 
legislation, regulations, executive orders or other Presidential, 
Secretarial or Director approved documents. This policy may include 
appropriately developed resource management commitments, suct as a 
right-of-way corridor crossing

[[Page 14]]

several resource areas, which are not required to be reexamined as part 
of the planning process.
    (2) Analysis requirements, planning procedures and other written 
information and instructions required to be considered in the planning 
process.
    (3) Guidance developed at the State Director level, with necessary 
and appropriate governmental coordination as prescribed by Sec. 1610.3 
of this title. Such guidance shall be reconsidered by the State Director 
at any time during the planning process that the State Director level 
guidance is found, through public involvement or other means, to be 
inappropriate when applied to a specific area being planned.
    (b) A resource management plan shall be prepared and maintained on a 
resource area basis, unless the State Director authorizes a more 
appropriate area.
    (c) An interdisciplinary approach shall be used in the preparation, 
amendment and revision of resource management plans as provided in 40 
CFR 1502.6. The disciplines of the preparers shall be appropriate to the 
values involved and the issues identified during the issue 
identification and environmental impact statement scoping stage of the 
planning process. The District or Area Manager may use any necessary 
combination of Bureau of Land Management staff, consultants, 
contractors, other governmental personnel, and advisors to achieve an 
interdisciplinary approach.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.2  Public participation.

    (a) The public shall be provided opportunities to meaningfully 
participate in and comment on the preparation of plans, amendments and 
related guidance and be given early notice of planning activities. 
Public involvement in the resource management planning process shall 
conform to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and 
associated implementing regulations.
    (b) The Director shall, early in each fiscal year, publish a 
planning schedule advising the public of the status of each plan in 
process of preparation or to be started during that fiscal year, the 
major action on each plan during that fiscal year and projected new 
planning starts for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The notice shall call 
for public comments on projected new planning starts so that such 
comments can be considered in refining priorities for those years.
    (c) Upon starting the preparation, amendment or revision of resource 
management plans, public participation shall be initiated by a notice 
published in the Federal Register and appropriate media, including 
newspapers of general circulation in the State, adjoining States where 
the District Manager deems it appropriate, and the District. This notice 
may also constitute the scoping notice required by regulation for the 
National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.7). This notice shall 
include the following:
    (1) Description of the proposed planning action;
    (2) Identification of the geographic area for which the plan is to 
be prepared;
    (3) The general types of issues anticipated;
    (4) The disciplines to be represented and used to prepare the plan;
    (5) The kind and extent of public participation opportunities to be 
provided;
    (6) The times, dates and locations scheduled or anticipated for any 
public meetings, hearings, conferences or other gatherings, as known at 
the time;
    (7) The name, title, address and telephone number of the Bureau of 
Land Management official who may be contacted for further information; 
and
    (8) The location and availability of documents relevant to the 
planning process.
    (d) A list of individuals and groups known to be interested in or 
affected by a resource management plan shall be maintained by the 
District Manager and those on the list shall be notified of public 
participation activities. Individuals or groups may ask to be placed on 
this list. Public participation activities conducted by the Bureau of 
Land Management shall be documented by a record or summary of the 
principal issues discussed and comments made.

The documentation together with a list of attendees shall be available 
to the

[[Page 15]]

public and open for 30 days to any participant who wishes to clarify the 
views he/she expressed.
    (e) At least 15 days' public notice shall be given for public 
participation activities where the public is invited to attend. Any 
notice requesting written comments shall provide for at least 30 
calendar days for response. Ninety days shall be provided for review of 
the draft plan and draft environmental impact statement. The 90-day 
period shall begin when the Environmental Protection Agency publishes a 
notice of the filing of the draft environmental impact statement in the 
Federal Register.
    (f) Public notice and opportunity for participation in resource 
mangement plan preparation shall be appropriate to the areas and people 
involved and shall be provided at the following specific points in the 
planning process:
    (1) General notice at the outset of the process inviting 
participation in the identification of issues (See Secs. 1610.2(c) and 
1610.4-1);
    (2) Review of the proposed planning criteria (See Sec. 1610.4-2);
    (3) Publication of the draft resource management plan and draft 
environmental impact statement (See Sec. 1610.4-7);
    (4) Publication of the proposed resource management plan and final 
environmental impact statement which triggers the opportunity for 
protest (See Secs. 1610.4-8 and 1610.5-1(b)); and
    (5) Public notice and comment on any significant change made to the 
plan as a result of action on a protest (See Sec. 1610.5-1(b)).
    (g) Copies of an approved resource management plan and amendments 
shall be reasonably available for public review. This includes copies at 
the State Office for the District, the District Manager's Office, the 
Area Office for lands directly involved and additional locations 
determined by the District Manager. Plans, amendments and revisions 
shall be published and single copies shall be available to the public 
upon request during the public participation process. After approval, a 
fee may be charged for additional copies at a rate established by the 
Director.
    (h) Supporting documents to a resource management plan shall be 
available for public review at the office where the plan was prepared.
    (i) Fees for reproducing requested documents beyond those used as 
part of the public participation activities and other than single copies 
of the printed plan amendment or revision may be charged according to 
the Department of the Interior schedule for Freedom of Information Act 
requests in 43 CFR part 2.
    (j) When resource management plans involve areas of potential mining 
for coal by means other than underground mining, and the surface is 
privately owned, the Bureau of Land Management shall consult with all 
surface owners who meet the criteria in Sec. 3400.0-5 of this title. 
Contact shall be made in accordance with subpart 3427 of this title and 
shall provide time to fully consider surface owner views. This contact 
may be made by mail or in person by the District or Area Manager or his/
her appropriate representative. A period of at least 30 days from the 
time of contact shall be provided for surface owners to convey their 
preference to the Area or District Manager.
    (k) If the plan involves potential for coal leasing, a public 
hearing shall be provided prior to the approval of the plan, if 
requested by any person having an interest which is, or may be, 
adversely affected by implementation of such plan. The hearing shall be 
conducted as prescribed in Sec. 3420.1-5 of this title and may be 
combined with a regularly scheduled public meeting. The authorized 
officer conducting the hearing shall:
    (1) Publish a notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the affected geographical area at least once a week for 2 
consecutive weeks;
    (2) Provide an opportunity for testimony by anyone who so desires; 
and
    (3) Prepare a record of the proceedings of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.3  Coordination with other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.3-1  Coordination of planning efforts.

    (a) In addition to the public involvement prescribed by Sec. 1610.2 
of this title

[[Page 16]]

the following coordination is to be accomplished with other Federal 
agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes. The objectives 
of the coordination are for the State Directors and District and Area 
Managers to keep apprised of non-Bureau of Land Management plans; assure 
that consideration is given to those plans that are germane in the 
development of resource management plans for public lands; assist in 
resolving, to the extent practicable, inconsistencies between Federal 
and non-Federal government plans; and provide for meaningful public 
involvement of other Federal agencies, State and local government 
officials, both elected and appointed, and Indian tribes in the 
development of resource management plans, including early pubic notice 
of proposed decisions which may have a significant impact on non-Federal 
lands.
    (b) State Directors and District and Area Managers shall provide 
other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes 
opportunity for review, advice, and suggestion on issues and topics 
which may affect or influence other agency or other government programs. 
To facilitate coordination with State governments, State Directors 
should seek the policy advice of the Governor(s) on the timing, scope 
and coordination of plan components; definition of planning areas; 
scheduling of public involvement activities; and the multiple use 
opportunities and constraints on public lands. State Directors may seek 
written agreements with Governors or their designated representatives on 
processes and procedural topics such as exchanging information, 
providing advice and participation, and timeframes for receiving State 
government participation and review in a timely fashion. If an agreement 
is not reached, the State Director shall provide opportunity for 
Governor and State agency review, advice and suggestions on issues and 
topics that the State Director has reason to believe could affect or 
influence State government programs.
    (c) In developing guidance to District Managers, in compliance with 
section 1611 of this title, the State Director shall:
    (1) Ensure that it is as consistent as possible with existing 
officially adopted and approved resource related plans, policies or 
programs of other Federal agencies, State agencies, Indian tribes and 
local governments that may be affected, as prescribed by Sec. 1610.3-2 
of this title;
    (2) Identify areas where the proposed guidance is inconsistent with 
such policies, plans or programs and provide reasons why the 
inconsistencies exist and cannot be remedied; and
    (3) Notify the other Federal agencies, State agencies, Indian tribes 
or local governments with whom consistency is not achieved and indicate 
any appropriate methods, procedures, actions and/or programs which the 
State Director believes may lead to resolution of such inconsistencies.
    (d) A notice of intent to prepare, amend, or revise a resource 
management plan shall be submitted, consistent with State procedures for 
coordination of Federal activities, for circulation among State 
agencies. This notice shall also be submitted to Federal agencies, the 
heads of county boards, other local government units and Tribal Chairmen 
or Alaska Native Leaders that have requested such notices or that the 
responsible line manager has reason to believe would be concerned with 
the plan or amendment. These notices shall be issued simultaneously with 
the public notices required under Sec. 1610.2(b) of this title.
    (e) Federal agencies, State and local governments and Indian tribes 
shall have the time period prescribed under Sec. 1610.2 of this title 
for review and comment on resource management plan proposals. Should 
they notify the District or Area Manager, in writing, of what they 
believe to be specific inconsistencies between the Bureau of Land 
Management resource management plan and their officially approved and 
adopted resources related plans, the resource management plan 
documentation shall show how those inconsistencies were addressed and, 
if possible, resolved.
    (f) When an Advisory Council has been formed under section 309 of 
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act for the district in which the 
resource area is located, that council

[[Page 17]]

shall be informed and their views sought and considered throughout the 
resource management planning process.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.3-2  Consistency requirements.

    (a) Guidance and resource management plans and amendments to 
management framework plans shall be consistent with officially approved 
or adopted resource related plans, and the policies and programs 
contained therein, of other Federal agencies, State and local 
governments and Indian tribes, so long as the guidance and resource 
management plans are also consistent with the purposes, policies and 
programs of Federal laws and regulations applicable to public lands, 
including Federal and State pollution control laws as implemented by 
applicable Federal and State air, water, noise, and other pollution 
standards or implementation plans.
    (b) In the absence of officially approved or adopted resource-
related plans of other Federal agencies, State and local governments and 
Indian tribes, guidance and resource management plans shall, to the 
maximum extent practical, be consistent with officially approved and 
adopted resource related policies and programs of other Federal 
agencies, State and local governments and Indian tribes. Such 
consistency will be accomplished so long as the guidance and resource 
management plans are consistent with the policies, programs and 
provisions of Federal laws and regulations applicable to public lands, 
including, but not limited to, Federal and State pollution control laws 
as implemented by applicable Federal and State air, water, noise and 
other pollution standards or implementation plans.
    (c) State Directors and District and Area Managers shall, to the 
extent practicable, keep apprised of State and local governmental and 
Indian tribal policies, plans, and programs, but they shall not be 
accountable for ensuring consistency if they have not been notified, in 
writing, by State and local governments or Indian tribes of an apparent 
inconsistency.
    (d) Where State and local government policies, plans, and programs 
differ, those of the higher authority will normally be followed.
    (e) Prior to the approval of a proposed resource management plan, or 
amendment to a management framework plan or resource management plan, 
the State Director shall submit to the Governor of the State(s) 
involved, the proposed plan or amendment and shall identify any known 
inconsistencies with State or local plans, policies or programs. The 
Governor(s) shall have 60 days in which to identify inconsistencies and 
provide recommendations in writing to the State Director. If the 
Governor(s) does not respond within the 60-day period, the plan or 
amendment shall be presumed to be consistent. If the written 
recommendation(s) of the Governor(s) recommend changes in the proposed 
plan or amendment which were not raised during the public participation 
process on that plan or amendment, the State Director shall provide the 
public with an opportunity to comment on the recommendation(s). If the 
State Director does not accept the recommendations of the Governor(s), 
The State Director shall notify the Governor(s) and the Governor(s) 
shall have 30 days in which to submit a written appeal to the Director 
of the Bureau of Land Management. The Director shall accept the 
recommendations of the Governor(s) if he/she determines that they 
provide for a reasonable balance between the national interest and the 
State's interest. The Director shall communicate to the Governor(s) in 
writing and publish in the Federal Register the reasons for his/her 
determination to accept or reject such Governor's recommendations.

Sec. 1610.4  Resource management planning process.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-1  Identification of issues.

    At the outset of the planning process, the public, other Federal 
agencies, State and local governments and Indian tribes shall be given 
an opportunity to suggest concerns, needs, and resource use, development 
and protection opportunities for consideration in the preparation of the 
resource management plan. The District and Area Manager shall analyze 
those suggestions, plus available district records of

[[Page 18]]

resource conditions, trends, needs and problems, and select topics and 
determine the issues to be addressed during the planning process. Issues 
may be modified during the planning process to incorporate new 
information. The identification of issues shall also comply with the 
scoping process required by regulations implementing the National 
Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.7).


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-2  Development of planning criteria.

    The District or Area Manager shall prepare criteria to guide 
development of the resource management plan or revision, to ensure that 
it is tailored to the issues previously identified and to ensure that 
unnecessary data collection and analyses are avoided. Planning criteria 
shall generally be based upon applicable law, Director and State 
Director guidance, the results of public participation and coordination 
with other Federal agencies, State and local governments and Indian 
tribes. Proposed planning criteria, including any significant changes, 
shall be made available for public comment prior to being approved by 
the District manager for use in the planning process. Planning criteria 
may be changed as planning proceeds, based on public suggestions and the 
findings of the various studies and assessments.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-3  Inventory data and information collection.

    (a) The District or Area Manager shall arrange for resource, 
environmental, social, economic and institutional data and information 
to be collected, or assembled if already available. New information and 
inventory data collection will emphasize significant issues and 
decisions with the greatest potential impact. Inventory data and 
information shall be collected in a manner that aids application in the 
planning process, including subsequent monitoring requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-4  Analysis of the management situation.

    The District or Area Manager shall analyze the inventory data and 
other information available to determine the ability of the resource 
area to respond to identified issues and opportunities. The analysis of 
the management situation shall provide, consistent with multiple use 
principles, the basis for formulating reasonable alternatives, including 
the types of resources for development or protection. Factors to be 
considered may include, but are not limited to:
    (a) The types of resource use and protection authorized by the 
Federal Land Policy and Management Act and other relevant legislation;
    (b) Opportunities to meet goals and objectives defined in national 
and State Director guidance;
    (c) Resource demand forecasts and analyses relevant to the resource 
area;
    (d) The estimated sustained levels of the various goods, services 
and uses that may be attained under existing biological and physical 
conditions and under differing management practices and degrees of 
management intensity which are economically viable under benefit cost or 
cost effectiveness standards prescribed in national or State Director 
guidance;
    (e) Specific requirements and constraints to achieve consistency 
with policies, plans and programs of other Federal agencies, State and 
local government agencies and Indian tribes;
    (f) Opportunities to resolve public issues and management concerns;
    (g) Degree of local dependence on resources from public lands;
    (h) The extent of coal lands which may be further considered under 
provisions of Sec. 3420.2-3(a) of this title; and
    (i) Critical threshold levels which should be considered in the 
formulation of planned alternatives.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-5  Formulation of alternatives.

    All reasonable resource management alternatives shall be considered 
and several complete alternatives developed for detailed study. The 
alternatives developed shall reflect the variety of issues and guidance 
applicable to the resource uses. In order to limit the total number of 
alternatives analyzed in detail to a manageable number for presentation 
and analysis, all reasonable variations shall be treated as 
subalternatives. One alternative shall be

[[Page 19]]

for no action, which means continuation of present level or systems of 
resource use. The plan shall note any alternatives identified and 
eliminated from detailed study and shall briefly discuss the reasons for 
their elimination.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-6  Estimation of effects of alternatives.

    The District or Area Manager shall estimate and display the 
physical, biological, economic, and social effects of implementing each 
alternative considered in detail. The estimation of effects shall be 
guided by the planning criteria and procedures implementing the National 
Environmental Policy Act. The estimate may be stated in terms of 
probable ranges where effects cannot be precisely determined.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-7  Selection of preferred alternative.

    The District or Area Manager shall evaluate the alternatives and the 
estimation of their effects according to the planning criteria, and 
develop a preferred alternative which shall best meet Director and State 
Director guidance. The preferred alternative shall be incorporated into 
the draft resource management plan and draft environmental impact 
statement. The resulting draft resource management plan and draft 
environmental impact statement shall be forwarded to the State Director 
for approval, publication, and filing with the Environmental Protection 
Agency. This draft plan and environmental impact statement shall be 
provided for comment to the Governor of the State involved, and to 
officials of other Federal agencies, State and local governments and 
Indian tribes that the State Director has reason to believe would be 
concerned. This action shall constitute compliance with the requirements 
of Sec. 3420.1-7 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-8  Selection of resource management plan.

    After publication of the draft resource management plan and draft 
environmental impact statement, the District Manager shall evaluate the 
comments received and select and recommend to the State Director, for 
supervisory review and publication, a proposed resource management plan 
and final environmental impact statement. After supervisory review of 
the proposed resource management plan, the State Director shall publish 
the plan and file the related environmental impact statement.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.4-9  Monitoring and evaluation.

    The proposed plan shall establish intervals and standards, as 
appropriate, for monitoring and evaluation of the plan. Such intervals 
and standards shall be based on the sensitivity of the resource to the 
decisions involved and shall provide for evaluation to determine whether 
mitigation measures are satisfactory, whether there has been significant 
change in the related plans of other Federal agencies, State or local 
governments, or Indian tribes, or whether there is new data of 
significance to the plan. The District Manager shall be responsible for 
monitoring and evaluating the plan in accordance with the established 
intervals and standards and at other times as appropriate to determine 
whether there is sufficient cause to warrant amendment or revision of 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5  Resource management plan approval, use and modification.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5-1  Resource management plan approval and administrative review.

    (a) The proposed resource management plan or revision shall be 
submitted by the District Manager to the State Director for supervisory 
review and approval. When the review is completed the State Director 
shall either publish the proposed plan and file the related 
environmental impact statement or return the plan to the District 
Manager with a written statement of the problems to be resolved before 
the proposed plan can be published.
    (b) No earlier than 30 days after the Environmental Protection 
Agency publishes a notice of the filing of the final environmental 
impact statement in the Federal Register, and pending final action on 
any protest that may be filed, the State Director shall approve the 
plan. Approval shall be withheld on any portion of a plan or amendment 
being protested until final action has

[[Page 20]]

been completed on such protest. Before such approval is given, there 
shall be public notice and opportunity for public comment on any 
significant change made to the proposed plan. The approval shall be 
documented in a concise public record of the decision, meeting the 
requirements of regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (40 CFR 1505.2).


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5-2  Protest procedures.

    (a) Any person who participated in the planning process and has an 
interest which is or may be adversely affected by the approval or 
amendment of a resource management plan may protest such approval or 
amendment. A protest may raise only those issues which were submitted 
for the record during the planning process.
    (1) The protest shall be in writing and shall be filed with the 
Director. The protest shall be filed within 30 days of the date the 
Environmental Protection Agency published the notice of receipt of the 
final environmental impact statement containing the plan or amendment in 
the Federal Register. For an amendment not requiring the preparation of 
an environmental impact statement, the protest shall be filed within 30 
days of the publication of the notice of its effective date.
    (2) The protest shall contain:
    (i) The name, mailing address, telephone number and interest of the 
person filing the protest;
    (ii) A statement of the issue or issues being protested;
    (iii) A statement of the part or parts of the plan or amendment 
being protested;
    (iv) A copy of all documents addressing the issue or issues that 
were submitted during the planning process by the protesting party or an 
indication of the date the issue or issues were discussed for the 
record; and
    (v) A concise statement explaining why the State Director's decision 
is believed to be wrong.
    (3) The Director shall promptly render a decision on the protest. 
The decision shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for the 
decision. The decision shall be sent to the protesting party by 
certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (b) The decision of the Director shall be the final decision of the 
Department of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5-3  Conformity and implementation.

    (a) All future resource management authorizations and actions, as 
well as budget or other action proposals to higher levels in the Bureau 
of Land Management and Department, and subsequent more detailed or 
specific planning, shall conform to the approved plan.
    (b) After a plan is approved or amended, and if otherwise authorized 
by law, regulation, contract, permit, cooperative agreement or other 
instrument of occupancy and use, the District and Area Manager shall 
take appropriate measures, subject to valid existing rights, to make 
operations and activities under existing permits, contracts, cooperative 
agreements or other instruments for occupancy and use, conform to the 
approved plan or amendment within a reasonable period of time. Any 
person adversely affected by a specific action being proposed to 
implement some portion of a resource management plan or amendment may 
appeal such action pursuant to 43 CFR 4.400 at the time the action is 
proposed for implementation.
    (c) If a proposed action is not in conformance, and warrants further 
consideration before a plan revision is scheduled, such consideration 
shall be through a plan amendment in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1610.5-5 of this title.
    (d) More detailed and site specific plans for coal, oil shale and 
tar sand resources shall be prepared in accordance with specific 
regulations for those resources: Group 3400 of this title for coal; 
Group 3900 of this title for oil shale; and part 3140 of this title for 
tar sand. These activity plans shall be in conformance with land use 
plans prepared and approved under the provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5-4  Maintenance.

    Resource management plans and supporting components shall be 
maintained as necessary to reflect minor changes in data. Such 
maintenance is

[[Page 21]]

limited to further refining or documenting a previously approved 
decision incorporated in the plan. Maintenance shall not result in 
expansion in the scope of resource uses or restrictions, or change the 
terms, conditions, and decisions of the approved plan. Maintenance is 
not considered a plan amendment and shall not require the formal public 
involvement and interagency coordination process described under 
Secs. 1610.2 and 1610.3 of this title or the preparation of an 
environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. Maintenance 
shall be documented in plans and supporting records.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5-5  Amendment.

    A resource management plan may be changed through amendment. An 
amendment shall be initiated by the need to consider monitoring and 
evaluation findings, new data, new or revised policy, a change in 
circumstances or a proposed action that may result in a change in the 
scope of resource uses or a change in the terms, conditions and 
decisions of the approved plan. An amendment shall be made through an 
environmental assessment of the proposed change, or an environmental 
impact statement, if necessary, public involvement as prescribed in 
Sec. 1610.2 of this title, interagency coordination and consistency 
determination as prescribed in Sec. 1610.3 of this title and any other 
data or analysis that may be appropriate. In all cases, the effect of 
the amendment on the plan shall be evaluated. If the amendment is being 
considered in response to a specific proposal, the analysis required for 
the proposal and for the amendment may occur simultaneously.
    (a) If the environmental assessment does not disclose significant 
impact, a finding of no significant impact may be made by the District 
Manager. The District Manager shall then make a recommendation on the 
amendment to the State Director for approval, and upon approval, the 
District Manager shall issue a public notice of the action taken on the 
amendment. If the amendment is approved, it may be implemented 30 days 
after such notice.
    (b) If a decision is made to prepare an environmental impact 
statement, the amending process shall follow the same procedure required 
for the preparation and approval of the plan, but consideration shall be 
limited to that portion of the plan being considered for amendment. If 
several plans are being amended simultaneously, a single environmental 
impact statement may be prepared to cover all amendments.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5-6  Revision.

    A resource management plan shall be revised as necessary, based on 
monitoring and evaluation findings (Sec. 1610.4-9), new data, new or 
revised policy and changes in circumstances affecting the entire plan or 
major portions of the plan. Revisions shall comply with all of the 
requirements of these regulations for preparing and approving an 
original resource management plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.5-7  Situations where action can be taken based on another agency's plan, or a land use analysis.

    These regulations authorize the preparation of a resource management 
plan for whatever public land interests exist in a given land area. 
There are situations of mixed ownership where the public land estate is 
under non-Federal surface, or administration of the land is shared by 
the Bureau of Land Management with another Federal agency. The District 
and Area Manager may use the plans or the land use analysis of other 
agencies when split or shared estate conditions exist in any of the 
following situations:
    (a) Another agency's plan (Federal, State, or local) may be used as 
a basis for an action only if it is comprehensive and has considered the 
public land interest involved in a way comparable to the manner in which 
it would have been considered in a resource management plan, including 
the opportunity for public participation.
    (b) After evaluation and review, the Bureau of Land Management may 
adopt another agency's plan for continued use as a resource management 
plan if an agreement is reached between the Bureau of Land Management 
and the other agency to provide for maintenance and amendment of the 
plan, as necessary, to comply with law and policy applicable to public 
lands.

[[Page 22]]

    (c) A land use analysis may be used to consider a coal lease when 
there is no Federal ownership interest in the surface or when coal 
resources are insufficient to justify plan preparation costs. The land 
use analysis process, as authorized by the Federal Coal Leasing 
Amendments Act, consists of an environmental assessment or impact 
statement, public participation as required by Sec. 1610.2 of this 
title, the consultation and consistency determinations required by 
Sec. 1610.3 of this title, the protest procedure prescribed by 
Sec. 1610.5-2 of this title and a decision on the coal lease proposal. A 
land use analysis meets the planning requirements of section 202 of the 
Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The decision to approve the land 
use analysis and to lease coal is made by the Departmental official who 
has been delegated the authority to issue coal leases.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.6  Management decision review by Congress.

    The Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires that any Bureau 
of Land Management management decision or action pursuant to a 
management decision which totally eliminates one or more principal or 
major uses for 2 or more years with respect to a tract of 100,000 acres 
or more, shall be reported by the Secretary to Congress before it can be 
implemented. This report shall not be required prior to approval of a 
resource management plan which, if fully or partially implemented, would 
result in such an elimination. The required report shall be submitted as 
the first action step in implementing that portion of a resource 
management plan which would require elimination of such a use.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.7  Designation of areas.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.7-1  Designation of areas unsuitable for surface mining.

    (a)(1) The planning process is the chief process by which public 
land is reviewed to assess whether there are areas unsuitable for all or 
certain types of surface coal mining operations under section 522(b) of 
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The unsuitability 
criteria to be applied during the planning process are found in 
Sec. 3461.1 of this title.
    (2) When petitions to designate land unsuitable under section 522(c) 
of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act are referred to the 
Bureau of Land Management for comment, the resource management plan, or 
plan amendment if available, shall be the basis for review.
    (3) After a resource management plan or plan amendment is approved 
in which lands are assessed as unsuitable, the District Manager shall 
take all necessary steps to implement the results of the unsuitability 
review as it applies to all or certain types of coal mining.
    (b)(1) The resource management planning process is the chief process 
by which public lands are reviewed for designation as unsuitable for 
entry or leasing for mining operations for minerals and materials other 
than coal under section 601 of the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act.
    (2) When petitions to designate lands unsuitable under section 601 
of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act are received by the 
Bureau of Land Management, the resource management plan, if available, 
shall be the basis for determinations for designation.
    (3) After a resource management plan or plan amendment in which 
lands are designated unsuitable is approved, the District Manager shall 
take all necessary steps to implement the results of the unsuitability 
review as it applies to minerals or materials other than coal.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.7-2  Designation of areas of critical environmental concern.

    Areas having potential for Areas of Critical Environmental Concern 
(ACEC) designation and protection management shall be identified and 
considered throughout the resource management planning process (see 
Secs. 1610.4-1 through 1610.4-9).
    (a) The inventory data shall be analyzed to determine whether there 
are areas containing resources, values, systems or processes or hazards 
eligible

[[Page 23]]

for further consideration for designation as an ACEC. In order to be a 
potential ACEC, both of the following criteria shall be met:
    (1) Relevance. There shall be present a significant historic, 
cultural, or scenic value; a fish or wildlife resource or other natural 
system or process; or natural hazard.
    (2) Importance. The above described value, resource, system, 
process, or hazard shall have substantial significance and values. This 
generally requires qualities of more than local significance and special 
worth, consequence, meaning, distinctiveness, or cause for concern. A 
natural hazard can be important if it is a significant threat to human 
life or property.
    (b) The State Director, upon approval of a draft resource management 
plan, plan revision, or plan amendment involving ACECs, shall publish a 
notice in the Federal Register listing each ACEC proposed and specifying 
the resource use limitations, if any, which would occur if it were 
formally designated. The notice shall provide a 60-day period for public 
comment on the proposed ACEC designation. The approval of a resource 
management plan, plan revision, or plan amendment constitutes formal 
designation of any ACEC involved. The approved plan shall include the 
general management practices and uses, including mitigating measures, 
identified to protect designated ACEC.


<R05>
Sec. 1610.8  Transition period.

    (a) Until superseded by resource management plans, management 
framework plans may be the basis for considering proposed actions as 
follows:
    (1) The management framework plan shall be in compliance with the 
principle of multiple use and sustained yield and shall have been 
developed with public participation and governmental coordination, but 
not necessarily precisely as prescribed in Secs. 1610.2 and 1610.3 of 
this title.
    (2) No sooner than 30 days after the Environmental Protection Agency 
publishes a notice of the filing of a final court-ordered environmental 
impact statement--which is based on a management framework plan--
proposed actions may be initiated without any further analysis or 
processes included in this subpart.
    (3) For proposed actions other than those described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, determination shall be made by the District or 
Area Manager whether the proposed action is in conformance with the 
management framework plan. Such determination shall be in writing and 
shall explain the reasons for the determination.
    (i) If the proposed action is in conformance, it may be further 
considered for decision under procedures applicable to that type of 
action, including requirements of regulations for implementing the 
procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act in 40 CFR 
parts 1500-1508.
    (ii) If the proposed action is not in conformance with the 
management framework plan, and if the proposed action warrants further 
favorable consideration before a resource management plan is scheduled 
for preparation, such consideration shall be through a management 
framework plan amendment using the provisions of Sec. 1610.5-5 of this 
title.
    (b)(1) If an action is proposed where public lands are not covered 
by a management framework plan or a resource management plan, an 
environmental assessment and an environmental impact statement, if 
necessary, plus any other data and analysis necessary to make an 
informed decision, shall be used to assess the impacts of the proposal 
and to provide a basis for a decision on the proposal.
    (2) A land disposal action may be considered before a resource 
management plan is scheduled for preparation, through a planning 
analysis, using the process described in Sec. 1610.5-5 of this title for 
amending a plan.

                    Subpart 1784--Advisory Committees


<R05>
Sec. 1784.0-1  Purpose.

    This subpart contains standards and procedures for the creation, 
operation and termination of advisory committees to advise the Secretary 
of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management on matters relating to 
public lands and resources under the administrative jurisdiction of the 
Bureau of Land Management.


<R05>
Sec. 1784.0-2  Objectives.

    The objective of advisory committees established under these 
regulations is to make available to the Department of the Interior and 
Bureau of Land Management the expert counsel of concerned, knowledgeable 
citizens and public officials regarding both the formulation of 
operating guidelines and the preparation and execution of plans and 
programs for the use and management of public lands, their natural and 
cultural resources, and the environment.


<R05>
Sec. 1784.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix 1) 
requires establishment of a system governing advisory committees in the 
Executive Branch of the Federal Government and specifies policies, 
procedures, and responsibilities for committee creation, management and 
termination.
    (b) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), as amended by the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 
1978 (43 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), requires establishment of advisory 
councils representative of major citizen interests concerned with 
resource management planning or the management of public lands.
    (c) Section 2 of the Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950 (5 U.S.C. 
Appendix, as amended; 64 Stat. 1262), authorizes the Secretary of the 
Interior to make provisions deemed appropriate authorizing the 
performance by any other officer, or by any agency or employee or the 
Department of the Interior of any Departmental function. The 
establishment of advisory committees is deemed an appropriate action.

<R05>
Sec. 1784.0-6  Policy.

    As part of the Department's program for public participation, it is 
the policy of the Secretary to establish and employ committees 
representative of major citizens' interests, or where required by law, 
of special citizen interests, to advise the Secretary and Director 
regarding policy formulation, program planning, decisionmaking, 
attainment of program objectives, and achievement of improved program 
coordination and economies in the management of public lands and 
resources; to regularly ensure that such committees are being optimally

Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate 
and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States 
House of Representatives.
    (b) An advisory committee not specifically required by statute shall 
be established only when the Secretary has--

Sec. 1784.1-2  Duration, termination, and renewal.

    (a) An advisory committee not mandated by statute, i.e., established

rechartered by the Secretary and copies of the new charter are filed 
with the appropriate committees of the Senate and House of 
Representatives. Any committee so renewed shall continue for not more 
than 2 additional years unless, prior to expiration of such period, it 
is again rechartered.
    (b) Any advisory committee mandated by statute shall terminate not 
later than 2 years after the date of its establishment unless its

membership balance, both geographic and interest-specific, in terms of 
the functions to be performed and points of view to be represented, as 
prescribed by its charter. Each shall be formed with the objective of 
providing representative counsel and advice about public land and 
resource planning, retention, management and disposal. No person is to 
be denied an opportunity to serve because of race, age, sex, religion or 
national origin.
    (b) Individuals shall qualify to serve on an advisory committee 
because their education, training, or experience enables them to give

[[Page 26]]

the geographical area under the purview of the advisory committee; and 
they have demonstrated a commitment to collaborate in seeking solutions 
to resource management issues.

on advisory committees except--
    (1) Holders of grazing permits and leases may serve on advisory 
committees, including resource advisory councils, and may serve on 
subgroups of such advisory councils;
    (2) That the lack of candidates make them the only available 
candidates; or
    (3) When they have special knowledge or experience which is needed 
to accomplish the committee functions to be performed.

<R05>
Sec. 1784.3  Member service.

    (a) Appointments to advisory committees shall be for 2-year terms 
unless otherwise specified in the charter or the appointing document. 
Terms of service normally coincide with duration of the committee 
charter. Members may be appointed to additional terms at the discretion 
of the authorized appointing official.
    (1) The term of the member of a council who has been appointed on 
the basis of his status as an elected official of general purpose 
government serving the people of the geographical area for which the 
council is established shall end upon that person's departure from such 
elective office if such departure occurs before his or her term of 
appointment or reappointment to the council would otherwise expire. 
However, the Secretary, in his discretion, may permit the member to 
complete the term in another vacant position on the council, provided 
that the member is qualified to represent one of the other categories of 
major citizens' interests set forth in the charter of the council;
    (2) A vacancy occurring by reason of removal, resignation, death, or 
departure from elective office shall be filled for the balance of the 
vacating member's term using the same method by which the original 
appointment was made;
    (b) Committee members advise and report only to the official(s) 
specified in the charter. Service as an advisor, however, does not limit 
the rights of a member acting as a private citizen or as a member or 
official of another organization.
    (c) The Secretary or the designated Federal officer may, after 
written notice, terminate the service of an advisor if, in the judgment 
of the Secretary or the designated Federal officer, such removal is in 
the public interest, or if the advisor--
    (1) No longer meets the requirements under which elected or 
appointed;
    (2) Fails or is unable to participate regularly in committee work; 
or
    (3) Has violated Federal law or the regulations of the Secretary.
    (d) For purposes of compensation, members of advisory committees 
shall be reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses when on advisory 
committee business, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703. No reimbursement 
shall be made for expenses incurred by members of subgroups selected by

reimburse travel and

[[Page 27]]

per diem expenses to members of subgroups who are also members of the 
parent committee.

<R05>
Sec. 1784.6-2  Resource advisory councils--optional features.

    (a) Resource advisory councils must be established consistent with 
any 1 of the 3 models in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this

the Governors of the affected States and other interested parties.

                               (1) Model A

    (i) Council jurisdiction. The geographic jurisdiction of a council 
shall coincide with BLM District or ecoregion boundaries. The Governor 
of the affected States or existing resource advisory councils may 
petition the Secretary to establish a resource advisory council for a 
specified Bureau of Land Management resource area. The councils will 
provide advice to the Bureau of Land Management official to whom they 
report regarding the preparation, amendment and implementation of land 
use plans. The councils will also assist in establishing other long-
range plans and resource management priorities in an advisory capacity, 
including providing advice on the development of plans for range 
improvement or development programs.
    (ii) Membership. Each council shall have 15 members, distributed 
equally among the 3 interest groups specified in Sec. 1784.6-1(c).
    (iii) Quorum and voting requirements. At least 3 council members 
from each of the 3 categories of interest from which appointments are 
made pursuant to Sec. 1784.6-1(c) must be present to constitute an 
official meeting of the council. Formal recommendations shall require 
agreement of at least 3 council members from each of the 3 categories of 
interest from which appointments are made.
    (iv) Subgroups. Local rangeland resource teams may be formed within 
the geographical area for which a resource advisory council provides 
advice, down to the level of a single allotment. These teams may be 
formed by a resource advisory council on its own motion or in response 
to a petition by local citizens. Rangeland resource teams will be formed 
for the purpose of providing local level input to the resource advisory 
council regarding issues pertaining to the administration of grazing on 
public land within the area for which the rangeland resource team is 
formed.
    (A) Rangeland resource teams will consist of 5 members selected by 
the resource advisory council. Membership will include 2 persons holding 
Federal

[[Page 30]]

grazing permits or leases. Additional members will include 1 person 
representing the public-at-large, 1 person representing a nationally or 
regionally recognized environmental organization, and 1 person

interests. Persons selected by the council to represent the public-at-
large, environmental, and wildlife or recreation interests may not hold 
Federal grazing permits or leases. At least 1 member must be selected 
from the membership of the resource advisory council.
    (B) The resource advisory council will be required to select 
rangeland resource team members from nominees who qualify by virtue of 
their knowledge or experience of the lands, resources, and communities 
that fall within the area for which the team is formed. All nominations 
must be accompanied by letters of recommendation from the groups or 
interests to be represented.
    (C) All members of rangeland resource teams will attend a course of 
instruction in the management of rangeland ecosystems that has been

opportunities to raise any matter of concern with the resource advisory 
council and to request that BLM form a technical review team, as 
described below, to provide information and options to the council for 
their consideration.
    (D) Technical review teams can be formed by the BLM authorized 
officer on the motion of BLM or in response to a request by the resource 
advisory council or a rangeland resource team. The purpose of such teams 
is to gather and analyze data and develop recommendations to aid the 
decisionmaking process, and functions will be limited to tasks assigned 
by the authorized officer. Membership will be limited to Federal 
employees and paid consultants. Members will be selected based upon 
their knowledge of resource management or their familiarity with the 
specific issues for which the technical review team has been formed. 
Technical review teams will terminate upon completion of the assigned 
task.

                               (2) Model B

    (i) Council jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the council shall be 
Statewide, or on an ecoregion basis. The purpose of the council is to 
promote federal, state, and local cooperation in the management of 
natural resources on public lands, and to coordinate the development of 
sound resource management plans and activities with other states. It 
will provide an opportunity for meaningful public participation in land 
management decisions at the state level and will foster conflict 
resolution through open dialogue and collaboration.

council.
    (iii) Quorum and voting requirements. The charter of the council 
shall specify that 80% or 12 members must be present to constitute a 
quorum and conduct official business, and that 80% or 12 members of the 
council must vote affirmatively to refer an issue to BLM Federal 
officer.
    (iv) Subgroups. Local rangeland resource teams may be formed by the 
Statewide council, down to the level of a 4th order watershed. Rangeland 
resource teams will be formed for the purpose of providing local level 
input to the resource advisory council. They will meet at least 
quarterly and will promote a decentralized administrative approach, 
encourage good stewardship, emphasize coordination and cooperation among 
agencies, permittees and the interested public, develop proposed 
solutions and management plans for local resources on public lands, 
promote renewable rangeland resource values, develop proposed standards 
to address sustainable resource uses and rangeland health, address 
renewable rangeland resource values, propose and participate in the 
development of area-specific National Environmental Policy Act 
documents, and develop range and wildlife education and training 
programs. As with the resource advisory council, an 80% affirmative vote

[[Page 31]]

will be required to send a recommendation to the resource advisory 
council.
    (A) Rangeland resource teams will not exceed 10 members and will 
include at least 2 persons from environmental or wildlife groups, 2 
grazing permittees, 1 elected official, 1 game and fish district 
representative, 2 members of the public or other interest groups, and a 
Federal officer from BLM. Members will be appointed for 2 year terms by 
the resource advisory council and may be reappointed. No member may 
serve on more than 1 rangeland resource team.
    (B) Technical review teams can be formed by the BLM authorized 
officer on the motion of BLM or in response to a request by the resource 
advisory council or a rangeland resource team. The purpose of such teams 
is to gather and analyze data and develop recommendations to aid the 
decisionmaking process, and functions will be limited to tasks assigned 
by the authorized officer. Membership will be limited to Federal 
employees and paid consultants. Members will be selected based upon 
their knowledge of resource management or their familiarity with the 
specific issues for which the technical review team has been formed.

members, distributed in a balanced fashion among the 3 interest groups 
defined in Sec. 1784.6-1(c).
    (iii) Quorum and voting requirements. The charter of each council 
shall specify that a majority of each interest group must be present to 
constitute a quorum and conduct official business, and that a majority 
of each interest group must vote affirmatively to refer an issue to BLM 
Federal officer.
    (iv) Subgroups. Resource advisory councils may form more local teams 
to provide general local level input to the resource advisory council on 
issues necessary to the successful functioning of the council. Such 
subgroups can be formed in response to a petition from local citizens or 
on the motion of the resource advisory council. Membership in any 
subgroup formed for the purpose of providing general input to the 
resource advisory council on grazing administration should be 
constituted in accordance with provisions for membership in Sec. 1784.6-
1(c).
    (A) Technical review teams can be formed by the BLM authorized 
officer on the motion of BLM or in response to a request by the resource 
advisory council or a local team. The purpose of such technical review 
teams is to gather and analyze data and develop recommendations to aid 
the decisionmaking process, and functions will be limited to tasks 
assigned by the authorized officer. Membership will be limited to 
Federal employees and paid consultants. Members will be selected based 
upon their knowledge of resource management or their familiarity with 
the specific issues for which the technical review team has been formed. 
Technical review teams will terminate upon completion of the assigned 
task.

    Source: 35 FR 9513, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1810.1  Rules of construction; words and phrases.

    Except where the context of the regulation or of the Act of the 
Congress on which it is based, indicates otherwise, when used in the

also;
    (b) Words importing the plural include the singular;
    (c) Words importing the masculine gender include the feminine as 
well;
    (d) Words used in the present tense include the future as well as 
the present;
    (e) The words person and whoever include corporations, companies, 
associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, 
as well as individuals;
    (f) Officer and authorized officer include any person authorized by 
law or by lawful delegation of authority to perform the duties 
described;
    (g) Signature or subscription includes a mark when the person making 
the same intended it as such;
    (h) Oath includes affirmation, and sworn includes affirmed;
    (i) Writing includes printing and typewriting as well as holographs, 
and copies include all types of reproductions on paper, including 
photographs, multigraphs, mimeographs and manifolds;
    (j) The word company or association, when used in reference to a 
corporation, shall be deemed to embrace the words successors and assigns 
of such company or association, in like manner as if these last-named 
words, or words of similar import, were expressed.


<R05>
Sec. 1810.2  Communications by mail; when mailing requirements are met.

    (a) Where the regulations in this chapter provide for communication

deposited in the mail.
    (b) Where the authorized officer uses the mails to send a notice or 
other communication to any person entitled to such a communication under 
the regulations of this chapter, that person will be deemed to have 
received the communication if it was delivered to his last address of 
record in the appropriate office of the Bureau of Land Management, 
regardless of whether it was in fact received by him. An offer of 
delivery which cannot be consummated at such last address of record 
because the addressee had moved therefrom without leaving a forwarding 
address or because delivery was refused or because no such address 
exists will meet the requirements of this section where the attempt to 
deliver is substantiated by post office authorities.

<R05>
Sec. 1815.0-5  Definitions.

    Major disaster means any hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, high 
water, winddriven water, tidal wave, earthquake, drought, fire, or other 
catastrophe in any part of the United States, which, in the 
determination of the President, is or threatens to be of sufficient 
severity and magnitude to warrant disaster assistance by the Federal 
Government to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, 
local governments, and relief organizations in alleviating the damage, 
loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby, and with respect to which 
the Governor of any State in which such catastrophe occurs or threatens 
to occur certifies the need for Federal disaster assistance and gives 
assurance of the expenditure of a reasonable amount of the funds of such 
State, its local governments, or other agencies for alleviating the 
damage, loss, hardship or suffering resulting from such catastrophe.


<R05>
Sec. 1815.1  Timber sale contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1815.1-1  Relief granted.

    (a) Where an existing timber sale contract does not provide relief 
to the timber purchaser from major physical change, not due to 
negligence of the purchaser, prior to approval of construction of any 
section of specified road or other specified development facility and, 
as a result of a major disaster, a major physical change results in 
additional construction work in connection therewith, the United States 
will bear a share of the increased construction costs. The United 
States' share will be determined by the authorized officer as follows:
    (1) For sales of less than 1 million board feet, costs over $1,000;
    (2) For sales of from 1 to 3 million board feet, costs over the sum 
of $1 per thousand board feet;
    (3) For sales of over 3 million board feet, costs over $3,000.

reconstruction, or construction is not practical under this cost-sharing 
arrangement, he may cancel the timber sale contract notwithstanding any 
provisions thereof.

    You must file your application and any other required documents 
during regular office hours at the appropriate BLM office having

States Postal Service or other delivery service, except for those

a more specific regulation or law specifies the mode of delivery. The 
date of mailing is not the date of filing.


<R05>
Sec. 1822.12  Where do I file my application or other required documents?

    You should file your application or other required documents at the 
BLM office having jurisdiction over the lands or records involved. The 
specific BLM office where you are to file your application is usually 
referenced in the BLM regulations which pertain to the filing you are 
making. If the regulations do not name the specific office, or if you 
have questions as to where you should file your application or other 
required documents, contact your local BLM office for information and we 
will tell you which BLM office to file your application.


<R05>
Sec. 1822.13  May I file electronically?

    For certain types of applications, BLM will accept your electronic 
filing if an original signature is not required. If BLM requires your 
signature, you must file your application or document by delivery or by 
mailing. If you have any questions regarding which types of applications 
can be electronically filed, you should check with the BLM office where 
you intend to file your application. When you file an application 
electronically, it will not be considered filed until BLM receives it.


<R05>
Sec. 1822.14  What if I try to file a required document on the last day of the stated period for filing, but the BLM office where it is to be filed is 
          officially closed all day?

office on the next day it is officially open.

[[Page 36]]


<R05>
Sec. 1822.15  If I miss filing a required document or payment within the specified period, can BLM consider it timely filed anyway?

    BLM may consider it timely filed if:
    (a) The law does not prohibit BLM from doing so;
    (b) No other BLM regulation prohibits doing so; and
    (c) No intervening third party interests or rights have been created 
or established during the intervening period.


<R05>
Sec. 1822.16  Where do I file an application that involves lands under the jurisdiction of more than one BLM State Office?

    You may file your application with any BLM State Office having 
jurisdiction over the subject lands. You should consult the regulations 
of the particular BLM resource program involved for more specific 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1822.17  When are documents considered filed simultaneously?

    (a) BLM considers two or more documents simultaneously filed when:
    (1) They are received at the appropriate BLM office on the same day 
and time; or
    (2) They are filed in conjunction with an order that specifies that 
documents received by the appropriate office during a specified period 
of time will be considered as simultaneously filed.
    (b) An application or document that arrives at the BLM office where 
it is to be filed when the office is closed for the entire day will be 
considered as filed on the day and hour the office next officially 
opens.
    (c) Nothing in this provision will deny any preference right granted 
by applicable law or regulation or validate a document which is invalid 
under applicable law or regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1822.18  How does BLM decide in which order to accept documents that are simultaneously filed?

    BLM makes this decision by a drawing open to the public.


<R04>
                   Subpart 1823--Payments and Refunds


<R05>
Sec. 1823.10  How may I make my payments to BLM?

    Unless specific regulations provide otherwise, you may pay by:
    (a) United States currency; or
    (b) Checks, money orders, or bank drafts made payable to the Bureau 
of Land Management; or
    (c) Visa or Master Card credit charge, except as specified by 
pertinent regulation(s).


<R05>
Sec. 1823.11  What is the authority for BLM issuing a refund of a payment?

    BLM can issue you a refund under the authority of section 304(c) of 
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, 43 U.S.C. 1734.


<R05>
Sec. 1823.12  When and how may I obtain a refund?

    (a) In making a payment to BLM, if the funds or fees you submitted 
to BLM exceed the amount required or if the regulations provide that 
fees submitted to BLM must be returned in certain situations, you may be 
entitled to a full or partial refund.
    (b) If you believe you are due a refund, you may request it from the 
BLM office where you previously submitted your payment. You should state 
the reasons you believe you are entitled to a refund and include a copy 
of the appropriate receipt, canceled check, or other relevant documents.


<R05>
Sec. 1823.13  Is additional documentation needed when a third party requests a refund?

    Yes. When refund requests are made by heirs, executors, 
administrators, assignees, or mortgagees, BLM may require additional 
documentation sufficient to establish your entitlement to a refund. If 
you are an heir, executor, administrator, assignee or mortgagee, you 
should contact the BLM office where you will file your refund 
application for information regarding appropriate documentation.

[[Page 37]]


<R04>
            Subpart 1824--Publication and posting of notices


<R05>
Sec. 1824.10  What is publication?

    Publication means publishing a notice announcing an event or a 
proposed action in the Federal Register, a local newspaper of 
established character and general circulation in the vicinity of the 
land affected or other appropriate periodical. BLM's purpose in 
publishing or requiring the publication of such information is to advise 
you and other interested parties that some action will occur and that 
the public is invited either to participate or to comment.


<R05>
Sec. 1824.11  How does BLM choose a newspaper in which to publish a notice?

    BLM bases its choice of newspapers on their reputation and frequency 
and level of circulation in the vicinity of the public or private lands 
involved.


<R05>
Sec. 1824.12  How many times must BLM publish a notice?

    The number of times that BLM will publish or cause to be published a 
notice depends on the publication requirements for the particular action 
involved. You should see the applicable law and the regulations 
governing specific BLM resource programs for information on the 
requirements for publication for a particular action.


<R05>
Sec. 1824.13  Who pays for publication?

    The cost of publication is the responsibility of the claimant or 
applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 1824.14  Does the claimant or applicant pay for an error by the printer of the paper in which the notice appears?

    No. The claimant or applicant is not responsible for costs involved 
in correcting an error by the printer.


<R05>
Sec. 1824.15  What does it mean to post a notice?

    Posting a notice is similar to publishing a notice except that the 
notice is displayed at the appropriate BLM office, local courthouse or 
similar prominent local government building or on a prominent fixture 
such as a building, tree or post located on the particular public lands 
involved.


<R05>
Sec. 1824.16  Why must I post a notice?

    The posting of a notice informs those persons who may be interested 
in the lands or resources described, who have relevant information to 
provide, or who may wish to oppose the proposal.


<R05>
Sec. 1824.17  If I must post a notice on the land, what are the requirements?

    The posted notice must be visible throughout the time period for 
posting specified in the regulations governing the relevant program. BLM 
or its regulations may require additional posting, such as in a post 
office or city hall. For any additional posting requirements, you should 
see applicable Federal and State law, the regulations of the particular 
BLM resource program and any additional BLM requirements associated with 
your application.


<R04>
                      Subpart 1825--Relinquishments


<R05>
Sec. 1825.10  If I relinquish my interest (such as a claim or lease) in public lands, am I relieved of all further responsibility associated with that interest?

    No. You are still responsible for fulfilling any regulatory, 
statutory, lease, permit and other contractual obligations that apply, 
such as performance of reclamation and payment of rentals accruing 
before the time of relinquishment. You should see the regulations 
relating to the specific BLM resource program involved for more detailed 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1825.11  When are relinquishments effective?

    Generally, BLM considers a relinquishment to be effective when it is 
received, along with any required fee, in the BLM office having 
jurisdiction of the lands being relinquished. However, the specific 
program regulations govern effectiveness of relinquishments.


<R05>
Sec. 1825.12  When does relinquished land become available again for other application or appropriation?

    Relinquished land may not again become available until BLM notes the 
filed relinquishment of an interest on

[[Page 38]]

the land records maintained by the BLM office having jurisdiction over 
the lands involved. If you have any questions regarding the availability 
of a particular tract of land, you should contact the BLM office having 
jurisdiction over the lands or records.

<R04>
        Subpart 1864--Recordable Disclaimers of Interest in Land

    Source: 49 FR 35297, Sept. 6, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.0-1  Purpose.

    The Secretary of the Interior has been granted discretionary 
authority by section 315 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1745) to issue recordable disclaimers of interests in 
lands. In general, a disclaimer may be issued if the disclaimer will 
help remove a cloud on the title to lands and there is a determination 
that such lands are not lands of the United States or that the United 
States does not hold a valid interest in the lands. These regulations 
implement this statutory authority of the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.0-2  Objectives.

    (a) The objective of the disclaimer is to eliminate the necessity 
for court action or private legislation in those instances where the 
United States asserts no ownership or record interest, based upon a 
determination by the Secretary of the Interior that there is a cloud on 
the title to the lands, attributable to the United States, and that:
    (1) A record interest of the United States in lands has terminated 
by operation of law or is otherwise invalid; or
    (2) The lands lying between the meander line shown on a plat of 
survey approved by the Bureau of Land Management or its predecessors and 
the actual shoreline of a body of water are not lands of the United 
States; or
    (3) Accreted, relicted, or avulsed lands are not lands of the United 
States.
    (b) A disclaimer has the same effect as a quitclaim deed in that it 
operates to estop the United States from asserting a claim to an 
interest in or the ownership of lands that are being disclaimed. 
However, a disclaimer does not grant, convey, transfer, remise, 
quitclaim, release or renounce any title or interest in lands, nor does 
it operate to release or discharge any tax, judgement or other lien, or 
any other mortgage, deed or trust or other security interest in lands 
that are held by or for the benefit of the United States or any 
instrumentality of the United States.
    (c) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any disclaimer, 
release, quitclaim or other similar instrument or declaration, that may 
be issued pursuant to any provision of law other than section 315 of the 
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1745).


<R05>
Sec. 1864.0-3  Authority.

    Section 315 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 
(43 U.S.C. 1745), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue a 
recordable disclaimer, where the disclaimer will help remove a cloud on 
the title of such lands, if certain determinations are made and 
conditions are met.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management who has been delegated the authority to perform the duties 
described in this subpart.
    (b) Accreted lands have the meaning imparted to them by applicable 
law. In general, they are lands that have been gradually and 
imperceptibly formed along the banks of a body of water by deposition of 
water-borne soil.
    (c) Avulsed lands have the meaning imparted to them by applicable 
law. In general, they are lands that have been uncovered by a relatively 
sudden change in alignment of the channel of a river, or by a comparable 
change in

[[Page 40]]

some other body of water, or that remain as uplands following such a 
change, or that are located in the bed of the new channel.
    (d) Actual shoreline means the line which is washed by the water 
wherever it covers the bed of a body of water at its mean high water 
level.
    (e) Lands means lands and interests in lands now or formerly forming 
a part of the reserved or unreserved public lands of the contiguous 48 
States and Alaska and as to any coastal State, includes submerged lands 
inside of the seaward boundary of the State.
    (f) Meander line means a survey line established for the purpose of 
representing the location of the actual shoreline of a permanent natural 
body of water, without showing all the details of its windings and 
irregularities. A meander line rarely runs straight for any substantial 
distance. It is established not as a boundary line but in order to 
permit calculation of the quantity of lands in the fractional sections 
remaining after segregation of the water area.
    (g) Relicted lands have the meaning imparted that term by applicable 
law. In general, they are lands gradually uncovered when water recedes 
permanently.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.1  Application for issuance of a document of disclaimer.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.1-1  Filing of application.

    (a) Any present owner of record may file an application to have a 
disclaimer of interest issued if there is reason to believe that a cloud 
exists on the title to the lands as a result of a claim or potential 
claim by the United States and that such lands are not subject to any 
valid claim of the United States.
    (b) Prior to the acceptance for filing of an application under this 
subpart, the authorized officer should discuss the proposal with the 
proposed applicant to determine if the regulations in this subpart

survey, a metes and bounds survey (whenever practicable, tied to the 
nearest corner of an official public land survey), duly certified in 
accordance with State law, by the licensed civil engineer or surveyor 
who executed or supervised the execution of the metes and bounds survey. 
A true copy of the field notes and plat of survey shall be attached to 
and made a part of the application. If reliance is placed in whole or in 
part on an official United States public land survey, such survey shall 
be adequately identified for record retrieval purposes;
    (2) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number and 
the names addresses and telephone numbers of others known or believed to 
have or claim an interest in the lands;
    (3) All documents which show to the satisfaction of the authorized 
officer the applicant's title to the lands;
    (4) As complete a statement as possible concerning:
    (i) The nature and extent of the cloud on the title, and
    (ii) The reasons the applicant believes:
    (A) The record title interest of the United States in the lands 
included in the application has terminated by operation of law or is 
otherwise invalid, including a copy or legal citation of relevant 
provisions of law; or
    (B) The lands between the meander line shown on the plat of survey 
approved by the Bureau of Land Management or its predecessors and the 
actual shoreline of a body of water are not lands of the United States, 
including as documentation an official plat of survey or a reference to 
a date of filing or approval and, if the applicant elects, any non-
Federal survey plats related to the issue; or

[[Page 41]]

    (C) The lands are accreted, relicted or avulsed and are no longer 
lands of the United States, including submission for the uplands portion 
of the body of water affected a copy of an official plat of survey or a 
reference to it by date of filing or approval and, if the applicant 
elects, any non-Federal survey plats related to the issue;
    (5) Any available documents or title evidence, such as historical 
and current maps, photographs, and water movement data, that support the 
application;
    (6) The name, mailing address, and telephone number of any known 
adverse claimant or occupant of the lands included in the application;
    (7) Any request the applicant may have that the disclaimer be issued 
in a particular form suitable for use in the jurisdiction in which it 
will be recorded; and
    (d) Based on prior discussions with the applicant, the authorized 
officer may waive any or all of the aforementioned items if in his/her 
opinion they are not needed to properly adjudicate that application.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.1-3  Action on application.

    (a) An application shall be denied by the authorized officer if:
    (1) More than 12 years have elapsed since the owner knew or should 
have known of the alleged claim attributed to the United States;
    (2) The application pertains to a security interest or water rights; 
or
    (3) The application pertains to trust or restricted Indian lands;
    (b) The authorized officer shall, if the application meets the 
requirements for further processing, determine the amount of deposit 
needed to cover the administrative costs of processing the application 
and issuing a disclaimer.
    (c) The applicant shall submit a deposit in an amount determined by 
authorized officer.
    (d) If the application is concerned with what may be omitted lands, 
it shall be processed in accordance with the applicable provisions of 
part 9180 of this title. If the application is determined by the 
authorized officer to involve omitted lands, the applicant shall be so 
notified in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.1-4  Consultation with other Federal agencies.

    If the lands included in the application are under the 
administrative jurisdiction of a Federal agency other than the 
Department of the Interior or if the issuance of a disclaimer for the 
lands would, to the Bureau of Land Management's knowledge, directly 
affect another Federal agency, the authorized officer shall refer the 
application to that Federal agency for comment.


<R05>
Sec. 1864.2  Decision on application.

    (a) The authorized officer shall notify the applicant and any party 
adverse to the application, in writing, on the determination of the 
authorized officer on whether or not to issue a disclaimer. Prior to 
such notification, the authorized officer shall issue to the applicant a 
billing that includes a full and complete statement of the cost incurred 
in reaching such determination, including any sum due the United States 
or that may be unexpended from the deposit made by the applicant. If the 
administrative costs exceed the amount of the deposit required of the 
applicant under this subpart, the applicant shall be informed that a 
payment is required for the difference between the actual costs and the 
deposit. The notification shall also require that payment be made within 
120 days from the date of mailing of the notice. If the deposit exceeds 
the administrative costs of issuing the disclaimer, the applicant shall 
be informed that a credit for or a refund of the excess will be made. 
Failure to pay the required amount within the allotted time shall 
constitute grounds for rejection of the application. Before the 
authorized officer makes a determination to issue a disclaimer, he/she 
shall publish notice of the application, including the grounds 
supporting it, in the Federal Register. Publication in the Federal 
Register shall be made at least 90 days preceding the issuance of a 
decision on the disclaimer. Notice shall be published in a newspaper 
located in the vicinity of the lands covered by the application once a 
week for 3 consecutive weeks during the 90-day period set out herein. 
Neither publication shall be made until the applicant has paid the 
administrative costs.

[[Page 42]]

    Upon receipt of the payment required by Secs. 1864.1-2(b), 1864.1-
3(c) and 1864.2 of this title and following, by not less than 90 days, 
the publication required by Sec. 1864.2 of this title, the authorized 
officer shall make a decision upon the application, and if the 
application is allowed, shall issued to the applicant an instrument of 
disclaimer.

land owned or administered by a State or unit of general local 
government that was exempt from real estate taxes when the land was 
conveyed to the United States. However, a unit of general local 
government may receive a PILT payment for land when:
    (1) A State or unit of general local government acquires from a 
private party to donate to the United States within eight years of 
acquisition;
    (2) A State acquires through an exchange with the United States if 
the land acquired was entitlement land; or

Federal land, royalties or other assets if, at the time of acquisition, 
a unit of general local government was entitled to receive payments in 
lieu of taxes from the State of Utah for the land; provided that the 
payment to the local government does not exceed the payment the State 
would have disbursed if the land had not been acquired.

general local government; and
    (3) Certifies the amount of the payment disbursed to each unit of 
general local government.
    (b) The BLM disburses a payment each fiscal year to each unit of 
general local government containing entitlement lands.
    (c) The State of Alaska is required to distribute the payment it 
receives to home rule cities and general law cities (as such cities are 
defined by the State) that are located within the boundaries of the unit 
of general local government entitled to the payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.21  What information does BLM need to calculate these payments?

    (a) The BLM obtains the necessary data on Federal and State payments 
from several sources:
    (1) Federal agencies provide the amount of entitlement land within 
the boundaries of each unit of general local government as of the last 
day of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which BLM disburses 
the payment.
    (2) The Governor or designated official provides the amount of money 
transfers (land revenue sharing payments) disbursed by the State during 
the previous fiscal year to eligible units of general local government 
under the following payment laws listed under 31 U.S.C. 6903(a)(1):
    (i) The Act of June 20, 1910 (Arizona and New Mexico Enabling Acts) 
(ch. 310, 36 Stat 557);
    (ii) Section 33 of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. 
1012);

and Federal and State payments disbursed during the previous fiscal year 
to units of general local government under the land payment laws listed 
under 31 U.S.C. 6903(a)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 1881.22  Are there any special circumstances that affect the way BLM calculates PILT payments?

    If a unit of general local government eligible for payments under 
this subpart reorganizes, BLM will calculate payments for the fiscal 
year in which the reorganization occurred as if the reorganization had 
not occurred. BLM will disburse any payment due to each new unit based 
on the amount of eligible acreage in that unit.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.23  How does BLM certify payment computations?

    (a) The BLM will certify a computation for payment only after the 
Governor of the State or designated official in which the unit of 
general local government is located provides the BLM with:
    (1) A statement of the amount of all money transfers (land revenue 
sharing payments) that each entitled unit of general local government 
has received from the State during the previous fiscal year from 
revenues derived from the payment law(s) listed under 31 U.S.C. 
6903(a)(1);
    (2) A certification, in writing, signed by a State Auditor, an 
independent Certified Public Accountant or an independent public 
accountant that the statements furnished by the Governor or designated 
official have been audited in accordance with auditing standards

Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions, 
available through the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, and in accordance with the Audit

Interior, will provide appropriate assistance to the Director, BLM, 
under the provisions of sections 4 and 6 of the Inspector General Act of 
1978 (5 U.S.C. Appendix), to facilitate implementing and administering 
the audit requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (c) The Office of the Inspector General will:
    (1) Develop appropriate audit guides which State auditors, 
independent Certified Public Accountants or independent public 
accountants, must use to audit the statements of the Governors or their 
designated officials and to certify the audits; and
    (2) Furnish copies of the guides to the Governor or designated 
official each year. You should send questions on the use or application 
of this guide to the

[[Page 48]]

Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Interior, 
Washington, DC 20240.
    (d) The BLM may waive the requirement to certify audits if the 
General Accounting Office or the Office of the Inspector General 
verifies the information in statements the Governor or designated 
official furnishes or if BLM determines it is not necessary.

  Payments to Local Governments for Acquisitions or Interest in Lands 
  Acquired for Addition to the National Park System or National Forest 
                    Wilderness Areas (31 U.S.C. 6904)


<R05>
Sec. 1881.30  How does BLM process section 6904 payments?

    (a) The BLM disburses payments to qualified units of general local 
government provided that the administering agency supplies the following 
information for each qualified unit of general local government:
    (1) Acreage or interests in land for which the payments are 
authorized; and
    (2) Any other information BLM may require to certify payments to 
each qualified unit of general local government.
    (b) BLM only disburses payments for a period of five years from the 
date the land was conveyed to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.31  How does BLM calculate section 6904 payments?

    BLM calculates payments by determining 1% of the fair market value 
of the purchased land and comparing the result to the amount of real 
estate taxes paid on the land in the year prior to Federal acquisition. 
The payment to qualified units of general local government will be the 
lesser of the two.

   Payments to Local Governments for Interest in Lands in the Redwood 
           National Park or Lake Tahoe Basin (31 U.S.C. 6905)


<R05>
Sec. 1881.40  How does BLM process section 6905 payments?

    (a) The BLM disburses payments to qualified units of general local 
government provided the administering agency supplies the following 
information for each qualified unit of general local government:
    (1) Acreage or interests in land for which the payments are 
authorized; and
    (2) Any other information BLM may require to certify payments to 
each qualified unit of general local government.
    (b) BLM disburses payments until 5% of the fair market value is paid 
in full.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.41  How does BLM calculate section 6905 payments?

    (a) BLM calculates payments by determining 1% of the fair market 
value of the purchased land and comparing the result to the amount of 
real estate taxes paid on the land in the year prior to Federal 
acquisition. The payment to qualified units of general local government 
will be the lesser of the two.
    (b) BLM disburses payments annually for a period of five years 
beginning in the year immediately following the year of Federal 
acquisition of the land or interest. The difference, if any, between the 
amounts actually paid during each of the five years and 1% of the fair 
market value will be deferred to future years. However, a payment or any 
portion of a payment not paid because Congress appropriated insufficient 
monies will not be deferred. BLM will begin annual payment of the 
deferred amount (calculated the same as in paragraph (a) of this 
section) starting with the sixth fiscal year following Federal 
acquisition. BLM disburses payment of the deferred amount until the 
total amount deferred during the first five years is paid in full.

general local government and affected school districts. The affected 
units of general

[[Page 49]]

local government and school districts may use sections 6904 and 6905 
payments for any governmental purpose.
    (c) The local government must distribute sections 6904 and 6905 
payments in proportion to the tax revenues assessed and levied by the 
affected units of general local government and school districts in the 
Federal fiscal year before the Federal Government acquired the 
entitlement lands. The Redwoods Community College District in California 
is an affected school district for this purpose.
    (d) Within 120 days of receiving payments, the local government must 
certify to BLM that it has made an appropriate distribution of funds.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.51  Are there general procedures applicable to all PILT payments?

    (a) The minimum payment that the BLM will disburse to any unit of 
general local government is $100.00 (one hundred dollars).
    (b) If Congress appropriates insufficient monies to provide full 
payment to each unit of general local government during any fiscal year, 
the BLM will reduce proportionally all payments in that fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.52  May a State enact legislation to reallocate or redistribute PILT payments?

    A State may enact legislation to reallocate or redistribute PILT 
payments. If a State does enact legislation, it must:
    (a) Notify the BLM if it enacts legislation which requires 
reallocating or redistributing payments to smaller units of general 
local government (see 31 U.S.C. 6907);
    (b)Provide the BLM a copy of the legislation within 60 days of 
enactment;
    (c) provide the name and address of the State government office to 
which BLM should send the payment;
    (d) distribute to its smaller units of general local government 
within 30 days of receiving the payment; and
    (e) not reduce the payment made to smaller units of general local 
government to pay the cost of State legislation which reallocates or 
redistributes payments.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.53  What is BLM's procedure on PILT payments to a State that enacts distribution legislation?

    The BLM would:
    (a) Notify the State that a single payment will be disbursed to the 
designated State government office beginning with the Federal fiscal 
year following the fiscal year in which the State enacted legislation; 
and
    (b) Provide the State with appropriate information that identifies 
the entitlement lands data on which BLM bases the payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.54  What happens if a State repeals or amends distribution legislation?

    (a) The State must immediately notify the BLM in writing that it has 
repealed or amended the legislation and furnish BLM with a copy of the 
new law.
    (b) The BLM must:
    (1) Determine if the State's process complies with 31 U.S.C. 6907. 
If BLM determines that it does not, we must notify the designated State 
government office that BLM will disburse payment directly to eligible 
units of general local government; and
    (2) Start the payments with the Federal fiscal year in which the BLM 
receives a copy of the State's amendatory legislation. If BLM receives a 
copy of the legislation after July 1, payments made directly to eligible 
units of general local government will not begin until the next Federal 
fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.55  Can a unit of general local government protest the results of payment computations?

    Any affected unit of general local government may file a protest 
with the BLM.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.56  How does a unit of general local government file a protest?

    The protesting unit of general local government must:
    (a) Submit evidence to indicate the possibility of error(s) in the 
computations or the data on which BLM bases the computations; and
    (b) File the protest by the first business day of the calendar year 
following

[[Page 50]]

the end of the fiscal year for which BLM made the payments.


<R05>
Sec. 1881.57  Can a unit of general local government appeal a rejection of a protest?

    Any affected unit of general local government may appeal BLM's 
decision to reject a protest to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 
the provisions of 43 CFR part 4.

Sec. 2091.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management who has been delegated the authority to perform the duties 
described in this subpart.
    (b) Segregation means the removal for a limited period, subject to 
valid existing rights, of a specified area of the public lands from the 
operation of some or all of the public land laws, including the mineral 
laws, pursuant to the exercise by the Secretary of regulatory authority 
for the orderly administration of the public lands.
    (c) Land or public lands means any lands or interest in lands owned 
by the United States within the several States and administered by the 
Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management, without 
regard to how the United States acquired ownership, except: (1) Lands 
located on the Outer Continental Shelf; and (2) lands held for the 
benefit of Indians, Aleuts and Eskimos.
    (d) Mineral laws means those laws applicable to the mineral 
resources administered by the Bureau of Land Management. They include, 
but are not limited to, the mining laws, the mineral leasing laws, the 
material disposal laws and the Geothermal Steam Act.
    (e) Public lands records means the Tract Books, Master Title Plats 
and Historical Indices maintained by the Bureau of Land Management, or 
automated representation of these books, plats and indices on which are 
recorded information relating to the status and availability of the 
public lands. The recorded information may include, but is not limited 
to, withdrawals, restorations, reservations, openings, classifications 
applications, segregations, leases, permits and disposals.
    (f) Opening means the restoration of a specified area of public 
lands to operation of the public land laws, including the mining laws, 
and, if appropriate, the mineral leasing laws, the material disposal 
laws and the Geothermal Steam Act, subject to valid existing rights and 
the terms and provisions of existing withdrawals, reservations, 
classifications, and management decisions. Depending on the language in 
the opening order, an opening may restore the lands to the operation of 
all or some of the public land laws.
    (g) Opening order means an order issued by the Secretary or the 
authorized officer and published in the Federal Register that describes 
the lands, the extent to which they are restored to operation of the 
public land laws and the mineral laws, and the date and time they are 
available for application, selection, sale, location, entry, claim or 
settlement under those laws.
    (h) Public land laws means that body of laws dealing with the 
administration, use and disposition of the public lands, but does not 
include the mineral laws.
    (i) Revocation means the cancellation of a Public Land Order, but 
does not restore public lands to operation of the public land laws.
    (j) Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or a secretarial 
officer subordinate to the Secretary who has been appointed by the 
President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and to whom has 
been delegated the authority of the Secretary to perform the duties 
described in this part as being performed by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 2091.07  Principles.

    (a) Generally, segregated lands are not available for application, 
selection, sale, location, entry, claim or settlement under the public 
land laws, including the mining laws, but may be open to the operation 
of the discretionary mineral leasing laws, the material disposal laws 
and the Geothermal Steam Act, if so specified in the document that 
segregates the lands. The segregation is subject to valid existing

[[Page 55]]

rights and is, in most cases, for a limited period which is specified in 
regulations or in the document that segregates the lands. Where there is 
an administrative appeal or review action on an application pursuant to 
part 4 or other subparts of this title, the segregative period continues 
in effect until publication of an opening order.
    (b) Opening orders may be issued at any time but are required when 
the opening date is not specified in the document creating the 
segregation, or when an action is taken to terminate the segregative 
effect and open the lands prior to the specified opening date.


<R05>
Sec. 2091.1  Action on applications and mining claims.

    (a) Except where the law and regulations provide otherwise, all 
applications shall be accepted for filing. However, applications which 
are accepted for filing shall be rejected and cannot be held pending 
possible future availability of the lands or interests in lands, except 
those that apply to selections made by the State of Alaska under section 
906(e) of the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act and 
selections made by Alaska Native Corporations under section 3(e) of the 
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, when approval of the application is 
prevented by:
    (1) A withdrawal, reservation, classification, or management 
decision applicable to the lands;
    (2) An allowed entry or selection of lands;
    (3) A lease which grants the lessee exclusive use of the lands;
    (4) Classifications existing under appropriate law:
    (5) Segregation due to an application previously filed under 
appropriate law and regulations;
    (6) Segregation resulting from a notice of realty action previously 
published in the Federal Register under appropriate regulations; and
    (7) The fact that, for any reason, the lands have not been made 
subject to, restored or opened to operation of the public land laws, 
including the mineral laws.
    (b) Lands may not be appropriated under the mining laws prior to the 
date and time of restoration and opening. Any such attempted 
appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 
38, vests no rights against the United States. Actions required to 
establish a mining claim location and to initiate a right of possession 
are governed by State laws where those laws are not in conflict with 
Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management does not intervene in 
disputes between rival locators over possessory rights because Congress 
has provided for the resolution of these matters in local courts.


<R05>
Sec. 2091.2  Segregation and opening resulting from publication of a Notice of Realty Action.


<R05>
Sec. 2091.2-1  Segregation.

    (c) The filing of an application and publication of the notice of 
the filing of an application in the Federal Register for the purchase of 
Federally-owned mineral interests under section 209 of the Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1719) segregates the lands 
for a period of 2 years from the date of the publication of the notice 
of filing of the application with the authorized officer. (See part 
2720)

publication in the Federal Register of an opening order specifying the 
date and time of opening.
    (c) Upon conveyance of public lands under section 206 of the Federal 
Land Policy and Management Act, mineral interests reserved by the United

the Acts of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. 1028) and August 3, 1955 (69 Stat. 
444; 48 U.S.C. 371) provides that no entry shall be allowed extending 
more than 160 rods along the shore of any navigable water. Section 10 of 
the Act of May 14, 1898, as amended by the Acts of March 3, 1927 (44 
Stat. 1364), May 26, 1934 (48 Stat. 809), and August 3, 1955 (69 Stat.

<R05>
Sec. 2094.1  Methods of measuring; restrictions.

    (a) In the consideration of applications to enter lands shown upon 
plats of public surveys in Alaska, as abutting upon navigable waters, 
the restriction as to length of claims shall be determined as follows: 
The length of the water front of a subdivision will be considered as 
represented by the longest straight-line distance between the shore 
corners of the tract, measured along lines parallel to the boundaries of 
the subdivision; and the sum of the distances of each subdivision of the 
application abutting on the water, so determined, shall be considered as 
the total shore length of the application. Where, so measured, the 
excess of shore length is greater than the deficiency would be if an end 
tract or tracts were eliminated, such tract or tracts shall be excluded, 
otherwise the application may be allowed if in other respects proper.
    (b) The same method of measuring shore space will be used in the 
case of special surveys, where legal subdivisions of the public lands 
are not involved.
    (c) The following sketch shows the method of measuring the length of

Sec. 2094.2  Waiver of 160-rod limitation.

    (a) The Act of June 5, 1920 (41 Stat. 1059; 48 U.S.C. 372) provides 
that the Secretary of the Interior in his discretion, may upon 
application to enter or otherwise, waive the restriction that no entry 
shall be allowed extending more than 160 rods along the shore of any 
navigable waters as to such lands as he shall determine are not 
necessary for harborage, landing, and wharf purposes. The act does not 
authorize the waiver of the 80-rod restriction, mentioned in 
Sec. 2094.0-3.
    (b) Except as to trade and manufacturing sites, and home and 
headquarters sites, any applications to enter and notices of settlement 
which cover lands extending more than 160 rods along the shore of any 
navigable water will be considered as a petition for waiver of the 160-
rod limitation mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, provided that 
it is accompanied by a showing that the lands are not necessary for 
harborage, landing and wharf purposes and that the public interests will 
not be injured by waiver of the limitation.

Sec. 2200.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Adjustment to relative values means compensation for exchange-

differential.
    (n) Market value means the most probable price in cash, or terms 
equivalent to cash, that lands or interests in lands should bring in a 
competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair 
sale, where the buyer and seller each acts prudently and knowledgeably, 
and the price is not affected by undue influence.
    (o) Mineral laws means the mining laws, mineral leasing laws, and

[[Page 63]]


<R05>
Sec. 2200.0-6  Policy.

    (a) Discretionary nature of exchanges. The Secretary is not required 
to exchange any Federal lands. Land exchanges are discretionary, 
voluntary real estate transactions between the Federal and non-Federal 
parties. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding exchange 
agreement, any party may withdraw from and terminate an exchange 
proposal or an agreement to initiate an exchange at any time during the 
exchange process, without any obligation to reimburse, or incur any 
liability to, any party, person or other entity.
    (b) Determination of public interest. The authorized officer may 
complete an exchange only after a determination is made that the public 
interest will be well served. When considering the public interest, the 
authorized officer shall give full consideration to the opportunity to 
achieve better management of Federal lands, to meet the needs of State 
and local residents and their economies, and to secure important 
objectives, including but not limited to: Protection of fish and 
wildlife habitats, cultural resources, watersheds, wilderness and 
aesthetic values; enhancement of recreation opportunities and public 
access; consolidation of lands and/or interests in lands, such as 
mineral and timber interests, for more logical and efficient management 
and development; consolidation of split estates; expansion of 
communities; accommodation of land use authorizations; promotion of 
multiple-use values; and fulfillment of public needs. In making this 
determination, the authorized officer must find that:
    (1) The resource values and the public objectives that the Federal 
lands or interests to be conveyed may serve if retained in Federal 
ownership are not more than the resource values of the non-Federal lands 
or interests and the public objectives they could serve if acquired, and
    (2) The intended use of the conveyed Federal lands will not, in the 
determination of the authorized officer, significantly conflict with 
established management objectives on adjacent Federal lands and Indian 
trust lands. Such finding and the supporting rationale shall be made 
part of the administrative record.
    (c) Equal value exchanges. Except as provided in Sec. 2201.5 of this 
part, lands or interests to be exchanged shall be of equal value or 
equalized in accordance with the methods set forth in Sec. 2201.6 of 
this part. An exchange of lands or interests shall be based on market 
value as determined by the Secretary through appraisal(s), through 
bargaining based on appraisal(s), or through arbitration.
    (d) Same-State exchanges. The Federal and non-Federal lands involved 
in an exchange authorized pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976, as amended, shall be located within the same 
State.
    (e) O and C land exchanges. Non-Federal lands acquired in exchange 
for revested Oregon and California Railroad Company Grant lands or 
reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant lands are required to be located 
within any one of the 18 counties in which the original grants were 
made, and, upon acquisition by the United States, automatically shall 
assume the same status as the lands for which they were exchanged.
    (f) Congressional designations. Upon acceptance of title by the 
United States, lands acquired by an exchange that are within the 
boundaries of any unit of the National Forest System, National Park 
System, National Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers 
System, National Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation System, 
or any other system established by Act of Congress; the California 
Desert Conservation Area; or any national conservation or national 
recreation area established by Act of Congress, immediately are reserved 
for and become part of the unit or area within which they are located, 
without further action by the Secretary, and thereafter shall be managed 
in accordance with all laws, rules, regulations, and land use plans 
applicable to such unit or area.
    (g) Land and resource management planning. The authorized officer 
shall consider only those exchange proposals that are in conformance 
with land use

[[Page 64]]

plans or plan amendments, where applicable. Lands acquired by an 
exchange within a Bureau of Land Management district shall automatically 
become public lands as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1702 and shall become part 
of that district. The acquired lands shall be managed in accordance with 
existing regulations and provisions of applicable land use plans and 
plan amendments. Lands acquired by an exchange that are located within 
the boundaries of areas of critical environmental concern or any other 
area having an administrative designation established through the land 
use planning process shall automatically become part of the unit or area 
within which they are located, without further action by the Bureau of 
Land Management, and shall be managed in accordance with all laws, 
rules, regulations, and land use plans applicable to such unit or area.
    (h) Environmental analysis. After an agreement to initiate an 
exchange is signed, an environmental analysis shall be conducted by the 
authorized officer in accordance with the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4371), the Council on Environmental Quality 
regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and the environmental policies and 
procedures of the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land 
Management. In making this analysis, the authorized officer shall 
consider timely written comments received in response to the published 
exchange notice, pursuant to Sec. 2201.2 of this part.
    (i) Reservations or restrictions in the public interest. In any 
exchange, the authorized officer shall reserve such rights or retain 
such interests as are needed to protect the public interest or shall 
otherwise restrict the use of Federal lands to be exchanged, as 
appropriate. The use or development of lands conveyed out of Federal 
ownership are subject to any restrictions imposed by the conveyance 
documents and all laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of State and 
local governing bodies.
    (j) Hazardous substances--(1) Federal lands. The authorized officer 
shall determine whether hazardous substances may be present on the 
Federal lands involved in an exchange and shall provide notice of known 
storage, release, or disposal of hazardous substances on the Federal 
lands to the other parties in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 
part 373. The authorized officer shall provide this notice in the 
exchange agreement. The authorized officer shall also provide such 
notice, to the extent information is readily available, in the agreement 
to initiate an exchange. Unless the non-Federal party is a potentially 
responsible party under 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), the conveyance document from 
the United States shall contain a covenant in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 
9620(h)(3). Where the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible 
party with respect to the property, it may be appropriate to enter into 
an agreement, as referenced in 42 U.S.C. 9607(e), whereby that party 
would indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless 
against any loss or cleanup costs after conveyance.
    (2) Non-Federal lands. The non-Federal party shall notify the 
authorized officer of any known, suspected and/or reasonably 
ascertainable storage, release, or disposal of hazardous substances on 
the non-Federal land pursuant to Sec. 2201.1 of this part. 
Notwithstanding such notice, the authorized officer shall determine 
whether hazardous substances are known to be present on the non-Federal 
land involved in an exchange. If hazardous substances are known or 
believed to be present on the non-Federal land, the authorized officer 
shall reach an agreement with the non-Federal party regarding the 
responsibility for appropriate response action concerning the hazardous 
substances before completing the exchange. The terms of this agreement 
and any appropriate ``hold harmless'' agreement shall be included in an 
exchange agreement, pursuant to Sec. 2201.7-2 of this part.
    (k) Legal description of properties. All lands subject to an 
exchange shall be properly described on the basis of either a survey 
executed in accordance with the Public Land Survey System laws and 
standards of the United States or, if those laws and standards cannot be 
applied, the lands shall be properly described and clearly locatable by 
other means as may be prescribed or allowed by law.

[[Page 65]]

    (l) Unsurveyed school sections. For purposes of exchange only, 
unsurveyed school sections, which would become State lands upon survey 
by the Secretary, are considered as ``non-Federal'' lands and may be 
used by the State in an exchange with the United States. However, 
minerals shall not be reserved by the State when unsurveyed sections are 
used in an exchange. As a condition of the exchange, the State shall 
have waived, in writing, all rights to unsurveyed sections used in the 
exchange.
    (m) Coordination with State and local governments. At least 60 days 
prior to the conveyance of and upon issuance of the deed or patent for 
Federal lands, the authorized officer will notify the Governor of the 
State within which the Federal lands covered by the notice are located 
and the head of the governing body of any political subdivision having 
zoning or other land use regulatory authority in the geographical area 
within which the Federal lands are located.
    (n) Fee coal exchanges. As part of the consideration of whether 
public interest would be served by the acquisition of fee coal through 
exchange, the provisions of subpart 3461 of this title shall be applied 
and shall be evaluated as a factor and basis for the exchange.


<R05>
Sec. 2200.0-7  Scope.

    (a) These rules set forth the procedures for conducting exchanges of 
Federal lands. The procedures in these rules are supplemented by the 
Bureau of Land Management Manuals and Handbooks 2200 and 9310. The 
contents of these supplemental materials are not considered to be a part 
of these rules.
    (b) The rules contained in this part apply to all land exchanges, 
made under the authority of the Secretary, involving Federal lands, as 
defined in 43 CFR 2200.0-5(i). Apart from the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., 
there are a variety of statutes, administered by the Secretary, that 
authorize land trades which may include Federal lands, as for example, 
certain National Wildlife Refuge System and National Park System 
exchange acts. The procedures and requirements associated with or 
imposed by any one of these other statutes may not be entirely 
consistent with the rules in this part, as the rules in this part are 
intended primarily to implement the FLPMA land exchange provisions. If 
there is any such inconsistency, and if Federal lands are involved, the 
inconsistent procedures or statutory requirements will prevail. 
Otherwise, the regulations in this part will be followed. The rules in 
this part also apply to the exchange of interests in either Federal or 
non-Federal lands including, but not limited to, minerals, water rights, 
and timber.
    (c) The application of these rules to exchanges made under the 
authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 
U.S.C. 1621) or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 
U.S.C. 3192), shall be limited to those provisions that do not conflict 
with the provisions of these Acts.
    (d) Pending exchanges initiated prior to December 17, 1993 shall 
proceed in accordance with this rule unless:
    (1) In the judgment of the authorized officer, it would be more 
expeditious to continue following the procedures in effect prior to 
December 17, 1993; or
    (2) A binding agreement to exchange was in effect prior to December 
17, 1993; and
    (3) To proceed as provided in paragraphs (d) (1) or (2) of this 
section would not be inconsistent with applicable law.
    (e) Exchanges proposed by persons holding fee title to coal deposits 
that qualify for exchanges under the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1260(b)(5)) and as provided in 
subpart 3436 of this title shall be processed in accordance with this 
part, except as otherwise provided in subpart 3436 of this title.

Sec. 2200.0-9  Information collection.

    (a) The collection of information contained in part 2200 of Group 
2200 has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1004-0056. The 
information will be used

[[Page 66]]

to initiate and complete land exchanges with the Bureau of Land 
Management. Responses are required to obtain benefits in accordance with 
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended.
    (b) Public reporting burden for this information is estimated to 
average 4 hours per response, including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
information. Comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect 
of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing 
the burden, should be sent to the Division of Information Resources 
Management (870), Bureau of Land Management, 1849 C Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20240; and the Paperwork Reduction Project (1004-0056), 
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.


<R04>
             Subpart 2201--Exchanges--Specific Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 2201.1  Agreement to initiate an exchange.

    (a) Exchanges may be proposed by the Bureau of Land Management or by 
any person, State, or local government. Initial exchange proposals 
should be directed to the authorized officer responsible for the 
management of Federal lands involved in an exchange.
    (b) To assess the feasibility of an exchange proposal, the 
prospective parties may agree to obtain a preliminary estimate of the 
values of the lands involved in the proposal. The preliminary estimate 
is generally not an appraisal but shall be prepared by a qualified 
appraiser.
    (c) If the authorized officer agrees to proceed with an exchange 
proposal, a nonbinding agreement to initiate an exchange shall be 
executed by all prospective parties. At a minimum, the agreement shall 
include:
    (1) The identity of the parties involved in the proposed exchange 
and the status of their ownership or ability to provide title to the 
land;
    (2) A description of the lands or interest in lands being considered 
for exchange;
    (3) A statement by each party, other than the United States and 
State and local governments, certifying that the party is a citizen of 
the United States or a corporation or other legal entity subject to the 
laws of the United States or a State thereof;
    (4) A description of the appurtenant rights proposed to be exchanged 
or reserved; any authorized uses including grants, permits, easements, 
or leases; and any known unauthorized uses, outstanding interests, 
exceptions, adverse claims, covenants, restrictions, title defects or 
encumbrances;
    (5) A time schedule for completing the proposed exchange;
    (6) An assignment of responsibility for performance of required 
functions and for costs associated with processing the exchange;
    (7) A statement specifying whether compensation for costs assumed 
will be allowed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 2201.1-3 of this 
part;
    (8) Notice of any known release, storage, or disposal of hazardous 
substances on involved Federal or non-Federal lands, and any commitments 
regarding responsibility for removal or other remedial actions 
concerning such substances on involved non-Federal lands. All such terms 
and conditions regarding non-Federal lands shall be included in a land 
exchange agreement pursuant to Sec. 2201.7-2 of this part;
    (9) A grant of permission by each party to conduct a physical 
examination of the lands offered by the other party;
    (10) The terms of any assembled land exchange arrangement, pursuant 
to Sec. 2201.1-1 of this part;
    (11) A statement as to any arrangements for relocation of any 
tenants occupying non-Federal land, pursuant to Sec. 2201.8 (c)(1)(iv) 
of this part;
    (12) A notice to an owner-occupant of the voluntary basis for the 
acquisition of the non-Federal lands, pursuant to Sec. 2201.8 (c)(1)(iv) 
of this part; and
    (13) A statement as to the manner in which documents of conveyance 
will be exchanged, should the exchange proposal be successfully 
completed.
    (d) Unless the parties agree to some other schedule, no later than 
90 days

[[Page 67]]

from the date of the executed agreement to initiate an exchange, the 
parties shall arrange for appraisals, which are to be completed within 
timeframes and under such terms as are negotiated. In the absence of 
current market information reliably supporting value, the parties may 
agree to use other acceptable and commonly recognized methods to 
estimate value.
    (e) An agreement to initiate an exchange may be amended by written 
consent of the parties or terminated at any time upon written notice by 
any party.
    (f) Entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange does not 
legally bind any party to proceed with processing or to consummate a 
proposed exchange, or to reimburse or pay damages to any party to a 
proposed exchange that is delayed or is not consummated or to anyone 
assisting in any way, or doing business with, any such party.
    (g) The withdrawal from, and termination of, an exchange proposal, 
or an agreement to initiate an exchange, by the authorized officer at 
any time prior to the notice of decision, pursuant to Sec. 2201.7-1 of 
this part, is not protestable or appealable under 43 CFR part 4.


<R05>
Sec. 2201.1-1  Assembled land exchanges.

    (a) Whenever the authorized officer determines it to be practicable, 
an assembled land exchange arrangement may be used to facilitate 
exchanges and reduce costs.
    (b) The parties to an exchange may agree to such an arrangement 
where multiple parcels of Federal and/or non-Federal lands are 
consolidated into a package for the purpose of completing one or more 
exchange transactions over a period of time.
    (c) An assembled land exchange arrangement shall be documented in 
the agreement to initiate an exchange, pursuant to Sec. 2201.1 of this 
part.
    (d) Values of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an 
assembled exchange arrangement shall be estimated pursuant to 
Sec. 2201.3 of this part.
    (e) If more than one transaction is necessary to complete the 
exchange package, the parties shall establish a ledger account under 
which the Federal and non-Federal lands can be exchanged. When a ledger 
account is used, the authorized officer shall:
    (1) Assure that the value difference between the Federal and non-
Federal lands does not exceed 25 percent of the total value of the 
Federal lands conveyed in the assembled land exchange up to and 
including the current transaction;
    (2) Assure that the values of the Federal and non-Federal lands 
conveyed are balanced with land and/or money at least every 3 years 
pursuant to Sec. 2201.6 of this part; and
    (3) If necessary, require from the non-Federal party a deposit of 
cash, bond or other approved surety in an amount equal to any 
outstanding value differential.
    (4) Assembled land exchanges are subject to the value equalization 
and cash equalization waiver provisions of Sec. 2201.6 of this part. 
Cash equalization waiver shall only be used in conjunction with the 
final transaction of the assembled land exchange and the termination of 
any ledger account used.
    (f) The assembled exchange arrangement may be terminated 
unilaterally at any time upon written notice by any party or upon 
depletion of the Federal or non-Federal lands assembled. Prior to 
termination, values shall be equalized pursuant to Sec. 2201.6 of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 2201.1-2  Segregative effect.

    (a) If a proposal is made to exchange Federal lands, the authorized 
officer may direct the appropriate State Office of the Bureau of Land 
Management to segregate the Federal lands by a notation on the public 
land records. Subject to valid existing rights, the Federal lands shall 
be segregated from appropriation under the public land laws and mineral 
laws for a period not to exceed 5 years from the date of record 
notation.
    (b) Any interests of the United States in the non-Federal lands that 
are covered by the exchange proposal may be segregated from 
appropriation under the mineral laws for a period not to exceed 5 years 
from the date of notation by noting the public land status records.
    (c) The segregative effect shall terminate upon the occurrence of 
any of the

costs ordinarily borne under local custom or practice by the non-Federal 
party or to compensate the non-Federal party for costs ordinarily borne

valuation is used, an analysis and reconciliation of the methods used to 
support the appraiser's estimate of value;
    (g) A description of comparable sales, including a description of 
all relevant physical, legal, and economic factors such as parties to 
the transaction, source and method of financing, effect of any favorable

<R05>
Sec. 2201.4  Bargaining; arbitration.

    (a) Unless the parties to an exchange agree in writing to suspend or 
modify the deadlines contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of 
this section, the parties shall adhere to the following schedule:
    (1) Within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) for 
review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an 
exchange may agree on the appraised values of the lands involved in an 
exchange. If the parties cannot agree on the appraised values, they may 
agree to initiate a process of bargaining or some other process to 
resolve the dispute over values. Bargaining or any other process shall 
be based on an objective analysis of the valuation in the appraisal 
report(s) and shall be a means of reconciling differences in such 
reports. Bargaining or another process to determine values may involve 
one or more of the following actions:
    (i) Submission of the disputed appraisal(s) to another qualified 
appraiser for review;
    (ii) Request for additional appraisals;
    (iii) Involvement of an impartial third party to facilitate 
resolution of the value disputes; or
    (iv) Use of some other acceptable and commonly recognized practice 
for resolving value disputes.

Any agreement based upon bargaining shall be in writing and made part of 
the administrative record of the exchange. Such agreement shall contain 
a reference to all relevant appraisal information and state how the 
parties reconciled or compromised appraisal information to arrive at an 
agreement based on market value.

    (2) If within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) 
for review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an 
exchange cannot agree on values but wish to continue with the land 
exchange, the appraisal(s) may, at the option of either party, be 
submitted to arbitration unless, in lieu of arbitration, the parties 
have employed a process of bargaining or some other process to determine 
values. If arbitration occurs, it shall be conducted in accordance with 
the real estate valuation arbitration rules of the American Arbitration 
Association. The Secretary or an official to whom such authority has 
been delegated shall appoint an arbitrator from a list provided by the 
American Arbitration Association.
    (3) Within 30 days after completion of arbitration, the parties 
involved in the exchange shall determine whether to proceed with the 
exchange, modify the exchange to reflect the findings of the arbitration 
or any other factors, or withdraw from the exchange. A decision to 
withdraw from the exchange may be made upon written notice by either 
party at this time or at any other time prior to entering into a binding 
exchange agreement.
    (4) If the parties agree to proceed with an exchange after 
arbitration, the values established by arbitration are binding upon all 
parties for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date of the 
arbitration decision.
    (b) Arbitration is limited to the disputed valuation of the lands 
involved

[[Page 72]]

in a proposed exchange, and an arbitrator's award decision shall be 
limited to the value estimate(s) of the contested appraisal(s). An award 
decision shall not include recommendations regarding the terms of a 
proposed exchange, nor shall an award decision infringe upon the 
authority of the Secretary to make all decisions regarding management of 
Federal lands and to make public interest determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 2201.5  Exchanges at approximately equal value.

is not more than $150,000 as based upon a statement of value prepared by 
a qualified appraiser and approved by the authorized officer;

location, acreage, use, and physical attributes; and
    (4) There are no significant elements of value requiring complex 
analysis.
    (b) The authorized officer shall determine that the Federal and non-
Federal lands are approximately equal in value and shall document how 
the determination was made.

Sec. 2201.6  Value equalization; cash equalization waiver.

    (a) To equalize the agreed upon values of the Federal and non-
Federal lands involved in an exchange, either with or without 
adjustments of relative values as compensation for various costs, the 
parties to an exchange may agree:
    (1) To modify the exchange proposal by adding or excluding lands; 
and/or
    (2) To use cash equalization after making all reasonable efforts to 
equalize values by adding or excluding lands.
    (b) The combined amount of any cash equalization payment and/or the 
amount of adjustments agreed to as compensation for costs under 
Sec. 2201.1-3 of this part may not exceed 25 percent of the value of the 
Federal lands to be conveyed.
    (c) The parties may agree to waive a cash equalization payment if 
the amount to be waived does not exceed 3 percent of the value of the 
lands being exchanged out of Federal ownership or $15,000, whichever is 
less. This provision shall not be applied to exchanges where the value 
differential is in excess of $15,000.
    (d) A cash equalization payment may be waived only after the 
authorized officer determines in writing how the waiver will expedite 
the exchange and why the public interest will be better served by the 
waiver.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 2201.7-1  Notice of decision.

<R05>
Sec. 2201.8  Title standards.

    (a) Title evidence. (1) Unless otherwise specified by the Office of 
the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, evidence of title for 
the non-Federal lands being conveyed to the United States shall be in 
conformance with the Department of Justice regulations and ``Standards 
for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United 
States'' in effect at the time of conveyance.
    (2) The United States is not required to furnish title evidence for 
the Federal lands being exchanged.
    (b) Conveyance documents. (1) Unless otherwise specified by the 
Office of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, all 
conveyances to the United States shall be prepared, executed, and 
acknowledged in recordable form and in accordance with the Department of 
Justice regulations and ``Standards for the Preparation of Title 
Evidence in Land Acquisition by the United States'' in effect at the 
time of conveyance.
    (2) Conveyances of lands from the United States shall be by patent, 
quitclaim deed, or deed without express or implied warranties, except as 
to hazardous substances pursuant to Sec. 2200.0-6(j)(1) of this title.
    (c) Title encumbrances--(1) Non-Federal lands. (i) Title to the non-
Federal lands must be acceptable to the United States. For example, 
encumbrances such as taxes, judgment liens, mortgages, and other 
objections or title defects shall be eliminated, released, or waived in 
accordance with requirements of the preliminary title opinion of the 
Office of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior or the 
Department of Justice, as appropriate.

[[Page 74]]

    (ii) The United States shall not accept lands in which there are 
reserved or outstanding interests that would interfere with the use and 
management of land by the United States or would otherwise be 
inconsistent with the authority under which, or the purpose for which, 
the lands are to be acquired. Reserved interests of the non-Federal 
landowner are subject to agreed upon covenants or conditions included in 
the conveyance documents.
    (iii) Any personal property owned by the non-Federal party that is 
not a part of the exchange proposal should be removed by the non-Federal 
party prior to acceptance of title by the United States, unless the 
authorized officer and the non-Federal party to the exchange previously 
agree upon a specified period to remove the personal property. If the 
personal property is not removed prior to acceptance of title or within 
the otherwise prescribed time, it shall be deemed abandoned and shall 
become vested in the United States.
    (iv) The exchange parties must reach agreement on the arrangements 
for the relocation of any tenants. Qualified tenants occupying non-
Federal lands affected by a land exchange may be entitled to benefits 
under 49 CFR 24.2. Unless otherwise provided by law or regulation (49 
CFR 24.101(a)(1)), relocation benefits are not applicable to owner-
occupants involved in exchanges with the United States provided the 
owner-occupants are notified in writing that the non-Federal lands are 
being acquired by the United States on a voluntary basis.
    (2) Federal lands. If Federal lands proposed for exchange are 
occupied under grant, permit, easement, or non-mineral lease by a third 
party who is not a party to the exchange, the third party holder of such 
authorization and the non-Federal party to the exchange may reach 
agreement as to the disposition of the existing use(s) authorized under 
the terms of the grant, permit, easement, or lease. The non-Federal 
exchange party shall submit documented proof of such agreement prior to 
issuance of a decision to approve the land exchange, as instructed by 
the authorized officer. If an agreement cannot be reached, the 
authorized officer shall consider other alternatives to accommodate the 
authorized use or shall determine whether the public interest will be 
best served by terminating such use in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of the instrument authorizing the use.


<R05>
Sec. 2201.9  Case closing.

    (a) Title transfers. Unless otherwise agreed, and notwithstanding 
the decision in United States v. Schurz, 102 U.S. 378 (1880), or any 
other law or ruling to the contrary, title to both the non-Federal and 
Federal lands simultaneously shall pass and be deemed accepted by the 
United States and the non-Federal landowner, respectively, when the 
documents of conveyance are recorded in the county clerk's or other 
local recorder's office. Before recordation, all instructions, 
requirements, and conditions set forth by the United States and the non-
Federal landowner shall be met. The requirements and conditions 
necessary for recordation at a minimum will include the following, as 
appropriate:
    (1) The determination by the authorized officer that the United 
States will receive possession, acceptable to it, of such lands; and
    (2) The issuance of title evidence as of the date and time of 
recordation, which conforms to the instructions and requirements of the 
Office of the Solicitor's preliminary title opinion.
    (b) Automatic segregation of lands. Subject to valid existing 
rights, non-Federal lands acquired through exchange by the United States 
automatically shall be segregated from appropriation under the public 
land laws and mineral laws until midnight of the 90th day after 
acceptance of title by the United States, and the public land records 
shall be noted accordingly. Except to the extent otherwise provided by 
law, the lands shall be open to the operation of the public land laws 
and mineral laws at midnight 90 days after the day title was accepted 
unless otherwise segregated pursuant to part 2300 of this title.
    (c) Notice to State and local governments. Following the transfer of 
title to the Federal lands involved in an exchange, notice will be given 
to State

                   Subpart 2300--Withdrawals, General


<R05>
Sec. 2300.0-1  Purpose.

    (a) These regulations set forth procedures implementing the 
Secretary of the Interior's authority to process Federal land withdrawal 
applications and, where appropriate, to make, modify or extend Federal 
land withdrawals. Procedures for making emergency withdrawals are also 
included.
    (b) The regulations do not apply to withdrawals that are made by the 
Secretary of the Interior pursuant to an act of Congress which directs 
the issuance of an order by the Secretary. Likewise, procedures 
applicable to withdrawals authorized under the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1272(b); 1281), and procedures 
relating to the Secretary's authority to establish Indian reservations 
or to add lands to the reservations pursuant to special legislation or 
in accordance with section 7 of the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 
467), as supplemented by section 1 of the Act of May 1, 1936 (25 U.S.C. 
473a), are not included in these regulations.
    (c) General procedures relating to the processing of revocation of 
withdrawals and relating to the relinquishment of reserved Federal land 
areas are not included in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 2300.0-3  Authority.

    (a)(1) Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976 (43 U.S.C. 1714) gives the Secretary of the Interior general 
authority to make, modify, extend or revoke withdrawals, but only in 
accordance with the provisions and limitations of that section. Among 
other limitations, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 
provides that the Secretary of the Interior does not have authority to:
    (i) Make, modify or revoke any withdrawal created by an Act of 
Congress;
    (ii) Make a withdrawal which can be made only by an Act of Congress;
    (iii) Modify or revoke any withdrawal creating national monuments 
under the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431-433), sometimes referred to 
as the Antiquities Act;
    (iv) Modify or revoke any withdrawal which added lands to the 
National Wildlife Refuge System prior to October 21, 1976, the date of 
approval of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 or which 
thereafter adds lands to that System under the terms of that Act. In 
this connection, nothing in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
of 1976 is intended to modify or change any provision of the Act of 
February 27, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 668 dd(a)).
    (2) Executive Order 10355 of May 26, 1952 (17 FR 4831), confers on 
the Secretary of the Interior all of the delegable authority of the 
President to make, modify and revoke withdrawals and reservations with 
respect to lands of the public domain and other lands owned and 
controlled by the United States in the continental United States or 
Alaska.
    (3) The Act of February 28, 1958 (43 U.S.C. 155-158), sometimes 
referred to as the Engle Act, places on the Secretary of the Interior 
the responsibility to process Department of Defense applications for 
national defense withdrawals, reservations or restrictions aggregating 
5,000 acres or more for any one project or facility. These withdrawals, 
reservations or restrictions may only be made by an act of Congress, 
except in time of war or national emergency declared by the President or 
the Congress and except as otherwise expressly provided in the Act of 
February 28, 1958.
    (4) Section 302(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976 (43 U.S.C. 1732(b)) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to 
regulate the management of the public lands as defined in the Act 
through instruments, such as memorandum of understanding, which the 
Secretary deems appropriate.
    (5) Section 1326(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands 
Conservation Act (Pub. L. 96-487), authorizes the President and the 
Secretary to make withdrawals exceeding 5,000 acres, in the aggregate, 
in the State of Alaska subject to the provisions that such withdrawals 
shall not become effective until notice is provided in the Federal 
Register and to both Houses of the Congress and such withdrawals shall 
terminate unless Congress passes a Joint Resolution of approval within

[[Page 78]]

one year after the notice of withdrawal has been submitted to the 
Congress.
    (b) The following references do not afford either withdrawal 
application processing or withdrawal authority but are provided as 
background information.
    (1) Executive Order 6910 of November 26, 1934, and E.O. 6964 of 
February 5, 1935, as modified, withdrew sizable portions of the public 
lands for classification and conservation. These lands and the grazing 
districts estalished under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, as amended, 
are subject to the classification and opening procedures of section 7 of 
the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934, as amended (43 U.S.C. 315f); 
however, they are not closed to the operation of the mining or mineral 
leasing laws unless separately withdrawn or reserved, classified for 
retention from disposal, or precluded from mineral leasing or mining 
location under other authority.
    (2) The Classification and Multiple Use Act of September 19, 1964 
(43 U.S.C. 1411-1418), authorized the Secretary of the Interior through 
the Bureau of Land Management for retention or disposal under Federal 
ownership and management. Numerous classification decisions based upon 
this statutory authority were made by the Secretary of the Interior. For 
the effect of these classification with regard to the disposal and 
leasing laws of the United States, see subparts 2440 and 2461 of this 
title.
    (3) Section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976 (43 U.S.C. 1712) provides for land use planning and resultant 
management decisions which may operate to totally eliminate a particular 
land use, including one or more principal or major uses, as defined in 
the Act. Withdrawals made pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act of 1976 may be used in appropriate cases, to 
carry out management decisions, except that public lands, as defined in 
the Act, can be removed from or restored to the operation of the Mining 
Law of 1872, as amended, or transferred to another department, agency or 
office, only by withdrawal action pursuant to section 204 of the Federal 
Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 or other action pursuant to 
applicable law.
    (4) The first proviso of section 302(b) of the Federal Land Policy 
and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1732(b)) provides, in part, that 
unless otherwise provided for by law, the Secretary of the Interior may 
permit Federal departments and agencies to use, occupy and develop 
public lands only through rights-of-way under section 507 of the Act (43 
U.S.C. 1767); withdrawals under section 204 of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714); 
and, where the proposed use and development are similar or closely 
related to the programs of the Secretary for the public lands involved, 
cooperative agreements under section 307(b) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 
1737(b)).
    (5) Section 701(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 note) provides that all withdrawals, reservations, 
classifications and designations in effect on October 21, 1976, the 
effective date of the Act, shall remain in full force and effect until 
modified under the provisions of the Act or other applicable law.

<R04>
              Subpart 2310--Withdrawals, General: Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 2310.1  Procedures: General.

    (a) The basic steps leading up to the making, modification or 
extension of a withdrawal, except emergency withdrawals, are:
    (1) Preapplication consultation;
    (2) Obtaining Secretarial approval of a withdrawal petition in 
appropriate cases;
    (3) Submission for filing of an application for a requested 
withdrawal action;

[[Page 80]]

    (4) Publication in the Federal Register of a notice stating that a 
withdrawal proposal has been made or that an application has been 
submitted for filing.
    (5) Negotiations between the applicant and the authorized officer as 
well as the accomplishment of investigations, studies and analyses which 
may be required to process an application.
    (6) Preparation of the case file to be considered by the Secretary, 
including the authorized officer's findings and recommendations;
    (7) Transmittal of the case file to the Director, Bureau of Land 
Management, for the Director's review and decision regarding the 
findings and recommendations of the authorized officer;
    (8) Transmittal of the case file to the Secretary.
    (9) Publication of a public land order or a notice of denial signed 
by the Secretary. If the application seeks a national defense withdrawal 
that may only be made by an Act of Congress, the Secretary will transmit 
to the Congress proposed legislation along with the Secretary's 
recommendations, and documentation relating thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.1-1  Preapplication consultation.

    A potential applicant should contact the appropriate State office of 
the Bureau of Land Management well in advance of the anticipated 
submission date of an application. Early consultation can familiarize 
the potential applicant with the responsibilities of an applicant, the 
authorized officer and the Secretary. Early consultation also will 
assist in determining the need for a withdrawal, taking possible 
alternatives into account, increase the likelihood that the applicant's 
needs will be considered in ongoing land use planning, assist in 
determining the extent to which any public lands that may be involved 
would have to be segregated if an application is submitted; and result 
in preliminary determinations regarding the scheduling of various 
investigations, studies, analyses, public meetings and negotiations that 
may be required for a withdrawal. Studies and analyses should be 
programmed to ensure their completion in sufficient time to allow the 
Secretary or the Congress adequate time to act on the application before 
the expiration of the segregation period.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.1-2  Submission of applications.

    (a) Applications for the making, modification or extension of a 
withdrawal shall be submitted for filing, in duplicate, in the proper 
Bureau of Land Management office, as set forth in Sec. 1821.2-1 of this

are classified for national security reasons. Requests for emergency 
withdrawals and applications that are classified for national security 
reasons shall be submitted, in duplicate, in the Office of the 
Secretary, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240.
    (b) Before the authorized officer can take action on a withdrawal 
proposal, a withdrawal application in support thereof shall be

in Sec. 2310.3-6(b) of this title, the application shall contain at 
least the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the applicant. Where the organization 
intending to use the lands is different from the applicant, the name and 
address of such using agency shall also be included.
    (2) If the applicant is a department or agency other than the 
Department of the Interior or an office thereof, a statement of the 
delegation or delegations of authority of the official acting on behalf

department or agency in connection with all matters pertaining to the 
application.
    (3) If the lands which are subject to an application are wholly or 
partially under the administration of any department or agency other 
than the Department of the Interior, the Secretary shall make or modify 
a withdrawal

[[Page 81]]

only with the consent of the head of the department or agency concerned, 
except in the case of an emergency withdrawal. In such case, a copy of

Federal ownership, would become subject to the withdrawal) within the 
exterior boundaries of the affected land areas;
    (iii) In the case of a national defense withdrawal which can only be 
made by an Act of Congress, sections 3(2) and 3(3) of the Act of 
February 28, 1958 (43 U.S.C. 157 (2), (3)) shall be complied with in 
lieu of paragraphs (c)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (6) If the application is for a withdrawal that would overlap, or

program shall be provided.
    (8) The extent to which the lands embraced in the application are 
requested to be withheld from settlement, sale, location or entry under 
the public land laws, including the mining laws, together with the 
extent to which, and the time during which, the lands involved in the 
application would be temporarily segregated in accordance with 
Sec. 2310.2 of this subpart.
    (9) The type of temporary land use that, at the discretion of the 
authorized officer, may be permitted or allowed during the segregation 
period, in accordance with Sec. 2310.2 of this subpart.
    (10) An analysis and explanation of why neither a right-of-way under 
section 507 of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1767), nor a cooperative agreement 
under sections 302(b) (43 U.S.C. 1732(b)) and 307(b) (43 U.S.C. 1737(b)) 
of the act would adequately provide for the proposed use.
    (11) The duration of the withdrawal, with a statement in

extension of an existing withdrawal is requested, its duration may not 
exceed the duration of the existing withdrawal.
    (12) A statement as to whether any suitable alternative sites are 
available for the proposed use or for uses which the requested 
withdrawal action would displace. The statement shall include a study 
comparing the projected costs of obtaining each alternative site in 
suitable condition for the intended use, as well as the projected costs 
of obtaining and developing each alternative site

[[Page 82]]

for uses that the requested withdrawal action would displace.
    (13) A statement as to whether water will or will not be needed to 
fulfill the purpose of the requested withdrawal action.
    (14) The place where records relating to the application can be 
examined by interested persons.
    (d) Except in the case of an emergency withdrawal, if the preceding 
application requirements have not been met, or if an application seeks 
an action that is not within the scope of the Secretary's authority, the 
application may be rejected by the authorized officer as a defective 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.1-3  Submission of withdrawal petitions.

    (a) Withdrawal petitions shall be submitted to the Director, Bureau 
of Land Management, for transmittal to the Secretary.
    (b) No specific form is required, but the petition shall contain at 
least the following information:
    (1) The office originating the petition;
    (2) The type and purpose of the proposed withdrawal action (See 
Sec. 2300.0-5(h) of this title) and whether the petition pertains to the

Sec. 2310.1-2 of this title), shall supersede the requirements of this 
section.
    (d) If a petition seeks an emergency withdrawal under the provisions 
of section 204(e) of the act, the petition shall be filed simultaneously 
with an application for withdrawal. In such instances, the petition/
application shall provide as much of the information required by 
Secs. 2310.1-2(c) and 2310.3-2(b) of this title as is available to the 
petitioner when the petition is submitted.
    (e) Upon the approval by the Secretary of a petition for withdrawal, 
the petition shall be considered as a Secretarial proposal for 
withdrawal, and notice of the withdrawal proposal shall be published 
immediately in the Federal Register in accordance with Sec. 2310.3-1(a) 
of this title. If a petition which seeks an emergency withdrawal is 
approved by the Secretary, the publication and notice provisions 
pertaining to emergency withdrawals shall be applicable. (See 
Sec. 2310.5 of this title.)


<R05>
Sec. 2310.1-4  Cancellation of withdrawal applications or withdrawal proposals and denial of applications.

    (a) Withdrawal or extension applications and proposals shall be 
amended promptly to cancel the application or proposal, in whole or in 
part, with respect to any lands which the applicant, in the case of 
applications, or the office, in the case of proposals, determines are no 
longer needed in connection with a requested or proposed action. The 
filing of a cancellation notice in each such case shall result in the 
termination of the segregation of the public lands that are to be 
eliminated from the withdrawal application or withdrawal proposal. (See 
Sec. 2310.2-1 of this title)
    (b) The Secretary may deny an application if the costs (as defined 
in section 304(b) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1734(b)) estimated to be 
incurred by the Department of the Interior would, in the judgment of the 
Secretary, be excessive in relation to available funds appropriated for 
processing applications requesting a discretionary withdrawal, or a 
modification or extension of a withdrawal.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.2  Segregative effect of withdrawal applications or withdrawal proposals.

    The following provisions apply only to applications or proposals to 
withdraw lands and not to applications or

[[Page 83]]

proposals seeking to modify or extend withdrawals.
    (a) Withdrawal applications or withdrawal proposals submitted on or 
after October 21, 1976. Within 30 days of the submission for filing of a 
withdrawal application, or whenever a withdrawal proposal is made, a 
notice stating that the application has been submitted or that the 
proposal has been made, shall be published in the Federal Register by 
the authorized officer. Publication of the notice in the Federal 
Register shall segregate the lands described in the application or 
proposal from settlement, sale, location or entry under the public land 
laws, including the mining laws, to the extent specified in the notice, 
for 2 years from the date of publication of the notice unless the 
segregative effect is terminated sooner in accordance with the 
provisions of this part. The notices published pursuant to the 
provisions of this section shall be the same notices required by 
Sec. 2310.3-1 of this title. Publication of a notice of a withdrawal 
application that is based on a prior withdrawal proposal, notice of 
which was published in the Federal Register, shall not operate to extend 
the segregation period which commenced upon the publication of the prior 
withdrawal proposal.
    (b) Withdrawal applications submitted before October 21, 1976. The 
public lands described in a withdrawal application filed before October 
21, 1976, shall remain segregated through October 20, 1991, from 
settlement, sale, location or entry under the public land laws, 
including the mining laws, to the extent specified in the Federal 
Register notice or notices that pertain to the application, unless the 
segregative effect of the application is terminated sooner in accordance 
with other provisions of this part. Any amendment made on or after 
October 21, 1976, of a withdrawal application submitted before October 
21, 1976, for the purpose of adding Federal lands to the lands described 
in a previous application, shall require the publication in the Federal 
Register, within 30 days of receipt of the amended application, of a 
notice of the amendment of the withdrawal application. All of the lands 
described in the amended application which includes those lands 
described in the original application shall be segregated for 2 years 
from the date of publication of the notice of the amended application in 
the Federal Register.
    (c) Applications for licenses, permits, cooperative agreements or 
other discretionary land use authorizations of a temporary nature that 
are filed on or after October 21, 1976, regarding lands involved in a 
withdrawal application or a withdrawal proposal and that are listed in 
the notices required by Sec. 2310.3-2 of this title as permissible 
during the segregation period, may be approved by the authorized officer 
while the lands remain segregated.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
applications for the use of lands involved in a withdrawal application 
or a withdrawal proposal, the allowance of which is discretionary, shall 
be denied.
    (e) The temporary segregation of lands in connection with a 
withdrawal application or a withdrawal proposal shall not affect in any 
respect Federal agency administrative jurisdiction of the lands, and the 
segregation shall not have the effect of authorizing or permitting any 
use of the lands by the applicant or using agency.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.2-1  Termination of the segregative effect of withdrawal applications or withdrawal proposals.

    (a) The publication in the Federal Register of an order allowing a 
withdrawal application, in whole or in part, shall terminate the 
segregative effect of the application as to those lands withdrawn by the 
order.
    (b) The denial of a withdrawal application, in whole or in part, 
shall result in the termination of the segregative effect of the 
application or proposal as to those lands where the withdrawal is 
disallowed. Within 30 days following the decision to disallow the 
application or proposal, in whole or in part, the authorized officer 
shall publish a notice in the Federal Register specifying the reasons 
for the denial and the date that the segregative period terminated. The 
termination date of the segregation period shall be noted promptly on 
the public land status records on or before the termination date.
    (c) The cancellation, in whole or in part, of a withdrawal 
application or a

[[Page 84]]

withdrawal proposal shall result in the termination of the segregative 
effect of the application or proposal, as to those lands deleted from 
the application or proposal. The authorized officer shall publish a 
notice in the Federal Register, within 30 days following the date of 
receipt of the cancellation, specifying the date that the segregation 
terminated. The termination date of the segregation shall be noted 
promptly on the public land status records. If the cancellation applies 
to only a portion of the public lands that are described in the 
withdrawal application or withdrawal proposal, then the lands that are 
not affected by the cancellation shall remain segregated.
    (d) The segregative effect resulting from the publication on or 
after October 21, 1976, of a Federal Register notice of the submission 
of a withdrawal application or the making of a withdrawal proposal shall 
terminate 2 years after the publication date of the Federal Register 
notice unless the segregation is terminated sooner by other provisions 
of this section. A notice specifying the date and time of termination 
shall be published in the Federal Register by the authorized officer 30 
days in advance of the termination date. The public land status records 
shall be noted as to the termination date of the segregation period on 
or before the termination date. Such a termination shall not affect the 
processing of the withdrawal application.
    (e) The segregative effect resulting from the submission of a 
withdrawal application or withdrawal proposal before October 21, 1976, 
shall terminate on October 20, 1991, unless the segregation is 
terminated sooner by other provisions of this part. A notice specifying 
the date and time of termination shall be published in the Federal 
Register by the authorized officer 30 days in advance of October 20, 
1991. The public land status records shall be noted as to the 
termination date of the segregation period on or before October 20, 
1991.

<R05>
Sec. 2310.3-1  Publication and public meeting requirements.

    (a) When a withdrawal proposal is made, a notice to that effect 
shall be published immediately in the Federal Register. The notice shall 
contain the information required by Sec. 2310.1-3 of this title. In the 
event a withdrawal petition, which subsequently becomes a withdrawal 
proposal, is submitted simultaneously with a withdrawal application, the 
information requirements for notices pertaining to withdrawal 
applications (See paragraph (b) of this section) shall supersede the 
information requirements of this paragraph. However, in such instances, 
the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be published 
immediately without regard to the 30-day period allowed for the filing 
for publication in the Federal Register of withdrawal application 
notices.
    (b)(1) Except for emergency withdrawals and except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section, within 30 days of the 
submission for filing of a withdrawal, extension or modification 
application, the authorized officer shall publish in the Federal 
Register a notice to that effect. The authorized officer also shall 
publish the same notice in at least one newspaper having a general 
circulation in the vicinity of the lands involved and, with the 
cooperation and assistance of the applicant, when appropriate, shall 
provide sufficient publicity to inform the interested public of the 
requested action.
    (2) The notice shall contain, in summary form, the information 
required by Sec. 2310.1-2 of this title, except that the authorized 
officer may exclude the information required by Sec. 2310.1-2(c)(2) of 
this title, and as much of the descriptive information required by 
Sec. 2310.1-2(c) (5) and (6) of this title as the authorized officer 
considers appropriate. The notice shall:

[[Page 85]]

    (i) Provide a legal description of the lands affected by the 
application, together with the total acreage of such lands;
    (ii) Specify the extent to which and the time during which any lands 
that may be involved may be segregated in accordance with Sec. 2310.2 of 
this title;
    (iii) Identify the temporary land uses that may be permitted or 
allowed during the segregation period as provided for in Sec. 2310.2(c) 
of this title;

publication of the notice, for public comment on the requested action;
    (v) Solicit written comments from the public as to the requested 
action and provide for one or more public meetings in relation to 
requested actions involving 5,000 or more acres in the aggregate and, as 
to requested actions involving less than 5,000 acres, solicit and 
evaluate the written comments of the public as to the requested action 
and as to the need for public meetings;
    (vi) State, in the case of a national defense withdrawal which can 
only be made by an Act of Congress, that if the withdrawal is to be 
made, it will be made by an Act of Congress;
    (vii) Provide the address of the Bureau of Land Management office in 
which the application and the case file pertaining to it are available 
for public inspection and to which the written comments of the public 
should be sent;
    (viii) State that the application will be processed in accordance 
with the regulations set forth in part 2300 of this title;
    (ix) Reference, if appropriate, the Federal Register in which the 
notice of a withdrawal proposal, if any, pertaining to the application 
was published previously;
    (x) Provide such additional information as the authorized officer 
deems necessary or appropriate.
    (c)(1) In determining whether a public meeting will be held on 
applications involving less than 5,000 acres of land, the authorized 
officer shall consider whether or not:
    (i) A large number of persons have expressed objections to or 
suggestions regarding the requested action;
    (ii) The objections or suggestions expressed appear to have merit 
without regard to the number of persons responding;
    (iii) A public meeting can effectively develop information which 
would otherwise be difficult or costly to accumulate;
    (iv) The requested action, because of the amount of acreage 
involved, the location of the affected lands or other relevant factors, 
would have an important effect on the public, as for example, the 
national or regional economy;
    (v) There is an appreciable public interest in the lands or their 
use, as indicated by the records of the Bureau of Land Management;
    (vi) There is prevailing public opinion in the area that favors 
public meetings or shows particular concern over withdrawal actions; and
    (vii) The applicant has requested a public meeting.
    (2) A public meeting, whether required or determined by the 
authorized officer to be necessary, shall be held at a time and place 
convenient to the interested public, the applicant and the authorized 
officer. A notice stating the time and place of the meeting, shall be 
published in the Federal Register and in at least one newspaper having a 
general circulation in the vicinity of lands involved in the requested 
action, at least 30 days before the scheduled date of the meeting.

Sec. 2310.3-2  Development and processing of the case file for submission to the Secretary.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 2310.3-6(b) of this title, 
the information, studies, analyses and reports identified in this 
paragraph that are required by applicable statutes, or which the 
authorized officer determines to be required for the Secretary or the 
Congress to make a decision or recommendation on a requested withdrawal, 
shall be provided by the applicant. The authorized officer shall assist 
the applicant to the extent the authorized officer considers it 
necessary or appropriate to do so. The qualifications of all specialists 
utilized by either the authorized officer or the applicant to prepare 
the information, studies, analyses and reports shall be provided.

[[Page 86]]

    (b) The information, studies, analyses and reports which, as 
appropriate, shall be provided by the applicant shall include:
    (1) A report identifying the present users of the lands involved, 
explaining how the users will be affected by the proposed use and 
analyzing the manner in which existing and potential resource uses are 
incompatible with or conflict with the proposed use of the lands and 
resources that would be affected by the requested action. The report 
shall also specify the provisions that are to be made for, and an 
economic analysis of, the continuation, alteration or terminaton of 
existing uses. If the provisions of Sec. 2310.3-5 of this title are 
applicable to the proposed withdrawal, the applicant shall also furnish 
a certification that the requirements of that section shall be satisfied 
promptly if the withdrawal is allowed or authorized.
    (2) If the application states that the use of water in any State 
will be necessary to fulfill the purposes of the requested withdrawal, 
extension or modification, a report specifying that the applicant or 
using agency has acquired, or proposes to acquire, rights to the use of 
the water in conformity with applicable State laws and procedures 
relating to the control, appropriation, use and distribution of water, 
or whether the withdrawal is intended to reserve, pursuant to Federal 
law, sufficient unappropriated water to fulfill the purposes of the 
withdrawal. Water shall be reserved pursuant to Federal law for use in 
carrying out the purposes of the withdrawal only if specifically so 
stated in the relevant withdrawal order, as provided in Sec. 2310.3-3(b) 
of this title and only to the extent needed for the purpose or purposes 
of the withdrawal as expressed in the withdrawal order. The applicant 
shall also provide proof of notification of the involved State's 
department of water resources when a land use needed to carry out the 
purposes of the requested withdrawal will involve utilization of the 
water resources in a State. As a condition to the allowance of an order 
reserving water, the applicant shall certify to the Secretary that it 
shall quantify the amount of water to be reserved by the order.
    (3) An environmental assessment, an environmental impact statement 
or any other documents as are needed to meet the requirements of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)), and 
the regulations applicable thereto. The authorized officer shall 
participate in the development of environmental assessments or impact 
statements. The applicant shall designate the Bureau of Land Management 
as a cooperating agency and shall comply with the requirements of the 
regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality. The Bureau of Land 
Management shall, at a minimum, independently evaluate and review the 
final product. The following items shall either be included in the 
assessment or impact statement, or they may be submitted separately, 
with appropriate cross references.
    (i) A report on the identification of cultural resources prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR part 800, and other 
applicable regulations.
    (ii) An identification of the roadless areas or roadless islands 
having wilderness characteristics, as described in the Wilderness Act of 
1964 (16 U.S.C. 1131, et seq.), which exist within the area covered by 
the requested withdrawal action.
    (iii) A mineral resource analysis prepared by a qualified mining 
engineer, engineering geologist or geologist which shall include, but 
shall not be limited to, information on: General geology, known mineral 
deposits, past and present mineral production, mining claims, mineral 
leases, evaluation of future mineral potential and present and potential 
market demands.
    (iv) A biological assessment of any listed or proposed endangered or 
threatened species, and their critical habitat, which may occur on or in 
the vicinity of the involved lands, prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 1536), and regulations applicable thereto, if the 
Secretary determines that assessment is required by law.
    (v) An analysis of the economic impact of the proposed uses and 
changes in use associated with the requested

[[Page 87]]

action on individuals, local communities, State and local government 
interests, the regional economy and the Nation as a whole.
    (vi) A statement as to the extent and manner in which the public 
participated in the environmental review process.
    (4) A statement with specific supporting data, as to:
    (i) Whether the lands involved are floodplains or are considered 
wetlands; and
    (ii) Whether the existing and proposed uses would affect or be 
affected by such floodplains or wetlands and, if so, to what degree and 
in what manner. The statement shall indicate whether, if the requested 
action is allowed, it will comply with the provisions of Executive 
Orders 11988 and 11990 of May 24, 1977 (42 FR 26951; 26961).
    (5) A statement of the consultation which has been or will be 
conducted with other Federal departments or agencies; with regional, 
State and local Government bodies; and with individuals and 
nongovernmental groups regarding the requested action.
    (c) Prior to final action being taken in connection with an 
application, the applicant shall prepare, with the guidance and 
participation of the authorized officer, and subject to the approval of 
the authorized officer, the Secretary and other affected departments, 
agencies or offices, a resource management plan and implementation 
program regarding the use and management of any public lands with their 
related resources uses. Consideration shall be given to the impact of 
the proposed reservation on access to and the use of the land areas that 
are located in the vicinity of the lands proposed to be withdrawn. Where 
appropriate, the plan and program will be implemented by means of a 
memorandum of understanding between the affected agencies. Any 
allocation of jurisdiction between the agencies shall be effected in the 
public land order or legislation. In those cases where the Secretary, 
acting through the Bureau of Land Management, would continue to exercise 
partial jurisdiction, resource management of withdrawn areas may be 
governed by the issuance of management decisions by the Bureau of Land 
Management to implement land use plans developed or revised under the 
land use planning requirements of section 202 of the Act (43 U.S.C. 
1712).
    (d) In regard to national defense withdrawals that can only be made 
by an Act of Congress, and to the extent that they are not otherwise 
satisfied by the information, studies, analyses and reports provided in 
accordance with the provisions of this section, the provisions of 
section 3(7) of the Act of February 28, 1958 (43 U.S.C. 157(7)), shall 
be complied with.
    (e) The authorized officer shall develop preliminary findings and 
recommendations to be submitted to the Secretary, advise the applicant 
of the findings and recommendations, and provide the applicant an 
opportunity to discuss any objections thereto which the applicant may 
have.
    (f) Following the discussion process, or in the absence thereof, the 
authorized officer shall prepare the findings, keyed specifically to the 
relevant portions of the case file, and the recommendations to the 
Secretary in connection with the application. The authorized officer 
also shall prepare, for consideration by the Secretary, a proposed order 
or notice of denial. In the case of a national defense withdrawal which 
can only be made by an Act of Congress, the authorized officer shall 
prepare, with the cooperation of the applicant, a draft legislative 
proposal to implement the applicant's withdrawal request, together with 
proposed recommendations for submission by the Secretary to the 
Congress. The findings and recommendations of the authorized officer, 
and the other documents previously specified in this section to be 
prepared by the authorized officer shall be made a part of the case 
file. The case file shall then be sent to the Director, Bureau of Land 
Management. At the same time, a copy of the findings and recommendations 
of the authorized officer shall be sent to the applicant.
    (1) If the applicant objects to the authorized officer's findings 
and recommendations to the Secretary, the applicant may, within 30 days 
of the receipt by the applicant of notification thereof, state its 
objections in writing and request the Director to review the

[[Page 88]]

authorized officer's findings and recommendations. The applicant shall 
be advised of the Director's decision within 30 days of receipt of the 
applicant's statement of objections in the Bureau of Land Management's 
Washington office. The applicant's statement of objections and the 
Director's decision shall be made a part of the case file and thereafter 
the case file shall be submitted to the Secretary.
    (2) If the applicant disagrees with the decision of the Director, 
Bureau of Land Management, the applicant may, within 30 days of receipt 
by the applicant of the Director's decision, submit to the Secretary a 
statement of reasons for disagreement. The statement shall be considered 
by the Secretary together with the findings and recommendations of the 
authorized officer, the applicant's statement of objections, the 
decision of the Director, the balance of the case file and such 
additional information as the Secretary may request.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.3-3  Action by the Secretary: Public land orders and notices of denial.

    (a) Except for national defense withdrawals which can only be made 
by an Act of Congress, and except as may be otherwise provided in 
section 1(d) of Executive Order 10355 (17 FR 4833), for applications 
that are subject to that order, the allowance or denial, in whole or in 
part, of a withdrawal, modification or extension application, may only 
be made by the Secretary.
    (b)(1) Before the allowance of an application, in whole or in part, 
the Secretary shall first approve all applicable memoranda of 
understanding and the applicant shall make all certifications required 
in this part. When an application has been finally allowed, in whole or 
in part, by the Secretary, an order to that effect shall be published 
promptly in the Federal Register. Each order shall be designated as, and 
shall be signed by the Secretary and issued in the form of, a public 
land order. Water shall be reserved pursuant to Federal law for use in 
carrying out the purposes of the withdrawal only if specifically so 
stated in the relevant public land order. In appropriate cases, the 
public land order also shall refer to the memorandum of understanding 
discussed in Sec. 2310.3-2(c) of this title and shall be drawn to comply 
with Sec. 2310.3-6 of this title.
    (2) On the same day an order withdrawing 5,000 or more acres in the 
aggregate is signed, the Secretary shall advise, in writing, each House 
of the Congress, or in the case of an emergency withdrawal, the 
appropriate Committee of each House, of the withdrawal action taken. 
Pursuant to the Secretary's authority under the act, the notices that 
are sent to the Congress shall be accompanied by the information 
required by section 204(c)(2) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(c)(2)), except 
in the case of an emergency withdrawal, transmittal of the required 
information may be delayed as provided in Sec. 2310.5(c) of this title.
    (c) When the action sought in an application involves the exercise 
by the Secretary of authority delegated by Executive Order 10355 (17 FR 
4831) and the Secretary denies the application in whole or in part, the 
applicant shall be notified of the reasons for the Secretary's decision. 
The decision shall be subject to further consideration only if the 
applicant informs the Secretary, in writing, within 15 days of the 
receipt by the applicant of the Secretary's decision, that the applicant 
has submitted the matter to the Office of Management and Budget for 
consideration and adjustment, as provided for in section 1(d) of the 
Executive Order.
    (d) A withdrawal application shall be denied, if, in the opinion of 
the Secretary, the applicant is attempting to circumvent the 
Congressional review provisions of section 204(c)(1) of the Act (43 
U.S.C. 1714(c)(1)) concerning withdrawals of 5,000 or more acres in the 
aggregate.
    (e) When an application is denied in its entirety by the Secretary, 
a notice to that effect, signed by the Secretary, shall be published 
promptly in the Federal Register.
    (f) In the case of a national defense withdrawal that may only be 
made by an Act of Congress, the Secretary shall transmit to the Congress 
proposed legislation effecting the withdrawal requested, together with 
the recommendations of the Secretary which may or may not support the 
proposed

[[Page 89]]

legislation in whole or in part. The proposed legislation shall contain 
such provisions for continued operation of the public land laws as to 
the public land areas included in the requested withdrawal as shall be 
determined by the Secretary to be compatible with the intended military 
use.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.3-4  Duration of withdrawals.

    (a) An order initially withdrawing 5,000 or more acres of land in 
the aggregate, on the basis of the Secretary's authority under section 
204 of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714), may be made for a period not to exceed 
20 years from the date the order is signed, except that withdrawals 
exceeding 5,000 acres in the State of Alaska shall not become effective 
until notice is provided in the Federal Register and to both Houses of 
Congress. All orders withdrawing 5,000 or more acres in the aggregate 
shall be subject to the Congressional review provision of section 204(c) 
of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(c)), except as follows:
    (1) A National Wildlife Refuge System withdrawal may not be 
terminated as provided in section 204(c)(1) of the Act (43 U.S.C 
1714(c)(1)) other than by an Act of Congress; or
    (2) A withdrawal exceeding 5,000 acres in the State of Alaska shall 
terminate unless Congress passes a Joint Resolution of approval within 1 
year after the notice of such withdrawal has been submitted to the 
Congress.
    (b) An order initially withdrawing less than 5,000 acres of land, in 
the aggregate, on the basis of the Secretary's authority under section 
204 of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714), may be made:
    (1) For such time as the Secretary determines desirable for a 
resource use;
    (2) For not more than 20 years for any other use, including, but not 
limited to, the use of lands for non-resource uses, related 
administrative sites and facilities or for other proprietary purposes; 
or
    (3) For not more than 5 years to preserve the lands for a specific 
use then under consideration by either House of Congress.
    (c) An order withdrawing lands on the basis of an emergency as 
provided for in section 204(e) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(e)) may be

duration may be extended, as provided for in Sec. 2310.4 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.3-5  Compensation for improvements.

the holder of record of each permit, license or lease lawfully 
terminated or revoked after the allowance of an application, for all 
authorized improvements placed on the lands under the terms and 
conditions of the permit, license or lease, before the lands were 
segregated or withdrawn. The amount of such compensation shall be 
determined by an appraisal as of the date of revocation or termination 
of the permit, license or lease, but shall not exceed fair market value. 
To the extent such improvements were constructed with Federal funds, 
they shall not be compensable unless the United States has been 
reimbursed for such funds prior to the allowance of the application and 
then only to the extent of the sum that the United States has received.
    (b) When an application is allowed that affects public lands which 
are subject to permits or leases for the grazing of domestic livestock 
and that is required to be terminated, the applicant shall comply with 
the cancellation notice and compensation requirements of section 402(g) 
of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1752(g)), to the extent applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.3-6  Transfer of jurisdiction.

    A public land order that reserves lands for a department, agency or 
office, shall specify the extent to which jurisdiction over the lands 
and their related resource uses will be exercised by that department, 
agency or office. (See Sec. 2310.3-2(c) of this title).


<R05>
Sec. 2310.4  Review and extensions of withdrawals.

    (a) Discretionary withdrawals of specific duration, whether made 
prior to or after October 21, 1976, shall be reviewed by the Secretary 
commencing at least 2 years before the expiration

[[Page 90]]

date of the withdrawal. When requested, the department, agency or office 
benefitting from the withdrawal shall promptly provide the Secretary 
with the information required by Sec. 2310.1-2(c) of this title, and the 
information required by Sec. 2310.3-2(b) of this title, in the form of a 
withdrawal extension application with supplemental information. If the 
concerned department, agency or office is delinquent in responding to 
such request, the deliquency shall constitute a ground for not extending 
the withdrawal. Such withdrawals may be extended or further extended 
only upon compliance with these regulations, and only if the Secretary 
determines that the purpose for which the withdrawal was first made 
requires the extension, and then only for a period that shall not exceed 
the duration of the original withdrawal period. In allowing an 
extension, the Secretary shall comply with the provisions of section 
204(c) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(c)), or section 204(d) of the Act (43 
U.S.C. 1714(d)), whichever is applicable; and, whether or not an 
extension is allowed, the Secretary shall report promptly on the 
decision for each pending extension to the Congressional Committees that 
are specified in section 204(f) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(f)).
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if the Secretary 
determines that a National Wildlife Refuge System withdrawal of specific 
duration shall not be extended, the Secretary shall nevertheless extend 
or reextend the withdrawal until such time as the withdrawal is 
terminated by an Act of Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 2310.5  Special action on emergency withdrawals.

    (a) When the Secretary determines, or when either one of the two 
Committees of the Congress that are specified in section 204(e) of the 
Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(e)) notifies the Secretary, that an emergency exists 
and that extraordinary measures need to be taken to protect natural 
resources or resource values that otherwise would be lost, the Secretary 
shall immediately make a withdrawal which shall be limited in its scope 
and duration to the emergency. An emergency withdrawal shall be 
effective when signed, shall not exceed 3 years in duration and may not 
be extended by the Secretary. If it is determined that the lands 
involved in an emergency withdrawal should continue to be withdrawn, a 
withdrawal application should be submitted to the Bureau of Land 
Management in keeping with the normal procedures for processing a 
withdrawal as provided for in this subpart. Such applications will be 
subject to the provisions of section 204(c) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 
1714(c)), or section 204(d) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(d), whichever is 
applicable, as well as section 204(b)(1) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 
1714(b)(1)).
    (b) When an emergency withdrawal is signed, the Secretary shall on 
the same day, send a notice of the withdrawal to the two Committees of 
the Congress that are specified for that purpose in section 204(e) of 
the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(e)).
    (c) The Secretary shall forward a report to each of the 
aforementioned committees within 90 days after filing with them the 
notice of emergency withdrawal. Reports for all such withdrawals, 
regardless of the amount of acreage withdrawn, shall contain the 
information specified in section 204(c)(2) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 
1714(c)(2)).

     Subpart 2320--Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Withdrawals


<R05>
Sec. 2320.0-3  Authority.

    (a) Section 24 of the Federal Power Act of June 10, 1920, as amended 
(16 U.S.C. 818), provides that any lands of the United States included 
in an application for power development under that Act shall, from the 
date of filing of an application therefor, be reserved from entry, 
location or other disposal under the laws of the United States until 
otherwise directed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or by 
Congress. This statute also provides that whenever the Commission shall 
determine that the value of any lands of the United States withdrawn or 
classified for power purposes shall not be injured or destroyed for such 
purposes by location, entry or selection under the public land laws, the 
Secretary of the Interior shall declare such lands open to location, 
entry or selection for

[[Page 91]]

such purposes under such restrictions as the Commission may determine 
are necessary, and subject to and with a reservation of the right of the 
United States or its permittees or licensees to enter upon, occupy and 
use any and all of the lands for power purposes. Before any lands are 
declared open to location, entry or selection, the Secretary shall give 
notice of his intention to make this declaration to the Governor of the 
State within which such lands are located, and the State shall have a 
preference for a period of 90 days from the date of this notice to file 
under any applicable law or regulation an application of the State, or 
any political subdivision thereof, for any lands required as a right-of-
way for a public highway or as a source of materials for the 
construction and maintenance of such highways. The 90-day preference 
does not apply to lands which remain withdrawn for national forest or 
other purposes.
    (b) The Mining Claims Rights Restoration Act of 1955 (30 U.S.C. 621 
et seq.), opened public lands which were then, or thereafter, withdrawn 
or classified for power purposes, with specified exceptions, to mineral 
location and development under certain circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 2320.1  Lands considered withdrawn or classified for power purposes.

    The following classes of lands of the United States are considered 
as withdrawn or classified for the purposes of section 24 of the Federal 
Power Act (16 U.S.C. 818): Lands withdrawn for powersite reserves under 
sections 1 and 2 of the Act of June 25, 1910, as amended (43 U.S.C. 141-
148); lands included in an application for power development under the 
Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 818); lands classified for powersite 
purposes under the Act of March 3, 1879 (43 U.S.C. 31); lands designated 
as valuable for power purposes under the Act of June 25, 1910, as 
amended (43 U.S.C. 148); the Act of June 9, 1916 (39 Stat. 218, 219), 
and the Act of February 26, 1919 (40 Stat. 1178, 1180); lands within 
final hydroelectric power permits under the Act of February 15, 1901 (43 
U.S.C. 959); and lands within transmission line permits or approved 
rights-of-way under the aforementioned Act of February 15, 1901, or the 
Act of March 4, 1911 (43 U.S.C. 961).


<R05>
Sec. 2320.2  General determinations under the Federal Power Act.

    (a) On April 22, 1922, the Federal Power Commission (as predecessor 
to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) made a general 
determination ``that where lands of the United States have heretofore 
been or hereafter may be reserved or classified as powersites, such 
reservation or classification being made solely because such lands are 
either occupied by power transmission lines or their occupancy and use 
for such purposes have been applied for or authorized under appropriate 
laws of the United States, and such lands have otherwise no value for 
power purposes, and are not occupied in trespass, the Commission 
determines that the value of such lands so reserved or classified or so 
applied for or authorized, shall not be injured or destroyed for the 
purposes of power development by location, entry or selection under the 
public land laws, subject to the reservation of section 24 of the 
Federal Power Act.''
    (b) The regulations governing mining locations on lands withdrawn or 
classified for power purposes, including lands that have been restored 
and opened to mining locations under section 24 of the Federal Power 
Act, are contained in subpart 3730 and in Group 3800 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2320.3  Applications for restoration.

    (a) Other than with respect to national forest lands, applications 
for restoration and opening of lands withdrawn or classified for power 
purposes under the provisions of section 24 of the Federal Power Act 
shall be filed, in duplicate, in the proper office of the Bureau of Land 
Management as set forth in Sec. 2321.2-1 of this title. No particular 
form of application is required, but it shall be typewritten or in 
legible handwriting, and it shall contain the information required by 18 
CFR 25.1. Each application shall be accompanied by a service charge of 
$10 which is not returnable.
    (b) Favorable action upon an application for restoration shall not 
give the

[[Page 92]]

applicant any preference right when the lands are opened.

               Subpart 2400--Land Classification; General


<R05>
Sec. 2400.0-2  Objectives.

    The statutes cited in Sec. 2400.0-3 authorize the Secretary of the 
Interior to classify or otherwise take appropriate steps looking to the 
disposition of public lands, and on an interim basis, to classify public 
lands for retention and management, subject to requirements of the 
applicable statutes. In addition to any requirements of law, it is the 
policy of the Secretary (a) to specify those criteria which will be 
considered in the exercise of his authority and (b) to establish 
procedures which will permit the prompt and efficient exercise of his 
authority with, as far as is practicable, the knowledge and 
participation of the interested parties, including the general public. 
Nothing in these regulations is meant to affect applicable State laws 
governing the appropriation and use of water, regulation of hunting and 
fishing or exercise of any police power of the State.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.0-3  Authority.

    (a) All vacant public lands, except those in Alaska, have been, with 
certain exceptions, withdrawn from entry, selection, and location under 
the nonmineral land laws by Executive Order 6910, of November 26, 1934, 
and Executive Order 6964 of February 5, 1935, and amendments thereto, 
and by the establishment of grazing districts under section 1 of the Act 
of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), as amended (43 U.S.C. 315). Section 7 
of the Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1272), as amended (43 U.S.C. 
315f), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior in his discretion to 
examine and classify and open to entry, selection, or location under 
applicable law any lands withdrawn or reserved by Executive Order 6910 
of November 26, 1934, or Executive Order 6964 of February 5, 1935, and 
amendments thereto, or within a grazing district established under that 
act which he finds are more valuable or suitable for the production of 
agricultural crops than for the production of native grasses and forage 
plants, or more valuable or suitable for any other use than for the use 
provided for under said act, or proper for acquisition in satisfaction 
of any outstanding lieu, exchange, or scrip rights or land grant. 
Classification under section 7 is a prerequisite to the approval of all 
entries, selections, or locations under the following subparts of this 
chapter, except as they apply to Alaska and with certain other 
exceptions: Original, Additional, Second, and Adjoining Farm 
Homesteads--subparts 2511, 2512, and 2513; Enlarged Homestead--subpart 
2514; Indian Allotments--part 2530; Desert Land Entries--part 2520; 
Recreation and Public Purposes Act--part 2740 and subpart 2912; State 
Grants for Educational, Institutional, and Park Purposes--part 2620; 
Scrip Selections--part 2610 and Exchanges for the Consolidation or 
Extension of National Forests, Indian Reservations or Indian Holdings--
Group 2200.
    (b) Section 8(b) of the Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1272), as 
amended (43 U.S.C. 315g), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, when 
public interests will be benefited thereby, to accept on behalf of the 
United States title to any privately owned lands within or without the 
boundaries of a grazing district established under that act and in 
exchange therefor to issue patent for not to exceed an equal value of 
surveyed grazing district land or of unreserved surveyed public land in 
the same State

[[Page 98]]

or within a distance of not more than 50 miles within the adjoining 
State nearest the base lands. The regulations governing such exchanges 
are contained in Group 2200 of this chapter.
    (c) Section 2455 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (43 U.S.C. 
1171), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior in his discretion to 
order into market and sell at public auction isolated or disconnected 
tracts of public land not exceeding 1,520 acres, and tracts not 
exceeding 760 acres the greater part of which are mountainous or too 
rough for cultivation. The regulations governing such sales are 
contained in part 2710 of this chapter.
    (d) Section 3 of the Act of August 28, 1937 (50 Stat. 875, 43 U.S.C. 
1181c), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to classify, either on 
application or otherwise, and restore to homestead entry, or purchase 
under the provisions of section 2455 of the Revised Statutes, as 
amended, any of the revested Oregon and California Railroad or 
reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant land which, in his judgment, is 
more suitable for agricultural use than for afforestation, 
reforestation, stream-flow protection, recreation, or other public 
purposes. The regulations governing disposal under this act are 
contained in part 2710 of this chapter.
    (e) The Small Tract Act of June 1, 1938 (52 Stat. 609), as amended 
(43 U.S.C. 682a-e), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in his 
discretion, to lease or sell certain classes of public lands which he 
classifies as chiefly valuable for residence, recreation, business or 
community site purposes. The regulations governing leases and sales 
under this act are contained in part 2730 and subpart 2913 of this 
chapter.
    (f) The Recreation and Public Purposes Act of June 14, 1926 (44 
Stat. 741), as amended (43 U.S.C. 869-869-4), requires the Secretary of 
the Interior, in the exercise of his discretion to make a determination 
that land is to be used for an established or definitely proposed 
project, and in the case of Alaska authorizes him to classify certain 
classes of public lands for lease or sale for recreation or other public 
purposes. The regulations governing lease and sale of land under this 
act are contained in part 2740 and subpart 2912 of this chapter.
    (g) The Act of July 31, 1939 (53 Stat. 1144), authorizes and 
empowers the Secretary of the Interior, in the administration of the Act 
of August 28, 1937 (supra), in his discretion, to exchange any land 
formerly granted to the Oregon & California Railroad Co., title to which 
was revested in the United States pursuant to the provisions of the Act 
of June 9, 1916 (39 Stat. 218), and any land granted to the State of 
Oregon, title to which was reconveyed to the United States by the 
Southern Oregon Co. pursuant to the provisions of the Act of February 
26, 1919 (40 Stat. 1179), for lands of approximately equal aggregate 
value held in private, State, or county ownership, either within or 
contiguous to the former limits of such grants, when by such action the 
Secretary of the Interior will be enabled to consolidate advantageously 
the holdings of lands of the United States. The regulations governing 
exchanges under this act are contained in part 2260 of this chapter.
    (h) The Alaska Public Sales Act of August 30, 1949 (63 Stat. 679), 
as amended (48 U.S.C. 364a-f), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior 
in his discretion to classify certain classes of public lands in Alaska 
for public sale for industrial or commercial purposes. The regulations 
governing sales of land under this act are contained in part 2770 of 
this chapter.
    (i) The Public Land Sale Act of September 19, 1964 (78 Stat. 988, 43 
U.S.C. 1421-27), authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to 
sell public lands in tracts not exceeding 5,120 acres, that have been 
classified for sale in accordance with a determination that (1) the 
lands are required for the orderly growth and development of a community 
or (2) the lands are chiefly valuable for residential, commercial, 
agricultural (which does not include lands chiefly valuable for grazing 
or raising forage crops), industrial, or public uses or development. The 
regulations governing such sales are contained in part 2720 of this 
chapter.
    (j) The Classification and Multiple Use Act of September 19, 1964 
(78 Stat. 986, 43 U.S.C. 1411-18), authorizes the Secretary of the 
Interior to determine

[[Page 99]]

which of the public lands (and other Federal lands), including those 
situated in the State of Alaska exclusively administered by him through 
the Bureau of Land Management shall be (1) sold because they are (i) 
required for the orderly growth and development of a community or (ii) 
are chiefly valuable for residential, commercial, agricultural (which 
does not include lands chiefly valuable for grazing or raising forage 
crops), industrial, or public uses or development or (2) retained, at 
least for the time being, in Federal ownership and managed for (i) 
domestic livestock grazing, (ii) fish and wildlife development and 
utilization, (iii) industrial development, (iv) mineral production, (v) 
occupancy, (vi) outdoor recreation, (vii) timber production, (viii) 
watershed protection, (ix) wilderness preservation, or (x) preservation 
of public values that would be lost if the land passed from Federal 
ownership.

<R05>
Sec. 2410.1  All classifications.

    All classifications under the regulations of this part will give due 
consideration to ecology, priorities of use, and the relative values of 
the various resources in particular areas. They must be consistent with 
all the following criteria:
    (a) The lands must be physically suitable or adaptable to the uses 
or purposes for which they are classified. In addition, they must have 
such physical and other characteristics as the law may require them to 
have to qualify for a particular classification.
    (b) All present and potential uses and users of the lands will be 
taken into consideration. All other things being equal, land 
classifications will attempt to achieve maximum future uses and minimum 
disturbance to or dislocation of existing users.
    (c) All land classifications must be consistent with State and local 
government programs, plans, zoning, and regulations applicable to the 
area in which the lands to be classified are located, to the extent such 
State and local programs, plans, zoning, and regulations are not 
inconsistent with Federal programs, policies, and uses, and will not 
lead to inequities among private individuals.
    (d) All land classifications must be consistent with Federal 
programs and policies, to the extent that those programs and policies 
affect the use or disposal of the public lands.

[35 FR 9560, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 2410.2  Relative value, disposal or retention.

    When, under the criteria of this part, a tract of land has potential 
for either retention for multiple use management or for some form of 
disposal, or for more than one form of disposal, the relative scarcity 
of the values involved and the availability of alternative means and 
sites for realization of those values will be considered. Long-term 
public benefits will be weighed against more immediate or local 
benefits. The tract will then be classified in a manner which will best 
promote the public interests.

<R05>
Sec. 2420.1  Use of criteria.

    In addition to the general criteria in subpart 2410, the following 
criteria will be used to determine whether public lands will be 
retained, in Federal ownership and managed for domestic livestock 
grazing, fish and wildlife development and utilization, industrial 
development, mineral production, occupancy, outdoor recreation, timber 
production, watershed protection, wilderness preservation, or 
preservation of public values that would be lost if the land passed from 
Federal ownership.

[35 FR 9561, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 2420.2  Criteria.

    Lands may be classified for retention under the Classification and 
Multiple Use Act of September 19, 1964 (78 Stat. 986, 43 U.S.C. 1411-
18), if they are not suitable for disposal under the criteria set forth 
in part 2430 and such classification will do one or more of the 
following:
    (a) Assist in effective and economical administration of the public 
lands in furtherance of the several objectives of such administration as 
expressed in the various public land laws.
    (b) Further the objectives of Federal natural resource legislation 
directed, among other things towards:
    (1) Stabilization and development of the livestock industry 
dependent upon Federal lands, such as sections 1 and 15 of the Taylor 
Grazing Act (43 U.S.C. 315 and 315m), and the Alaska Grazing Act (48 
U.S.C. 471-471o).
    (2) Provision or preservation of adequate areas of public hunting 
and fishing grounds and public access thereto, and maintenance of 
habitat and food supplies for the fish and wildlife dependent upon the 
public lands and maintained under Federal and State programs, such as 
section 9 of the Taylor Grazing Act (43 U.S.C. 315h) and the Fish and 
Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661-666c).
    (3) Fostering the economy of the nation by industrial and mineral 
development, such as through the materials sales and mineral leasing 
laws (Group 3000 of this chapter) and the rights-of-way laws (Group 2800 
of this chapter).
    (4) Realization of the beneficial utilization of the public lands 
through occupancy leases, such as under the Recreation and Public 
Purposes Act (43 U.S.C. 869-869-4) and the Small Tract Act (43 U.S.C. 
682a-682e).
    (5) Provision of needed recreation, conservation, and scenic areas 
and open space (42 U.S.C. 1500-1500e) and assurance of adequate outdoor 
recreation resources for present and future generations of Americans (16 
U.S.C. 460-1 et seq.).
    (6) Stabilization of the timber industry and dependent communities 
and sustained-yield production of timber and other forest products, such 
as the Materials Sales Act (30 U.S.C. 601-604), and, in connection with 
management of other Federal lands, the O and C Act (43 U.S.C. 1181a-
1181f, 1181g-1181j).
    (7) Protection of frail lands, conservation of productive soils and 
water supplies, and prevention of damage and loss due to excessive 
runoff, flooding, salination, and siltation, such as the Soil and 
Moisture Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 590a et seq.) and section 2 of the 
Taylor Grazing Act (43 U.S.C. 315a).
    (c) Preservation of public values that would be lost if the land 
passed from Federal ownership (43 U.S.C. 1411-1418) such as where
    (1) The lands are needed to protect or enhance established Federal 
programs, by such means as provision of buffer zones, control of access, 
maintenance of water supplies, reduction and prevention of water 
pollution, exclusion of nonconforming inholdings, maintenance of 
efficient management areas, provision of research areas, and maintenance 
of military areas or sites for other government activities.
    (2) The lands should be retained in Federal ownership pending 
enactment of Federal legislation, which would affect them.
    (3) The lands should be retained in Federal ownership pending their 
acquisition by a State or local government.
    (4) The lands are best suited for multiple use management and 
require management for a mixture of uses in order to best benefit the 
general public and such management could not be

[[Page 102]]

achieved if the lands were in private ownership.
    (5) The lands contain scientific, scenic, historic, or wilderness 
values which would be lost to the general public if they were 
transferred out of Federal ownership.
    (6) Transfer of the lands would be inconsistent with national 
objectives for the preservation of natural beauty of the country and the 
proper utilization of open space.

<R04>
           Subpart 2430--Criteria for Disposal Classifications


<R05>
Sec. 2430.1  Use of criteria.

    In addition to the general criteria in subpart 2410 the following 
criteria will govern classifications under the authorities listed in 
Sec. 2400.0-3 for sale, selection, grant or other disposal under the 
Public Land Sale Act (78 Stat. 988, 43 U.S.C. 1421-1427) and other laws 
authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of public lands. 
The criteria are set forth in terms of land use classes. Where 
appropriate, the applicability of specific disposal laws to lands in 
each use class is discussed.


<R05>
Sec. 2430.2  General criteria for disposal classification.

    The general approach to determine the act under which lands are to 
be classified and disposed of is as follows:
    (a) Consideration under criteria listed in this part will first be 
given to whether the lands can be classified for retention for multiple 
use management, for disposal, or for both. If, under these criteria, 
they could be classified for both, the principles of Sec. 2410.2 will be 
applied.
    (b) If the lands are found to be suitable for disposal, 
consideration under the criteria of this part will be given to whether 
the lands are needed for urban or suburban purposes or whether they are 
chiefly valuable for other purposes. Lands found to be valuable for 
public purposes will be considered chiefly valuable for public purposes, 
except in situations where alternate sites are available to meet the 
public needs involved.


<R05>
Sec. 2430.3  Additional criteria for classification of lands needed for urban or suburban purposes.

    (a) To be needed for urban or suburban purposes it must be 
anticipated that a community will embrace the lands within 15 years.
    (b) Lands determined to be needed for urban or suburban purposes may 
be classified for sale pursuant to the Public Land Sale Act as being 
required for the orderly growth and development of a community, if (1) 
adequate zoning regulations are in effect and (2) adequate local 
governmental comprehensive plans have been adopted.
    (c) Lands determined to be needed for urban or suburban purposes may 
be classified for disposal under any appropriate law other than the 
Public Land Sale Act, if disposal under such other authority would be 
consistent with local comprehensive plans, or in the absence of such 
plans, with the views of local governmental authorities.
    (d) Where more than one form of disposal is possible, the authorized 
officer will select that course of action which will best promote 
development of the land for urban or suburban purposes.

[[Page 103]]


<R05>
Sec. 2430.4  Additional criteria for classification of lands valuable for public purposes.

    (a) To be valuable for public purposes, lands must be suitable for 
use by a State or local governmental entity or agency for some 
noncommercial and nonindustrial governmental program or suitable for 
transfer to a non-Federal interest in a transaction which will benefit a 
Federal, State, or local governmental program.
    (b) Lands found to be valuable for public purposes may be classified 
for sale pursuant to the Public Land Sale Act as chiefly valuable for 
public uses or development or for transfer in satisfaction of a State 
land grant, or for transfer to a State or local governmental agency in 
exchange for other property, or for transfer to a governmental agency 
under any applicable act of Congress other than the Recreation and 
Public Purposes Act (44 Stat. 741), as amended (43 U.S.C. 869-869-4), if 
(1) the proposed use includes profit activities or if the interested, 
qualified governmental agency and the authorized officer agree that 
there is no need for the perpetual dedication of the lands to public 
uses required by the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, and (2) in the 
case of sales under the Public Land Sale Act, adequate zoning 
regulations exist in the area in which the lands are located.
    (c) Lands found to be valuable for public purposes will ordinarily 
be classified for sale or lease under the Recreation and Public Purposes 
Act (see part 2740 and subpart 2912 of this chapter) if the proposed use 
involves nonprofit activities and if it is determined by the authorized 
officer that the provisions of that Act are required to insure the 
continued dedication of the lands to such uses, or otherwise to carry 
out the purposes of the Act.
    (d) Lands may be classified for exchange under appropriate authority 
where they are found to be chiefly valuable for public purposes because 
they have special values, arising from the interest of exchange 
proponents, for exchange for other lands which are needed for the 
support of a Federal program.


<R05>
Sec. 2430.5  Additional criteria for classification of lands valuable for residential, commercial, agricultural, or industrial purposes.

    (a) Lands which have value for residential, commercial, 
agricultural, or industrial purposes, or for more than one of such 
purposes, will be considered chiefly valuable for that purpose which 
represents the highest and best use of the lands, i.e., their most 
profitable legal use in private ownership.
    (b) Lands may be classified for sale pursuant to the Public Land 
Sale Act as being chiefly valuable for residential, commercial, 
agricultural, or industrial uses or development (other than grazing use 
or use for raising native forage crops), if (1) adequate zoning 
regulations are in effect, and, where the lands also are needed for 
urban or suburban development, (2) adequate local governmental 
comprehensive plans have been adopted.
    (c) Lands determined to be valuable for residential, commercial, 
agricultural, or industrial purposes may be classified for disposal 
under any appropriate authority other than the Public Land Sale Act if 
(1) disposal under such other authority would be consistent with local 
governmental comprehensive plans, or (2) in the absence of such plans, 
with the views of local governmental authorities.
    (d) Lands outside of Alaska may be classified as suitable for 
homestead entry under part 2510 of this chapter if they are (1) chiefly 
valuable for agricultural purposes, and (2) suitable for development as 
a home and farm for a man and his family, and (3) the anticipated return 
from agricultural use of the land would support the residents. If it is 
determined that the irrigation of land otherwise suitable for homestead 
entry would endanger the supply of adequate water for existing users or 
cause the dissipation of water reserves, such land will not be 
classified for entry. Land may be classified for homestead entry only if 
rainfall is adequate, or if under State law, there is available to the 
land sufficient irrigation water, to permit agricultural development of 
its cultivable portions.
    (e) Lands may be classified as suitable for desert land entry under

<R04>
                 Subpart 2440--Criteria for Segregation


<R05>
Sec. 2440.1  Use of criteria.

    The following criteria will govern the determination of the extent 
to which classifications and proposed classifications will segregate the 
affected lands from settlement, location, sale, selection, entry, lease, 
or other forms of disposal under the public land laws, including the 
mining and mineral leasing laws. The segregative effect of each 
classification or proposed classification will be governed by applicable 
laws and regulations, and will be stated in the classification notice or 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 2440.2  General criterion.

    The public lands classified or proposed to be classified under the 
regulations of this part will be kept open to (i.e., not segregated 
from) as many forms of disposal as possible consistent with the purposes 
of the classification and the resource values of the lands.


<R05>
Sec. 2440.3  Specific criteria for segregative effect of classification for retention.

    (a) Public lands classified or proposed to be classified for 
retention for multiple-use management will be segregated from those 
forms of disposal which, if the lands remain open thereto, could:
    (1) Interfere significantly with the management of the lands under 
principles of multiple use and sustained yield, or
    (2) Impair or prevent, to an appreciable extent, realization of 
public values in the lands, or
    (3) Impair or prevent, to an appreciable extent, realization of the 
objectives of retention and management set forth in part 2420, or
    (4) Lead to unnecessary expenditures of public or private funds 
arising out of individual efforts to acquire public lands under laws, 
which are in fact not applicable, because of the nature of the resources 
of the lands.
    (b) In applying the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
land shall not be closed to mining location unless the nonmineral uses 
would be inconsistent with and of greater importance to the public 
interest than the continued search for a deposit of valuable minerals.


<R05>
Sec. 2440.4  Specific criteria for segregative effect of classification for disposal.

    Public lands classified or proposed to be classified for disposal 
will be segregated from those forms of disposal which, if the lands 
remained open

[[Page 105]]

thereto, could interfere with the orderly disposal of the lands pursuant 
to appropriate law. Public lands classified or proposed to be classified 
for sale under the Public Land Sale Act (78 Stat. 988, 43 U.S.C. 1411-
18) will be segregated from all forms of disposal under the mining and 
mineral leasing laws.

<R04>
              Subpart 2450--Petition-Application Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 2450.1  Filing of petition.

    (a) When (1) land must be classified or designated pursuant to the 
authorities cited in Sec. 2400.0-3 before an application may be approved 
and (2) the filing of applications is permitted prior to classification, 
the application together with a petition for classification on a form 
approved by the Director (hereinafter referred to collectively as a 
petition-application) must be filed in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1821.2 of this chapter. Lists indicating the proper office for 
filing of applications may be obtained from the Director or any other 
officer of the Bureau of Land Management. Copies of the petition for 
classification form and the application forms may be obtained from the 
proper offices or from the Bureau of Land Management, Washington, DC 
20240.


<R05>
Sec. 2450.2  Preliminary determination.

    Upon the filing of a petition-application, the authorized officer 
shall make a preliminary determination as to whether it is regular upon 
its face and, where there is no apparent defect, shall proceed to 
investigate and classify the land for which it has been filed. No 
further consideration will be given to the merits of an application or 
the qualifications of an applicant unless or until the land has been 
classified for the purpose for which the petition-application has been 
filed.


<R05>
Sec. 2450.3  Proposed classification decision.

    (a) The State Director shall make and issue a proposed 
classification decision which shall contain a statement of reasons in 
support thereof. Such decisions shall be served upon (1) each 
petitioner-applicant for the land, (2) any grazing permittee, licensee, 
or lessee on the land, or his representative, (3) the District Advisory 
Board, (4) the local governing board, planning commission, State 
coordinating committee, or other official or quasi-official body having 
jurisdiction over zoning in the geographic area within which the lands 
are located, and (5) any governmental officials or agencies from whom 
the record discloses comments on the classification have been received. 
If the decision affects more than 2,560 acres and would lead to the 
disposal of the lands, the decision will also be published in accordance 
with the provisions of subpart 2462.
    (b) When there are multiple petition-applications for the same land, 
the proposed classification decision shall state which petition-
application, if any, will be entitled to preference under applicable 
law; or where no petition-application has been filed for the purpose for 
which the land is proposed to be classified, the decision shall so 
state.
    (1) When multiple petition-applications have been filed for the same 
land, the one first filed for the purpose for which the land is 
classified will be entitled to preference under applicable law.
    (2) When two or more petition-applications have been simultaneously 
filed for the purpose for which the land is classified, the petition-
application entitled to preference will be the first to be selected by 
drawing.
    (3) If no petition-application has been filed for the purpose for 
which it is proposed to classify the land, the proposed

[[Page 106]]

decision shall state that the land will be opened to application by all 
qualified individuals on an equal-opportunity basis after public notice.


<R05>
Sec. 2450.4  Protests: Initial classification decision.

    (a) For a period of 30 days after the proposed classification 
decision has been served upon the parties listed in Sec. 2450.3(a), 
protests thereto may be filed by an interested party with the State 
Director. No particular form of protest is required under this 
subparagraph, it being the intent of this procedure to afford the State 
Director the opportunity to review the proposed classification decision 
in the light of such protests.
    (b) If no protests are filed within the time allowed, the proposed 
classification action shall be issued as the initial classification 
decision of the State Director, and shall be served on the petitioner-
applicants and upon grazing permittees, licensees, or lessees.
    (c) If protests are timely filed, they shall be reviewed by the 
State Director, who may require statements or affidavits, take 
testimony, or conduct further field investigations as are deemed 
necessary to establish the facts. At the conclusion of such review, the 
State Director shall issue an initial classification decision, either 
revised or as originally proposed, which shall be served on all 
interested parties.


<R05>
Sec. 2450.5  Administrative review.

    (a) For a period of 30 days after service thereof upon all parties 
in interest, the initial classification decision of the State Director 
shall be subject to the exercise of supervisory authority by the 
Secretary of the Interior for the purpose of administrative review.
    (b) If, 30 days from receipt by parties in interest of the initial 
decision of the State Director, the Secretary has not either on his own 
motion, or motion of any protestant, petitioner-applicant, or the State 
Director, exercised supervisory authority for review, the initial 
classification decision shall become the final order of the Secretary.
    (c) The exercise of supervisory authority by the Secretary shall 
automatically vacate the initial classification decision and the final 
Departmental decision shall be issued by the Secretary of the Interior 
and served upon all parties in interest.
    (d) No petitioner-applicant or protestant to a proposed 
classification decision of a State Director to whom the provisions of 
this section are applicable shall be entitled to any administrative 
review other than that provided by this section or to appeal under 
provisions of parts 1840 and 1850 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 2450.6  Effect of final order.

    (a) A final order of the Secretary shall continue in full force and 
effect so long as the lands remain subject to classification under the 
authorities cited in subpart 2400 until an authorized officer revokes or 
modifies it. Until it is so revoked or modified, all applications and 
petition-applications for the lands not consistent with the 
classification of the lands will not be allowed. Any payments submitted 
therewith will be returned. If the order is revoked or modified, the 
land will be opened to entry on an equal-opportunity basis after public 
notice in accordance with applicable regulations for the purpose for 
which it may be classified.
    (b) Nothing in this section, however, shall prevent the Secretary of 
the Interior, personally and not through a delegate, from vacating or 
modifying a final order of the Secretary. In the event that the 
Secretary vacates or modifies a final order within sixty days of the 
date it became final, any preference right of a petitioner-applicant 
will be restored.


<R05>
Sec. 2450.7  Right to occupy or settle.

    The filing of a petition-application gives no right to occupy or 
settle upon the land. A person shall be entitled to the possession and 
use of land only after his entry, selection, or location has been 
allowed, or a lease has been issued. Settlement on the land prior to 
that time constitutes a trespass.


<R05>
Sec. 2450.8  Preference right of petitioner-applicant.

    Where public land is classified for entry under section 7 of the 
Taylor Grazing Act or under the Small Tract Act pursuant to a petition-
application

[[Page 107]]

filed under this part, the petitioner-applicant is entitled to a 
preference right of entry, if qualified. If, however, it should be 
necessary thereafter for any reason to reject the application of the 
preference right claimant, the next petitioner-applicant in order of 
filing shall succeed to the preference right. If there is no other 
petitioner-applicant the land may be opened to application by all 
qualified individuals on an equal-opportunity basis after public notice 
or the classification may be revoked by the authorized officer.

    (b) The segregative effect of a proposed classification will 
terminate in one of the following ways:
    (1) Classification of the lands within 2 years of publication of the 
notice of proposed classification in the Federal Register;
    (2) Publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination 
of the proposed classification;
    (3) An Act of Congress;
    (4) Expiration of a 2-year period from the date of publication of

terminate in one of the following ways:
    (1) Reclassification of the lands for some form of disposal;
    (2) Publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination 
of the classification;
    (3) An Act of Congress;
    (4) Expiration of the classification.

<R05>
Sec. 2462.0-3  Authority.

    Section 2 of the Classification and Multiple Use Act of September 
19, 1964 (78 Stat. 986, 43 U.S.C. 1412), requires the Secretary of the 
Interior to take certain actions when he proposes the classification for 
sale or other disposal under any statute of a tract of land in excess of 
2,560 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 2462.1  Publication of notice of, and public hearings on, proposed classification.

    The authorized officer shall publish a notice of his proposed 
classification in the Federal Register and an announcement in a 
newspaper having general circulation in the area or areas in the 
vicinity of the affected land. The notice shall include the legal 
description of the affected land, the law or laws under which the lands 
would be disposed of together with such other information as the 
authorized officer deems pertinent. Copies of the notice will be sent to 
the head of the governing body of the political subdivision of the 
State, if any, having jurisdiction over zoning in the geographic area 
within which the affected lands are located, the governor of that State 
and the BLM multiple use advisory board in that State, the land-use 
planning officer and land-use planning committees, if any, of the 
county, in which the affected lands are located, the authorized user or 
users of the lands or their selected representatives, all petitioner-
applicants involved, and any other party the authorized officer 
determines to have an interest in the proper use of the lands. The 
authorized officer will hold a public hearing on the proposal if (a) the 
proposed classification will affect more than 25,000 acres or (b) he 
determines that sufficient public interest exists to warrant the time 
and expense of a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 2462.2  Publication of notice of classification.

    After having considered the comments received as the result of 
publication, the authorized officer may classify the lands any time 
after the expiration of 60 days following the publication of the 
proposed classification in the Federal Register. The authorized officer 
shall publicize the classification in the same manner as the proposed 
classification was publicized, indicating in the notice the differences, 
if

[[Page 109]]

any, between the proposed classification and the classification.


<R05>
Sec. 2462.3  Administrative review.

    For a period of 30 days after publication in the Federal Register of 
a notice of classification for disposal, the classification shall be 
subject to the exercise of supervisory authority by the Secretary of the 
Interior for the purpose of administrative review. If, 30 days from date 
of publication, the Secretary has neither on his own motion, on motion 
of any protestant or the State Director exercised supervisory authority 
for review, the classification shall become the final order of the 
Secretary. The exercise of supervisory authority by the Secretary shall 
automatically vacate the classification and reinstate the proposed 
classification together with its segregative effect. In this event the 
final departmental decision shall be issued by the Secretary and 
published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 2462.4  Segregative effect of publication.

    (a) Publication in the Federal Register of a notice of proposed 
classification pursuant to Sec. 2462.1 or of a notice of classification 
pursuant to Sec. 2462.2 will segregate the affected land from all forms 
of disposal under the public land laws, including the mining laws except 
the form or forms of disposal for which it is proposed to classify the 
lands. However, publication will not alter the applicability of the 
public land laws governing the use of the lands under lease, license, or 
permit, or governing the disposal of their mineral and vegetative 
resources, other than under the mining laws.
    (b) The segregative effect of a proposed classification will 
terminate in one of the following ways:
    (1) Classification of the lands within 2 years of publication of the 
notice of proposed classification in the Federal Register;
    (2) Publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination 
of the proposed classification;
    (3) An Act of Congress;
    (4) Expiration of a 2-year period from the date of publication of 
the notice of proposed classification without continuance as prescribed 
by the Classification and Multiple Use Act of September 19, 1964 (78 
Stat. 986, 43 U.S.C. 1411-18), or expiration of an additional period, 
not exceeding 2 years, if the required notice of proposed continuance is 
given.
    (c) The segregative effect of a classification for sale or other 
disposal will terminate in one of the following ways:
    (1) Disposal of the lands;
    (2) Publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination 
of the classification;
    (3) An Act of Congress;
    (4) Expiration of 2 years from the date of publication of the 
proposed classification without disposal of the land and without the 
notice of proposed continuance as prescribed by the Classification and 
Multiple Use Act; or
    (5) Expiration of an additional period, not exceeding 2 years, if 
the required notice of proposed continuance is given.

    The Act of March 3, 1877 (19 Stat. 377; 43 U.S.C. 321-323) as 
amended by the Act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1096; 43 U.S.C. 231, 323, 
325, 327-329), provides for the making of desert-land entries in the 
States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and 
Wyoming.


<R05>
Sec. 2520.0-5  Definitions.

    (a) As used in the desert-land laws and the regulations of this 
subpart:

[[Page 111]]

    (1) Reclamation requires conducting water in adequate amounts and 
quality to the land so as to render it available for distribution when 
needed for irrigation and cultivation.
    (2) Cultivation requires the operation, practice, or act of tillage 
or preparation of land for seed, and keeping the ground in a state 
favorable for the growth of crops.
    (3) Irrigation requires the application of water to land for the 
purpose of growing crops.
    (4) Crop includes any agricultural product to which the land under 
consideration is generally adapted and which would return a fair reward 
for the expense of producing it.
    (5) Water supply, to be adequate, must be sufficient to irrigate 
successfully and to reclaim all of the irrigable land embraced in an 
entry.
    (6) Water right means the authority, whether by prior ownership, 
contract, purchase, or appropriation in accordance with state law, to 
use water on the land to be irrigated.

reclamation projects, see Sec. 2524.5(a).
    (b) For provisions under Appeals and Hearings see parts 1840 and 
1850 of this chapter.
    (c) For relinquishments, in general, see subpart 1825 of this 
chapter.

laws, see Sec. 2511.4-2(a).


<R05>
Sec. 2520.0-8  Land subject to disposition.

    (a) Land that may be entered as desert land. (1) As the desert-land 
law requires the artificial irrigation of any land entered thereunder, 
lands which are not susceptible of irrigation by practicable means are 
not deemed subject to entry as desert lands. The question as to whether 
any particular tract sought to be entered as desert land is in fact 
irrigable from the source proposed by the applicant will be investigated 
and determined before the application for entry is allowed. In order to 
be subject to entry under the desert-land law, public lands must be not 
only irrigable but also surveyed, unreserved, unappropriated, non-
mineral (except lands withdrawn, classified, or valuable for coal, 
phosphate, nitrate, potash, sodium, sulphur, oil, gas or asphaltic 
minerals, which may be entered with a reservation of such mineral 
deposits, as explained in subpart 2093, nontimbered, and such as will 
not, without artificial irrigation, produce any reasonably remunerative 
agricultural crop by the usual means or methods of cultivation. In this 
latter class are those lands which, one year with another for a series 
of years, will not without irrigation produce paying crops, but on which 
crops can be successfully grown in alternate years by means of the so-
called dry-farming system. (37 L.D. 522 and 42 L.D. 524.)
    (2) Applications to make desert-land entries of lands embraced in 
applications, permits, or leases under the Act of February 25, 1920 (41 
Stat. 437), if in all other respects complete, will be treated in 
accordance with Secs. 2093.0-3 to 2093.0-7. Applications to make desert-
land entries of lands within a naval petroleum reserve must be rejected, 
as no desert-land entry may be allowed for such lands.
    (3) Land that has been effectually reclaimed is not subject to 
desert land entry.
    (b) Quantity of lands that may be entered. An entry of lands under 
the Act of March 3, 1877, is limited to 320 acres, subject to the 
following additional limitations:
    (1) An entry of lands within an irrigation district which the 
Secretary of the Interior or his delegate has approved under the Act of 
August 11, 1916 (39 Stat. 506; 43 U.S.C. 621-630), is limited to 160 
acres.
    (2) An entryman may have a desert-land entry for such a quantity of 
land as, taken together with all land acquired and claimed by him under 
the other agricultural land laws since August 30, 1890, does not exceed 
320 acres in the aggregate, or 480 acres if he shall have made an 
enlarged homestead entry of 320 acres (Acts of August 30, 1890; 26 Stat. 
391; 43 U.S.C. 212; and of February 27, 1917; 39 Stat. 946; 43 U.S.C. 
330).
    (c) Entries restricted to surveyed lands. Unsurveyed public land 
withdrawn by Executive Orders 6910 and 6964 of November 26, 1934, and 
February 5, 1935,

[[Page 112]]

respectively, is not subject to appropriation, under the desert-land 
laws, until such appropriation has been authorized by classification. 
(See parts 2410, 2420, and 2430.)
    (d) Economic unit requirements, compactness. (1) One or more tracts 
of public lands may be included in a desert land entry and the tracts so 
entered need not be contiguous. All the tracts entered, however, shall 
be sufficiently close to each other to be managed satisfactorily as an 
economic unit. In addition, the lands in the entry must be in as compact 
a form as possible taking into consideration the character of available 
public lands and the effect of allowance of the entry on the remaining 
public lands in the area.
    (2) In addition to the other requirements of the regulations in this 
part, applicants for desert land entry must submit with their 
applications information showing that the tracts applied for are 
sufficiently close to each other to be managed satisfactorily as an 
economic unit and that the lands in the application are as compact as 
possible in the circumstances.
    (3) In determining whether an entry can be allowed in the form 
sought, the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will 
take into consideration such factors as the topography of the applied 
for and adjoining lands, the availability of public lands near the lands 
sought, the private lands farmed by the applicant, the farming systems 
and practices common to the locality and the character of the lands 
sought, and the practicability of farming the lands as an economically 
feasible operating unit.

                        Subpart 2521--Procedures

    Source: 35 FR 9582, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.1  Who may make desert-land entry.

    (a) Citizenship. (1) Any citizen of the United States 21 years of 
age, or any person of that age who has declared his intention of 
becoming a citizen of the United States, and who can truthfully make the 
statements specified in Secs. 2520.0-8(c) and 2521.2(a) can make a 
desert-land entry. Thus, a woman, whether married or single, who 
possesses the necessary qualifications, can make a desert-land entry, 
and, if married, without taking into consideration any entries her 
husband may have made.
    (2) At the time of making final proof claimants of alien birth must 
have been admitted to citizenship, but evidence of naturalization need 
not be furnished if it has already been filed in connection with the 
original declaration or with the proof of an assignment of the entry.
    (b) Second and additional entries. A person's right of entry under 
the desert-land law is exhausted either by filing an allowable 
application and withdrawing it prior to its allowance or by making an 
entry or by taking an assignment of an entry, in whole or in part, 
except under the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 
this section.
    (1) Under the Act of September 5, 1914 (38 Stat. 712; 43 U.S.C. 
182), if a person, otherwise duly qualified to make a desert-land entry, 
has previously filed an allowable application, or made such entry or 
entries and through no fault of his own has lost, forfeited, or 
abandoned the same, such person may make another entry. In such case, 
however, it must be shown that the prior application, entry, or entries 
were made in good faith, and were lost, forfeited, or abandoned because 
of matters beyond the applicant's control, and that the applicant has 
not speculated in his right, nor committed a fraud or attempted fraud in 
connection with such prior entry or entries. As the assignment of an 
entry involves no loss, forfeiture, or abandonment thereof, but carries 
a benefit to the assignor, it is held to exhaust his right of entry 
under the desert-land law. Hence, no person who has assigned such entry, 
in whole or in part, will be permitted to make another entry or to take 
one or any part thereof by assignment except where paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section applies.
    (2) The Act of June 16, 1955 (69 Stat. 138) authorizes any person 
who prior to June 16, 1955, made a valid desert-land entry on lands 
subject to the Acts of June 22, 1910 (36 Stat. 583; 30 U.S.C. 33-85), or 
of July 17, 1914 (38 Stat. 509; 30

[[Page 113]]

U.S.C. 121-123), if otherwise qualified to enter as a personal privilege 
not assignable, an additional tract of desert land, providing such 
additional tract shall not, together with the original entry, exceed 320 
acres. Applicants and entrymen under the Act of June 16, 1955, are 
subject to, and must comply with, all the regulations of this part, 
including the acreage limitations of Sec. 2520.0-8(b).


<R05>
Sec. 2521.2  Petitions and applications.

    (a) Filing and fees. (1) A person who desires to enter public lands 
under the desert land laws must file an application together with a 
petition on forms approved by the Director, properly executed. However, 
if the lands described in the application have been already classified 
and opened for disposition under the desert land laws, no petition is 
required. The documents must be filed in the proper office (see 
Sec. 1821.2-1 of this chapter).
    (2) All applications must be accompanied by an application service 
fee of $15 which is not returnable, and the payment of 25 cents per acre 
for the lands therein described as required by law.
    (b) Post-office addresses of applicants and witnesses. Applicants 
and witnesses must in all cases state their places of actual residence, 
their business or occupation, and their post-office addresses. It is not 
sufficient to name only the county or State in which a person lives, but 
the town or city must be named also; and where the residence is in a 
city the street and number must be given. It is especially important to 
claimants that upon changing their post-office addresses they promptly 
notify the authorizing officer of such change, for in case of failure to 
do so their entries may be canceled upon notice sent to the address of 
record but not received by them.
    (c) Execution of applications and proofs; time for filing of 
applications. (1) Applications and proofs, except final proofs required 
by R.S. 2294 (43 U.S.C. 254), must be signed by the applicants but need 
not be under oath. Final proofs may be executed before any officer 
authorized to administer oaths in public land cases, as explained by 
Sec. 1821.3-2 of this chapter.
    (2) An application to make desert-land entry is not acceptable if 
dated more than 10 days before its filing at the land office.
    (d) Evidence of water rights required with application. No desert-
land application will be allowed unless accompanied by evidence 
satisfactorily showing either that the intending entryman has already 
acquired by appropriation, purchase, or contract a right to the 
permanent use of sufficient water to irrigate and reclaim all of the 
irrigable portion of the land sought, or that he has initiated and 
prosecuted, as far as then possible, appropriate steps looking to the 
acquisition of such a right, or, in States where no permit or right to 
appropriate water is granted until the land embraced within the 
application is classified as suitable for desert-land entry or the entry 
is allowed, a showing that the applicant is otherwise qualified under 
State law to secure such permit or right. If applicant intends to 
procure water from an irrigation district, corporation, or association, 
but is unable to obtain a contract for the water in advance of the 
allowance of his entry, then he must furnish, in lieu of the contract, 
some written assurance from the responsible officials of such district, 
corporation, or association that, if his entry be allowed, applicant 
will be able to obtain from that source the necessary water. The 
authorizing officer will examine the evidence submitted in such 
applications and either reject defective applications or require 
additional evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.3  Assignment.

    (a) Lands which may be assigned. While by the Act of March 3, 1891 
(26 Stat. 1096; 43 U.S.C. 329), assignments of desert-land entries were 
recognized, the Department of the Interior, largely for administrative 
reasons, held that a desert-land entry might be assigned as a whole or 
in its entirety, but refused to recognize the assignment of only a 
portion of an entry. The Act of March 28, 1908, however, provides for an 
assignment of such entries, in whole or in part, but this does not mean 
that less than a legal subdivision may be assigned. Therefore no 
assignment, otherwise than by legal subdivisions, will

[[Page 114]]

be recognized. The legal subdivisions assigned must be contiguous.
    (b) Qualifications of assignees. (1) The Act of March 28, 1908, also 
provides that no person may take a desert-land entry by assignment 
unless he is qualified to enter the tract so assigned to him. Therefore, 
if a person is not at least 21 years of age and, excepting Nevada, a 
resident citizen of the State wherein the land involved is located; or 
if he is not a ciitzen of the United States, or a person who has 
declared his intention to become a citizen thereof; or, if he has made a 
desert-land entry in his own right and is not entitled under Sec. 2521.1 
to make a second or an additional entry, he cannot take such an entry by 
assignment. The language of the act indicates that the taking of an 
entry by assignment is equivalent to the making of an entry, and this 
being so, no person is allowed to take more than one entry by 
assignment, unless it be done as the exercise of a right of second or 
additional entry.
    (2) A person who has the right to make a second or additional 
desert-land entry may exercise that right by taking an assignment of a 
desert-land entry, or part of such entry, if he is otherwise qualified 
to make a desert-land entry for the particular tract assigned.
    (3) The Act of March 28, 1908, also provides that no assignment to 
or for the benefit of any corporation shall be authorized or recognized.
    (c) Showing required of assignees; recognition of assignments. (1) 
As evidence of the assignment there should be transmitted to the 
authorizing officer the original deed of assignment or a certified copy 
thereof. Where the deed of assignment is recorded a certified copy may 
be made by the officer who has custody of the record. Where the original 
deed is presented to an officer qualified to take proof in desert-land 
cases, a copy certified by such officer will be accepted.
    (2) An assignee must file with his deed of assignment, a statement 
on a form approved by the Director, showing his qualifications to take 
the entry assigned to him. He must show what applications or entries, if 
any, have been made by him or what entries assigned to him under the 
agricultural public land laws, and he must also show his qualifications 
as a citizen of the United States; that he is 21 years of age or over; 
and also that he is a resident citizen of the State in which the land 
assigned to him is situated, except in the State of Nevada, where 
citizenship of the United States only is required. If the assignee is 
not a native-born citizen of the United States, he should also furnish a 
statement as to his citizenship status in accordance with subpart 1811 
of this chapter. If the assignee is a woman, she should in all cases 
state whether she is married, and if so, she must make the showing 
required by subpart 1811 of this chapter. Desert-land entries are 
initiated by the payment of 25 cents per acre, and no assignable right 
is acquired by the application prior to such payment. (6 L.D. 541, 33 
L.D. 152.) An assignment made on the day of such payment, or soon 
thereafter, is treated as suggesting fraud, and such cases will be 
carefully scrutinized. The provisions of law authorizing the assignment 
of desert entries, in whole or in part, furnish no authority to a 
claimant under said law to make an executory contract to convey the land 
after the issuance of patent and thereafter to proceed with the 
submission of final proof in furtherance of such contract. (34 L.D. 
383.) The sale of land embraced in an entry at any time before final 
payment is made must be regarded as an assignment of the entry, and in 
such cases the person buying the land must show that he possesses all 
the qualifications required of an assignee. (29 L.D. 453.) The assignor 
of a desert-land entry may execute the assignment before any officer 
authorized to take acknowledgements of deeds. The assignee must furnish 
a statement on a form approved by the Director as to his qualifications.
    (3) No assignments of desert-land entries or parts of entries are 
conclusive until examined in the proper office and found satisfactory 
and the assignment recognized. When recognized, however, the assignee 
takes the place of the assignor as effectively as though he had made the 
entry, and is subject to any requirement that may be made relative 
thereto. The assignment of a desert-

[[Page 115]]

land entry to one disqualified to acquire title under the desert-land 
law, and to whom, therefore, recognition of the assignment is refused by 
the authorizing officer, does not of itself render the entry fraudulent, 
but leaves the right thereto in the assignor. In such connection, 
however, see 42 L.D. 90 and 48 L.D. 519.
    (4) All applications for recognition of assignment of desert-land 
entries must be accompanied by an application service fee of $10 which 
will not be returnable.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.4  When lands may be sold, taxed, or mortgaged.

    (a) After final proof and payment have been made the land may be 
sold and conveyed to another person without the approval of the Bureau 
of Land Management, but all such conveyances are nevertheless subject to 
the superior rights of the United States, and the title so contained 
would fall if it should be finally determined that the entry was illegal 
or that the entryman had failed to comply with the law.
    (b) Lands embraced in unperfected desert-land entries are not 
subject to taxation by the State authorities, nor to levy and sale under 
execution to satisfy judgments against the entrymen, except as 
hereinafter set forth in this section.
    (c) Lands embraced in desert-land entries within an irrigation 
district which the Secretary of the Interior has approved under the Act 
of August 11, 1916 (39 Stat. 506; 43 U.S.C. 621-630), may be taxed and 
otherwise dealt with as provided by said act, and lands in desert-land 
entries within irrigation projects constructed under the Reclamation Act 
may be taxed as provided for by the Act of June 13, 1930 (46 Stat. 581; 
43 U.S.C. 455, 455a-455c).
    (d) A desert-land entryman may, however, mortgage his interest in 
the entered land if, by the laws of the State in which the land is 
situated, a mortgage of land is regarded as merely creating a lien 
thereon and not as a conveyance thereof. The purchaser at a sale had for 
the foreclosure of such mortgage may be recognized as assignee upon 
furnishing proof of his qualifications to take a desert-land entry by 
assignment. Transferees, after final proof, mortgagees, or other 
encumbrancers may file in the proper office written notice stating the 
nature of their claims, and they will there upon become entitled to 
receive notice of any action taken by the Bureau of Land Management with 
reference to the entry.
    (e) The filing of all notices of recordation of claim by 
transferees, mortgagees or other encumbrancer under this section must be 
accompanied by a service charge of $10 which will not be returnable.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.5  Annual proof.

    (a) Showing required. (1) In order to test the sincerity and good 
faith of claimants under the desert-land laws and to prevent the 
segregation for a number of years of public lands in the interest of 
persons who have no intention to reclaim them, Congress, in the Act of 
March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1096; 43 U.S.C. 327, 328) made the requirement 
that a map be filed at the initiation of the entry showing the mode of 
contemplated irrigation and the proposed source of water supply, and 
that there be expended yearly for 3 years from the date of the entry not 
less than $1 for each acre of the tract entered, making a total of not 
less than $3 per acre, in the necessary irrigation, reclamation, and 
cultivation of the land, in permanent improvements thereon, and in the 
purchase of water rights for the irrigation thereof, and that at the 
expiration of the third year a map or plan be filed showing the 
character and extent of the improvements placed on the claim. Said act, 
however, authorizes the submission of final proof at an earlier date 
than 4 years from the time the entry is made in cases wherein 
reclamation has been effected and expenditures of not less than $3 per 
acre have been made.
    (2) Yearly or annual proof of expenditures must consist of the 
statements of two or more credible witnesses, each of whom must have 
general knowledge that the expenditures were made for the purpose stated 
in the proof. Annual proofs must contain itemized statements showing the 
manner in which expenditures were made.
    (b) Acceptable expenditures. (1) Expenditures for the construction 
and maintenance of storage reservoirs,

[[Page 116]]

dams, canals, ditches, and laterals to be used by claimant for 
irrigating his land; for roads where they are necessary; for erecting 
stables, corrals, etc.; for digging wells, where the water therefrom is 
to be used for irrigating the land; for stock or interest in an approved 
irrigation company, or for taxes paid to an approved irrigation district 
through which water is to be secured to irrigate the land; and for 
leveling and bordering land proposed to be irrigated, will be accepted. 
Expenditures for fencing all or a portion of the claim, for surveying 
for the purpose of ascertaining the levels for canals, ditches, etc., 
and for the first breaking or clearing of the soil are also acceptable.
    (2) The value to be attached to, and the credit to be given for, an 
expenditure for works or improvements is the reasonable value of the 
work done or improvement placed upon the land, according to the market 
price therefor, or for similar work or improvements prevailing in the 
vicinity, and not the amount alleged by a claimant to have been expended 
nor the mere proof of expenditures, as exhibited by checks or other 
vouchers. (Bradley v. Vasold, 36 L.D. 106.)
    (c) Expenditures not acceptable. (1) Expenditures for cultivation 
after the soil has been first prepared may not be accepted, because the 
claimant is supposed to be compensated for such work by the crops to be 
reaped as a result of cultivation. Expenditures for surveying the claim 
in order to locate the corners of same may not be accepted. The cost of 
tools, implements, wagons, and repairs to same, used in construction 
work, may not be computed in cost of construction. Expenditures for 
material of any kind will not be allowed unless such material has 
actually been installed or employed in and for the purpose for which it 
was purchased. For instances, if credit is asked for posts and wire for 
fences or for pump or other well machinery, it must be shown that the 
fence has been actually constructed or the well machinery actually put 
in place. No expenditures can be credited on annual proofs upon a 
desert-land entry unless made on account of that particular entry, and 
expenditures once credited can not be again applied. This rule applies 
to second entries as well as to original entries, and a claimant who 
relinquishes his entry and makes second entry of the same land under the 
Act of September 5, 1914, cannot receive credit on annual proofs upon 
the second entry for expenditures made on account of the former entry. 
(41 L.D. 601 and 42 L.D. 523.)
    (2) Expenditures for the clearing of the land will not receive 
credit in cases where the vegetation or brush claimed to have been 
cleared away has not been actually removed by the roots. Therefore, 
expenditures for clearing, where as a matter of fact there has been only 
crushing, or rolling, or what is known in some localities as railing the 
land will not be accepted.
    (3) No expenditures for stock or interest in an irrigation company, 
through which water is to be secured for irrigating the land, will be 
accepted as satisfactory annual expenditure until a field examiner, or 
other authorized officer, has submitted a report as to the resources and 
reliability of the company, including its actual water right, and such 
report has been favorably acted upon by the Bureau of Land Management. 
The stock purchased must carry the right to water, and it must be shown 
that payment in cash has been made at least to the extent of the amount 
claimed as expenditure for the purchase of such stock in connection with 
the annual proof submitted, and such stock must be actually owned by the 
claimants at the time of the submission of final proof.
    (d) Procedure where proof is not made when due. Authorizing officers 
will examine their records frequently for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether all annual proofs due on pending desert-land entries have been 
made, and in every case where the claimant is in default in that respect 
they will send him notice and allow him 60 days in which to submit such 
proof. If the proof is not furnished as required the entry will be 
canceled. During the pendency of a Government proceeding initiated by 
such notice the entry will be protected against a private contest 
charging failure to make the required expenditures, and such contest 
will neither defeat

[[Page 117]]

the claimant's right to equitably perfect the entry as to the matter of 
expenditures during the 60 days allowed in the notice nor secure to the 
contestant a preference right in event the entry be canceled for default 
under said notice.
    (e) Desert land entry in more than one district. When a desert-land 
entry embraces land in more than one district, the required annual 
proofs may be filed in either district, provided proper reference is 
made to the portion of the entry in the adjoining district, and the 
entryman must notify the authorized officer of the adjoining district by 
letter of the date when the annual proof is filed.
    (f) Extensions of time. (1) The law makes no provision for 
extensions of time in which to file annual proof becoming due subsequent 
to December 31, 1936, on desert-land entries not embraced within the 
exterior boundaries of any withdrawal or irrigation project under the 
Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388), and extensions for said 
purpose cannot therefore be granted. However, where a township is 
suspended from entry for the purpose of resurvey thereof the time 
between the date of suspension and the filing in the local office of the 
new plat of survey will be excluded from the period accorded by law for 
the reclamation of land under a desert entry within such township and 
the statutory life of the entry extended accordingly (40 L.D. 223). 
During the continuance of the extension the claimant may, at his option, 
defer the making of annual expenditures and proof thereof.
    (2) Extensions of time for making desert-land proofs were authorized 
by the Acts of June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 274; 43 U.S.C. 256a), July 26, 
1935 (49 Stat. 504; 43 U.S.C. 256a), and June 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 303; 43 
U.S.C. 256a). Such acts affect only proofs becoming due on or before 
December 31, 1936. For that reason, the regulations which were issued 
thereunder have not been included in this chapter.
    (g) Submission of proof before due date. Nothing in the statutes or 
regulations should be construed to mean that the entryman must wait 
until the end of the year to submit his annual proof because the proof 
may be properly submitted as soon as the expenditures have been made. 
Proof sufficient for the 3 years may be offered whenever the amount of 
$3 an acre has been expended in reclaiming and improving the land, and 
thereafter annual proof will not be required.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.6  Final proof.

    (a) General requirements. The entryman, his assigns, or, in case of 
death, his heirs or devisees, are allowed 4 years from date of the entry 
within which to comply with the requirements of the law as to 
reclamation and cultivation of the land and to submit final proof, but 
final proof may be made and patent thereon issued as soon as there has 
been expended the sum of $3 per acre in improving, reclaiming, and 
irrigating the land, and one-eighth of the entire area entered has been 
properly cultivated and irrigated, and when the requirements of the 
desert-land laws as to water rights and the construction of the 
necessary reservoirs, ditches, dams, etc., have been fully complied 
with.
    (1) Where the proof establishes that the entryman cannot effect 
timely compliance with the law, the entry must be canceled unless 
statutory authority permits the granting of an extension of time or 
other relief.
    (b) Notice of intention to make final proof. When an entryman has 
reclaimed the land and is ready to make final proof, he should apply to 
the authorizing officer for a notice of intention to make such proof. 
This notice must contain a complete description of the land, give the 
number of the entry and name of the claimant, and must bear an 
endorsement specifically indicating the source of his water supply. If 
the proof is made by an assignee, his name, as well as that of the 
original entryman, should be stated. It must also show when, where and 
before whom the proof is to be made. Four witnesses may be named in this 
notice, two of whom must be used in making proof. Care should be 
exercised to select as witnesses persons who are familiar, from personal 
observation, with the land in question, and with what has been done by 
the claimant toward reclaiming and improving it. Care should also be 
taken to ascertain definitely the names and addresses of the proposed 
witnesses, so

[[Page 118]]

that they may correctly appear in the notice.
    (c) Publication of final-proof notice. The authorizing officer will 
issue the usual notice for publication. This notice must be published 
once a week for five successive weeks in a newspaper of established 
character and general circulation published nearest the lands (see 38 
L.D. 131; 43 L.D. 216). The claimant must pay the cost of the 
publication but it is the duty of authorizing officers to procure the 
publication of proper final-proof notices. The date fixed for the taking 
of the proof must be at least 30 days after the date of first 
publication. Proof of publication must be made by the statement of the 
publisher of the newspaper or by someone authorized to act for him.
    (d) Submission of final proof. On the day set in the notice (or, in 
the case of accident or unavoidable delay, within 10 days thereafter), 
and at the place and before the officer designated, the claimant will 
appear with two of the witnesses named in the notice and make proof of 
the reclamation, cultivation, and improvement of the land. The testimony 
of each claimant should be taken separately and apart from and not 
within the hearing of either of his witnesses, and the testimony of each 
witness should be taken separately and apart from and not within the 
hearing of either the applicant or of any other witness, and both the 
applicant and each of the witnesses should be required to state, in and 
as a part of the final-proof testimony given by them, that they have 
given such testimony without any actual knowledge of any statement made 
in the testimony of either of the others. In every instance where, for 
any reason whatever, final proof is not submitted within the 4 years 
prescribed by law, or within the period of an extension granted for 
submitting such proof, a statement should be filed by claimant, with the 
proof, explaining the cause of delay.

The final proof may be made before any officer authorized to administer 
oaths in public land cases, as explained in Sec. 1821.3-2 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Showing as to irrigation system. The final proof must show 
specifically the source and volume of the water supply and how it was 
acquired and how it is maintained. The number, length, and carrying 
capacity of all ditches, canals, conduits, and other means to conduct 
water to and on each of the legal subdivisions must also be shown. The 
claimant and the witnesses must each state in full all that has been 
done in the matter of reclamation and improvements of the land, and must 
answer fully, of their own personal knowledge, all of the questions 
contained in the final-proof blanks. They must state plainly whether at 
any time they saw the land effectually irrigated, and the different 
dates on which they saw it irrigated should be specifically stated.
    (f) Showing as to lands irrigated and reclaimed. While it is not 
required that all of the land shall have been actually irrigated at the 
time final proof is made, it is necessary that the one-eighth portion 
which is required to be cultivated shall also have been irrigated in a 
manner calculated to produce profitable results, considering the 
character of the land, the climate, and the kind of crops being grown. 
(Alonzo B. Cole, 38 L.D. 420.) The cultivation and irrigation of the 
one-eighth portion of the entire area entered may be had in a body on 
one legal subdivision or may be distributed over several subdivisions. 
The final proof must clearly show that all of the permanent main and 
lateral ditches, canals, conduits, and other means to conduct water 
necessary for the irrigation of all the irrigable land in the entry have 
been constructed so that water can be actually applied to the land as 
soon as it is ready for cultivation. If pumping be relied upon as the 
means of irrigation, the plant installed for that purpose must be of 
sufficient capacity to render available enough water for all the 
irrigable land. If there are any high points or any portions of the land 
which for any reason it is not practicable to irrigate, the nature, 
extent, and situation of such areas in each legal subdivision must be 
fully stated. If less than one-eighth of a smallest legal subdivision is 
practically susceptible of irrigation from claimant's source of water 
supply and no portion thereof is used as a necessary part of his 
irrigation scheme, such subdivision must be relinquished. (43 L.D. 269.)

[[Page 119]]

    (g) Showing as to tillage of land. As a rule, actual tillage of one-
eighth of the land must be shown. It is not sufficient to show only that 
there has been a marked increase in the growth of grass or that grass 
sufficient to support stock has been produced on the land as a result of 
irrigation. If, however, on account of some peculiar climatic or soil 
conditions, no crops except grass can be successfully produced, or if 
actual tillage will destroy or injure the productive quality of the 
soil, the actual production of a crop of hay of merchantable value will 
be accepted as sufficient compliance with the requirements as to 
cultivation. (32 L.D. 456.) In such cases, however, the facts must be 
stated and the extent and value of the crop of hay must be shown, and, 
as before stated, that same was produced as a result of actual 
irrigation.
    (h) Showing as to water right. (1) In every case where the 
claimant's water right is founded upon contract or purchase the final 
proof must embrace evidence which clearly establishes the fact and legal 
sufficiency of that right. If claimant's ownership of such right has 
already been evidenced in connection with the original entry or some 
later proceeding, then the final proof must show his continued 
possession thereof. If the water right relied on is obtained under 
claimant's appropriation, the final proof, considered together with any 
evidence previously submitted in the matter, must show that the claimant 
has made such preliminary filings as are required by the laws of the 
State in which the land is located, and that he has also taken all other 
steps necessary under said laws to secure and perfect the claimed water 
right. In all cases the water right, however it be acquired, must 
entitle the claimant to the use of a sufficient supply of water to 
irrigate successfully all the irrigable land embraced in his entry, 
notwithstanding that the final proof need only show the actual 
irrigation of one-eighth of that area.
    (2) In those States where entrymen have made applications for water 
rights and have been granted permits but where no final adjudication of 
the water right can be secured from the State authorities owing to delay 
in the adjudication of the watercourses or other delay for which the 
entrymen are in no way responsible, proof that the entrymen have done 
all that is required of them by the laws of the State, together with 
proof of actual irrigation of one-eighth of the land embraced in their 
entries, may be accepted. This modification of the rule that the 
claimant must furnish evidence of an absolute water right will apply 
only in those States where under the local laws it is impossible for the 
entryman to secure final evidence of title to his water right within the 
time allowed him to submit final proof on his entry, and in such cases 
the best evidence obtainable must be furnished. (35 L.D. 305.)
    (3) It is a well-settled principle of law in all of the States in 
which the desert land acts are operative that actual application to a 
beneficial use of water appropriated from public streams measures the 
extent of the right to the water, and that failure to proceed with 
reasonable diligence to make such application to beneficial use within a 
reasonable time constitutes an abandonment of the right. (Wiel's Water 
Rights in the Western States, sec. 172.) The final proof, therefore, 
must show that the claimant has exercised such diligence as will, if 
continued, under the operation of this rule result in his definitely 
securing a perfect right to the use of sufficient water for the 
permanent irrigation and reclamation of all of the irrigable land in his 
entry. To this end the proof must at least show that water which is 
being diverted from its natural course and claimed for the specific 
purpose of irrigating the lands embraced in claimant's entry, under a 
legal right acquired by virtue of his own or his grantor's compliance 
with the requirements of the State laws governing the appropriation of 
public waters, has actually been conducted through claimant's main 
ditches to and upon the land; that one-eighth of the land embraced in 
the entry has been actually irrigated and cultivated; that water has 
been brought to such a point on the land as to readily demonstrate that 
the entire irrigable area may be irrigated from the system; and that 
claimant is prepared to distribute the water so claimed over all of the 
irrigable land in

[[Page 120]]

each smallest legal subdivision in quantity sufficient for practical 
irrigation as soon as the land shall have been cleared or otherwise 
prepared for cultivation. The nature of the work necessary to be 
performed in and for the preparation for cultivation of such part of the 
land as has not been irrigated should be carefully indicated, and it 
should be shown that the said work of preparation is being prosecuted 
with such diligence as will permit of beneficial application of 
appropriated water within a reasonable time.
    (4) Desert-land claimants should bear in mind that a water right and 
a water supply are not the same thing and that the two are not always or 
necessarily found together. Strictly speaking, a perfect and complete 
water right for irrigation purposes is confined to and limited by the 
area of land that has been irrigated with the water provided thereunder. 
Under the various State laws, however, an inchoate or incomplete right 
may be obtained which is capable of ripening into a perfect right if the 
water is applied to beneficial use with reasonable diligence. A person 
may have an apparent right of this kind for land which he has not 
irrigated, and which, moreover, he never can irrigate because of the 
lack of available water to satisfy his apparent right. Such an imperfect 
right, of course, cannot be viewed as meeting the requirements of the 
desert-land law which contemplates the eventual reclamation of all the 
irrigable land in the entry. Therefore, and with special reference to 
that portion of the irrigable land of an entry not required to be 
irrigated and cultivated before final proof, an incomplete (though real) 
water right will not be acceptable if its completion appears to be 
impossible because there is no actual supply of water available under 
the appropriation in question.
    (i) Showing where water supply is derived from irrigation project. 
(1) Where the water right claimed in any final proof is derived from an 
irrigation project it must be shown that the entryman owns such an 
interest therein as entitles him to receive from the irrigation works of 
the project a supply of water sufficient for the proper irrigation of 
the land embraced in his entry. Investigations by field examiners as to 
the resources and reliability, including particularly the source and 
volume of the water supply, of all irrigation companies associations, 
and districts through which desert-land entrymen seek to acquire water 
rights for the reclamation of their lands are made, and it is the 
purpose of the Bureau of Land Management to accept no annual or final 
proofs based upon such a water right until an investigation of the 
company in question has been made and report thereon approved. The 
information so acquired will be regarded as determining, at least 
tentatively, the amount of stock or interest which is necessary to give 
the entryman a right to a sufficient supply of water; but the entryman 
will be permitted to challenge the correctness of the report as to the 
facts alleged and the validity of its conclusions and to offer either 
with his final proof or subsequently such evidence as he can tending to 
support his contentions.
    (2) Entrymen applying to make final proof are required to state the 
source of their water supply, and if water is to be obtained from the 
works of an irrigation company, association, or district the authorizing 
officer will endorse the name and address of the project upon the copy 
of the notice to be forwarded to the State Director. If the report on 
the company has been acted upon by the Bureau of Land Management and the 
proof submitted by claimant does not show that he owns the amount of 
stock or interest in the company found necessary for the area of land to 
be reclaimed, the authorizing officer will suspend the proof, advise the 
claimant of the requirements made by the Bureau of Land Management in 
connection with the report, and allow him 30 days within which to comply 
therewith or to make an affirmative showing in duplicate and apply for a 
hearing. In default of any action by him within the specified time the 
authorizing officer will reject the proof, subject to the usual right of 
appeal.
    (j) Final-proof expiration notice. (1) Where final proof is not made 
within the period of 4 years, or within the period for which an 
extension of time has

[[Page 121]]

been granted, the claimant will be allowed 90 days in which to submit 
final proof. (44 L.D. 364.)
    (2) Should no action be taken within the time allowed, the entry 
will be canceled. The 90 days provided for in this section must not be 
construed as an extension of time or as relieving the claimant from the 
necessity of explaining why the proof was not made within the statutory 
period or within such extensions of that period as have been 
specifically granted.
    (k) Requirements where township is suspended for resurvey. No 
claimant will be required to submit final proof while the township 
embracing his entry is under suspension for the purpose of resurvey. (40 
L.D. 223.) This also applies to annual proof. In computing the time when 
final proof on an entry so affected will become due the period between 
the date of suspension and the filing in the local office of the new 
plat of survey will be excluded. However, if the claimant so elects, he 
may submit final proof on such entry notwithstanding the suspension of 
the township.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.7  Amendments.

    (a) To enlarge area of desert-land entry. Amendment for the purpose 
of enlarging the area of a desert-land entry will be granted under and 
in the conditions and circumstances now to be stated.
    (1) In any case where it is satisfactorily disclosed that entry was 
not made to embrace the full area which might lawfully have been 
included therein because of existing appropriations of all contiguous 
lands then appearing to be susceptible of irrigation through and by 
means of entryman's water supply, or of all such lands which seemed to 
be worthy of the expenditure requisite for that purpose, said lands 
having since been released from such appropriations.
    (2) Where contiguous tracts have been omitted from entry because of 
entryman's belief, after a reasonably careful investigation, that they 
could not be reclaimed by means of the water supply available for use in 
that behalf, it having been subsequently discovered that reclamation 
thereof can be effectively accomplished by means of a changed plan or 
method of conserving or distributing such water supply.
    (3) Where, at the time of entry, the entryman announced, in his 
declaration, his purpose to procure the cancellation, through contest or 
relinquishment, of an entry embracing lands contiguous to those entered 
by him, and thereafter to seek amendment of his entry in such manner as 
to embrace all or some portion of the lands so discharged from entry.
    (b) Conditions governing amendments in exercise of equitable powers; 
amendments involving homestead and desert-land entries of adjoining 
lands. Applications for amendment presented pursuant to Sec. 1821.6-5(a) 
of this chapter will not be granted, except where at least one legal 
subdivision of the lands originally entered is retained in the amended 
entry, and any such application must be submitted within 1 year next 
after discovery by the entryman of the existence of the conditions 
relied upon as entitling him to the relief he seeks, or within 1 year 
succeeding the date on which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, 
the existence of such conditions might have been discovered: Provided, 
nevertheless, That where an applicant for amendment has made both 
homestead and desert land entries for contiguous lands, amendment may be 
granted whereby to transfer the desert-land entry, in its entirety, to 
the land covered by the homestead entry, and the homestead entry, in its 
entirety, to the land covered by the desert-land entry, or whereby to 
enlarge the desert-land entry in such manner as that it will include the 
whole or some portion of the lands embraced in the homestead entry, 
sufficient equitable reason for such enlargement being exhibited, and 
the area of the enlarged entry in no case exceeding 320 acres. 
Applications for such amendments may be made under Secs. 1821.6-1 to 
1821.6-5 of this chapter and on the prescribed form, in so far as the 
same are applicable. A supplemental statement should also be furnished, 
if necessary, to show the facts.
    (c) Evidence of water-right to accompany application to amend 
desert-land entry. Application to amend desert-land entries by the 
addition of a new and enlarged area or by transferring the

[[Page 122]]

entry to lands not originally selected for entry must be accompanied by 
evidence of applicant's right to the use of water sufficient for the 
adequate irrigation of said enlarged area or of the lands to which entry 
is to be transferred. Such evidence must be in the form prescribed by 
Sec. 2521.2.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.8  Contests.

    (a) Contests may be initiated by any person seeking to acquire title 
to or claiming an interest in the land involved against a party to any 
desert-land entry because of priority of claim or for any sufficient 
cause affecting the legality or validity of the claim not shown by the 
records of the Bureau of Land Management.
    (b) Successful contestants will be allowed a preference right of 
entry for 30 days after notice of the cancellation of the contested 
entry, in the same manner as in homestead cases, and the authorizing 
officer will give the same notice and is entitled to the same fee for 
notice as in other cases.


<R05>
Sec. 2521.9  Relinquishments.

    A desert-land entry may be relinquished at any time by the party 
owning the same. Conditional relinquishments will not be accepted.

    Source: 35 FR 9587, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2522.1  General acts authorizing extensions of time.

    (a) There are five general Acts of Congress which authorize the 
allowance, under certain conditions, of an extension of time for the 
submission of final proof by a desert-land claimant. Said Acts are the 
following: June 27, 1906 (Sec. 5, 34 Stat. 520; 43 U.S.C. 448); March 
28, 1908 (Sec. 3, 35 Stat. 52; 43 U.S.C. 333); April 30, 1912 (37 Stat. 
106; 43 U.S.C. 334); March 4, 1915 (Sec. 5, 38 Stat. 1161; 43 U.S.C. 
335); and February 25, 1925 (43 Stat. 982; 43 U.S.C. 336). The Act of 
June 27, 1906, is applicable only to entries embraced within the 
exterior limits of some withdrawal or irrigation project under the 
Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388).
    (b) In addition to the Acts cited in this section, extensions of 
time for making desert-land proofs were authorized by the Acts of June 
16, 1933 (48 Stat. 274; 43 U.S.C. 256a), July 26, 1935 (49 Stat. 504; 43 
U.S.C. 256a), and June 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 303; 43 U.S.C. 256a). Such 
Acts affect only proofs becoming due on or before December 31, 1936. For 
that reason, the regulations which were issued thereunder have not been 
included in this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 2522.2  Procedure on applications for extensions of time, where contest is pending.

    (a) A pending contest against a desert-land entry will not prevent 
the allowance of an application for extension of time, where the contest 
affidavit does not charge facts tending to overcome the prima facie 
showing of right to such extension (41 L.D. 603).
    (b) Consideration of an application for extension of time will not 
be deferred because of the pendency of a contest against the entry in 
question unless the contest charges be sufficient, if proven, to 
negative the right of the entryman to an extension of time for making 
final proof. If the contest charges be insufficient, the application for 
extension, where regular in all respects, will be allowed and the 
contest dismissed subject to the right of appeal, but without prejudice 
to the contestant's right to amend his charges.


<R05>
Sec. 2522.3  Act of March 28, 1908.

    Under the provisions of the Act of March 28, 1908 (35 Stat. 52; 43 
U.S.C. 333), the period of 4 years may be extended, in the discretion of 
the authorized officer, for an additional period not exceeding 3 years, 
if, by reason of some unavoidable delay in the construction of the 
irrigating works intended to convey water to the land, the entryman is 
unable to make proof of reclamation and cultivation required within the 
4 years. This does not mean that the period within which proof may be 
made will be extended as a matter of course for 3 years. Applications 
for extension under said act will not be granted unless it be clearly 
shown that the failure to reclaim and cultivate the land within the 
regular period of 4

[[Page 123]]

years was due to no fault on the part of the entryman but to some 
unavoidable delay in the construction of the irrigation works for which 
he was not responsible and could not have readily foreseen (37 L.D. 
332). It must also appear that he has complied with the law as to annual 
expenditures and proof thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 2522.4  Act of April 30, 1912.

    (a) Under the provisions of the Act of April 30, 1912 (37 Stat. 106; 
43 U.S.C. 334), a further extension of time may be granted for 
submitting final proof, not exceeding 3 years, where it is shown that, 
because of some unavoidable delay in the construction of irrigation 
works intended to convey water to the land embraced in his entry, the 
claimant is, without fault on his part, unable to make proof of the 
reclamation and cultivation of said lands within the time limited 
therefor, but such further extension cannot be granted for a period of 
more than 3 years nor affect contests initiated for a valid existing 
reason.
    (b) An entryman who has complied with the law as to annual 
expenditures and proof thereof and who desires to make application for 
extension of time under the provisions of the Act of March 28, 1908, 
should file with the authorizing officer a statement setting forth fully 
the facts, showing how and why he has been prevented from making final 
proof of reclamation and cultivation within the regular period. This 
statement must be corroborated by two witnesses who have personal 
knowledge of the facts.


<R05>
Sec. 2522.5  Act of February 25, 1925.

    Applications for further extension of time under the Act of April 
30, 1912, and February 25, 1925 (43 Stat. 982; 43 U.S.C. 336), may be 
made in the same manner, and the same procedure will be followed with 
respect to such applications as under the Act of March 28, 1908, and the 
Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1161; 43 U.S.C. 335), as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 2522.6  Service fees.

    All applications for extension of time made under the Acts of March 
28, 1908, April 30, 1912, or February 25, 1925, must be accompanied by 
an application service fee of $10 which will not be returnable.

                         Subpart 2523--Payments


<R05>
Sec. 2523.1  Collection of purchase money and fees; issuance of final certificate.

    (a) At the time of making final proof the claimant must pay to the 
authorizing officer the sum of $1 per acre for each acre of land upon 
which proof is made. This, together with the 25 cents per acre paid at 
the time of making the original entry, will amount to $1.25 per acre, 
which is the price to be paid for all lands entered under the desert 
land law.
    (b) If the entryman is dead and proof is made by anyone for the 
heirs, no will being suggested in the record, the final certificate 
should issue to the heirs generally, without naming them; if by anyone 
for the heirs or devisees, final certificate should issue in like manner 
to the heirs or devisees.
    (c) When final proof is made on an entry made prior to the Act of 
March 28, 1908 (35 Stat. 52; 43 U.S.C. 324, 326, 333), for unsurveyed 
land, if the land is still unsurveyed and such proof is satisfactory, 
the authorizing officer will approve same without collecting the final 
payment of $1 an acre and without issuing final certificate. Fees for 
reducing the final-proof testimony to writing should be collected and 
receipt issued therefor if the proof is taken before the authorizing 
officer. As soon as the plat or plats of any township or townships 
previously unsurveyed are filed in the proper office the authorizing 
office will examine his records for the purpose of determining, if 
possible, whether or not, prior to the passage of the Act of March 28, 
1908, any desert-land entry of unsurveyed land was allowed in the 
locality covered by the said plats; and if any such entries are found 
intact, he will call upon the claimants thereof to file a statement of 
adjustment, corroborated by two witnesses, giving the correct 
description, in accordance with the survey of the lands embraced in 
their respective entries.
    (d) If the final proof has been made upon any desert-land entry so 
adjusted and the records show that such proof

[[Page 124]]

has been found satisfactory and no conflicts or other objections are 
apparent, the manager will allow claimant 60 days within which to make 
final payment for the land.

[35 FR 9588, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 2523.2  Amounts to be paid.

    No fees or commissions are required of persons making entry under 
the desert land laws except such fees as are paid to the officers for 
taking the affidavits and proofs. Unless the entry be perfected under 
the Act of February 14, 1934 (48 Stat. 349; 43 U.S.C. 339), the only 
payments made to the Government are the original payment of 25 cents an 
acre at the time of making the application and the final payment of $1 
an acre, to be paid at the time of making the final proof. On all final 
proofs made before the authorizing officer, the claimant must pay to the 
authorizing officer the costs of reducing the testimony to writing, as 
determined by the authorizing officer. No proof shall be accepted or 
approved until all charges have been paid.

Sec. 2524.1  Conditions excusing entrymen from compliance with the desert-land laws.

    (a) By section 5 of the Act of June 27, 1906 (34 Stat. 520, 43 
U.S.C. 448), it is provided that any desert-land entryman who has been 
or may be directly or indirectly hindered or prevented from making 
improvements on or from reclaiming the lands embraced in his entry, by 
reason of the fact that such lands have been embraced within the 
exterior limits of any withdrawal under the Reclamation Act of June 17, 
1902 (32 Stat. 388; 43 U.S.C. 372 et seq.) will be excused during the 
continuance of such hindrance from complying with the provisions of the 
desert-land laws.
    (b) Persons excused from compliance with the desert-land laws. 
Section 5 of the Act of June 27, 1906, applies only to persons who have 
been, directly or indirectly, delayed or prevented, by the creation of 
any reclamation project, or by any withdrawal of public lands under the 
reclamation law, from improving or reclaiming the lands covered by their 
entries.
    (c) Statement required to warrant excuse. No entryman will be 
excused under this act from a compliance with all of the requirements of 
the desert-land law until he has filed in the proper office for the 
district in which his lands are situated a statement showing in detail 
all of the facts upon which he claims the right to be excused. This 
statement must show when the hindrance began, the nature, character, and 
extent of the same, and it must be corroborated by two disinterested 
persons, who can testify from their own personal knowledge.


<R05>
Sec. 2524.2  Annual proof.

    (a) Extension of time. Inasmuch as entrymen are allowed 1 year after 
entry in which to submit the first annual proof of expenditures for the 
purpose of improving and reclaiming the land entered by them, the 
privileges of the Act of June 27, 1906, are not necessary in connection 
with annual proofs until the expiration of the years in which such 
proofs are due. Therefore, if at the time that annual proof is due it 
can not be made, on account of hindrance or delay occasioned by a 
withdrawal of the land for the purpose indicated in the act, the 
applicant will file his statement explaining the delay. As a rule, 
however, annual proofs may be made, notwithstanding the withdrawal of 
the land, because expenditures for various kinds of improvements are 
allowed as satisfactory annual proofs. Therefore an extension of time 
for making annual proof will not be granted unless it is made clearly to 
appear that the entryman has been delayed or prevented by the withdrawal 
from making the required improvements; and, unless he has been so 
hindered or prevented from making the required improvements, no 
application for extension of time for making final proof will be granted 
until after all the yearly proofs have been made.

[[Page 125]]

    (b) When application for extension of time should be filed. An 
entryman will not need to invoke the privileges of the Act of June 27, 
1906, in connection with final proof until such final proof is due, and 
if at that time he is unable to make the final proof of reclamation and 
cultivation, as required by law, and such inability is due, directly or 
indirectly, to the withdrawal of the land on account of a reclamation 
project, the statement explaining the hindrance and delay should be 
filed in order that the entryman may be excused for such failure.


<R05>
Sec. 2524.3  Time extended to make final proof.

    When the time for submitting final proof has arrived and the 
entryman is unable, by reason of the withdrawal of the land, to make 
such proof, upon proper showing, he will be excused and the time during 
which it is shown that he has been hindered or delayed on account of the 
withdrawal of the land will not be computed in determining the time 
within which final proof must be made.


<R05>
Sec. 2524.4  Beginning of period for compliance with the law.

    If, after investigation the irrigation project has been or may be 
abandoned by the Government, the time for compliance with the law by the 
entryman shall begin to run from the date of notice of such abandonment 
of the project and of the restoration to the public domain of the lands 
which had been withdrawn in connection with the project. If, however, 
the reclamation project is carried to completion by the Government and a 
water supply has been made available for the land embraced in such 
desert-land entry, the entryman must, if he depends on the Government's 
project for his water supply, comply with all provisions of the 
reclamation law, and must under the Act of June 6, 1930 (46 Stat. 502; 
43 U.S.C. 448), relinquish or assign in not less than 2 years after 
notice all the land embraced in his entry in excess of one farm unit, 
and upon making final proof and complying with the regulations of the 
Department applicable to the remainder of the irrigable land of the 
project and with the terms of payment prescribed in the reclamation law, 
he shall be entitled to patent as to such retained farm unit, and final 
water-right certificate containing lien as provided for by the Act of 
August 9, 1912 (37 Stat. 265; 43 U.S.C. 541-546), Act of August 26, 1912 
(37 Stat. 610; 43 U.S.C. 547), and the Act of February 15, 1917 (39 
Stat. 920; 43 U.S.C. 541), or to patent without a lien if provision 
therefor shall have been made as provided for by the Act of May 15, 1922 
(42 Stat. 541; 43 U.S.C. 511-513).


<R05>
Sec. 2524.5  Assignment of desert-land entries in whole or in part.

    (a) Act of July 24, 1912. Under the Act of July 24, 1912 (37 Stat. 
200; 43 U.S.C. 449), desert-land entries covering lands within the 
exterior limits of a Government reclamation project may be assigned in 
whole or in part, even though water-right application has been filed for 
the land in connection with the Government reclamation project, or 
application for an extension of time in which to submit proof on the 
entry has been submitted, under the Act of June 27, 1906 (34 Stat. 520; 
43 U.S.C. 448), as amended by the Act of June 6, 1930 (46 Stat. 502; 43 
U.S.C. 448), requiring reduction of the area of the entry to one farm 
unit.
    (b) Amendment of farm-unit plat after partial assignment. Where it 
is desired to assign part of a desert-land entry which has been 
designated as a farm unit, application for the amendment of the farm-
unit plat should be filed with the official in charge of the project, as 
in the case of assignments of homestead entries. (See Sec. 2515.5 (a)(3) 
to (5).) The same disposition of amendatory diagrams will be made and 
the same procedure followed as provided for assignments of homestead 
entries.


<R05>
Sec. 2524.6  Desert-land entryman may proceed independently of Government irrigation.

    Special attention is called to the fact that nothing contained in 
the Act of June 27, 1906 (34 Stat. 520; 43 U.S.C. 448), shall be 
construed to mean that a desert-land entryman who owns a water right and 
reclaims the land embraced in his entry must accept the conditions of 
the reclamation law, but he may proceed independently of the

[[Page 126]]

Government's plan of irrigation and acquire title to the land embraced 
in his desert-land entry by means of his own system of irrigation.


<R05>
Sec. 2524.7  Disposal of lands in excess of 160 acres.

    Desert-land entrymen within exterior boundaries of a reclamation 
project who expect to secure water from the Government must relinquish 
or assign all of the lands embraced in their entries in excess of one 
farm unit in not less than 2 years after notice through the land office, 
must reclaim one-half of the irrigable area covered by their water right 
in the same manner as private owners of land irrigated under a 
reclamation project, and also comply with the regulations of the 
Department applicable to the remainder of the irrigable land of the 
project.


<R05>
Sec. 2524.8  Cancellation of entries for nonpayment of water-right charges.

    All homestead and desert-land entrymen holding land under the 
reclamation law must, in addition to paying the water-right charges, 
reclaim the land as required by the reclamation law. Homestead entrymen 
must reside upon, cultivate, and improve the lands embraced in their 
entries for not less than the period required by the homestead laws. 
Desert-land entrymen must comply with the provisions of the desert-land 
laws as amended by the reclamation law. Failure to make payment of any 
water-right charges due for more than 1 year, will render the entry 
subject to cancellation and the money paid subject to forfeiture, 
whether water-tight application has been made or not.

Sec. 2530.0-3  Authority.

    (a) General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887. Section 4 of the 
General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. 389; 25 U.S.C. 334), 
as amended by the Act of February 28, 1891 (26 Stat. 794), and section 
17 of the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 859; 25 U.S.C. 336), provides 
that where any Indian entitled to allotment under existing laws shall 
make settlement upon any surveyed or unsurveyed lands of the United 
States not otherwise appropriated, he or she shall be entitled, upon 
application to the proper office for the district in which the lands are 
located, to have the same allotted to him or her and to his or her 
children in manner as provided by law for allotments to Indians residing 
upon reservations, and that such allotments to Indians on the public 
domain shall not exceed 40 acres of irrigable land, or 80 acres of 
nonirrigable agricultural land or 160 acres of nonirrigable grazing land 
to any one Indian.
    (b) Act of March 1, 1933. The Act of March 1, 1933 (47 Stat. 1418; 
43 U.S.C. 190a) provides that no further allotments of lands to Indians 
on the public domain shall be made in San Juan County, Utah.
    (c) Executive Orders 6910 and 6964, Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 
1934. Public land withdrawn by Executive Orders 6910 and 6964 of 
November 26, 1934, and February 5, 1935, respectively, and land within 
grazing districts established under section 1 of the Taylor Grazing Act 
of June 28, 1934 (43 U.S.C. 315), is not subject to settlement under 
section

[[Page 127]]

4 of the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, as amended, until 
such settlement has been authorized by classification. See parts 2410, 
2420, and 2430 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 2530.0-8  Land subject to allotment.

    (a) General. (1) The law provides that allotments may include not to 
exceed 40 acres of irrigable land, 80 acres of nonirrigable agricultural 
land, or 160 acres of nonirrigable grazing land.
    (2) Irrigable lands are those susceptible of successful irrigation 
at a reasonable cost from any known source of water supply; nonirrigable 
agricultural lands are those upon which agricultural crops can be 
profitably raised without irrigation; grazing lands are those which can 
not be profitably devoted to any agricultural use other than grazing.
    (3) An allotment may be allowed for coal and oil and gas lands, with 
reservation of the mineral contents to the United States.

[35 FR 9589, June 13, 1970]


<R04>
                  Subpart 2531--Applications, Generally


<R05>
Sec. 2531.1  Qualifications of applicants.

    (a) General. An applicant for allotment under the fourth section of 
the Act of February 8, 1887, as amended, is required to show that he is 
a recognized member of an Indian tribe or is entitled to be so 
recognized. Such qualifications may be shown by the laws and usages of 
the tribe. The mere fact, however, that an Indian is a descendant of one 
whose name was at one time borne upon the rolls and who was recognized 
as a member of the tribe does not of itself make such Indian a member of 
the tribe. The possession of Indian blood, not accompanied by tribal 
affiliation or relationship, does not entitle a person to an allotment 
on the public domain. Tribal membership, even though once existing and 
recognized, may be abandoned in respect to the benefits of the fourth 
section.
    (b) Certificate that applicant is Indian and eligible for allotment. 
Any person desiring to file application for an allotment of land on the 
public domain under this act must first obtain from the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs a certificate showing that he or she is an Indian and 
eligible for such allotment, which certificate must be attached to the 
allotment application. Application for the certificate must be made on 
the proper form, and must contain information as to the applicant's 
identity, such as thumb print, age, sex, height, approximate weight, 
married or single, name of the Indian tribe in which membership is 
claimed, etc., sufficient to establish his or her identity with that of 
the applicant for allotment. Each certificate must bear a serial number, 
record thereof to be kept in the Indian Office. The required forms may 
be obtained as stated in Sec. 2531.2(b).
    (c) Heirs of Indian settlers and applicants. (1) Allotments are 
allowable only to living persons or those in being at the date of 
application. Where an Indian dies after settlement and filing of 
application, but prior to approval, the allotment will upon final 
approval be confirmed to the heirs of the deceased allottee.
    (2) In disposing of pending applications in which the death of the 
applicant has been reported, the heirs of an applicant who was otherwise 
qualified at the date of application should be notified that they will 
be allowed 90 days from receipt of notice within which to submit proof 
that the applicant personally settled on the land applied for during his 
or her lifetime, and while the land was open to settlement, and upon 
failure to submit such proof within the time allowed the application 
will be finally rejected.
    (3) When it is sufficiently shown that an applicant was at the time 
of death occupying in good faith the land settled on, patent will be 
issued to his or her heirs without further use or occupancy on the part 
of such heirs being shown.
    (d) Minor children. An Indian settler on public lands under the 
fourth section of the Act of February 8, 1887, as

[[Page 128]]

amended, is also eligible upon application for allotments made 
thereunder to his minor children, stepchildren, or other children to 
whom he stands in loco parentis, provided the natural children are in 
being at the date of the parent's application, or the other relationship 
referred to exist at such date. The law only permits one eligible 
himself under the fourth section to take allotments thereunder on behalf 
of his minor children or of those to whom he stands in loco parentis. 
Orphan children (those who have lost both parents) are not eligible for 
allotments on the public domain unless they come within the last-
mentioned class. No actual settlement is required in case of allotments 
to minor children under the fourth section, but the actual settlement of 
the parent or of a person standing in loco parentis on his own public-
land allotment will be regarded as the settlement of the minor children.
    (e) Indian wives. (1) Where an Indian woman is married to non-Indian 
not eligible for an allotment under the fourth section of the Act of 
February 8, 1887, as amended, and not a settler or entryman under the 
general homestead law, her right, and that of the minor children born of 
such marriage, to allotments on the public domain will be determined 
without reference to the quantum of Indian blood possessed by such women 
and her children but solely with reference as to whether they are 
recognized members of an Indian tribe or are entitled to such 
membership.
    (2) An Indian woman married to an Indian man who has himself 
received an allotment on the public domain or is entitled to one, or has 
earned the equitable right to patent on any form of homestead or small 
holding claim, is not thereby deprived of the right to file an 
application for herself, provided she is otherwise eligible, and also 
for her minor children where her husband is for any reason disqualified.
    (3) An Indian woman who is separated from her husband who has not 
received an allotment under the fourth section will be regarded as the 
head of a family and may file applications for herself and for the minor 
children under her care.
    (4) In every case where an Indian woman files applications for her 
minor children it must appear that she has not only applied for herself 
under the fourth section but has used the land in her own application in 
some beneficial manner.
    (f) Citizenship. (1) Under section 6 of the Act of February 8, 1887 
(24 Stat. 390; 25 U.S.C. 349), every Indian born within the territorial 
limits of the United States, to whom allotments were made under that 
Act, and every Indian who voluntarily takes up his residence separate 
and apart from any tribe of Indians and adopts the habits of civilized 
life is declared to be a citizen of the United States.
    (2) The Act of May 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 182; 8 U.S.C. 3), changed the 
time when an Indian became a citizen by virtue of the allotment made to 
him to the time when patent in fee should be issued on such an 
allotment.
    (3) The Act of June 2, 1924 (43 Stat. 253, 8 U.S.C. 3), conferred 
citizenship on all noncitizen Indians born within the Territorial limits 
of the United States, but expressly reserved to them all rights to 
tribal or other property. These rights include that of allotment on the 
public land, if qualified.

[35 FR 9589, June 13, 1970, as amended at 37 FR 23185, Oct. 31, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 2531.2  Petition and applications.

    (a) Any person desiring to receive an Indian allotment (other than 
those seeking allotments in national forests, for which see subpart 2533 
of this part) must file with the authorized officer, an application, 
together with a petition on forms approved by the Director, properly 
executed, together with a certificate from the authorized officer of the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs that the person is Indian and eligible for 
allotment, as specified in Sec. 2531.1(b). However, if the lands 
described in the application have been already classified and opened for 
disposition under the provisions of this part, no petition is required. 
The documents must be filed in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1821.2 of this chapter.

The petition and the statement attached to the application for 
certificate must be signed by the applicant.

[[Page 129]]

    (b) Blank forms for petitions and applications may be had from any 
office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or from land offices of the 
Bureau of Land Management.

[35 FR 9590, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 2531.3  Effect of application.

    (a) Where an allotment application under the fourth section of the 
Act of February 8, 1887, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 334 (is not accompanied 
by the requisite certificate from the Bureau of Indian Affairs showing 
the applicant to be eligible for an allotment, and the applicant is 
given time to furnish such certificate, the application does not 
segregate the land, and other applications therefor may be received and 
held to await final action on the allotment application.
    (b) Where an allotment application is approved by the authorized 
officer, it operates as a segregation of the land, and subsequent 
application for the same land will be rejected.

<R04>
                        Subpart 2532--Allotments


<R05>
Sec. 2532.1  Certificate of allotment.

    (a) When the authorizing officer approves an application for 
allotment, he will issue to the applicant a certificate of allotment, on 
a prescribed form, showing the name in full of the applicant, post 
office address, name of the tribe in which membership is claimed, serial 
number of the certificate issued by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
and a description of the land allotted.
    (b) Where the application under investigation is that of a single 
person over 21 years of age, or of the head of a family, report will 
also be made as to the character of the applicant's settlement and 
improvements. A similar report will be made on applications filed in 
behalf of minor children as to the character of the settlement and 
improvements made by the parent, or the person standing in loco 
parentis, on his or her own allotment under the fourth section.

[35 FR 9591, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 2532.2  Trust patent.

    (a) To enable an Indian allottee to demonstrate his good faith and 
intention, the issuance of trust patent will be suspended for a period 
of 2 years from date of settlement; but in those cases where that period 
has already elapsed at the time of adjudicating the allotment 
application, and when the evidence either by the record or upon further 
investigation in the field, shows the allottee's good faith and 
intention in the matter of his settlement, trust patents will issue in 
regular course. Trust patents in the suspended class, when issued will 
run from the date of suspension.
    (b) In the matter of fourth-section applications filed prior to the 
regulations in this part, where, by the record or upon further 
investigation in the field, it appears that such settlement has not been 
made as is contemplated by the regulations, such applications will not 
be immediately rejected, but the applicant will be informed that 2 years 
will be allowed within which to perfect his settlement and to furnish 
proof thereof, whereupon his application will be adjudicated as in other 
cases.

Sec. 2533.0-3  Authority.

    By the terms of section 31 of the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat.

<R05>
Sec. 2533.0-8  Land subject to allotment.

    An allotment under this section may be made for lands containing 
coal and oil and gas with reservation of the mineral contents to the 
United States, but not for lands valuable for metalliferous minerals. 
The rules governing the conduct of fourth-section applications under the 
Act of February 8, 1887 as amended, apply equally to applications under 
said section 31.

[[Page 130]]


<R05>
Sec. 2533.1  Application.

    An Indian who desires to apply for an allotment within a national 
forest under this act must submit the application to the supervisor of 
the particular forest affected, by whom it will be forwarded with 
appropriate report, through the district forester and Chief, Forest 
Service, to the Secretary of Agriculture, in order that he may determine 
whether the land applied for is more valuable for agriculture or grazing 
than for the timber found thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 2533.2  Approval.

    (a) Should the Secretary of Agriculture decide that the land applied 
for, or any part of it, is chiefly valuable for the timber found 
thereon, he will transmit the application to the Secretary of the 
Interior and inform him of his decision in the matter. The Secretary of 
the Interior will cause the applicant to be informed of the action of 
the Secretary of Agriculture.
    (b) In case the land is found to be chiefly valuable for agriculture 
or grazing, the Secretary of Agriculture will note that fact on the 
application and forward it to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
    (c) If the Commissioner of Indian Affairs approves the application, 
he will transmit it to the Bureau of Land Management for issuance of a 
trust patent.

upon survey to be omitted public lands of the United States, and which 
are not within the boundaries of a national forest or other Federal 
reservation and are not lawfully appropriated by a qualified settler or 
entryman claiming under the public land laws, or are not used and

Sec. 2540.0-5  Definition.

    (a) The act, when used in this section means the Act of December 22, 
1928 (45 Stat. 1069; 43 U.S.C. 1068, 1068a), as amended by the Act of 
July 28, 1953 (67 Stat. 227, 43 U.S.C. 1068a).
    (b) The claims recognized by the Act will be referred to in this 
part as claims of class 1, and claim of class 2. A claim of class 1 is 
one which has been held in good faith and in peaceful adverse possession 
by a claimant, his ancestors or grantors, under claim or color of title 
for more than 20 years, on which valuable improvements have been placed, 
or on which some part of the land has been reduced to cultivation. A 
claim of class 2 is one which has been held in good faith and in 
peaceful, adverse possession by a claimant, his ancestors or grantors, 
under claim or color of title for the period commencing not later than 
January 1, 1901, to the date of application, during which time they have 
paid taxes levied on the land by State and local governmental units. A 
claim is not held in good faith where held with knowledge that the land 
is owned by the United States. A claim is not held in peaceful, adverse 
possession where it was initiated while the land was withdrawn or 
reserved for Federal purposes.

land used by him for his livelihood and well-being and that of his 
family. Such use and occupancy must be substantial actual possession and 
use of the land, at least potentially exclusive of others, and not 
merely intermittent use.
    (b) Allotment is an allocation to a Native of land of which he has 
made substantially continuous use and occupancy for a period of five 
years and which shall be deemed the homestead of the allottee and his 
heirs in perpetuity, and shall be inalienable and nontaxable except as 
otherwise provided by the Congress.
    (c) Allotment Act means the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197), as 
amended (48 U.S.C. 357, 357a, 357b).


<R05>
Sec. 2561.0-8  Lands subject to allotment.

    (a) A Native may be granted a single allotment of not to exceed 160 
acres of land. All the lands in an allotment need not be contiguous but 
each separate tract of the allotment should be in reasonably compact 
form.
    (b) In areas where the rectangular survey pattern is appropriate, an 
allotment may be in terms of 40-acre legal subdivisions and survey lots 
on the basis that substantially continuous use and occupancy of a 
significant portion of such smallest legal subdivision shall normally 
entitle the applicant to the

[[Page 144]]

full subdivision, absent conflicting claims.
    (c) Allotments may be made in national forests if founded on 
occupancy of the land prior to the establishment of the particular 
forest or if an authorized officer of the Department of Agriculture 
certifies that the land in the application for allotment is chiefly 
valuable for agricultural or grazing purposes.
    (d) Lands in applications for allotment and allotments that may be 
valuable for coal, oil, or gas deposits are subject to the regulations 
of Sec. 2093.4 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 2561.1  Applications.

    (a) Applications for allotment properly and completely executed on a 
form approved by the Director, Bureau of Land Management, must be filed 
in the proper office which has jurisdiction over the lands.
    (b) Any application for allotment of lands which extend more than 
160 rods along the shore of any navigable waters shall be considered a 
request for waiver of the 160-rod limitation (see part 2094 of this 
chapter).
    (c) If surveyed, the land must be described in the application 
according to legal subdivisions and must conform to the plat of survey 
when possible. If unsurveyed, it must be described as accurately as 
possible by metes and bounds and tied to natural objects. On unsurveyed 
lands, the application should be accompanied by a map or approved 
protracted survey diagram showing approximately the lands included in 
the application.
    (d) An application for allotment shall be rejected unless the 
authorized officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs certifies that the 
applicant is a native qualified to make application under the Allotment 
Act, that the applicant has occupied and posted the lands as stated in 
the application, and that the claim of the applicant does not infringe 
on other native claims or area of native community use.
    (e) The filing of an acceptable application for a Native allotment 
will segregate the lands. Thereafter, subsequent conflicting 
applications for such lands shall be rejected, except when the 
conflicting application is made for the conveyance of lands pursuant to 
any provision of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 
et seq.).
    (f) By the filing of an application for allotment the applicant 
acquires no rights except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. 
If the applicant does not submit the required proof within six years of 
the filing of his application in the proper office, his application for 
allotment will terminate without affecting the rights he gained by 
virtue of his occupancy of the land or his right to make another 
application.

[35 FR 9597, June 13, 1970, as amended at 39 FR 34542, Sept. 26, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 2561.2  Proof of use and occupancy.

    (a) An allotment will not be made until the lands are surveyed by 
the Bureau of Land Management, and until the applicant or the authorized 
officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs has made satisfactory proof of 
substantially continuous use and occupancy of the land for a period of 
five years by the applicant. Such proof shall be made on a form approved 
by the Director, Bureau of Land Management, and filed in the proper land 
office. If made by the applicant, it must be signed by him, but if he is 
unable to write his name, his mark or thumb print shall be impressed on 
the statement and witnessed by two persons. This proof may be submitted 
with the application for allotment if the applicant has then used and 
occupied the land for five years, or may be made at any time within six 
years after the filing of the application when the requirements have 
been met.
    (b)[Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 2561.3  Effect of allotment.

    (a) Land allotted under the Act is the property of the allottee and 
his heirs in perpetuity, and is inalienable and nontaxable. However, a 
native of Alaska who received an allotment under the Act, or his heirs, 
may with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative, convey the complete title to the allotted land by deed. 
The allotment shall thereafter be free of any restrictions against 
alienation and taxation unless the purchaser is a native of Alaska who 
the Secretary determines is unable to

[[Page 145]]

manage the land without the protection of the United States and the 
conveyance provides for a continuance of such restrictions.
    (b) Application by an allottee or his heirs for approval to convey 
title to land allotted under the Allotment Act shall be filed with the 
appropriate officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

and the regulations of Sec. 2093.4 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 2562.1  Initiation of claim.

    (a) Notice. Any qualified person, association, or corporation 
initiating a claim on or after April 29, 1950, under section 10 of the

remittance of $10.00, which will be earned and applied as a service 
charge for recording the notice, and will not be returnable, except in 
cases where the notice is not acceptable to the proper office for 
recording, because the land is not subject to the form of disposition 
specified in the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 2562.2  Qualifications of applicant.

    An application must show that the applicant is a citizen of the 
United States and 21 years of age, and that he has not theretofore 
applied for land as a trade and manufacturing site. If such site has 
been applied for and the application not completed, the facts must be 
shown. If the application is made for an association of citizens or a 
corporation, the qualifications of each member of the organization must 
be shown. In the case of a corporation, proof of incorporation must be 
established by the certificate of the officer having custody of the 
records of incorporation at the place of its formation and it must be

<R05>
Sec. 2562.3  Applications.

    (a) Execution. Application for a trade and manufacturing site should 
be executed in duplicate and should be filed in the proper office. It 
need not be sworn to, but it must be signed by the applicant and must be 
corroborated by the statements of two persons.

[[Page 146]]

    (b) Fees. All applications must be accompanied by an application 
service fee of $10 which will not be returnable.

    (d) Contents. The application to enter must show:
    (1) That the land is actually used and occupied for the purpose of 
trade, manufacture or other productive industry when it was first so 
occupied, the character and value of the improvements thereon and the 
nature of the trade, business or productive industry conducted thereon 
and that it embraces the applicant's improvements and is needed in the 
prosecution of the enterprise. A site for a prospective business cannot 
be acquired under section 10 of the Act of May 14, 1898 (30 Stat. 413; 
43 U.S.C. 687a).
    (2) That no portion of the land is occupied or reserved for any 
purpose by the United States or occupied or claimed by natives of 
Alaska; that the land is unoccupied, unimproved, and unappropriated by 
any person claiming the same other than the applicant.
    (3) That the land does not abut more than 80 rods of navigable 
water.
    (4) That the land is not included within an area which is reserved 
because of springs thereon. All facts relative to medicinal or other 
springs must be stated, in accordance with Sec. 2311.2(a) of this 
chapter.
    (5) That no part of the land is valuable for mineral deposits other 
than coal, oil, or gas, and that at the date of location no part of the 
land was claimed under the mining laws.
    (e) Description of land. If the land be surveyed, it must be 
described in the application according to legal subdivisions of the 
public-land surveys. If it be unsurveyed, the application must describe 
it by approximate latitude and longitude and otherwise with as much 
certainty as possible without survey.


<R05>
Sec. 2562.4  Survey.

    (a) If the land applied for be unsurveyed and no objection to its 
survey is known to the authorizing officer, he will furnish the 
applicant with a certificate stating the facts, and, after receiving 
such certificate, the applicant may make application to the State 
Director for the survey of the land. Upon receipt of an application, the 
State Director will, if conditions make such procedure practicable and 
no objection is shown by his records, furnish the applicant with an 
estimate of the cost of field and office work, and upon receipt of the 
deposit required will issue appropriate instructions for the survey of 
the claim, such survey to be made not later than the next surveying 
season. The sum so deposited by the applicant for survey will be deemed 
an appropriation thereof and will be held to be expended in the payment 
of the cost of the survey, including field and office work, and upon the 
acceptance of the survey any excess over the cost shall be repaid to the 
depositor or his legal representative.
    (b) In case it is decided that by reason of the inaccessibility of 
the locality embraced in an application for the survey, or by reason of 
other conditions, it will result to the advantage of the Government or 
claimant to have the survey executed by a deputy surveyor, the State 
Director will deliver an order to the applicant for such survey, which 
will be sufficient authority for any deputy surveyor to make a survey of 
the claim.
    (c) In the latter contingency the survey must be made at the expense 
of the applicant, and no right will be recognized as initiated by such 
application unless actual work on the survey is begun and carried to 
completion without unnecessary delay.

each such deed shall provide that the title conveyed is inalienable 
except upon approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative, and that the issuance of the restricted deed does not 
subject the tract to taxation, to levy and sale in satisfaction of the 
debts, contracts or liabilities of the transferee, or to any claims of 
adverse occupancy or law of prescription; also, if the established 
streets and alleys of the townsite have been extended upon and across 
the tract, that there is reserved to the townsite the area covered by 
such streets and alleys as extended. The deed shall further provide that 
the approval by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative of a sale by the Indian or Eskimo transferee shall vest 
in the purchaser a complete and unrestricted title from the date of such 
approval.

Sec. 2564.5  Sale of land for which restricted deed was issued.

    When a native possessing a restricted deed for land in a trustee 
townsite issued under authority of the Act of May 25, 1926 (44 Stat. 
629; 43 U.S.C. 733-736), desires to sell the land, he should execute a 
deed on a form approved by the Director, prepared for the approval of 
the Secretary of the Interior, or his authorized representative, and 
send it to the townsite trustee in Alaska. The townsite trustee will 
forward the deed to the Area Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
who will determine whether it should be approved. Where the deed is 
approved it shall be returned by the Area Director, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, through the townsite trustee to the vendor. In the event the 
Area Director determines that the deed shall not be approved, he shall 
so inform the native possessing the restricted deed, who shall have a 
right of appeal from such finding or decision to the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs within sixty days from the date of notification of such 
finding or decision. The appeal shall be filed with the Area Director. 
Should the Commissioner uphold the decision of the Area Director, he

an unrestricted deed to the applicant. Thereafter all restrictions as to 
sale, encumbrance, or taxation of the land applied for shall be removed, 
but the said land shall not be liable to the satisfaction of any debt, 
except obligations owed to the Federal Government, contracted prior to 
the issuance of such deed. Any adverse action under this section by the 
townsite trustee shall be subject to appeal to the Board of Land 
Appeals, Office of the Secretary, in accordance with part 4 of 43 CFR

<R05>
Sec. 2565.0-3  Authority.

    The entry of public lands in Alaska for townsite purposes, by such 
trustee or trustees as may be named by the Secretary of the Interior for 
that purpose, is authorized by section 11 of the Act of March 3, 1891 
(sec. 11, 26 Stat. 1099; 43 U.S.C. 732).


<R05>
Sec. 2565.0-7  Cross reference.

    Townsites in Alaska may be reserved by the President and sold as 
provided for in sections 2380 and 2381 of the Revised Statutes; 43 
U.S.C. 711, 712. The regulations governing these townsites are contained 
in Secs. 2760.0-3 and 2761.3.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.1  General requirements.

    (a) Survey of exterior lines; exclusions from townsite survey. If 
the land is unsurveyed the occupants must by application to the State 
Director, obtain a survey of the exterior lines of the townsite which 
will be made at Government expense. There must be excluded from the 
tract to be surveyed and entered for the townsite any lands set aside by 
the district court under section 31 of the Act of June 6, 1900 (31 Stat. 
332; 48 U.S.C. 40), for use as jail and courthouse sites, also all lands 
needed for Government purposes or use, together with any existing valid 
claim initiated under Russian rule.
    (b) Petition for trustee and for survey of lands into lots, blocks, 
etc. When the survey of the exterior lines has been approved, or if the 
townsite is on surveyed land, a petition, signed by a majority of 
occupants of the land, will be filed in the proper office requesting the 
appointment of trustee and the survey of the townsite into lots, blocks, 
and municipal reservations for public use,

[[Page 152]]

the expense thereof to be paid from assessments upon the lots, as 
provided in Sec. 2565.3(b) of this part.
    (c) Designation of trustee; payment required: area enterable. If the 
petition be found sufficient, the Secretary of the Interior will 
designate a trustee to make entry of the townsite, payment for which 
must be made at the rate of $1.25 per acre. If there are less than 100 
inhabitants the area of the townsite is limited to 160 acres; if 100 and 
less than 200, to 320 acres; if more than 200, to 640 acres, this being 
the maximum area allowed by the statute.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.2  Application; fees; contests and protests.

    (a) Filing of application; publication and posting; submission of 
proof. The trustee will file his application and notice of intention to 
make proof, and thereupon the authorizing officer will issue the usual 
notice of making proof, to be posted and published at the trustee's 
expense, for the time and in the manner as in other cases provided, and 
proof must be made showing occupancy of the tract, number of inhabitants 
thereon, character of the land, extent, value, and character of 
improvements, and that the townsite does not contain any land occupied 
by the United States for school or other purposes or land occupied under 
any existing valid claim initiated under Russian rule.
    (b) Application service fee. The trustee's application shall be 
accompanied by $10 application service fee which shall not be 
returnable.
    (c) Expense money to be advanced by lot occupants. The occupants 
will advance a sufficient amount of money to pay for the land and the 
expenses incident to the entry to be refunded to them when realized from 
lot assessments.
    (d) Contests and protests. Applications for entry will be subject to 
contest or protest as in other cases.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.3  Subdivision.

    (a) Subdivision of land and payment therefore. After the entry is 
made, the townsite will be subdivided by the United States into blocks, 
lots, streets, alleys, and municipal public reservations. The expense of 
such survey will be paid from the appropriation for surveys in Alaska 
reimbursable from the lot assessments collected.
    (b) Lot assessments. The trustee will assess against each lot, 
according to area, its share of the cost of the subdivisional survey. 
The trustee will make a valuation of each occupied or improved lot in 
the townsite and assess upon such lots, according to their value, such 
rate and sum in addition to the cost of their share of the survey as 
will be necessary to pay all other expenses incident to the execution of 
his trust which have accrued up to the time of such levy. More than one 
assessment may be made if necessary to effect the purpose of the Act of 
March 3, 1891, and this section.
    (c) Award and disposition of lots after subdivisional survey. On the 
acceptance of the plat by the Bureau of Land Management, the trustee 
will publish a notice that he will, at the end of 30 days from the date 
thereof, proceed to award the lots applied for, and that all lots for 
which no applications are filed within 120 days from the date of said 
notice will be subject to disposition to the highest bidder at public 
sale. Only those who were occupants of lots or entitled to such 
occupancy at the date of the approval of final subdivisional townsite 
survey or their assigns thereafter, are entitled to the allotments 
herein provided. Minority and coverture are not disabilities.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.4  Deeds.

    (a) Applications for deeds. Claimants should file their applications 
for deeds, setting forth the grounds of their claims for each lot 
applied for, which should be corroborated by two witnesses.
    (b) Issuance of deeds; procedure on conflicting applications. (1) 
Upon receipt of the patent and payment of the assessments the trustee 
will issue deeds for the lots. The deeds will be acknowledged before an 
officer duly authorized to take acknowledgements of deeds at the cost of 
the grantee. In case of conflicting applications for lots, the trustee, 
if he considers it necessary, may order a hearing to be conducted in 
accordance with the part 1850 of this chapter.
    (2) No deed will be issued for any lot involved in a contest until 
the case has

[[Page 153]]

been finally closed. Appeals from any decision of the trustee or from 
decisions of the Bureau of Land Management may be taken in the manner 
provided by part 1840 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.5  Sale of the land.

    (a) Public sale of unclaimed lots. After deeds have been issued to 
the parties entitled thereto the trustee will publish or post notice 
that he will sell, at a designated place in the town and at a time 
named, to be not less than 30 days from date, at public outcry, for 
cash, to the highest bidder, all lots and tracts remaining unoccupied 
and unclaimed at the date of the approval of final subdivisional 
townsite survey, and all lots and tracts claimed and awarded on which 
the assessments have not been paid at the date of such sale. The notice 
shall contain a description of the lots and tracts to be sold, made in 
two separate lists, one containing the lots and tracts unclaimed at the 
date of the approval of final subdivisional townsite survey and the 
other the lots and tracts claimed and awarded on which the assessments 
have not been paid. Should any delinquent allottee, prior to the sale of 
the lot claimed by him, pay the assessments thereon, together with the 
pro rata cost of the publication and the cost of acknowledging deed, a 
deed will be issued to him for such lot, and the lot will not be offered 
at public sale. Where notice by publication is deemed advisable the 
notice will be published once a week for 5 consecutive weeks in 
accordance with Sec. 1824.3 of this chapter prior to the date of sale, 
and in any event copies of such notice shall be posted in three 
conspicuous places within the townsite. Each lot must be sold at a fair 
price, to be determined by the trustee, and he is authorized to reject 
any and all bids. Lots remaining unsold at the close of the public sale 
in an unincorporated town may again be offered at a fair price if a 
sufficient demand appears therefor.
    (b) Sales to Federal, State and local governmental agencies. (1) Any 
lot or tract in the townsite which is subject to sale to the highest 
bidder by the trustee pursuant to this section may in lieu of 
disposition at public sale be sold by the trustee at a fair value to be 
fixed by him to any Federal or State agency or instrumentality or to any 
local governmental agency or instrumentality of the State for use for 
public purposes.
    (2) All conveyances under this section shall be subject to such 
conditions, limitations, or stipulations as the trustee shall determine 
are necessary or appropriate in the circumstances, including, where he 
deems proper, a provision for reversion of title to the trustee or his 
successor in interest. Any such provision for reversion of title, 
however, shall by its terms cease to be in effect 25 years after the 
conveyance.
    (3) Conveyances under this section for lands within any incorporated 
city, town, village, or municipality may be made only after the proposed 
conveyance has received the approval of the city, town, or village 
council, or of the local official designated by such council. Such 
conveyances for lands within any unincorporated city, town, village or 
municipality may be made only after notice of the proposed conveyance, 
together with the opportunity to be heard, has been given by the 
proposed grantee to the residents or occupants thereof in accordance 
with the requirements for such notice in the case of the public sale of 
unclaimed lots in a trustee townsite. Any decision of the trustee which 
is adverse to a protest will be subject to the right of appeal under 
part 1840 of this chapter. Upon filing of an appeal pursuant to that 
part, action by the trustee on the conveyance will be suspended pending 
final decision on the appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.6  Rights-of-way.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, the trustee 
is authorized to grant rights-of-way for public purposes across any 
unentered lands within the townsite. This authority is expressly limited 
to grants of rights-of-way to cities, towns, villages, and 
municipalities, and to school, utility, and other types of improvement 
districts, and to persons, associations, companies, and corporations 
engaged in furnishing utility services to the general public, and to the 
United States, any Federal or State agency or instrumentality for use 
for public purposes.

[[Page 154]]

    (b) The trustee may in his discretion fix a reasonable charge for 
any grant under this authority to private persons, associations, 
companies and corporations, and to Federal and State agencies and 
instrumentalities, which charge shall be a lump sum. All grants shall be 
subject to such conditions, limitations, or stipulations as the trustee 
shall determine are necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. No 
grants of rights-of-way under this authority shall be made across or 
upon lands on which prior rights of occupancy or entry have vested under 
the law.
    (c) Grants of rights-of-way under this section to Federal and State 
agencies and instrumentalities to private persons, associations, 
companies, or corporations affecting lands within any incorporated city, 
town, village, or municipality, may be made only after the proposed 
grant has received the approval of the city, town, or village council, 
or, where applicable, the municipal board or commission having authority 
under state law to approve rights-of-way for local public utility 
purposes. Grants of such rights-of-way to Federal and State agencies and 
instrumentalities and to private persons, associations, companies, or 
corporations within unincorporated cities, towns, villages, or 
municipalities may be made only after notice of the proposed grant, 
together with the opportunity to be heard, has been given by the 
proposed grantee to the residents or occupants thereof in accordance 
with the requirements for such notice in the case of the public sale of 
unclaimed lots in a trustee townsite. Any decision by the trustee which 
is adverse to a protest will be subject to the right of appeal under 
part 1840 of this chapter. Upon the filing of an appeal, action by the 
trustee on the application for right-of-way will be suspended pending 
final decision on the appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.7  Final report of trustee; disposition of unexpended moneys and unsold lots.

    After the disposal of a sufficient number of lots to pay all 
expenses incident to the execution of the trust, including the cost of 
the subdivisional survey, the trustee will make and transmit to the 
Bureau of Land Management his final report of his trusteeship, showing 
all amounts received and paid out and the balance remaining on hand 
derived from assessments upon the lots and from the public sale. The 
proceeds derived from such sources, after deducting all expenses, may be 
used by the trustee on direction of the Secretary of the Interior, where 
the town is unincorporated, in making public improvements, or, if the 
town is incorporated such remaining proceeds may be turned over to the 
municipality for the use and benefit thereof. After the public sale and 
upon proof of the incorporation of the town, all lots then remaining 
unsold will be deeded to the municipality, and all municipal public 
reserves will, by a separate deed, be conveyed to the municipality in 
trust for the public purposes for which they were reserved.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.8  Records to be kept by trustee.

    The trustee shall keep a tract book of the lots and blocks, a record 
of the deeds issued, a contest docket, and a book of receipts and 
disbursements.


<R05>
Sec. 2565.9  Disposition of records on completion of trust.

    The trustee's duties having been completed, the books of accounts of 
all his receipts and expenditures, together with a record of his 
proceedings as provided in Sec. 2565.8 of this part with all papers, 
other books, and everything pertaining to such townsite in his 
possession and all evidence of his official acts shall be transmitted to 
the Bureau of Land Management to become a part of the records thereof, 
excepting from such papers, however, in case the town is incorporated, 
the subdivisional plat of the townsite, which he will deliver to the 
municipal authorities of the town, together with a copy of the townsite 
tract book or books, taking a receipt therefore to be transmitted to the 
Bureau of Land Management.

Subpart 2568 and has assigned them clearance number 1004-0191 for Form 
AK-2561-10. BLM uses this information to determine if using the public 
lands is appropriate. You must respond to obtain a benefit.
    (b) BLM estimates that the public reporting burden for this 
information is as follows: 28 hours per response to fill out form AK-
2561-10. These estimates include the time for reviewing instruction, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
needed and completing the collection of information.
    (c) Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect 
of this collection to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, 
Bureau of Land Management, 1849 C St. N.W., Mail Stop 401 LS, 
Washington, D.C. 20240.

                    Who Is Qualified for an Allotment


<R05>
Sec. 2568.50  What qualifications do I need to be eligible for an allotment?

    To qualify for an allotment you must:
    (a) Have been eligible for an allotment under the Native Allotment 
Act as it was in effect before December 18, 1971; and
    (b) Establish that you used land in accordance with the regulation 
in effect before December 18, 1971, and that the land is still owned by 
the Federal government; and
    (c) Be a veteran who served at least six months between January 1, 
1969, and June 2, 1971, or enlisted or was drafted after June 2, 1971, 
but before December 3, 1971; and
    (d) Not have already received conveyance or approval of an 
allotment. (However, if you are otherwise qualified to receive an 
allotment under the Alaska Native Veterans Allotment Act, you will still 
qualify even if you received another allotment interest by inheritance, 
devise, gift, or purchase); and
    (e) Not have a Native allotment application pending on October 21, 
1998; and
    (f) Reside in the State of Alaska or, in the case of a deceased 
veteran, have been a resident of Alaska at the time of death.

                        Personal Representatives


<R05>
Sec. 2568.60  May the personal representatives of eligible deceased veterans apply on their behalf?

    Yes. The personal representative may apply for an allotment, for the 
benefit of the deceased veteran's heirs, if, between January 1, 1969, 
and December 31, 1971, the deceased veteran:
    (a) Was killed in action,
    (b) Was wounded in action and later died as a direct consequence of 
that wound, as determined and certified by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, or
    (c) Died while a prisoner of war.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.61  What are the requirements for a personal representative?

    The person filing the application must present proof of a current 
appointment as personal representative of the estate of the deceased 
veteran by the proper court, or proof that this appointment process has 
begun.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.62  Under what circumstances does BLM accept the appointment of a personal representative?

    BLM will accept an appointment of personal representative made any 
time after an eligible person dies, even if that appointment came before 
enactment of the Alaska Native Veterans Allotment Act.

[[Page 158]]


<R05>
Sec. 2568.63  Under what circumstances does BLM reject the appointment of a personal representative?

    If the appointment process is incomplete at the time of allotment 
application filing, the prospective personal representative must file 
the proof of appointment with BLM within 18 months after the application 
filing deadline or BLM will reject the application.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.64  Are there different requirements for giving an allotment to the estate of a deceased veteran?

    No, the estate of the deceased veteran eligible under Sec. 2568.60 
must meet the same requirements for a Native allotment as other living 
Alaska Native veterans. In addition, a deceased veteran must have been a 
resident of Alaska at the time of death.

                        Applying for an Allotment


<R05>
Sec. 2568.70  If I am qualified for an allotment, when can I apply?

    If you are qualified, you can apply between July 31, 2000 and 
January 31, 2002.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.71  Where do I file my application?

    You must file your application in person or by mail with the BLM 
Alaska State Office in Anchorage, Alaska.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.72  When does BLM consider my application to be filed too late?

    BLM will consider applications to be filed too late if they are:
    (a) Submitted in person after the deadline in section 2568.70, or
    (b) Postmarked after the deadline in section 2568.70.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.73  Do I need to fill out a special application form?

    Yes. You must complete form no. AK-2561-10, ``Alaska Native Veteran 
Allotment Application.''


<R05>
Sec. 2568.74  What else must I file with my application?

    You must also file:
    (a) A Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB), which is a Bureau of Indian 
Affairs form,
    (b) A DD Form 214 ``Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active 
Duty'' or other documentation from the Department of Defense (DOD) to 
verify military service, as well as any information on cause of death 
supplied by the Department of Veterans Affairs,
    (c) A map at a scale of 1:63,360 or larger, sufficient to locate on-
the-ground the land for which you are applying, and
    (d) A legal description of the land for which you are applying. If 
there is a discrepancy between the map and the legal description, the 
map will control. The map must be sufficient to allow BLM to locate the 
parcel on the ground. If there is a discrepancy between the map or legal 
description and the location of the parcel on the ground, the location 
as posted on the ground will control. You must also estimate the number 
of acres in each parcel.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.75  Must I include a Certificate of Indian Blood as well as a Department of Defense verification of qualifying military service when I file my 
          application with BLM?

    Yes.
    (a) If the CIB or DOD verification of qualifying military service is 
missing when you file the application, BLM will ask you to provide the 
information within the time specified in a notice. BLM will not process 
the application until you file the necessary documents but will consider 
the application as having been filed on time.
    (b) A personal representative filing on behalf of the estate of a 
deceased veteran must file the Department of Veterans Affairs 
verification of cause of death.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.76  Do I need to pay any fees when I file my application?

    No. You do not need to pay a fee to file an application.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.77  Do I have to post, on-the-ground, the land in my application?

    (a) Yes. Before you file your application you must post the land by 
marking all corners on the ground with your name and address.
    (b) On land within a CSU, you must get a free special use permit 
from the CSU manager before you erect any

[[Page 159]]

signs or markers. The CSU manager may establish in the permit a maximum 
size of any signs or markers. If the CSU manager later decides under 
section 2568.104 that your allotment is not consistent with the CSU, you 
must promptly remove the signs or markers unless the CSU manager waives 
this requirement in the special use permit.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.78  Will my application segregate the land for which I am applying from other applications or land actions?

    The filing of an application with a sufficient description to 
identify the lands will segregate those lands. ``Segregation'' has the 
same meaning as in 43 CFR 2091.0-5(b).


<R05>
Sec. 2568.79  Are there any rules about the number and size of parcels?

    Yes. You may apply for one or two parcels, but if you apply for two 
parcels the two combined cannot total more than 160 acres. You may apply 
for less than 160 acres. Each parcel must be reasonably compact.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.80  Does the parcel have to be surveyed before I can receive title to it?

    Yes. The land in your application must be surveyed before BLM can 
convey it to you. BLM will survey your allotment at no charge to you, or 
you may obtain a private survey. BLM must approve the survey if it is 
done by a private surveyor.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.81  If BLM finds errors in my application, will BLM give me a chance to correct them?

    Yes. If you file your application during the 18-month filing period 
and BLM finds correctable errors, it will consider the application as 
having been filed on time once you correct them. BLM will send you a 
notice advising you of any correctable errors and give you at least 60 
days to correct them. You must make corrections within the specified 
time or BLM will reject your application.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.82  If BLM decides that I have not submitted enough information to show qualifying use and occupancy, will it reject my application or give me a 
          chance to submit more information?

    (a) BLM will not reject your application without giving you an 
opportunity for a hearing to establish the facts of your use.
    (b) If BLM cannot determine from the information you submit that you 
met the use and occupancy requirements of the 1906 Act, it will send you 
a notice saying that you have not submitted enough evidence and will 
give you at least 60 days to file additional information.
    (c) If you do not submit additional evidence by the end of the time 
BLM gives you or if you submit additional evidence but BLM still cannot 
determine that you meet the use and occupancy requirements, the 
following process will occur:
    (1) BLM will issue a formal contest complaint telling you why it 
believes it should reject your application.
    (2) If you answer the complaint and tell BLM you want a hearing, BLM 
will ask an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Interior Department, 
Office of Hearings and Appeals, to preside over a hearing to establish 
the facts of your use and occupancy.
    (3) The ALJ will evaluate all the written evidence and oral 
testimony and issue a decision.
    (4) You can appeal this decision to the Interior Board of Land 
Appeals according to 43 CFR part 4.

                        Available Lands--General


<R05>
Sec. 2568.90  If I qualify for an allotment, what land may BLM convey to me?

    You may receive title only to:
    (a) Land that:
    (1) Is currently owned by the Federal government,
    (2) Was vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved when you first began 
to use and occupy it,
    (3) Has not been continuously withdrawn since before your sixth 
birthday,
    (4) You started using before December 14, 1968, the date when Public 
Land

[[Page 160]]

Order 4582 withdrew all unreserved public lands in Alaska from all forms 
of appropriation and disposition under the public land laws, and
    (5) You prove by a preponderance of the evidence that you used and 
occupied in a substantially continuous and independent manner, at least 
potentially exclusive of others, for five or more years. This possession 
of the land must not be merely intermittent. ``Preponderance of 
evidence'' means evidence which is more convincing than the evidence 
offered in opposition to it; that is, evidence which as a whole shows 
that the fact you are trying to prove is more likely a fact than not.
    (b) Substitute land explained in 43 CFR 2568.110.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.91  Is there land owned by the Federal government that BLM cannot convey to me even if I qualify?

    You cannot receive an allotment containing any of the following:
    (a) A regularly used and recognized campsite that is primarily used 
by someone other than yourself. The campsite area that you cannot 
receive is that which is actually used as a campsite.
    (b) Land presently selected by, but not conveyed to, the State of 
Alaska. The State may relinquish up to 160 acres of its selection to 
allow an eligible Native veteran to receive an allotment;
    (c) Land presently selected by, but not conveyed to, a Native 
corporation as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1602(m). A Native corporation may 
relinquish up to 160 acres of its selection to allow an eligible Native 
veteran to receive an allotment, as long as the remaining ANCSA 
selection comports with the appropriate selection rules in 43 CFR 2650. 
Any such relinquishment must not cause the corporation to become 
underselected. See 43 U.S.C. 1621(j)(2) for a definition of 
underselection;
    (d) Land designated as wilderness by statute;
    (e) Land acquired by the Federal government through gift, purchase, 
or exchange;
    (f) Land containing any development owned or controlled by a unit of 
government, or a person other than yourself;
    (g) Land withdrawn or reserved for national defense, other than the 
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska;
    (h) National Forest land; or
    (i) Land selected or claimed, but not yet conveyed, under a public 
land law, including but not limited to the following:
    (1) Land within a recorded mining claim;
    (2) Home sites;
    (3) Trade and manufacturing sites;
    (4) Reindeer sites and headquarters sites;
    (5) Cemetery sites.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.92  Is there anything else I should consider if I apply for land that is selected by a Native corporation or by the State of Alaska?

    You must realize that applying for land which cannot be conveyed 
because it has been selected by a Native corporation or by the State is 
very risky. If BLM does not receive and approve a relinquishment from a 
Native corporation or the State before the allotment application filing 
period ends, you cannot file an application for an allotment in a 
different location and you will not be eligible for an alternative 
allotment.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.93  Is there a limit to how much water frontage my allotment can include?

    Yes, in some cases. You will normally be limited to a half-mile 
(referred to as 160 rods in the regulations at 43 CFR part 2094) along 
the shore of a navigable water body. If you apply for land that extends 
more than a half-mile, BLM will treat your application as a request to 
waive this limitation. As explained in 43 CFR 2094.2, BLM can waive the 
half-mile limitation if it determines the land is not needed for a 
harborage, wharf, or boat landing area, and that a waiver would not harm 
the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.94  Can I receive an allotment of land that is valuable for minerals?

    BLM can convey an allotment that is known to be or believed to be 
valuable for coal, oil, or gas, but the ownership of these minerals 
remains with the Federal government. BLM cannot convey to you land 
valuable for other kinds of minerals such as gold, silver,

[[Page 161]]

sand or gravel. If BLM conveys an allotment that is valuable for coal, 
oil, or gas, the allottee owns all minerals in the land except those 
expressly reserved to the United States in the conveyance.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.95  Will BLM try to reacquire land that has been conveyed out of Federal ownership so it can convey that land to a Native veteran?

    No. The Alaska Native Veterans Allotment Act does not give BLM the 
authority to reacquire former Federal land in order to convey it to a 
Native veteran.

            Available Lands--Conservation System Units (CSU)


<R05>
Sec. 2568.100  What is a CSU?

    A CSU is an Alaska unit of the National Park System, National 
Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National 
Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation System, or a National 
Forest Monument.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.101  If the land I used and occupied is within a CSU other than a National Wilderness or any part of a National Forest, can I receive a title to it?

    You may receive title if you qualify for that allotment and the 
managing agency of the CSU agrees that conveyance of that allotment is 
not inconsistent with the purposes of the CSU.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.102  Is the process by which the managing agency decides whether my allotment is not inconsistent with the CSU the same as other such determination 
          processes?

    No. This process is unique to this regulation. It should not be 
confused with any similar process under any other act, including the 
incompatibility process under the National Wildlife Refuge System 
Improvement Act of 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.103  By what process does the managing agency of a CSU decide if my allotment would be consistent with the CSU?

    (a) BLM conducts a field exam, with you or your representative, to 
check the boundaries of the land for which you are applying and to look 
for signs of use and occupancy. The CSU manager or a designated 
representative may also attend the field exam.
    (b) The CSU manager or representative assesses the resources to 
determine if the allotment would be consistent with CSU purposes at that 
location. You may submit any other information for the CSU manager to 
consider. You or your representative may also accompany the CSU 
representative on any field exam.
    (c) The CSU manager submits a written decision and resource 
assessment to BLM within 18 months of the BLM field exam. The CSU 
manager will send you a copy of the decision and a copy of the resource 
assessment.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.104  How will a CSU manager determine if my allotment is consistent with the CSU?

    The CSU manager will decide this on a case-by-case basis by 
considering the law or withdrawal order which created the CSU. The law 
or withdrawal order explains the purposes for which the CSU was created. 
The manager would also consider the mission of the CSU managing agency 
as established in law and policy. The manager will also consider how the 
cumulative impacts of the various activities that could take place on 
the allotment might affect the CSU.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.105  In what situations could a CSU manager likely find an allotment to be consistent with the CSU?

    An allotment could generally be consistent with the purposes of the 
CSU if:
    (a) The allotment for which you qualify is located near land that 
BLM has conveyed to a Native corporation under ANCSA, or,
    (b) A Native corporation has selected the land under ANCSA and has 
said it would relinquish such selection, as long as the remaining ANCSA 
selection comports with the appropriate selection rules in 43 CFR 2650. 
Any relinquishment must not cause the corporation to become 
underselected. See 43 U.S.C. 1621(j)(2) for a definition of 
underselection.

[[Page 162]]


<R05>
Sec. 2568.106  In what situations could a CSU manager generally find an allotment to be inconsistent with the purposes of a CSU?

    An allotment could generally be inconsistent in situations 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) If, by itself or as part of a group of allotments, it could 
significantly interfere with biological, physical, cultural, scenic, 
recreational, natural quiet or subsistence values of the CSU.
    (b) If, by itself or as part of a group of allotments, it obstructs 
access by the public or managing agency to the resource values of 
surrounding CSU lands.
    (c) If, by itself or as part of a group of allotments, it could 
trigger development or future uses in an area that would adversely 
affect resource values of surrounding CSU lands.
    (d) If it is isolated from existing private properties and opens an 
area of a CSU to new access and uses that adversely affect resource 
values of the surrounding CSU lands.
    (e) If it interferes with the implementation of the CSU management 
plan.

                         Alternative Allotments


<R05>
Sec. 2568.110  If I qualify for Federal land in one of the categories BLM cannot convey, is there any other way for me to receive an allotment?

    Yes. If you qualify for land in one of the categories listed in 
section 2568.91 which BLM cannot convey, you may choose an alternative 
allotment from the following types of land within the same ANCSA Region 
as the land for which you originally qualified:
    (a) Land within an original withdrawal under section 11(a)(1) of 
ANCSA for selection by a Village Corporation which was:
    (1) Not selected,
    (2) Selected and later relinquished, or
    (3) Selected and later rejected by BLM;
    (b) Land outside of, but touching a boundary of a Village 
withdrawal, not including land described in section 2568.91 or land 
within a National Park; or
    (c) Vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved land. (For purposes of 
this section, the term ``unreserved'' includes land withdrawn solely 
under the authority of section 17(d)(1) of ANCSA.)


<R05>
Sec. 2568.111  What if BLM decides that I qualify for land that is in the category of Federal land that BLM cannot convey?

    BLM will notify you in writing that you are eligible to choose an 
alternative allotment from lands described in section 2568.110.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.112  What do I do if BLM notifies me that I am eligible to choose an alternative allotment?

    You must file a request for an alternative allotment in the Alaska 
State Office as stated in section 2568.71 and follow all the 
requirements you did for your original allotment application.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.113  Do I have to prove that I used and occupied the land I've chosen as an alternative allotment?

    No. If BLM cannot convey the allotment for which you originally 
apply, and you are eligible to choose an alternative allotment, you do 
not have to prove that you used and occupied the land in the alternative 
location.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.114  How do I apply for an alternative allotment if the CSU manager determines my application is inconsistent with a CSU?

    You should contact the appropriate CSU manager as quickly as 
possible to discuss resource concerns, potential constraints, and 
impacts on existing management plans. After you do this you must file a 
request for an alternative allotment with the BLM Alaska State Office as 
stated in section 2568.71 and follow all the requirements of the 
original allotment application. If the alternative allotment land is 
also in the CSU, the CSU manager will evaluate it to determine if 
conveyance of an allotment there would be inconsistent with the CSU as 
well.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.115  When must I apply for an alternative allotment if the CSU manager determines my application is inconsistent with a CSU?

    Your application for an alternative allotment must be filed:
    (a) Within 12 months of when you receive a decision from a CSU 
manager

[[Page 163]]

that says your original allotment is inconsistent with the purposes of 
the CSU or,
    (b) Within six months of when you receive a decision from the CSU 
manager on your request for reconsideration of the original decision 
affirming that your original allotment is inconsistent with the purposes 
of the CSU, or
    (c) Within three months of the date an appellate decision from the 
appropriate Federal official becomes final. This official will be 
either:
    (1) The Regional Director of the National Park Service (NPS),
    (2) The Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(USFWS), or
    (3) The BLM Alaska State Director

                                 Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 2568.120  What can I do if I disagree with any of the decisions that are made about my allotment application?

    You may appeal all decisions, except for CSU inconsistency decisions 
or determinations by the Department of Veterans Affairs, to the Interior 
Board of Land Appeals under 43 CFR Part 4.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.121  If an agency determines my allotment is inconsistent with the purposes of a CSU, what can I do if I disagree?

    (a) You may request reconsideration of a CSU manager's decision by 
sending a signed request to that manager.
    (b) The request for reconsideration must be submitted in person or 
correctly addressed and postmarked to the CSU manager no later than 90 
calendar days of when you received the decision.
    (c) The request for reconsideration must include:
    (1) The BLM case file number of the application and parcel, and
    (2) Your reason(s) for filing the reconsideration, and any new 
pertinent information.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.122  What then does the CSU manager do with my request for reconsideration?

    (a) The CSU manager will reconsider the original inconsistency 
decision and send you a written decision within 45 calendar days after 
he or she receives your request. The 45 days may be extended for a good 
reason in which case you would be notified of the extension in writing. 
The reconsideration decision will give the CSU Manager's reasons for 
this new decision and it will summarize the evidence that the CSU 
manager used.
    (b) The reconsideration decision will provide information on how to 
appeal if you disagree with it.


<R05>
Sec. 2568.123  Can I appeal the CSU Manager's reconsidered decision if I disagree with it?

    (a) Yes. If you or your legal representative disagree with the 
decision you may appeal to the appropriate Federal official designated 
in the appeal information you receive with the decision. That official 
will be either the NPS Regional Director, the USFWS Regional Director, 
or the BLM Alaska State Director, depending on the CSU where your 
proposed allotment is located.
    (b) Your appeal must:
    (1) Be in writing,
    (2) Be submitted in person to the CSU manager or correctly addressed 
and postmarked no later than 45 calendar days of when you received the 
reconsidered decision.
    (3) State any legal or factual reason(s) why you believe the 
decision is wrong. You may include any additional evidence or arguments 
to support your appeal.
    (c) The CSU manager will send your appeal to the appropriate Federal 
official, which is either the NPS Regional Director, the USFWS Regional 
Director, or the BLM Alaska State Director.
    (d) You may present oral testimony to the appropriate Federal 
official to clarify issues raised in the written record.
    (e) The appropriate Federal official will send you his or her 
written decision within 45 calendar days of when he or she receives your 
appeal. The 45 days may be extended for good reason in which case you 
would be notified of the extension in writing.
    (f) The decision of the appropriate Federal official is the final 
administrative decision of the Department of the Interior.

                 Subpart 2610--Carey Act Grants, General


<R05>
Sec. 2610.0-2  Objectives.

    The objective of section 4 of the Act of August 18, 1894 (28 Stat. 
422), as amended (43 U.S.C. 641 et seq.), known as the Carey Act, is to 
aid public land States in the reclamation of the desert lands therein, 
and the settlement, cultivation, and sale thereof in small tracts to 
actual settlers.


<R05>
Sec. 2610.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The Carey Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, with the 
approval of the President, to contract and agree to grant and patent to 
States, in which there are desert lands, not to exceed 1,000,000 acres 
of such lands to each State, under the conditions specified in the Act. 
The Secretary is authorized to contract and agree to grant and patent 
additional lands to certain States. After a State's application for a 
grant has been approved by the Secretary, the lands are segregated from 
the public domain for a period of from 3 to 15 years, the State 
undertaking within that time to cause the reclamation of the lands by 
irrigation. The lands, when reclaimed, are patented to the States or to 
actual settlers who are its assignees. If the lands are patented to the 
State, the State transfers title to the settler. Entries are limited to 
160 acres to each actual settler.
    (b) The Act of June 11, 1896 (29 Stat. 434; 43 U.S.C. 642), 
authorizes liens on the land for the cost of construction of the 
irrigation works, and permits the issuance of patents to States for 
particular tracts actually reclaimed without regard to settlement or 
cultivation.
    (c) The Act of March 1, 1907 (34 Stat. 1056), extends the provisions 
of the Carey Act to the former Southern Ute Indian Reservation in 
Colorado.
    (d) The Joint Resolution approved May 25, 1908 (35 Stat. 577), 
authorizes grants to the State of Idaho of an additional 1,000,000 
acres.
    (e) The Act of May 27, 1908 (35 Stat. 347; 43 U.S.C. 645), 
authorizes grants of an additional 1,000,000 acres to the State of Idaho 
and the State of Wyoming.
    (f) The Act of February 24, 1909 (35 Stat. 644; 43 U.S.C. 647), 
extends the provisions of the Carey Act to the former Ute Indian 
Reservation in Colorado.
    (g) The Act of February 16, 1911 (36 Stat. 913), extends the Carey 
Act to the former Fort Bridger Military Reservation in Wyoming.
    (h) The Act of February 21, 1911 (36 Stat. 925; 43 U.S.C. 523-524), 
permits the sale of surplus water by the United

[[Page 165]]

States Bureau of Reclamation for use upon Carey Act lands.
    (i) The Act of March 4, 1911 (36 Stat. 1417; 43 U.S.C. 645), 
authorizes grants to the State of Nevada of an additional 1,000,000 
acres.
    (j) The Joint Resolution of August 21, 1911 (37 Stat. 38; 43 U.S.C. 
645), authorizes grants to the State of Colorado of an additional 
1,000,000 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 2610.0-4  Responsibilities.

    (a) The authority of the Secretary of the Interior to approve the 
applications provided for in this part, has been delegated to the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Management and redelegated to State 
Directors of the Bureau of Land Management.
    (b) The grant contact must be signed by the Secretary of the 
Interior, or an officer authorized by him, and approved by the 
President.


<R05>
Sec. 2610.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in the regulations of this part:
    (a) Actual settler means a person who establishes a primary 
residence on the land.
    (b) Cultivation means tilling or otherwise preparing the land and 
keeping the ground in a state favorable for the growth of ordinary 
agricultural crops, and requires irrigation as an attendant act.
    (c) Desert lands means unreclaimed lands which will not, without 
irrigation, produce any reasonably remunerative agricultural crop by 
usual means or methods of cultivation. This includes lands which will 
not, without irrigation, produce paying crops during a series of years, 
but on which crops can be successfully grown in alternate years by means 
of the so-called dry-farming system. Lands which produce native grasses 
sufficient in quantity, if ungrazed by grazing animals, to make an 
ordinary crop of hay in usual seasons, are not desert lands. Lands which 
will produce an agricultural crop of any kind without irrigation in 
amount sufficient to make the cultivation reasonably remunerative are 
not desert. Lands containing sufficient moisture to produce a natural 
growth of trees are not to be classed as desert lands.
    (d) Economic feasibility means the capability of an entry to provide 
an economic return to the settler sufficient to provide a viable farm 
enterprise and assure continued use of the land for farming purposes. 
Factors considered in determining feasibility may include the cost of 
developing or acquiring water, land reclamation costs, land treatment 
costs, the cost of construction or acquisition of a habitable residence, 
acquisition of farm equipment, fencing and other costs associated with a 
farm enterprise, such as water delivery, seed, planting, fertilization, 
harvest, etc.
    (e) Grant contract means the contract between a State and the United 
States which sets the terms and conditions which the State or its 
assignees shall comply with before lands shall be patented.
    (f) Irrigation means the application of water to the land for the 
purpose of growing crops.
    (g) Ordinary agricultural crops means any agricultural product to 
which the land under consideration is generally adapted, and which would 
return a fair reward for the expense of producing them. Ordinary 
agricultural crops do not include forest products, but may include 
orchards and other plants which cannot be grown on the land without 
irrigation and from which a profitable crop may be harvested.
    (h) Reclamation means the establishment of works for conducting 
water in adequate volume and quantity to the land so as to render it 
available for distribution when needed for irrigation and cultivation.
    (i) Segregation means the action under the Act of August 19, 1894 
(39 Stat. 422), as amended (43 U.S.C. 641), by which the lands are 
reserved from the public domain and closed to application or entry under 
the public land laws, including location under the mining laws.
    (j) Smallest legal subdivision means a quarter quarter section (40 
acres).


<R05>
Sec. 2610.0-7  Background.

    The Carey Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, with the 
approval of the President, to contract and agree to grant and patent to 
States, in which there are desert lands,

[[Page 166]]

not exceeding 1 million acres of such lands to each State, as the State 
may cause to be reclaimed. The State shall also cause not less than 20 
acres of each 160 acre tract to be cultivated by actual settlers. A 
number of amendments allowed additional acreages for certain States. 
Colorado, Nevada and Wyoming were allowed up to 2 million acres. Idaho 
was allowed up to 3 million acres.


<R05>
Sec. 2610.0-8  Lands subject to application.

    (a) The lands shall be unreclaimed desert lands capable of producing 
ordinary agricultural crops by irrigation.
    (b) The lands shall be nonmineral, except that lands withdrawn, 
classified or valuable for coal, phosphate, nitrate, potash, sodium, 
sulphur, oil, gas or asphaltic minerals may be applied for subject to a 
reservation of such deposit, as explained in subpart 2093 of this title.
    (c) Lands embraced in mineral permits of leases, or in applications 
for such permits or leases, or classified, withdrawn or reported as 
valuable for any leasable mineral, or lying within the geologic 
structure of a field are subject to the provisions of Secs. 2093.0-3 
through 2093.0-7 of this title.
    (d) A project or individual entry may consist of 2 or more 
noncontiguous parcels. However, noncontiguous lands should be in a 
pattern compact enough to be managed as an efficient, economic unit.


<R04>
        Subpart 2611--Segregation Under the Carey Act: Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 2611.1  Applications.


<R05>
Sec. 2611.1-1  Applications for determination of suitability and availability of lands.

    The first step in obtaining segregation of lands for Carey Act 
development shall be the filing of an application in the appropriate 
State office of the Bureau of Land Management requesting that the 
authorized officer make a determination regarding the suitability and 
availability of lands for a Carey Act Project. The application shall 
consist of a map of lands proposed to be reclaimed, containing 
sufficient detail to clearly show which lands are included in the 
Project, the mode of irrigation and the source of water. The map shall 
bear a certification by the State official authorized to file the 
application that the lands are applied for subject to the provisions of 
subpart 2093 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2611.1-2  Determination of suitability and availability of lands.

    The authorized officer shall evaluate the suitability and 
availability of the lands for agricultural development under the Carey 
Act utilizing the criteria and procedures in part 2400 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2611.1-3  Application for grant contract.

    If it is determined that lands are suitable and available for 
agricultural development under the Carey Act, the State shall submit the 
following, in duplicate, to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management 
office (43 CFR part 1821):
    (a) A plan of development that includes:
    (1) A report on the economic feasibility of the project and the 
availability of an adequate supply of water to thoroughly irrigate and 
reclaim the lands to raise ordinary agricultural crops.
    (2) Procedures for avoiding or mitigating adverse environmental 
impacts and for rehabilitation of the lands if all or part of the 
project fails.
    (3) A map in sufficient detail to show the proposed major irrigation 
works and the lands to be irrigated. Map material and dimensions shall 
be as prescribed by the authorized officer and shall be drawn to a scale 
not greater than 1,000 feet to 1 inch. The map shall connect canals, 
pipelines larger than 8 inches in diameter, reservoirs and other major 
facilities in relationship to public survey lines or corners, where 
present. The map shall show other data as needed to enable retracement 
of the proposed major irrigation works on the ground. The engineer who 
prepared the map shall certify that the system depicted therein is 
accurately and fully represented and that the system proposed is 
sufficient to fully reclaim the lands.

[[Page 167]]

    (4) Additional data concerning the specifics of the plan and its 
feasibility as required by the authorized officer.
    (b) A grant contract in a form prescribed by the Director, Bureau of 
Land Management, in duplicate, signed by the authorized State official, 
shall also be filed. A carbon copy of the contract shall not be 
accepted. The person who signs the contract on behalf of the State shall 
furnish evidence of his/her authority to do so. The contract shall 
obligate the State to all terms and conditions of the Act and all 
specifications of the approved plan, and shall obligate the United 
States to issue patents to the State upon actual reclamation of the 
lands according to the plan or to settlers who are its assignees, as 
provided in subpart 2093 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2611.1-4  Approval of plan and contract.

    (a) After making a determination that the proposed project is 
economically feasible, that sufficient water can be furnished to 
thoroughly irrigate and reclaim the lands, that measures to avoid or 
mitigate adverse environmental impacts and to rehabilitate the lands if 
the project fails are adequate, and that State laws and regulations 
concerning the disposal of the lands to actual settlers are not contrary 
to the provisions and restrictions of the Act, the authorized officer 
may approve the plan. Before making this determination and approving the 
plan, the authorized officer may, in agreement with the State, modify 
the plan.
    (b) Upon approval of the plan, the grant contract may be signed by 
the Secretary of the Interior, or an officer in the Office of the 
Secretary who has been appointed by the President, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate. A notice that the contract has been 
signed and the lands are segregated shall be published in the Federal 
Register. As a condition to entering into the contract, the Secretary or 
his delegate may require additional terms and conditions. If such is 
done, the new contract form shall be returned to the State for signing.
    (c) The contract is not final and binding until approved by the 
President.
    (d) After the plan has been approved, and the contract signed and 
approved, the lands may be entered by the State and its agents for 
reclamation and for residency, if appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 2611.1-5  Priority of Carey Act applications.

    Properly filed applications under Sec. 2611.1-1 or Sec. 2611.1-3 of 
this title shall have priority over any subsequently filed agricultural 
applications for lands within the project boundaries. However, the 
rejection of a Carey Act application will not preclude subsequent 
agricultural development under another authority.


<R05>
Sec. 2611.2  Period of segregation.

    (a) The States are allowed 10 years from the date of the signing of 
the contract by the Secretary in which to cause the lands to be 
reclaimed. If the State fails in this, the State Director may, in his 
discretion, extend the period for up to 5 years, or may restore the 
lands to the public domain at the end of the 10 years or any extension 
thereof. If actual construction of the reclamation works has not been 
commenced within 3 years after the segregation of the land or within 
such further period not exceeding 3 years as may be allowed for that 
purpose by the State Director, the State Director may, in his 
discretion, restore the lands to the public domain.
    (b) All applications for extensions of the period of segregation 
must be submitted to the State Director. Such applications will be 
entertained only upon the showing of circumstances which prevent 
compliance by the State with the requirements within the time allowed, 
which, in the judgment of the State Director, could not have been 
reasonably anticipated or guarded against, such as the distruction of 
irrigation works by storms, floods, or other unavoidable casualties, 
unforeseen structural or physical difficulties encountered in the 
operations, or errors in surveying and locating needed ditches, canals, 
or pipelines.


<R05>
Sec. 2611.3  Rights-of-way over other public lands.

    When the canals, ditches, pipelines, reservoirs or other facilities 
required by the plan of development will be located on public lands not 
applied for by

[[Page 168]]

the State under the Carey Act, an application for right-of-way over such 
lands under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976 (43 U.S.C. 1761 et seq.), shall be filed separately by the proposed 
constructor. Rights-of-way shall be approved simultaneously with the 
approval of the plan, but shall be conditioned on approval of the 
contract.


<R04>
                    Subpart 2612--Issuance of Patents


<R05>
Sec. 2612.1  Lists for patents.

    When patents are desired for any lands that have been segregated, 
the State shall file in the BLM State Office a list of lands to be 
patented, with a certificate of the presiding officer of the State land 
board, or other officer of the State who may be charged with the duty of 
disposing of the lands which the State may obtain under the law, that 
the lands have been reclaimed according to the plan of development, so 
that a permanent supply of water has been made available for each tract 
in the list, sufficient to thoroughly reclaim each 160-acre tract for 
the raising of ordinary agricultural crops. If patents are to be issued 
directly to assignees, the list shall include their names, the 
particular lands each claims, and a certification by the State that each 
is an actual settler and has cultivated at least 20 acres of each 160-
acre tract. If there are portions which cannot be reclaimed, the nature, 
extent, location, and area of such portions should be fully stated. If 
less than 5 acres of a smallest legal subdivision can be reclaimed and 
the subdivision is not essential for the reclamation, cultivation, or 
settlement of the lands; such legal subdivision must be relinquished, 
and shall be restored to the public domain as provided in a notice 
published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 2612.2  Publication of lists for patents.

    (a) Notice of lists. When a list for patents is filed in the State 
Office, it shall be acompanied by a notice of the filing, in duplicate, 
prepared for the signature of the State Director, or his delegate, fully 
incorporating the list. The State shall cause this notice to be 
published once a week for 5 consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of 
established character and general circulation in the vicinity of the 
lands, to be designated by the State Director, as provided in subpart 
1824 of this chapter.
    (b) Proof of publication. At the expiration of the period of 
publication, the State shall file in the State Office proof of 
publication and of payment for the same.


<R05>
Sec. 2612.3  Issuance of patents.

    Upon the receipt of proof of publication such action shall be taken 
in each case as the showing may require, and all tracts that are free 
from valid protest, and respecting which the law and regulations and 
grant contract have been complied with, shall be patented to the State, 
or to its assignees if the lands have been settled and cultivated. If 
patent issues to the State, it is the responsibility of the State to 
assure that the lands are cultivated and settled. If the State does not 
dispose of the patented lands within 5 years to actual settlers who have 
cultivated at least 20 acres of each 160 acre tract, or if the State 
disposes of the patented lands to any person who is not an actual 
settler or has not cultivated 20 acres of the 160 acre tract, action may 
be taken to revest title in the United States.


<R04>
             Subpart 2613--Preference Right Upon Restoration


<R05>
Sec. 2613.0-3  Authority.

    The Act approved February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 407; 43 U.S.C. 644), 
provides that upon restoration of Carey Act lands from segregation, the 
Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to allow a preference right 
of entry under other applicable land laws to any Carey Act entryman on 
any such lands which such person had entered under and pursuant to the 
State laws providing for the administration of the grant and upon which 
such person had established actual, bona fide residence or had made 
substantial and permanent improvements.

[[Page 169]]


<R05>
Sec. 2613.1  Allowance of filing of applications.

    (a) Status of lands under State laws. Prior to the restoration of 
lands segregated under the Carey Act, the Bureau of Land Management 
shall ascertain from the proper State officials whether any entries have 
been allowed under the State Carey Act laws on any such lands, and if 
any such entries have been allowed, the status thereof and action taken 
by the State with reference thereto.
    (b) No entries under State laws. If it is shown with reasonable 
certainty, either from the report of the State officers or by other 
available information, that there are no entries under State law, then 
the Act of February 14, 1920, shall not be considered applicable to the 
restoration of the lands. Lands shall be restored as provided in a 
notice published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Entries under State laws. If it appears from the report of the 
State officials or otherwise that there are entries under the State law 
which may properly be the basis for preference rights under this act, in 
the order restoring the lands the authorized officer may, in his 
discretion, allow only the filing of applications to obtain a preference 
right under the Act of February 14, 1920.


<R05>
Sec. 2613.2  Applications.

    (a) Applications for preference rights under the Act of February 14, 
1920, shall be filed within 90 days of the publication of the 
restoration order.
    (b) Applications shall be on a form approved by the Director and 
shall set forth sufficient facts to show that the applicant is qualified 
under the act and these regulations. The application must be subscribed 
and sworn to before a notary public.
    (c) Persons qualified. The Act of February 14, 1920, applies only to 
cases of entries in good faith in compliance with the requirements of 
State law, with a view to reclaiming the land and procuring title 
pursuant to the provisions of the Carey Act; the act does not apply to 
cases where persons have settled on or improved the segregated land, 
either with the approval of the State authorities or otherwise, not 
pursuant to State law or not in anticipation of reclaiming the lands and 
procuring title under the Carey Act but in anticipation of initiating 
some kind of a claim to the land on its restoration because of failure 
of the project or cancellation of the segregation.
    (d) Persons not qualified. The Act of February 14, 1920, does not 
apply to cases where the applicant's entry has been canceled by the 
State or forfeited for failure to perfect the entry according to State 
law, unless the failure is the result of conditions which culminated in 
the elimination of the lands from the project if the State has allowed a 
subsequent entry for the same lands, this shall be conclusive evidence 
that the default was the fault of the State entryman whose entry was 
forfeited or canceled.


<R05>
Sec. 2613.3  Allowance of preference right.

    If a person's application is approved, such person shall have 90 
days to submit an application for entry under another land law, and 
shall be entitled to a preference right of entry under other law if and 
when the lands are determined to be suitable for entry under such law 
pursuant to the regulations found in part 2400 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 2621.0-2  Objectives and background.

    Generally, grants made by Statehood Acts to the various States of 
school sections 16 and 36, and in addition, sections 2 and 32 in 
Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, attach to a school sections on the date 
of acceptance or approval of the plat of survey thereof. If the 
acceptance or approval was prior to the granting act, or to the date of 
admission of the State into the Union, the grant attaches either on the 
date of approval of the act or the date of admission into the Union, 
whichever is the later date. However, if on the date the grant would 
otherwise attach, the land is appropriated under some applicable public 
land law, the grant does not attach, and the State is entitled to 
indemnity therefor as provided in the regulations in this subpart.

[35 FR 9607, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 2621.0-3  Authority.

    (a) Sections 2275 and 2276 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (43 
U.S.C. 851, 852), referred to in Secs. 2621.0-3 to 2621.4 of this 
subpart as the law, authorize the public land States except Alaska to 
select lands (or the retained or reserved interest of the United States 
in lands which have been disposed of with a reservation to the United 
States of all minerals, or any specified mineral or minerals, which 
interest is referred to in Secs. 2621.0-3 to 2621.4 as the mineral 
estate) of equal acreage within their boundaries as indemnity for grant 
lands in place lost to the States because of appropriation before title 
could pass to the State or because of natural deficiencies resulting 
from such causes as fractional sections and fractional townships.
    (b) The law provides that indemnity for lands lost because of 
natural deficiencies will be selected from the unappropriated, 
nonmineral, public lands, and that indemnity for lands lost before title 
could pass to the State will be selected from the unappropriated, public 
lands subject to the following restrictions:
    (1) No lands mineral in character may be selected except to the 
extent that the selection is made as indemnity for mineral lands.
    (2) No lands on a known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas 
field may be selected except to the extent that the selection is made as 
indemnity for lands on such a structure.
    (c) The law also provides that lands subject to a mineral lease or 
permit may be selected, but only if the lands are otherwise available 
for selection, and if none of the lands subject to that lease or permit 
are in producing or producible status. It permits the selection of lands 
withdrawn, classified, or reported as valuable for coal, phosphate, 
nitrate, potash, oil, gas, asphaltic minerals, oil shale, sodium, and 
sulphur and lands withdrawn by Executive Order 5327 of April 15, 1930, 
if such lands are otherwise available for, and subject to, selection: 
Provided, That except where the base lands are mineral in character, 
such minerals are reserved to the United States in accordance with and 
subject to the regulations in subpart 2093. Except for the withdrawals 
mentioned in this paragraph and for lands subject to classification 
under section 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 
1269; 43 U.S.C. 315f), as amended, the law does not permit the selection 
of withdrawn or reserved lands.
    (d) Subsection (b) of the section 2276 of the Revised Statutes, as 
amended, sets forth the principles of adjustment

[[Page 171]]

where selections are made to compensate for deficiencies of school lands 
in fractional townships.

[35 FR 9607, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 2621.1  Applications for selection.

    (a) Applications for selection must be made on a form approved by 
the Director, and must be accompanied by a petition on a form approved 
by the Director properly executed. However, if the lands described in 
application have been already classified and opened for selection 
pursuant to the regulations of this part, no petition is required.
    (b) Applications for selection under the law will be made by the 
proper selecting agent of the State and will be filed, in duplicate, in 
the proper office in the State or for lands or mineral estate in a State 
in which there is no office, will be filed in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1821.2 of this chapter.
    (c) Applications must be accompanied by the following information:
    (1) A reference to the Act of August 27, 1958 (72 Stat. 928), as 
amended.
    (2) A certificate by the selecting agent showing:
    (i) All facts relative to medicinal or hot springs or other waters 
upon the selected lands.

(This provision does not apply insofar as the application involves the 
selection of the mineral estate.)
    (ii) That indemnity has not been previously granted for the assigned 
base lands and that no other selection is pending for such assigned 
base.
    (3) A statement describing the mineral or nonmineral character of 
each smallest legal subdivision of the base and selected lands or 
mineral estate.
    (4) A certificate by the officer or officers charged with the care 
and disposal of school lands that no instrument purporting to convey, or 
in any way incumber, the title to any of the land used as base or bases, 
has been issued by the State or its agents.
    (d) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section, applications for selection must conform with the following 
rules:
    (1) The selected land and base lands must be described in accordance 
with the official plats of survey except that unsurveyed lands will be 
described in terms of protracted surveys as officially approved in 
accordance with 43 CFR 3101.1-4(d)(1). If the unsurveyed lands are not 
covered by protracted surveys the lands must be described in terms of 
their probable legal description, if and when surveyed in accordance 
with the rectangular system of public land surveys, or if the State 
Director gives written approval therefor, by a metes and bounds 
description adequate to identify the lands accurately.
    (2) Separate base or bases do not have to be assigned to each 
smallest legal subdivision of selected surveyed lands or mineral estate 
and to each tract of unsurveyed lands upon application. However, prior 
to final approval of the selection, separate base or bases shall be 
assigned. Assignment of the smallest actual or probable legal 
subdivision as base will constitute an election to take indemnity for 
the entire subdivision and is a waiver of the State's rights to such 
subdivision, except that any remaining balance of acreage may be used as 
base in other selections.
    (3) For purposes of selecting unsurveyed land a protracted section 
shall be considered to be a smallest legal subdivision except where the 
State Director finds otherwise.
    (4) The cause of loss of the base lands to the State must be 
specifically stated for each separate base.

    (a) The State will be required to publish once a week for five 
consecutive weeks in accordance with Sec. 1824.3 of this chapter, at its 
own expense, in a designated newspaper and in a designated form, a 
notice allowing all persons claiming the land adversely to file in the

certified to a State, or if, where the State has previously acquired 
title to a portion of the lands subject to a mineral lease or permit, 
the remaining lands in the lease or permit are certified to the State, 
the State shall succeed to the position of the United States thereunder. 
Where a portion of the lands subject to any mineral lease or permit are 
certified to a State, the United States shall retain for the duration of 
the lease or permit the mineral or minerals for which the lease or 
permit was issued.

Sec. 2621.4  Application for selection of unsurveyed lands.

    (a) The authorized officer will reject any application for selection 
of unsurveyed lands if: (1) The costs of survey of the lands would 
grossly exceed the average per-acre costs of surveying public lands 
under the rectangular system of surveys in the State in which the lands 
are located, or (2) if the conveyance of the lands would create serious 
problems in the administration of the remaining public lands or 
resources thereof or would significantly diminish the value of the 
remaining public lands. The term remaining public lands means the public 
lands from which the applied-for lands would be separated by survey.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of this section, applications for 
selection of unsurveyed lands are subject to the provisions of subpart 
2400.

<R05>
Sec. 2623.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The first paragraph of section 1 of the Act approved January 25, 
1927 (44 Stat. 1026; 43 U.S.C. 870), reads as follows:

    That, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section, the several grants to the States of numbered sections in 
place for the support or in aid of common or public schools be, and they 
are hereby, extended to embrace numbered school sections mineral in 
character, unless land has been granted to and/or selected by and 
certified or approved, to any such State or States as indemnity or in 
lieu of any land so granted by numbered sections.


    (b) The beneficiaries of this grant are the States of Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North 
Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. The grant 
also extends to the unsurveyed school sections reserved, granted, and 
confirmed to the State of Florida by the Act of Congress approved 
September 22, 1922 (42 Stat. 1017; 16 U.S.C. 483, 484).
    (c) The additional grant thus made, subject to all the conditions in 
the statute making same, applies to school-section lands known to be of 
mineral character at the effective date thereof as hereinafter defined. 
It does not include school-section lands nonmineral in character, those 
not known to be mineral in character at time of grant, but afterwards 
found to contain mineral deposits, such lands not being excepted from 
the grants theretofore made (Wyoming et al. v. United States, 255 U.S. 
489-500, 501, 65 L. ed. 742-748), nor does it include lands in numbered 
school sections in lieu of or as indemnity for which lands were conveyed 
to the States first above named, or to the State of Florida with respect 
to school-section lands coming within the purview of the Act of 
September 22, 1922, prior to January 25, 1927.
    (d) Determinations made prior to January 25, 1927, by the Secretary 
of the Interior or the Commissioner of the General Land Office to the 
effect that lands in school sections were excepted from school-land 
grants because of their known mineral character do not, of themselves, 
prevent or affect in any way the vesting of title in the States pursuant 
to the provisions of the statute making the additional grant.
    (e) Subsection (a) of section 1 of the Act provides:

    That the grant of numbered mineral sections under this Act shall be 
of the same effect as prior grants for the numbered nonmineral sections, 
and title to such numbered mineral sections shall vest in the States at 
the time and in the manner and be subject to all the rights of adverse 
parties recognized by existing law in the grants of numbered nonmineral 
sections.

<R05>
Sec. 2623.0-8  Lands subject to selection.

    (a) Lands included in grant. (1) Section 2 of the Act of January 25, 
1927 (44 Stat. 1027; 43 U.S.C. 871) reads as follows:

    Sec. 2. That nothing herein contained is intended or shall be held 
or construed to increase, diminish, or affect the rights of States under 
grants other than for the support of common or public schools by 
numbered school sections in place, and this Act shall not apply to 
indemnity of lieu selections or exchanges or the right hereafter to 
select indemnity for numbered school sections in place lost to the State 
under the provisions of this or other Acts, and all existing laws 
governing such grants and indemnity or lieu selections and exchanges are 
hereby continued in full force and effect.

    (2) The only grants affected in any way by the provisions of the Act 
of January 25, 1927, are those of numbered sections of land in place 
made to the States for the support of common or public schools. The 
adjudication of claims to land asserted under other grants, for 
indemnity or lieu lands and exchanges of lands, will proceed as 
theretofore, being governed by the provisions of existing laws 
applicable thereto. The States will be afforded full opportunity, 
however, if the facts and conditions are such as to authorize such 
action, either to assign new base in support of or to withdraw pending 
unapproved indemnity school land selections in support of which mineral 
school-section lands have been tendered as base.

[[Page 174]]

    (b) Lands excluded from grant. (1) Subsection (c) of section 1 of 
the Act of January 25, 1927, provides:

    That any lands included within the limits of existing reservations 
of or by the United States, or specifically reserved for waterpower 
purposes, or included in any pending suit or proceedings in the courts 
of the United States, or subject to or included in any valid 
application, claim, or right initiated or held under any of the existing 
laws of the United States, unless or until such application, claim, or 
right is relinquished or canceled, and all lands in the Territory of 
Alaska are excluded from the provisions of this act.


    (2) School-section lands included within the limits of existing 
reservations of or by the United States, specifically reserved for 
waterpower purposes, or included in any suit or proceedings in the 
courts of the United States, prior to January 25, 1927, and all lands in 
Alaska are excluded from the provisions of the Act. (Sec. 2623.4)
    (3) The words existing reservation as used in subsection (c) are 
construed generally and subject to specific determination in particular 
cases if the need therefor shall arise, as including Indian and military 
reservations, naval and petroleum reserves, national parks, national 
forests, stock driveways, reservations established under the Act of June 
25, 1910 (36 Stat. 847; 43 U.S.C. 141-143), as amended by the Act of 
August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. 497; 43 U.S.C. 142), and all forms of 
Executive withdrawal recognized and construed by the Department of the 
Interior as reservations, existent prior to January 25, 1927.


<R05>
Sec. 2623.1  Effective date of grant.

    Grants to the States of school lands in place (the numbered 
sections), of the character and status subject thereto, as a rule, are 
effective and operate to vest title upon the date of the approval of the 
statute making the grant or the date of the admission of the State into 
the Union, as to lands then surveyed, and as to the lands thereafter 
surveyed upon the date of the acceptance of the survey thereof by the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Management. (United States v. Morrison, 
240 U.S. 192, 60 L. ed. 599; United States v. Sweet, 245 U.S. 563, 62 L. 
ed. 473; Wyoming et al. v. United States, supra.) It is held, therefore, 
that the grant made by the first paragraph of section 1 of the Act of 
January 25, 1927, subject to the provision therein with respect to 
indemnity or lieu lands, to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of 
said section 1 and following the plain provisions of subsection (a) 
thereof is effective upon the date of the approval of the Act (January 
25, 1927) as to lands then surveyed and the survey thereof accepted by 
the Director of the Bureau of Land Management and as to the unsurveyed 
school sections in the State of Florida granted to that State by the Act 
of September 22, 1922. The grant, as to other lands thereafter surveyed, 
subject to the same provisions is effective upon the acceptance of the 
survey thereof as above indicated.


<R05>
Sec. 2623.2  Claims protected.

    (a) Valid applications, claims, or rights protected by the 
provisions of subsection (c) of section 1 of the Act of January 25, 
1927, include applications, entries, selections, locations, permits, 
leases, and other forms of filing, initiated or held pursuant to 
existing laws of the United States prior to January 25, 1927, embracing 
known mineral school-section lands then surveyed and otherwise within 
the terms of the additional grant, and as to lands thereafter surveyed, 
valid applications, claims, or rights so initiated or held prior to the 
date of the acceptance of the survey. The additional grant to the State 
will attach upon the effective date of the relinquishment or 
cancellation of any claim, so asserted, in the absence of any other 
valid existing claim for the land and if same be then surveyed. Should 
the validity of any such claim be questioned by the State, proceedings 
with respect thereto by protest, contest, hearing, etc., will be had in 
the form and manner prescribed by existing rules governing such cases. 
This procedure will be followed in the matter of all protests, contests, 
or claims filed by individuals, associations, or corporations against 
the States affecting school-section lands.

<R05>
Sec. 2623.3  States not permitted to dispose of lands except with reservation of minerals.

    (a) Subsection (b) of section 1 of the Act of January 25, 1927, 
provides:

    That the additional grant made by this Act is upon the express 
condition that all sales, grants, deeds, or patents for any of the lands 
so granted shall be subject to and contain a reservation to the State of 
all the coal and other minerals in the lands so sold, granted, deeded, 
or patented, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove 
the same. The coal and other mineral deposits in such lands shall be 
subject to lease by the State as the State legislature may direct, the 
proceeds of rentals and royalties therefrom to be utilized for the 
support or in aid of the common or public schools: Provided, That any 
lands or minerals disposed of contrary to the provisions of this Act 
shall be forfeited to the United States by appropriate proceedings 
instituted by the Attorney General for that purpose in the United States 
district court for the district in which the property or some part 
thereof is located.


    (b) The lands granted to the States by the Act of January 25, 1927, 
and the mineral deposits therein are to be disposed of by the States in 
the manner prescribed in subsection (b) thereof, provision being made 
for judicial forfeiture in case of disposal of any of the lands or 
minerals contrary to the provisions of the act.


<R05>
Sec. 2623.4  Grant of mineral school sections effective upon restoration of land from reservation.

    (a) By the Act of January 25, 1927 (44 Stat. 1026; 43 U.S.C. 870, 
871), which grants to the States certain school-section lands that are 
mineral in character, it is provided by subsection (c) of section 1 that 
where such lands are embraced within an existing reservation at the date 
of said Act of 1927, they are thereby excluded from the grant made by 
said act.
    (b) Under the amendatory Act of May 2, 1932 (47 Stat. 140; 43 U.S.C. 
870), it is provided that in the event of the restoration of the lands 
from such reservation, the grant to the State of such mineral school-
section lands will thereupon become effective.
    (c) Adjudications in connection with the State's title to school 
sections will be governed by the provisions of this amendatory Act of 
May 2, 1932.

    Source: 35 FR 9610, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2625.0-3  Authority.

    (a) Circular dated Mar. 17, 1896, containing the swamp-land laws and 
regulations, states:

    As soon as practicable after the passage of the swamp-land grant of 
September 28, 1850, viz, on the 21st of November 1850, the commissioner 
transmitted to the governors of the respective States to which the grant 
applied copies of office circular setting forth the provisions of said 
Act, giving instructions thereunder, and allowing the States to elect 
which of two methods they would adopt for the purpose of designating the 
swamp lands, viz:
    1. The field notes of Government survey could be taken as the basis 
for selections, and all lands shown by them to be swamp or overflowed, 
within the meaning of the act, which were otherwise vacant and 
unappropriated September 28, 1850, would pass to the States.
    2. The States could select the lands by their own agents and report 
the same to the United States surveyor general with proof as to the 
character of the same.
    The following States elected to make the field notes of survey the 
basis for determining what lands passed to them under the grant, viz: 
Louisiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Later the State of Minnesota adopted 
this method of settlement.
    The authorities of the following States elected to make their 
selections by their own agents and present proof that the lands selected 
were of the character contemplated by the swamp grant, viz: Alabama, 
Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, and 
Ohio. Later Oregon adopted this method.
    The States of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Mississippi, and Ohio 
adopted the second method at the beginning, but they changed to the 
first method, i.e., to the field notes of survey, as a basis of 
settlement, in recent years.
    The authorities of California did not adopt either method, and the 
passage of the Act of July 23, 1866, rendered such action on their part 
unnecessary.
    In Louisiana the selections under the grant of March 2, 1849, 
forming the bulk of the selections in said State, are made in accordance 
with the terms of said act by deputy surveyors, under the direction of 
the United

[[Page 176]]

States surveyor general, at the expense of the State.


    (b) The grant of swamp lands, under Acts of March 2, 1849, and 
September 28, 1850, is a grant in praesenti. See United States Supreme 
Court decisions Railroad Co. v. Fremont County (9 Wall, 89, 19 L. ed. 
563); Railroad Co. v. Smith (id. 95, 19 L. ed. 599); Martin v. Marks (7 
Otto 345, 24 L. ed. 940); decisions of the Secretary of the Interior, 
December 23, 1851 (1 Lester's L.L. 549), April 25, 1862, and opinion of 
Attorney General, November 10, 1858 (1 Lester's L.L. 564).
    (c) The Act of September 28, 1850, did not grant swamp and 
overflowed lands to States admitted into the Union after its passage. 
See decision of Secretary of the Interior, August 17, 1858; 
Commissioner, General Land Office, May 2, 1871 (Copp's L.L. 474), 
affirmed by Secretary June 1, 1871, and Commissioner, General Land 
Office, January 19, 1874 (Copp's L.L. 473), affirmed by Secretary July 
9, 1875.
    (d) A State having elected to take swamp land by field notes and 
plats of survey is bound by them, as is also the Government. (See 
Secretary's decisions, October 4, 1855 (1 Lester's L.L. 553), August 1, 
1859 (id. 571), December 4, 1877 (4 Copp's L.L. 149), and September 19, 
1879.
    (e) The Swamp-Land Acts do not contain any exception or reservation 
of mineral lands and none is to be implied, since at the time of their 
enactment the public policy of withholding mineral lands for disposition 
only under laws including them, was not established. Work, Secretary of 
the Interior v. Louisiana (269 U.S. 250, 70 L. ed. 259).


<R05>
Sec. 2625.1  Selection and patenting of swamp lands.

    (a) All lands properly selected and reported to the Bureau of Land 
Management as swamp will be compared with the records of the said 
office, and lists of such lands as are shown to be swamp or overflowed, 
within the meaning of the Acts of March 2, 1849, and September 28, 1850 
(9 Stat. 352, 519), and that are otherwise free from conflict will be 
made out by such office and approved.
    (b) When the lists have been approved a copy of each list will be 
transmitted to the governor of the State, with the statement that on 
receipt of his request patent will issue to the State for the lands. A 
copy of each list also will be transmitted to the authorizing officer of 
the proper office for the district in which the lands are situated, and 
he will be requested to examine the same with the records of his office 
and report any conflicts found.
    (c) Upon receipt of a request from the governor for patent, and a 
report from the authorizing officer as to status, patents will issue to 
the State for all the lands embraced in said lists so far as they are 
free from conflict.
    (d) Under the provisions of the Act of March 2, 1849, granting swamp 
lands to the State of Louisiana, a certified copy of the list approved 
by the Director, transmitted to the Governor, has the force and effect 
of a patent.


<R05>
Sec. 2625.2  Applications in conflict with swamp-land claims.

    Applications adverse to the State, in conflict with swamp-land 
claims, will be governed by the following rules:
    (a) In those States where the adjudication of swamp-land claims is 
based on the evidence contained in the survey returns, applications 
adverse to the State for lands returned as swamp will be rejected unless 
accompanied by a showing that the land is non-swamp in character.
    (b) In such case, the claim adverse to the State must be supported 
by a statement of the applicant under oath, corroborated by two 
witnesses, setting forth the basis of the claim and that at the date of 
the swamp-land grant the land was not swamp and overflowed and not 
rendered thereby unfit for cultivation. In the absence of such affidavit 
the application will be rejected. If properly supported, the application 
will be received and suspended subject to a hearing to determine the 
swamp or nonswamp character of the land, the burden of proof being upon 
the non-swamp claimant.
    (c) In those States where the survey returns are not made the basis 
for adjudication of the swamp-land selections, junior applications for 
lands covered by swamp-land selections may be

[[Page 177]]

received and suspended, if supported by non-swamp affidavits 
corroborated by two witnesses, subject to hearing to determine the 
character of the land, whether swamp or non-swamp, and the burden of 
proof will be upon the junior applicant. Likewise, the State, if a 
junior applicant, may be heard upon furnishing an affidavit corroborated 
by two witnesses alleging that the land is swamp in character within the 
meaning of the swamp-land grant, in which case the burden of proof at 
the hearing will be upon the State.
    (d) Where hearings are ordered in any such cases, the Rules of 
Practice governing contests will be applied, except as herein otherwise 
provided.

<R05>
Sec. 2627.1  Grant for community purposes.

    (a) Authority. The Act of July 7, 1958 (72 Stat. 339, 340), grants 
to the State of Alaska the right to select, within 25 years after 
January 3, 1959, not to exceed 400,000 acres of national forest lands in 
Alaska which are vacant and unappropriated at the time of their 
selection and not to exceed 400,000 acres of other public lands in 
Alaska which are vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved at the time of 
their selection. The act provides that the selected lands must be 
adjacent to the established communities or suitable for prospective 
community centers and recreational areas. The act further provides that 
such lands shall be selected with the approval of the Secretary of 
Agriculture as to national forest lands and with the approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior as to other lands, and that no selection shall 
be made north and west of the line described in section 10 of the act 
without approval of the President or his designated representative.
    (b) Applicable regulations. Unless otherwise indicated therein, the 
regulations in Sec. 2627.3 (a) to (d) apply to the grant and selection 
of lands for community purposes. In addition to the requirements of 
Sec. 2627.3(c), where the selected lands are national forest, the 
application for selection must be accompanied by a statement of the 
Secretary of Agriculture or his delegate showing that he approves the 
selection.
    (c) Approval of selections outside of national forests. Selection of 
lands outside of national forests will be approved by the authorized 
officer of the Bureau of Land Management if, all else being regular, he 
finds that approval of a selection of lands adjacent to an established 
community will further expansion of an established community, or if the 
lands are suitable for prospective community centers and recreational 
areas.

of the University of Alaska, the unsatisfied portion of 100,000 acres of 
vacant, surveyed, unreserved public lands in said State, to be selected 
by the State, under the direction and subject to the approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior, and subject to the conditions and limitations 
expressed in the act.
    (b) Applications for selection. (1) Applications to select lands 
under the grant made to Alaska by the Act of January 21, 1929, will be 
made by the proper selecting agent of the State and will be filed in the 
proper office of the district in which such selected lands are situated. 
Such selections must be made in accordance with the law and with the 
applicable regulations governing selection of lands by States as set 
forth in part 2620.
    (2) Notice of selection and publication is required as provided by 
Sec. 2627.5 (b) and (c).
    (3) Each list of selections must contain a reference to the act 
under which the selections are made and must be accompanied by a 
certificate of the selecting agent showing the selections are made under 
and pursuant to the laws of the State of Alaska.
    (4) The selections in any one list must not exceed 6,400 acres.
    (5) Each list must be accompanied by a certification of the

cumulative acreage

[[Page 178]]

total of all prior sales for lists pending and finally approved for 
clear-listing or patenting does not exceed 100,000 acres.
    (c) Statement with application. Every application for selection 
under the Act of January 21, 1929, must be accompanied by a duly 
corroborated statement making the following showing as to the lands

same other than the applicant; and that at the date of the application 
no part of the land was claimed under the mining laws.
    (2) That the land applied for does not extend more than 160 rods 
along the shore of any navigable water or that such restriction has been 
or should be waived. (See Sec. 2094.2 of this chapter.)

upon the lands must be stated.


<R05>
Sec. 2627.3  Grant for general purposes.

    (a) Statutory authority. (1) The Act of July 7, 1958 (72 Stat. 339-
343), referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section as the act, 
grants to the State of Alaska the right to select, within 25 years from 
January 3, 1959, not to exceed 102,550,000 acres from the public lands 
in Alaska which are vacant, unappropriated and unreserved at the time of 
selection. The Act of September 14, 1960 (74 Stat. 1024), defines vacant 
unappropriated, unreserved public lands in Alaska to include the 
retained or reserved interest of the United States in lands which have 
been disposed of with a reservation to the United States of all minerals 
or any specified mineral or minerals.
    (2) The Act further provides that no selection shall be made in the 
area north and west of the line described in section 10 thereof (72 
Stat. 345) without the approval of the President or his designated 
representative.
    (b) Lands subject to selection; patents; minerals. (1) The Act as 
amended August 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 395), provides that any lease, permit, 
license, or contract issued under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (41 
Stat. 437; 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), as amended, or under the Alaska Coal 
Leasing Act of 1914 (38 Stat. 741; 30 U.S.C. 432 et seq.), as amended, 
referred to in this section as the mineral leasing acts, shall have the 
effect of withdrawing the lands subject thereto from selection by the 
State.
    (2) Under the Act, the State may select any vacant, unappropriated, 
and unreserved public lands in Alaska, whether or not they are surveyed 
and whether or not they contain mineral deposits. For the purposes of 
selection, leases, permits, licenses, and contracts issued under the 
Mineral Leasing Acts of 1914 and 1920 will be considered an 
appropriation of lands. Where the preference provisions of 
Sec. 2627.4(a) do not apply, selections by the State of lands covered by 
an application filed prior to the State selection will be rejected to 
the extent of the conflict when and if such application is allowed. 
Conflicting applications and offers for mineral leases and permits, 
except for preference right applicants, filed pursuant to the Mineral 
Leasing Act, whether filed prior to, simultaneously with, or after the 
filing of a selection under this part will be rejected when and if the 
selection is tentatively approved by the authorized officer of the 
Bureau of Land Management in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (3) Patents will be issued for all selections approved under the act 
by the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management but such 
patents will not issue unless or until the exterior boundaries of the 
selected area are officially surveyed.
    (4) (i) Where the State selects all the lands in a mineral lease, 
permit, license, or contract, issued under the Mineral Leasing Acts of 
1914 and 1920, the patent issued under the act will convey to the State 
all mineral deposits in the selected lands. Any such patent shall vest 
in the State all right, title, and interest of the United States in and 
to any such lease, permit, license, or contract that remains outstanding 
on the effective date of the patent, including the right to all rentals, 
royalties, and other payments accruing after that date under such lease, 
permit, license, or contract, and including any authority that may have 
been retained by the United States to

[[Page 179]]

modify the terms and conditions of such lease, permit, license, or 
contract. Issuance of patent will not affect the continued validity of 
any such lease, permit, license, or contract or any rights arising 
thereunder.
    (ii) Where the State selects a portion of the lands subject to a 
mineral lease, permit, license, or contract issued under the Mineral 
Leasing Acts of 1914 and 1920, the patent issued under the act shall 
reserve to the United States the mineral or minerals subject to that 
lease, permit, license, or contract, together with such further rights 
as may be necessary to the full and complete enjoyment of all rights, 
privileges, and benefits under or with respect to that lease, permit, 
license, or contracts. Upon the termination of the lease, permit, 
license, or contract, title to minerals so reserved to the United States 
shall pass to the State.
    (c) Applications for selection. (1) Applications for selection of 
lands under the act will be made by the proper selecting agent of the 
State and will be filed, in duplicate, in the proper office of the 
district in which such selected lands are situated. No special form is 
required but it must be typewritten and must contain the following 
information:
    (i) A reference to the Act of July 7, 1958 (70 Stat. 709), as 
supplemented, and a statement that the selection, together with other 
selections under the act pending or approved, does not exceed 
102,550,000 acres (400,000 acres where one of the grants for community 
purposes is involved).
    (ii) A certificate by the selecting agent showing:
    (a) That the selection is made under and pursuant to the laws of the 
State.
    (b) The acreage selected and the cumulative acreage of all prior 
selection lists pending and finally approved for clear-listing or 
patenting.
    (c) His official title and his authority to make the selection on 
behalf of the State.
    (d) That no portion of the selected land is occupied for any purpose 
by the United States and that to the best of his knowledge and belief 
the land is unoccupied, unimproved, and unappropriated by any person 
claiming the land other than the applicant, and that at the date of the 
application no part of the land claimed or occupied under the mining 
laws.
    (e) That the selected land does not extend more than 160 rods along 
the shore of any navigable water or that such restriction has been 
waived or should be waived. (Sec. 2094.2 of this chapter.)
    (f) All the facts relative to medicinal or hot springs or other 
waters upon the selected lands.
    (iii) If the selected lands are surveyed, the legal description of 
the lands in accordance with official plats of survey.
    (iv) If the selected lands are unsurveyed and are described by 
approved protraction diagrams of the rectangular system of surveys, such 
description is required.
    (v) If the selected lands are unsurveyed and are not described by 
approved protraction diagrams, a description of the lands and a map or 
maps, in duplicate, sufficient to permit ready identification of the 
location, boundaries, and area of the lands.
    (2) Selections must be accompanied by a filing fee of $10 for 5,760 
acres or fraction thereof in the selection which fee is not returnable.
    (3) All selections shall be made in reasonably compact tracts, 
taking into account the situation and potential uses of the lands 
involved. A tract will not be considered compact if it excludes other 
public lands available for selection within its exterior boundary. Each 
tract selected shall contain at least 5,760 acres unless isolated from 
other tracts open to selection.
    (4) If the selected lands are in the area north and west of the line 
described in section 10 of the Act, all selection made or confirmed by 
the act must be accompanied by a statement of the President or his 
designated representative showing that he approves the selection.
    (5) Section 2627.3(a)(1) and (c)(1)(ii) do not apply to the extent 
that an application embraces a reserved or retained interest.
    (d) Effect of approval of selections. Following the selection of 
lands by the State and the tentative approval of such selection by the 
authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management,

[[Page 180]]

the State is authorized to execute conditional leases and to make 
conditional sales of such selected lands pending survey of the exterior 
boundaries of the selected area, if necessary, and issuance of patent. 
Said officer will notify the appropriate State official in writing of 
his tentative approval of a selection after determining that there is no 
bar to passing legal title to the lands to the State other than the need 
for the survey of the lands or for the issuance of patent or both.


<R05>
Sec. 2627.4  All grants.

    (a) State preference right of selection: waivers. (1) The Act of 
July 7, 1958 (see Sec. 2627.3(a)), provide that upon the revocation of 
any order of withdrawal in Alaska, the order of revocation shall provide 
for a period of not less than 90 days before the date on which it 
otherwise becomes effective during which period the State of Alaska 
shall have a preferred right of selection under the acts of 1956 and 
1958, except as against prior existing valid rights, equitable claims 
subject to allowance and confirmation and other preferred rights of 
application conferred by law.
    (2) Where the proper selecting agent of the State files in writing 
in the proper office a waiver of the preference provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section in connection with the proposed revocation of an 
order of withdrawal, the order affecting such revocation will not 
provide for such preference.
    (b) Segregative effect of applications. Lands desired by the State 
under the regulations of this part will be segregated from all 
appropriations based upon application or settlement and location, 
including locations under the mining laws, when the state files its 
application for selection in the proper office properly describing the 
lands as provided in Sec. 2627.3(c)(1) (iii), (iv), and (v). Such 
segregation will automatically terminate unless the State publishes 
first notice as provided by paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days 
of service of such notice by the appropriate officer of the Bureau of 
Land Management.
    (c) Publications and protests. (1) The State will be required to 
publish once a week for five consecutive weeks in accordance with 
Sec. 1824.4 of this chapter, at its own expense, in a designated 
newspaper, and in a designated form, a notice allowing all persons 
claiming the land adversely to file in the appropriate office their 
objections to the issuance of patent or certification for lands selected 
under the regulations of this part. A protestant must serve on the State 
a copy of the objections and furnish evidence of service to the proper 
office.
    (2) The State must file a statement of the publisher, accompanied by 
a copy of the notice published, showing that publication has been had 
for the required time.

<R05>
Sec. 2631.0-8  Lands for which applications may be made.

    Subsection (b) of section 321, Part II, Title III, of the 
Transportation Act of 1940 provides that in the case of a railroad 
carrier, or a predecessor, which received a land grant to aid in the 
construction of any part of its railroad, the laws relating to 
compensation for certain Government transportation services shall 
continue to apply as though subsection (a) of section 321 had not been 
enacted unless the carrier shall file on or before September 18, 1941, 
with the Secretary of the Interior, in the form and manner prescribed by 
him, a release of any claim it may have to lands, interests in lands, 
compensation, or reimbursement on account of lands or interests in lands 
so granted, claimed to have been granted or claimed should have been 
granted. Section 321 provides further that nothing therein shall be 
construed as preventing the issuance of patents confirming the title to 
such uncertified or unpatented lands as the Secretary of the Interior 
shall find have been sold prior to September 18, 1940, to innocent 
purchasers for value. Subsection (b) of section 321 authorizing the 
issuance of such patents is not an enlargement of the grants, and does 
not extend them to lands not already covered thereby and, therefore, has 
no application to lands which for various reasons, such as mineral 
character, prior grants, withdrawals, reservations, or appropriation, 
were not subject to the grants. It does apply, however, to lands 
selected under remedial or lieu acts supplemental to the original grants 
as well as to primary and indemnity lands. Classification under section 
7 of the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), as amended 
by the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1976; 43 U.S.C. 315f), will not be 
required where the sold land is such as the company was authorized by 
law to select.


<R05>
Sec. 2631.1  Applications.

    Application, and supporting evidence, must be filed by the carrier 
in the proper office, accompanied by a nonrefundable application service 
charge of $10. The lands listed in any one application must be limited 
to those embraced in a single sale upon which the claim for patent is 
based. The application should state that it is filed under the railroad 
land grant act involved, properly cited, and subsection (b) of section 
321, Part II, Title III of the Transportation Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 
954). The application must be supported by a showing that the land is of 
the character which would pass under the grant involved, and was not by 
some superior or prior claim, withdrawal, reservation, or other reason, 
excluded from the operation of the grant. Full details of the alleged 
sale must be furnished, such as dates, the terms thereof, the estate 
involved, consideration, parties, amounts and dates of payments, made, 
and amounts due, if any, description of the land, and transfers of 
title. The use, occupancy, and cultivation of the land and the 
improvements placed thereon by the alleged purchaser should be 
described. All statements should be duly corroborated. Available 
documentary evidence, including the contract or deed, should be filed, 
which may be authenticated copies of the originals. An abstract of title 
may be necessary, dependent upon the circumstances of the particular 
case. No application for a patent under this act will be favorably 
considered unless it be shown that the alleged purchaser is entitled 
forthwith to the estate and interest transferred by such patent. 
Evidence of a recorded deed of conveyance from the carrier to the 
purchaser may be required. Where the company has on file an application 
in which the sold lands embraced, it need not file a new application, 
but may file a request for amendment of the pending application to come 
under the Transportation Act of 1940, together with the showing, supra, 
required as to the bona fide sale.


<R05>
Sec. 2631.2  Publication of notice.

    The authorizing officer shall direct the publication of notice of 
the application. The notice will be published at the carrier's expense 
in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the land. If a 
daily newspaper be designated, the notice should be published in the 
Wednesday issue for five consecutive weeks; if weekly, for five 
consecutive issues; and if semiweekly, in either issue for five 
consecutive weeks. The carrier must furnish evidence of

[[Page 182]]

such publication in due course. Notice need not be published, in case of 
amendment of a pending application, where publication has already been 
had.


<R05>
Sec. 2631.3  Surveying and conveyance fees.

    The carrier must pay the cost of the survey of the land, paying also 
one-half the cost of any segregation survey in accordance with the laws 
and regulations pertaining to the survey and patenting of railroad 
lands. (See 43 U.S.C. 881 et seq.; also subpart 1822 of this chapter.)


<R05>
Sec. 2631.4  Patents.

    If all be found regular and in conformity with the governing law and 
regulations, patent shall be issued in the name of the grantee under the 
railroad grant, the carrier paying the costs of preparation and issuance 
of the patent.

Sec. 2641.1  Request by Administrator for conveyance of property interest.

    Each request by the Administrator in behalf of the applicant for

Bureau of Land Management having jurisdiction of the

[[Page 183]]

lands or interests in lands in duplicate, and shall contain the 
following:

<R05>
Sec. 2641.2  Action on request.

    (a) Upon receipt of the request from the Administrator, the 
authorized officer shall determine whether the requested conveyance is

agency thereof, and shall notify the Administrator of the determination 
within 4 months after receipt of the request. On determining that the 
conveyance is not inconsistent with the needs of the Department of the

    (d) Each applicant also shall pay the cost of publication of a 
notice in the Federal Register and in a newspaper of general circulation 
in the area in which the lands are located.


<R05>
Sec. 2641.3  Publication and payment.

    (a) Prior to issuance of a conveyance document, the authorized 
officer shall publish a notice of realty action in the Federal Register 
and in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the lands to be 
conveyed. The notice shall identify the lands proposed for conveyance 
and contain the terms, covenants, conditions and reservations to be 
included in the conveyance document. The notice shall provide public 
comment period of 45 days from the date of publication in the Federal 
Register. Comments shall be sent to the Bureau of Land Management office 
issuing the notice.
    (b) The notice of realty action may segregate the lands or interests 
in lands to be conveyed to the extent that they will not be subject to 
appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. The 
segregative effect of the notice of realty action shall terminate either 
upon the issuance of a document of conveyance or 1 year after the date 
of publication, whichever occurs first.
    (c) The determination concerning the granting or denial of an 
application shall be sent by the authorized officer to the applicant and 
to any party who commented on the application.
    (d) The authorized officer shall advise the applicant whether any 
balance is due on the payments required of the applicant and of the time 
within which payment shall be made. Failure to pay the required amount

of this title and after consideration of comments received, the 
authorized officer shall make a decision upon the application. If the 
decision is to make a conveyance, the authorized officer shall send the 
conveyance document to the Attorney General of the United States for 
consideration. Upon approval by the Attorney General, the authorized 
officer shall issue the conveyance document.


<R05>
Sec. 2641.5  Reversion.

    A conveyance shall be made only on the condition that, at the option 
of the Administrator, the property interest conveyed shall revert to the 
United States in the event that the lands in question are not developed 
for airport or airway purposes or are used in a manner inconsistent with 
the terms of the conveyance. If only a part of the property interest 
conveyed is not developed for airport purposes, or is used in a manner 
inconsistent with the terms of the conveyance, only that particular part 
shall, at the option of the Administrator, revert to the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 2650.0-8  Waiver.

    The Secretary may, in his discretion, waive any nonstatutory 
requirement of these regulations. When the rights of third parties will 
not be impaired, and when rapid, certain settlement of the claims of 
Natives will be assisted, minor procedural and technical errors should 
be waived.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.1  Provisions for interim administration.

    (a)(1) Prior to any conveyance under the Act, all public lands 
withdrawn pursuant to sections 11, 14, and 16, or covered by section 19 
of the Act, shall be administered under applicable laws and regulations 
by the Secretary of the Interior, or by the Secretary of Agriculture in 
the case of national forest lands, as provided by section 22(i) of the 
Act. The authority of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Secretary 
of Agriculture to make contracts and to issue leases, permits, rights-
of-way, or easements is not impaired by the withdrawals.
    (2)(i) Prior to the Secretary's making contracts or issuing leases, 
permits, rights-of-way, or easements, the views of the concerned regions 
or villages shall be obtained and considered, except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Prior to making contracts, or issuing leases, permits, rights-
of-way, or easements on lands subject to election pursuant to section 
19(b) of the Act, the Secretary shall obtain the consent of the 
representatives of the Natives living on those lands.
    (b) As provided in section 17(d)(3) of the Act, any lands withdrawn 
pursuant to section 17(d) shall be subject to administration by the 
Secretary under applicable laws and regulations and his authority to 
make contracts, and to issue leases, permits, rights-of-way, or 
easements shall not be impaired by the withdrawal. To the extent that 
any such land is also subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section, the provisions of that subsection shall govern.
    (c) As provided in section 21(e) of the Act, so long as there are no 
substantial revenues from real property interests conveyed pursuant to 
this Act and the lands are not subject to State and local real property 
taxes, such lands shall continue to receive forest fire protection 
services from the United States at no cost. The Secretary will 
promulgate criteria, after consultation with the concerned Native 
corporations and the State of Alaska, for determining when substantial 
revenues are accruing as to lands for which forest fire protection 
services are furnished by the Department of the Interior and no 
discontinuance of such service will be ordered by the Secretary unless 
he finds, after notice and opportunity for submission of views, that 
such discontinuance is in conformity with the criteria.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.2  Application procedures for land selections.

    (a) Applications for land selections must be filed on forms approved 
by the Director, Bureau of Land Management. Applications must be filed 
in accordance with subpart 1821 of this chapter.
    (b) Each regional corporation shall submit with its initial 
application under this section a copy of the resolution authorizing the 
individual filing the application to do so.
    (c) Each village corporation under subpart 2651 of this chapter must 
submit with its initial application under this section a certificate of 
incorporation, evidence of approval of its articles of incorporation by 
the regional corporation for that region, and a copy of the 
authorization of the individual filing the application to do so.
    (d)(1) Regional and village corporations authorized by the act 
subsequently filing additional or amendatory applications need only 
refer to the serial number of the initial filing.
    (2) Any change of the officer authorized to act for any corporation

[[Page 188]]

office of the Bureau of Land Management.
    (e)(1) If the lands applied for are surveyed, the legal description 
of the lands in accordance with the official plats of survey shall be 
used.
    (2) If the lands applied for are unsurveyed, they shall be described 
by protraction diagrams.
    (3) If the lands applied for are not surveyed and are not covered by 
protraction diagrams, they must be described by metes and bounds 
commencing at a readily identifiable topographic feature, such as a 
mountain peak, mouth of a stream, etc., or a monumented point of known 
position, such as a triangulation station, and the description must be 
accompanied by a topographic map delineating the boundary of the area 
applied for.
    (4) Where 1:63,360 U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps with the protraction 
diagram plotted thereon have been published, these maps shall be used to 
portray and describe the lands applied for. Where 1:63,360 U.S.G.S. 
quadrangle maps with the protraction diagram plotted thereon have not 
been published, then the 1:250,000 U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps with the 
protraction diagrams plotted thereon shall be used.
    (5) If the written description shown on the application and the map 
portrayal accompanying the application do not agree the delineation 
shown on the map shall be controlling.
    (f) The selected areas may be adjusted by the Secretary with the 
consent of the applicant and amendment of the application by the 
applicant, provided that the adjustment will not create an excess over 
the selection entitlement.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.3  Lawful entries, lawful settlements, and mining claims.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.3-1  Lawful entries and lawful settlements.

    (a) Pursuant to sections 14(g) and 22(b) of the Act, all conveyances 
issued under the act shall exclude any lawful entries or entries which 
have been perfected under, or are being maintained in compliance with, 
laws leading to the acquisition of title, but shall include land subject 
to valid existing rights of a temporary or limited nature such as those 
created by leases (including leases issued under section 6(g) of the 
Alaska Statehood Act), contracts, permits, rights-of-way, or easements.
    (b) The right of use and occupancy of persons who initiated lawful 
settlement or entry of land, prior to August 31, 1971, is protected: 
Provided, That:
    (1) Occupancy has been or is being maintained in accordance with the 
appropriate public land law, and
    (2) Settlement or entry was not in violation of Public Land Order 
4582, as amended. Any person who entered or settled upon land in 
violation of that public land order has gained no rights.
    (c) In the event land excluded from conveyance under paragraph (a) 
of this section reverts to the United States, the grantee or his 
successor in interest shall be afforded an opportunity to acquire such 
land by exchange pursuant to section 22(f) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.3-2  Mining claims.

    (a) Possessory rights. Pursuant to section 22(c) of the Act, on any 
lands to be conveyed to village or regional corporations, any person who 
prior to August 31, 1971, initiated a valid mining claim or location, 
including millsites, under the general mining laws and recorded notice 
thereof with the appropriate State or local office, shall not be 
challenged by the United States as to his possessory rights, if all 
requirements of the general mining laws are met. However, the validity 
of any unpatented mining claim may be contested by the United States, 
the grantee of the United States or its successor in interest, or by any 
person who may initiate a private contest. Contest proceedings and 
appeals therefrom shall be to the Interior Board of Land Appeals.
    (b) Patent requirements met. An acceptable mineral patent 
application must be filed with the appropriate Bureau of Land Management 
office not later than December 18, 1976, on lands conveyed to village or 
regional corporations.
    (1) Upon a showing that a mineral survey cannot be completed by 
December 18, 1976, the filing of an application for a mineral survey, 
which states on its face that it was filed for the purpose of proceeding 
to patent, will constitute

[[Page 189]]

an acceptable mineral patent application, provided all applicable 
requirements under the general mining laws have been met.
    (2) The failure of an applicant to prosecute diligently his 
application for mineral patent to completion will result in the loss of 
benefits afforded by section 22(c) of the Act.
    (3) The appropriate office of the Bureau of Land Management shall 
give notice of the filing of an application under this section to the 
village or regional corporation which has selection rights in the land 
covered by the application.
    (c) Patent requirements not met. Any mineral patent application 
filed after December 18, 1976, on land conveyed to any village or 
regional corporation pursuant to this Act, will be rejected for lack of 
departmental jurisdiction. After that date, patent applications may 
continue to be filed on land not conveyed to village or regional 
corporations until such land is conveyed.

<R05>
Sec. 2650.4  Conveyance reservations.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.4-1  Existing rights and contracts.

    Any conveyance issued for surface and subsurface rights under this 
act will be subject to any lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or 
easement and the rights of the lessee, contractee, permittee, or grantee 
to the complete enjoyment of all rights, privileges, and benefits 
thereby granted him.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.4-2  Succession of interest.

    Upon issuance of any conveyance under this authority, the grantee 
thereunder shall succeed and become entitled to any and all interests of 
the State of Alaska or of the United States as lessor, contractor, 
permitter, or grantor, in any such lease, contract, permit, right-of-
way, or easement covering the estate conveyed, subject to the provisions 
of section 14(g) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.4-3  Administration.

    Leases, contracts, permits, rights-of-way, or easements granted 
prior to the issuance of any conveyance under this authority shall 
continue to be administered by the State of Alaska or by the United 
States after the conveyance has been issued, unless the responsible 
agency waives administration. Where the responsible agency is an agency 
of the Department of the Interior, administration shall be waived when 
the conveyance covers all the land embraced within a lease, contract, 
permit, right-of-way, or easement, unless there is a finding by the 
Secretary that the interest of the United States requires continuation 
of the administration by the United States. In the latter event, the 
Secretary shall not renegotiate or modify any lease, contract, right-of-
way or easement, or waive any right or benefit belonging to the grantee 
until he has notified the grantee and allowed him an opportunity to 
present his views.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.4-4  Revenues. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 2650.4-5  National forest lands.

    Every conveyance which includes lands within the boundaries of a 
national forest shall, as to such lands, contain reservations that:
    (a) Until December 18, 1976, the sale of any timber from the land is 
subject to the same restrictions relating to the export of timber from 
the United States as are applicable to national forest lands in Alaska 
under rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture; and,
    (b) Until December 18, 1983, the land shall be managed under the 
principles of sustained yield and under management practices for 
protection and enhancement of environmental quality no less stringent 
than such management practices on adjacent national forest lands.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.4-6  National wildlife refuge system lands.

    (a) Every conveyance which includes lands within the national 
wildlife refuge system shall, as to such lands, provide that the United 
States has the right of first refusal so long as such lands remain 
within the system. The right of first refusal shall be for a period of 
120 days from the date of notice to the United States that the owner of

[[Page 190]]

the land has received a bona fide offer of purchase. The United States 
shall exercise such right of first refusal by written notice to the 
village corporation within such 120-day period. The United States shall 
not be deemed to have exercised its right of first refusal if the 
village corporation does not consummate the sale in accordance with the 
notice to the United States.
    (b) Every conveyance which covers lands lying within the boundaries 
of a national wildlife refuge in existence on December 18, 1971, shall 
provide that the lands shall remain subject to the laws and regulations 
governing use and development of such refuge so long as such lands 
remain in the refuge. Regulations governing use and development of 
refuge lands conveyed pursuant to section 14 shall permit such uses that 
will not materially impair the values for which the refuge was 
established.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.4-7  Public easements.

    (a) General requirements. (1) Only public easements which are 
reasonably necessary to guarantee access to publicly owned lands or 
major waterways and the other public uses which are contained in these 
regulations, or to guarantee international treaty obligations shall be 
reserved.
    (2) In identifying appropriate public easements assessment shall be 
made in writing of the use and purpose to be accommodated.
    (3) The primary standard for determining which public easements are 
reasonably necessary for access shall be present existing use. However, 
a public easement may be reserved absent a demonstration of present 
existing use only if it is necessary to guarantee international treaty 
obligations, if there is no reasonable alternative route or site 
available, or if the public easement is for access to an isolated tract 
or area of publicly owned land. When adverse impacts on Native culture, 
lifestyle, and subsistence needs are likely to occur because of the 
reservation of a public easement, alternative routes shall be assessed 
and reserved where reasonably available. The natural environment and 
other relevant factors shall also be considered.
    (4) All public easements which are reserved shall be specific as to 
use, location, and size. Standard sizes and uses which are delineated in 
this subsection may be varied only when justified by special 
circumstances.
    (5) Transportation, communication, and utility easements shall be 
combined where the combination of such easements is reasonable 
considering the primary purposes for which easement is to be reserved.
    (6) Public easements may be reserved to provide access to present 
existing Federal, State, or municipal corporation sites; these sites 
themselves shall not be reserved as public easements. Unless otherwise 
justified, access to these sites shall be limited to government use.
    (7) Scenic easements or easements for recreation on lands conveyed 
pursuant to the Act shall not be reserved. Nor shall public easements be 
reserved to hunt or fish from or on lands conveyed pursuant to the Act.
    (8) The identification of needed easements and major waterways shall 
include participation by appropriate Natives and Native corporations, 
LUPC, State, Federal agencies, and other members of the public.
    (9) After reviewing the identified easements needs, the Director 
shall tentatively determine which easements shall be reserved. Tentative 
determinations of major waterways shall also be made by the Director and 
shall apply to rivers, streams, and lakes. All lakes over 640 acres in 
size shall be screened to determine if they qualify as major waterways. 
Those smaller than 640 acres may be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
The Director shall issue a notice of proposed easements which notifies 
all parties that participated in the development of the easement needs 
and information on major waterways as to the tentative easement 
reservations and which directs that all comments be sent to the LUPC and 
the Director.
    (10) The State and the LUPC shall be afforded 90 days after notice 
by the Director to make recommendations with respect to the inclusion of 
public easements in any conveyance. If the Director does not receive a 
recommendation from the LUPC or the State within the time period herein 
called for, he may proceed with his determinations.

[[Page 191]]

    (11) Prior to making a determination of public easements to be 
reserved, the Director shall review the recommendations of the LUPC, 
appropriate Native corporation(s), other Federal agencies, the State, 
and the public. Consideration shall be given to recommendations for 
public easement reservations which are timely submitted to the Bureau of 
Land Management and accompanied by written justification.
    (12) The Director, after such review, shall prepare a decision to 
convey that includes all necessary easements and other appropriate terms 
and conditions relating to conveyance of the land. If the decision 
prepared by the Director is contrary to the LUPC's recommendations, he 
shall notify the LUPC of the variance(s) and shall afford the LUPC 10 
days in which to document the reasons for its disagreement before making 
his final decision. The Director shall then issue a Decision to Issue 
Conveyance (DIC).
    (13) The Director shall terminate a public easement if it is not 
used for the purpose for which it was reserved by the date specified in 
the conveyance, if any, or by December 18, 2001, whichever occurs first, 
He may terminate an easement at any time if he finds that conditions are 
such that its retention is no longer needed for public use or 
governmental function. However, the Director shall not terminate an 
access easement to isolated tracts of publicly owned land solely because 
of the absence of proof of public use. Public easements which have been 
reserved to guarantee international treaty obligations shall not be 
terminated unless the Secretary determines that the reasons for such 
easements no longer justify the reservation. No public easement shall be 
terminated without proper notice and an opportunity for submission of 
written comments or for a hearing if a hearing is deemed to be necessary 
by either the Director or the Secretary.
    (b) Transportation easements. (1) Public easements for 
transportation purposes which are reasonably necessary to guarantee the 
public's ability to reach publicly owned lands or major waterways may be 
reserved across lands conveyed to Native corporations. Such purposes may 
also include transportation to and from communities, airports, docks, 
marine coastline, groups of private holdings sufficient in number to 
constitute a public use, and government reservations or installations. 
Public easements may also be reserved for railroads. If public easements 
are to be reserved, they shall:
    (i) Be reserved across Native lands only if there is no reasonable 
alternative route of transportation across publicly owned lands;
    (ii) Within the standard of reasonable necessity, be limited in 
number and not duplicative of one another (nonduplication does not 
preclude separate easements for winter and summer trails, if otherwise 
justified);
    (iii) Be subject only to specific uses and sizes which shall be 
placed in the appropriate interim conveyance and patent documents;
    (iv) Follow existing routes of travel unless a variance is otherwise 
justified;
    (v) Be reserved for future roads, including railroads and roads for 
future logging operations, only if they are site specific and actually 
planned for construction within 5 years of the date of conveyance;
    (vi) Be reserved in topographically suitable locations whenever the 
location is not otherwise determined by an existing route of travel or 
when there is no existing site;
    (vii) Be reserved along the marine coastline only to preserve a 
primary route of travel between coastal communities, publicly owned 
uplands, or coastal communities and publicly owned uplands;
    (viii) Be reserved from publicly owned uplands to the marine 
coastline only if significant present existing use has occurred on those 
publicly owned lands below the line of mean high tide. However, for 
isolated tracts of publicly owned uplands, public easements may be 
reserved to provide transportation from the marine coastline if there is 
no other reasonable transportation route;
    (ix) Be reserved along major waterways only to provide short 
portages or transportation routes around obstructions. However, this 
condition does not preclude the reservation of a trail or road easement 
which happens to run alongside a waterway;
    (x) Not be reserved on the beds of major waterways except where use 
of

[[Page 192]]

the bed is related to road or trail purposes, portaging, or changing the 
mode of travel between water and land (e.g., launching or landing a 
boat); a specific portion of the bed or shore of the waterway which is 
necessary to provide portage or transportation routes around 
obstructions, including those that are dangerous or impassible or 
seasonably dangerous or impassible, may be reserved.
    (xi) Not be reserved on the beds of nonmajor waterways except where 
use of the beds is related to road or trail purposes. However, this 
exception shall not be used to reserve a continuous linear easement on 
the streambed to facilitate access by boat.
    (xii) Not be reserved simply to reflect patterns of Native use on 
Native lands;
    (xiii) Not be reserved for the purpose of protecting Native 
stockholders from their respective corporations;
    (xiv) Not be reserved on the basis of subsistence use of the lands 
of one village by residents of another village.
    (2) Transportation easements shall be limited to roads and sites 
which are related to access. The use of these easements shall be 
controlled by applicable Federal, State, or municipal corporation laws 
or regulations. The uses stated herein will be specified in the interim 
conveyance and patent documents as permitted uses of the easement.
    (i) The width of a trail easement shall be no more than 25 feet if 
the uses to be accommodated are for travel by foot, dogsleds, animals, 
snowmobiles, two and three-wheel vehicles, and small all-terrain 
vehicles (less than 3,000 lbs. G.V.W.);
    (ii) The width of a trail easement shall be no more than 50 feet if 
the uses to be accommodated are for travel by large all-terrain vehicles 
(more than 3,000 lbs. G.V.W.), track vehicles and 4-wheel drive 
vehicles, in addition to the uses included under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section;
    (iii) The width of an existing road easement shall be no more than 
60 feet if the uses to be accommodated are for travel by automobiles or 
trucks in addition to the uses included under paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and 
(ii) of this section. However, if an existing road is wider than 60 
feet, the specific public easement may encompass that wider width. For 
proposed roads, including U.S. Forest Service logging roads, the width 
of the public easement shall be 100 feet, unless otherwise justified. 
Prior to construction, trail uses which are included under paragraphs 
(b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section may be permitted if otherwise 
justified and may continue if the road is not built. If after the road 
has been constructed a lesser width is sufficient to accommodate the 
road, the Director shall reduce the size of the easement to that width.
    (iv) The width of a proposed railroad easement shall be 100 feet on 
either side of the center line of any such railroad.
    (3) Site easements. Site easements which are related to 
transportation may be reserved for aircraft landing or vehicle parking 
(e.g., aircraft, boats, ATV's, cars, trucks), temporary camping, loading 
or unloading at a trail head, along an access route or waterway, or 
within a reasonable distance of a transportation route or waterway where 
there is a demonstrated need to provide for transportation to publicly 
owned lands or major waterways. Temporary camping, loading, or unloading 
shall be limited to 24 hours. Site easements shall not be reserved for 
recreational use such as fishing, unlimited camping, or other purposes 
not associated with use of the public easement for transportation. Site 
easements shall not be reserved for future logging or similar operations 
(e.g., log dumps, campsites, storage or staging areas). Before site 
easements are reserved on transportation routes or on major waterways, a 
reasonable effort shall be made to locate parking, camping, beaching, or 
aircraft landing sites on publicly owned lands; particularly, publicly 
owned lands in or around communities, or bordering the waterways. If a 
site easement is to be reserved, it shall:
    (i) Be subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) (ii), (iii), 
(vi), (xii), (xiii), and (xiv) of this section.
    (ii) Be no larger than one acre in size and located on existing 
sites unless a variance is in either instance, otherwise justified;
    (iii) Be reserved on the marine coastline only at periodic points 
along the

[[Page 193]]

coast where they are determined to be reasonably necessary to facilitate 
transportation on coastal waters or transportation between coastal 
waters and publicly owned uplands;
    (iv) Be reserved only at periodic points on major waterways. Uses 
shall be limited to those activities which are related to travel on the 
waterway or to travel between the waterway and publicly owned lands. 
Also, periodic site easements shall be those necessary to allow a 
reasonable pattern of travel on the waterway;
    (v) Be reserved for aircraft landing strips only if they have 
present significant use and are a necessary part of a transportation 
system for access to publicly owned lands and are not suitable for 
reservation under section 14(c)(4) of the Act. Any such easement shall 
encompass only that area which is used for takeoffs and landings and any 
clear space around such site that is needed for parking or public 
safety.
    (c) Miscellaneous easements. The public easements referred to in 
this subsection which do not fall into the categories above may be 
reserved in order to continue certain uses of publicly owned lands and 
major waterways. These public easements shall be limited in number. The 
identification and size of these public easements may vary from place to 
place depending upon particular circumstances. When not controlled by 
applicable law or regulation, size shall not exceed that which is 
reasonably necessary for the purposes of the identified easement. 
Miscellaneous easements may be reserved for the following purposes:
    (1) Public easements which are for utility purposes (e.g., water, 
electricity, communications, oil, gas, and sewage) may be reserved and 
shall be based upon present existing use. Future easements for these 
purposes may also be reserved, but only if they are site specific and 
actually planned for construction within 5 years of the date of 
conveyance;
    (2) Easements for air light or visibility purposes may be reserved 
if required to insure public safety or to permit proper use of 
improvements developed for public benefit or use; e.g., protection for 
aviation or navigation aids or communications sites;
    (3) Public easements may be reserved to guarantee international 
treaty obligations or to implement any agreement entered into between 
the United States and the Native Corporation receiving the conveyance. 
For example, the agreement of May 14, 1974, related to Naval Petroleum 
Reserve Number Four (redesignated June 1, 1977, as the National 
Petroleum Reserve-Alaska) between the United States Department of the 
Navy and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and four Native village 
corporations, shall be incorporated in the appropriate conveyances and 
the easements necessary to implement the agreement shall be reserved.
    (d) Conveyance provisions. (1) Public easement provisions shall be 
placed in interim conveyances and patents.
    (2) Permissible uses of a specific easement shall be listed in the 
appropriate conveyance document. The conveyance documents shall include 
a general provision which states that uses which are not specifically 
listed are prohibited.
    (3) The easements shall be identified on appropriate maps which 
shall be part of the pertinent interim conveyance and patent.
    (4) All public easement shall be reserved to the United States and 
subject, as appropriate, to further Federal, State, or municipal 
corporation regulation.
    (5) All conveyance documents shall contain a general provision which 
states that pursuant to section 17(b)(2) of the Act, any valid existing 
right recognized by the Act shall continue to have whatever right of 
access as is now provided for under existing law.

Sec. 2650.5  Survey requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.5-1  General.

    (a) Selected areas are to be surveyed as provided in section 13 of 
the Act. Any survey or description used as a basis for conveyance must 
be adequate to identify the lands to be conveyed.
    (b) The following procedures shall be used to determine what acreage 
is not to be charged against Native entitlement:
    (1) For any approved plat of survey where meanderable water bodies 
were not segregated from the survey but

[[Page 194]]

were included in the calculation of acreage to be charged against the 
Native corporation's land entitlement, the chargeable acreage shall, at 
no cost to the Native corporation, be recalculated to conform to the 
principles contained in the Bureau of Land Management's Manual of 
Surveying Instructions, 1973, except as modified by this part. Pursuant 
to such principles, the acreage of meanderable water bodies, as modified 
by this part, shall not be included in the acreage charged against the 
Native corporation's land entitlement.
    (2) For any plat of survey approved after December 5, 1983, water 
bodies shall be meandered and segregated from the survey in accordance 
with the principles contained in the Bureau of Land Management's Manual 
of Surveying Instructions, 1973, as modified by this part, as the basis 
for determining acreage chargeability.
    (3) If title to lands beneath navigable waters, as defined in the 
Submerged Lands Act, of a lake less than 50 acres in size or a river or 
stream less than 3 chains in width did not vest in the State on the date 
of Statehood, such lake, river or stream shall not be meandered and 
shall be charged against the Native corporation's entitlement.
    (4) Any determinations of meanders which may be made pursuant to 
this paragraph shall not require monumentation on the ground unless 
specifically required by law or for good cause in the public interest.

[38 FR 14218, May 30, 1973, as amended at 50 FR 15547, Apr. 19, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 2650.5-2  Rule of approximation.

    To assure full entitlement, the rule of approximation may be applied 
with respect to the acreage limitations applicable to conveyances and 
surveys under this authority, i.e., any excess must be less than the 
deficiency would be if the smallest legal subdivision were eliminated 
(see 62 I.D. 417, 421).


<R05>
Sec. 2650.5-3  Regional surveys.

    Lands to be conveyed to a regional corporation, when selected in 
contiguous units, shall be grouped together for the purpose of survey 
and surveyed as one tract, with monuments being established on the 
exterior boundary at angle points and at intervals of approximately 2 
miles on straight lines. If requested by the grantee, the Secretary may 
survey, insofar as practicable, the individual selections that comprise 
the total tract.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.5-4  Village surveys.

    (a) Only the exterior boundaries of contiguous entitlements for each 
village corporation will be surveyed. Where land within the outer 
perimeter of a selection is not selected, the boundaries along the area 
excluded shall be deemed exterior boundaries. The survey will be made 
after the total acreage entitlement of the village has been selected.
    (b) Surveys will be made within the village corporation selections 
to delineate those tracts required by law to be conveyed by the village 
corporations pursuant to section 14(c) of the Act.
    (c) (1) The boundaries of the tracts described in paragraph (b) of 
this section shall be posted on the ground and shown on a map which has 
been approved in writing by the affected village corporation and 
submitted to the Bureau of Land Management. Conflicts arising among 
potential transferees identified in section 14(c) of the Act, or between 
the village corporation and such transferees, will be resolved prior to 
submission of the map. Occupied lots to be surveyed will be those which 
were occupied as of December 18, 1971.
    (2) Lands shown by the records of the Bureau of Land Management as 
not having been conveyed to the village corporation will be excluded by 
adjustments on the map by the Bureau of Land Management. No surveys 
shall begin prior to final written approval of the map by the village 
corporation and the Bureau of Land Management. After such written 
approval, the map will constitute a plan of survey. Surveys will then be 
made in accordance with the plan of survey. No further changes will be 
made to accommodate additional section 14(c) transferees, and no 
additional survey work desired by the village corporation or 
municipality within the area covered by the plan of survey or 
immediately adjacent thereto will be performed by the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 2650.5-5  Cemetery sites and historical places.

    Only those cemetery sites and historical places to be conveyed under 
section 14(h)(1) of the Act shall be surveyed.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.5-6  Adjustment to plat of survey.

    All conveyances issued for lands not covered by officially approved 
surveys of the Bureau of Land Management shall note that upon the filing 
of an official plat of survey, the boundary of the selected area, 
described in terms of protraction diagrams or by metes and bounds, shall 
be redescribed in accordance with the plats of survey. However, no 
change will be made in the land selected.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.6  Selection limitations.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the act, no village or 
regional corporation may select lands which are within 2 miles from the 
boundary of any home rule or first-class city (excluding boroughs) as 
the boundaries existed and the cities were classified on December 18, 
1971, or which are within 6 miles from the boundary of Ketchikan, except 
that a village corporation organized by Natives of a community which is 
itself a first class or home-rule city is not prohibited from making 
selections within 2 miles from the boundary of that first class or home-
rule city, unless such selections fall within 2 miles from the boundary 
of another first class or home-rule city which is not itself a Native 
village or within 6 miles from the boundary of Ketchikan.
    (b) Determination as to which cities were classified as home rule or 
first class as of December 18, 1971, and their boundaries as of that 
date will be made in accordance with the laws of the State of Alaska.
    (c) If any village corporation whose land withdrawals encompass 
Dutch Harbor is found eligible under this act, it may select lands 
pursuant to subpart 2651 of this chapter and receive a conveyance under 
the terms of section 14(a) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2650.7  Publication.

    In order to determine whether there are any adverse claimants to the 
land, the applicant should publish notice of his application. If the 
applicant decides to avail himself of the privilege of publishing a 
notice to all adverse claimants and requests it, the authorized officer 
will prepare a notice for publication. The publication will be in 
accordance with the following procedure:
    (a) The applicant will have the notice published allowing all 
persons claiming the land adversely to file in the appropriate land 
office their objections to the issuance of any conveyance. The notice 
shall be published once a week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of 
general circulation.
    (b) The applicant shall file a statement of the publisher, 
accompanied by a copy of the published notice, showing that publication 
has been had for 4 consecutive weeks. The applicant must pay the cost of 
publication.
    (c) Any adverse claimant must serve on the applicant a copy of his 
objections and furnish evidence of service thereof to the appropriate 
land office.
    (d) For all land selections made under the Act, in order to give 
actual notice of the decision of the Bureau of Land Management proposing 
to convey lands, the decision shall be served on all known parties of 
record who claim to have a property interest or other valid existing 
right in land affected by such decision, the appropriate regional 
corporation, and any Federal agency of record. In order to give 
constructive notice of the decision to any unknown parties, or to known 
parties who cannot be located after reasonable efforts have been 
expended to locate, who claim a property interest or other valid 
existing right in land affected by the decision, notice of the decision 
shall be published once in the Federal Register and, once a week, for 
four (4) consecutive weeks, in one or more newspapers of general 
circulation in the State of Alaska nearest the locality where the land 
affected by the decision is situated, if possible. Any decision or 
notice actually served on parties or constructively served on parties in 
accord with this subsection shall state that any party claiming a 
property interest in land affected by the decision

[[Page 196]]

may appeal the decision to the Board of Land Appeals. The decision or 
notice of decision shall also state that:
    (1) Any party receiving actual notice of the decision shall have 30 
days from the receipt of actual notice to file an appeal; and,
    (2) That any unknown parties, any parties unable to be located after 
reasonable efforts have been expended to locate, and any parties who 
failed or refused to sign a receipt for actual notice, shall have 30 
days from the date of publication in the Federal Register to file an 
appeal. Furthermore, the decision or notice of decision shall inform 
readers where further information on the manner of, and requirements 
for, filing appeal may be obtained, and shall also state that any party 
known or unknown who may claim a property interest which is adversely 
affected by the decision shall be deemed to have waived their rights 
which were adversely affected unless an appeal is filed in accordance 
with the requirements stated in the decisions or notices provided for in 
this subsection and the regulation governing such appeals set out in 43 
CFR part 4, subpart E.

by eligible village corporations.


<R05>
Sec. 2651.1  Entitlement.

    (a) Village corporations eligible for land benefits under the Act 
shall be entitled to a conveyance to the surface estate in accordance 
with sections 14(a) and 16(b) of the Act.
    (b) In addition to the land benefits in paragraph (a) of this

of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2651.2  Eligibility requirements.

    (a) Pursuant to sections 11(b) and 16(a) of the Act, the Director, 
Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall review and make a 
determination, not later than December 19, 1973, as to which villages 
are eligible for benefits under the act.
    (1) Review of listed native villages. The Director, Juneau Area 
Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall make a determination of the 
eligibility of villages listed in section 11(b)(1) and 16(a) of the Act. 
He shall investigate and examine available records and evidence that may 
have a bearing on the character of the village and its eligibility 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Findings of fact and notice of proposed decision. After 
completion of the investigation and examination of records and evidence 
with respect to the eligibility of a village listed in sections 11(b)(1) 
and 16(a) of the Act for land benefits, the Director, Juneau Area 
Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall publish in the Federal Register 
and in one or more newspapers of general circulation in Alaska his 
proposed decision with respect to such eligibility and shall mail a copy 
of the proposed decision to the affected village, all villages located 
in the region in which the affected village is located, all regional 
corporations within the State of Alaska and the State of Alaska. His 
proposed decision is subject to protest by any interested party within 
30 days of the publication of the proposed decision in the Federal 
Register. If no valid protest is received within the 30-day period, such 
proposed decision shall become final and shall be published in the 
Federal Register. If the final decision is in favor of a listed village, 
the Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall issue 
a certificate as to the eligibility of the village in question for land 
benefits under the act, and certify the

[[Page 197]]

record and the decision to the Secretary. Copies of the final decisions 
and certificates of village eligibility shall be mailed to the affected 
village, all villages located in the region in which the affected 
village is located, all regional corporations within the State of 
Alaska, and the state of Alaska.
    (3) Protest. Within 30 days from the date of publication of the 
proposed decision in the Federal Register, any interested party may 
protest a proposed decision as to the eligibility of a village. No 
protest shall be considered which is not accompanied by supporting 
evidence. The protest shall be mailed to the Director, Juneau Area 
Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    (4) Action on protest. Upon receipt of a protest, the Director, 
Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall examine and evaluate 
the protest and supporting evidence required herein, together with his 
record of findings of fact and proposed decision, and shall render a 
decision on the eligibility of the Native village that is the subject of 
the protest. Such decision shall be rendered within 30 days from the 
receipt of the protest and supporting evidence by the Director, Juneau 
Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs. The decision of the Director, 
Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall be published in the 
Federal Register and in one or more newspapers of general circulation in 
the State of Alaska and a copy of the decision and findings of fact upon 
which the decision is based shall be mailed to the affected village, all 
villages located in the region in which the affected village is located, 
all regional corporations within the State of Alaska, the State of 
Alaska, and any other party of record. Such decision shall become final 
unless appealed to the Secretary by a notice filed within 30 days of its 
publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the regulations 
governing appeals set out in 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.
    (5) Action on appeals. Appeals shall be made to the Board of Land 
Appeals in accordance with subpart E of part 4 of this title. Decisions 
of the Board on village eligibility appeals are not final until 
personally approved by the Secretary.
    (6) Applications by unlisted villages for determination of 
eligibility. The head or any authorized subordinate officer of a Native 
village not listed in section 11(b) of the Act may file on behalf of the 
unlisted village an application for a determination of its eligibility 
for land benefits under the act. Such application shall be filed in 
duplicate with the Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, prior to September 1, 1973. If the application does not 
constitute prima facie evidence of compliance with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section, he shall return the application to the 
party filing the same with a statement of reasons for return of the 
application, but such filing, even if returned, shall constitute timely 
filing of the application. The Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, shall immediately forward an application which appears 
to meet the criteria for eligibility to the appropriate office of the 
Bureau of Land Management for filing. Each application must identify the 
township or townships in which the Native village is located.
    (7) Segregation of land. The receipt of the selection application 
for filing by the Bureau of Land Management shall operate to segregate 
the lands in the vicinity of the village as provided in sections 
11(a)(1) and (2) of the Act.
    (8) Action on application for eligibility. Upon receipt of an 
application which appears to meet the criteria for eligibility, the 
Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall have a 
notice of the filing of the application published in the Federal 
Register and in one or more newspapers of general circulation in Alaska 
and shall promptly review the statements contained in the application. 
He shall investigate and examine available records and evidence that may 
have a bearing on the character of the village and its eligibility 
pursuant to this subpart 2651, and thereafter make findings of fact as 
to the character of the village. No later than December 19, 1973, the 
Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall make a 
determination as to the eligibility of the village as a Native village 
for land benefits under the act and shall issue a decision. He shall 
publish his decision in

[[Page 198]]

the Federal Register and in one or more newspapers of general 
circulation in Alaska and shall mail a copy of the decision to the 
representative or representatives of the village, all villages in the 
region in which the village is located, all regional corporations, and 
the State of Alaska.
    (9) Protest to eligibility determination. Any interested party may 
protest a decision of the Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, regarding the eligibility of a Native village for land benefits 
under the provisions of sections 11(b)(3)(A) and (B) of the Act by 
filing a notice of protest with the Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, within 30 days from the date of publication of the 
decision in the Federal Register. A copy of the protest must be mailed 
to the representative or representatives of the village, all villages in 
the region in which the village is located, all regional corporations 
within Alaska, the State of Alaska, and any other parties of record. If 
no protest is received within the 30-day period, the decision shall 
become final and the Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, shall certify the record and the decision to the Secretary. No 
protest shall be considered which is not accompanied by supporting 
evidence. Anyone protesting a decision concerning the eligibility or 
ineligibility of an unlisted Native village shall have the burden of 
proof in establishing that the decision is incorrect. Anyone appealing a 
decision concerning the eligibility or ineligibility of an unlisted 
Native village shall have the burden of proof in establishing that the 
decision is incorrect.
    (10) Action on protest appeal. Upon receipt of a protest, the 
Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, shall follow the 
procedure outlined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If an appeal is 
taken from a decision on eligibility, the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) 
of this section shall apply.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, villages 
must meet each of the following criteria to be eligible for benefits 
under sections 14(a) and (b) of the Act:
    (1) There must be 25 or more Native residents of the village on 
April 1, 1970, as shown by the census or other evidence satisfactory to 
the Secretary. A Native properly enrolled to the village shall be deemed 
a resident of the village.
    (2) The village shall have had on April 1, 1970, an identifiable 
physical location evidenced by occupancy consistent with the Natives' 
own cultural patterns and life style and at least 13 persons who 
enrolled thereto must have used the village during 1970 as a place where 
they actually lived for a period of time: Provided, That no village 
which is known as a traditional village shall be disqualified if it 
meets the other criteria specified in this subsection by reason of 
having been temporarily unoccupied in 1970 because of an act of God or 
government authority occurring within the preceding 10 years.
    (3) The village must not be modern and urban in character. A village 
will be considered to be of modern and urban character if the Secretary 
determines that it possessed all the following attributes as of April 1, 
1970:
    (i) Population over 600.
    (ii) A centralized water system and sewage system that serves a 
majority of the residents.
    (iii) Five or more business establishments which provide goods or 
services such as transient accommodations or eating establishments, 
specialty retail stores, plumbing and electrical services, etc.
    (iv) Organized police and fire protection.
    (v) Resident medical and dental services, other than those provided 
by Indian Health Service.
    (vi) Improved streets and sidewalks maintained on a year-round 
basis.
    (4) In the case of unlisted villages, a majority of the residents 
must be Native, but in the case of villages listed in sections 11 and 16 
of the Act, a majority of the residents must be Native only if the 
determination is made that the village is modern and urban pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 2651.3  Selection period.

    Each eligible village corporation must file its selection 
application(s) not later than December 18, 1974, under sections 12(a) or 
16(b) of the Act; and not later than December 18, 1975, under section 
12(b) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2651.4  Selection limitations.

    (a) Each eligible village corporation may select the maximum surface 
acreage entitlement under sections 12(a) and (b) and section 16(b) of 
the Act. Village corporations selecting lands under sections 12(a) and 
(b) may not select more than:
    (1) 69,120 acres from land that, prior to January 17, 1969, has been 
selected by, or tentatively approved to, but not yet patented to the 
State under the Alaska Statehood Act; and
    (2) 69,120 acres of land from the National Wildlife Refuge System; 
and
    (3) 69,120 acres of land from the National Forest System.
    (b) To the extent necessary to obtain its entitlement, each eligible 
village corporation shall select all available lands within the township 
or townships within which all or part of the village is located, and 
shall complete its selection from among all other available lands. 
Selections shall be contiguous and, taking into account the situation 
and potential uses of the lands involved, the total area selected shall 
be reasonably compact, except where separated by lands which are 
unavailable for selection. The total area selected will not be 
considered to be reasonably compact if (1) it excludes other lands 
available for selection within its exterior boundaries; or (2) lands 
which are similar in character to the village site or lands ordinarily 
used by the village inhabitants are disregarded in the selection 
process; or (3) an isolated tract of public land of less than 1,280 
acres remains after selection.
    (c) The lands selected under sections 12(a) or (b) shall be in whole 
sections where they are available, or shall include all available lands 
in less than whole sections, and, wherever feasible, shall be in units 
of not less than 1,280 acres. Lands selected under section 16(b) of the 
Act shall conform to paragraph (b) of this section and shall conform as 
nearly as practicable to the U.S. land survey system.
    (d) Village corporation selections within sections 11 (a)(1) and 
(a)(3) areas shall be given priority over regional corporation 
selections for the same lands.
    (e) Village or regional corporations are not required to select 
lands within an unpatented mining claim or millsite. Unpatented mining 
claims and millsites shall be deemed to be selected, unless they are 
excluded from the selection by metes and bounds or other suitable 
description and there is attached to the selection application a copy of 
the notice of location and any amendments thereto. If the village or 
regional corporation selection omits lands within an unpatented mining 
claim or millsite, this will not be construed as violating the 
requirements for compactness and contiguity. If, during the selection 
period, the excepted mining claims or millsites are declared invalid, or 
under the State of Alaska mining laws are determined to be abandoned, 
the selection will no longer be considered as compact and contiguous. 
The corporation shall be required to amend its selection, upon notice 
from the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management, to include 
the lands formerly included in the mining claim or millsite. If the 
corporation fails to amend its selection to include such lands, the 
selection may be rejected.
    (f) Eligible village corporations may file applications in excess of 
their total entitlement. To insure that a village acquires its selection 
in the order of its priorities, it should identify its choices 
numerically in the order it wishes them granted. Such selections must be 
filed not later than December 18, 1974, as to sections 12(a) or 16(b) 
selections and December 18, 1975, as to section 12(b) selections.
    (g) Whenever the Secretary determines that a dispute exists between 
villages over land selection rights, he shall accept, but not act on, 
selection applications from any party to the dispute until the dispute 
has been resolved in accordance with section 12(e) of the Act.
    (h) Village or regional corporations may, but are not required to, 
select

[[Page 200]]

lands within pending Native allotments. If the village or regional 
corporation selection omits lands within a pending Native allotment, 
this will not be construed as violating the requirements for compactness 
and contiguity. If, during the selection period, the pending Native 
allotment is finally rejected and closed, the village or regional 
corporation may amend its selection application to include all of the 
land formerly in the Native allotment application, but is not required 
to do so to meet the requirements for compactness and contiguity.

Sec. 2651.5  Conveyance reservations.

    In addition to the conveyance reservations in Sec. 2650.4 of this 
chapter, conveyances issued to village corporations shall provide for 
the transfer of the surface estates specified in section 14(c) of the 
Act, and shall be subject to valid existing rights under section 14(g) 
of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2651.6  Airport and air navigation facilities.

    (a) Every airport and air navigation facility owned and operated by 
the United States which the Secretary determines is actually used in 
connection with the administration of a Federal program will be deemed a 
Federal installation under the provisions of section 3(e) of the Act, 
and the Secretary will determine the smallest practicable tract which 
shall enclose such Federal installations. Such Federal installations are 
not public lands as defined in the act and are therefore not lands 
available for selection under the provisions of these regulations.
    (b) The surface of all other lands of existing airport sites, airway 
beacons, or other navigation aids, together with such additional acreage 
or easements as are necessary to provide related services and to insure 
safe approaches to airport runways, shall be conveyed by the village 
corporation to the State of Alaska, and the Secretary will include in 
the conveyance to any village corporation any and all covenants which he 
deems necessary to insure the fulfillment of this obligation.

later than December 18, 1975, for lands other than those allocated under 
section 14(h)(8) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2652.3  Selection limitations.

    (a) To the extent necessary to obtain its entitlement, each regional 
corporation must select all available lands withdrawn pursuant to 
sections 11(a)(1)(B) and (C) of the Act, before selecting lands 
withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(3) of the Act, except that regional 
corporations selecting lands withdrawn pursuant to sections 11(a)(1) (B) 
and (C) may select only even-numbered townships in even-numbered ranges 
and only odd-numbered townships in odd-numbered ranges.

[[Page 201]]

    (b) Village corporation selections within section 11(a)(1) and 
section 11(a)(3) areas shall be given priority over regional corporation 
selections for the same lands.
    (c) Whenever a regional selection is made in any township, the 
regional corporation shall select all available lands in that township: 
Provided, That such selection would not exceed the entitlement of that 
regional corporation.
    (d) Subsurface selections made by a regional corporation pursuant to 
section 12(a) of the Act shall be contiguous and the total area selected 
shall be reasonably compact, except as separated by subsurface interests 
that are not the property of the United States including subsurface 
interests under bodies of water, and the selection shall be in whole 
sections where they are available, or shall include all available 
subsurface interests in less than whole sections and, wherever feasible, 
shall be in units of not less than 1,280 acres. The total area selected 
shall not be considered to be reasonably compact if (1) it excludes 
other subsurface interests available for selection within its exterior 
boundaries; or (2) an isolated tract of subsurface interests owned by 
the United States of less than 1,280 acres remains after selection.
    (e) Regional corporations are not required to select lands within 
unpatented mining claims or millsites, as provided in Sec. 2651.4(e) of 
this chapter.
    (f) Regional corporations may file applications in excess of their 
total entitlement. To insure that a regional corporation acquires its 
selections in the order of its priorities, it should identify its 
choices numerically in the order it wishes them granted.


<R05>
Sec. 2652.4  Conveyance reservations.

    In addition to the conveyance reservations in Sec. 2650.4 of this 
chapter, conveyances issued to regional corporations for the subsurface 
estate of lands whose surface has been conveyed to village corporations

from the subsurface estate in the lands within the boundaries of any 
Native village shall be subject to the consent of the village

<R05>
Sec. 2653.1  Conveyance limitations.

    (a) Under section 14(h) of the Act, a total of 2 million acres may 
be selected for cemetery sites and historical places, Native groups, 
corporations formed by the Native residents of Sitka, Kenai, Juneau, and 
Kodiak, for primary places of residence, and for Native allotments 
approved as provided in section 18 of the Act. Selections must be made 
before July 1, 1976. Of this total amount:
    (1) 500,000 acres will be set aside to be used by the Secretary to 
satisfy applications filed pursuant to section 14(h) (1), (2), and (5) 
of the Act. The 500,000 acres will be allocated by: (i) Dividing 200,000 
acres among the regions based on the number of Natives enrolled in each 
region; and, (ii) dividing 300,000 acres equally among the regions;
    (2) 92,160 acres will be set aside for possible allocation by the 
Secretary to corporations formed by the Natives residing in Sitka, 
Kenai, Juneau, and Kodiak;
    (3) 400,000 acres will be set aside to be used by the Secretary to 
satisfy Native allotment applications approved prior to December 18, 
1975, under the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197), the Act of February 
8, 1887 (24 Stat. 389), as amended and supplemented, and the Act of June 
25, 1910 (36 Stat. 863). Any Native allotment applications pending 
before the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Bureau of Land Management on 
December 18, 1971, will be considered as pending before the Department. 
Those allotment applications which have been determined to meet the 
requirements of the acts cited herein and for which survey has been 
requested before December 18, 1975, shall be considered approved under 
section 14(h)(6) of the Act and shall be charged against the acreage.
    (b) After subtracting the number of acres used in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section from 2 million acres, the remainder will, 
after July 1, 1976, be reallocated by the Secretary among the regional 
corporations in accordance with the number of Natives enrolled in each 
region.

    (b) Applications by corporations of Native groups under section 
14(h)(2) and by a Native for a primary place of residence under section 
14(h)(5) of the Act must be accompanied by written concurrence of the 
affected regional corporation. In the case of Native groups, such 
concurrence must also indicate how much land per member of the Native 
group, not to exceed 320 acres per member, the regional corporation 
recommends that the Secretary convey. Any application not accompanied by 
the necessary concurrence and recommendation of the affected region will 
be rejected.
    (c) Native groups, and Natives residing in Sitka, Kenai, Juneau, and 
Kodiak, as provided in sections 14(h) (2) and (3), respectively, must 
comply with the applicable terms of Sec. 2650.2(a), (c), (d), (e), and 
(f) of this chapter.
    (d) The filing of an application under the regulations of this 
section will constitute a request for withdrawal of the lands, and will 
segregate the lands from all other forms of appropriation under the 
public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, and 
from selection under the Alaska Statehood Act, as amended, subject to 
valid existing rights, but will not segregate the lands from selections 
under

section 12 or 16 of the Act. The segregative effect of such an 
application will terminate if the application is rejected.


<R05>
Sec. 2653.3  Lands available for selection.

    (a) Selection may be made for existing cemetery sites or historical 
places, Native groups, corporations formed by the Natives residing in 
Sitka, Kenai, Juneau, and Kodiak, and for primary places of residence, 
from any unappropriated and unreserved lands which the Secretary may 
withdraw for these purposes: Provided, That National Wildlife Refuge 
System lands and National Forest lands may be made available as provided 
by section 14(h)(7) of the Act and the regulations in this subpart. 
Selections for these purposes may also be made from any unappropriated 
and unreserved lands which the Secretary may withdraw from lands 
formerly withdrawn and not selected under section 16 of the Act and 
after December 18, 1975, from lands formerly withdrawn under section 
11(a)(1) or 11(a)(3) and not selected under sections 12 or 19 of the 
Act.
    (b) After December 18, 1975, selection of the lands allocated 
pursuant to Sec. 2653.1(b), shall be made from any lands previously 
withdrawn under sections 11 or 16 of the Act which are not otherwise 
appropriated.
    (c) A withdrawal made pursuant to section 17(d)(1) of the Act which 
is not part of the Secretary's recommendation to Congress of December 
18, 1973, on the four national systems shall not preclude a withdrawal 
pursuant to section 14(h) of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 2653.4  Termination of selection period.

    Except as provided in Sec. 2653.10, applications for selections 
under this subpart will be rejected after all allocated lands, as 
provided in Sec. 2653.1, have been exhausted, or if the application is 
received after the following dates, whichever occurs first:
    (a) As to primary place of residence--December 18, 1973.
    (b) As to all recipients described in sections 14(h) (1), (2), and 
(3) of the Act--December 31, 1976.

<R05>
Sec. 2653.5  Cemetery sites and historical places.

    (a) The appropriate regional corporation may apply to the Secretary 
for the conveyance of existing cemetery sites or historical places 
pursuant to section 14(h) of the Act. The Secretary may give favorable 
consideration to these applications: Provided, That the Secretary 
determines that the criteria in these regulations are met: And provided 
further, That the regional corporation agrees to accept a covenant in 
the conveyance that these cemetery sites or historical places will be 
maintained and preserved solely as cemetery sites or historical places 
by the regional corporation, in accordance with the provisions for 
conveyance reservations in Sec. 2653.11.
    (b) A historical place may be granted in a National Wildlife Refuge 
or National Forest unless, in the judgment of the Secretary, the events 
or the qualities of the site from which it derives its particular value 
and significance as a historical place can be commemorated or found in 
an alternative site outside the refuge or forest, or if the Secretary 
determines that the conveyance could have a substantial detrimental 
effect on (1) a fish or wildlife population, (2) its habitat, (3) the 
management of such population or habitat, or (4) access by a fish or 
wildlife population to a critical part of its habitat.
    (c) Although the existence of a cemetery site or historical place 
and a proper application for its conveyance create no valid existing 
right, they operate to segregate the land from all other forms of 
appropriation under the public land laws. Conveyances of lands reserved 
for the National Wildlife Refuge System made pursuant to this subpart 
are subject to the provisions of section 22(g) of the Act and 
Sec. 2650.4-6 as though they were conveyances to a village corporation.
    (d) For purposes of evaluating and determining the eligibility of 
properties

[[Page 204]]

as historical places, the quality of significance in Native history or 
culture shall be considered to be present in places that possess 
integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling 
and association, and:
    (1) That are associated with events that have made a significant 
contribution to the history of Alaskan Indians, Eskimos or Aleuts, or
    (2) That are associated with the lives of persons significant in the 
past of Alaskan Indians, Eskimos or Aleuts, or
    (3) That possess outstanding and demonstrably enduring symbolic 
value in the traditions and cultural beliefs and practices of Alaskan 
Indians, Eskimos or Aleuts, or
    (4) That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, 
or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or 
that possess high artistic values, or
    (5) That have yielded, or are demonstrably likely to yield 
information important in prehistory or history.
    (e) Criteria considerations for historic places: Ordinarily, 
cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties 
owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, 
structures that have been moved from their original locations, 
reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in 
nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 
50 years shall not be considered eligible as a historical place unless 
they fall within one of the following categories:
    (1) A religious property deriving primary significance from 
architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance;
    (2) A building or structure removed from its original location but 
which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a 
historic person or event;
    (3) A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding 
importance if there is no appropriate site or building directly 
associated with his productive life;
    (4) A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of 
persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design 
features, or from association with historic events;
    (5) A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable 
environment and preserved in a dignified manner as part of a restoration 
master plan and when no other building or structure with the same 
association has survived;
    (6) A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, 
tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own historical 
significance; or
    (7) A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it 
is of exceptional importance.
    (f) Applications by a regional corporation under section 14(h)(1) of 
the Act for conveyance of existing cemetery sites or historical places 
within its boundaries shall be filed with the proper office of the 
Bureau of Land Management in accordance with Sec. 2650.2(a) of this 
chapter. The regional corporation shall include as an attachment to its 
application for a historical place a statement describing the events 
that took place and the qualities of the site from which it derives its 
particular value and significance as a historical place. In making the 
application, the regional corporation should identify accurately and 
with sufficient specificity the size and location of the site for which 
the application is made as an existing cemetery site or historical place 
to enable the Bureau of Land Management to segregate the proper lands. 
The land shall be described in accordance with Sec. 2650.2(e) of this 
chapter, except that if the site under application is less than 2.50 
acres or if it cannot be described by a protracted survey description, 
it shall be described by a metes and bounds description.
    (g) Upon receipt of an application for an existing cemetery site or 
historical place, the Bureau of Land Management shall segregate from all 
other appropriation under the public land laws the land which it 
determines, adequately encompasses the site described in the 
application.
    (h) Notice of filing of such application specifying the regional 
corporation, the size and location of the segregated lands encompassing 
the site for which application has been made, the date of filing, and 
the date by which

[[Page 205]]

any protest of the application must be filed shall be published once in 
the Federal Register and in one or more newspapers of general 
circulation in Alaska once a week for three consecutive weeks by the 
Bureau of Land Management. The Bureau of Land Management shall then 
forward the application to the Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, for investigation, report, and certification and supply 
a copy to the National Park Service. When an application pertains to 
lands within a National Wildlife Refuge or National Forest, the Bureau 
of Land Management shall also forward informational copies of the 
application and the size and location of segregated lands to the agency 
or agencies involved.
    (i) If, during its investigation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs finds 
that the location of the site as described in the application is in 
error, it shall notify the applicant, the Bureau of Land Management, and 
other affected Federal agencies, of such error. The applicant shall have 
60 days from receipt of such notice to file with the Bureau of Land 
Management an amendment to its application with respect to the location 
of the site. Upon acceptance of such amendment the Bureau of Land 
Management shall reprocess the application, including segregation of 
lands and publication of notice.
    (j) The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall identify on a map and mark on 
the ground, including gravesites or other important items, the location 
and size of the site or place with sufficient clarity to enable the 
Bureau of Land Management to locate on the ground said site or place. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, after consultation with the National Park 
Service and, in the case of refuges and forests, the agency or agencies 
involved, shall certify as to the existence of the site or place and 
that it meets the criteria in this subpart.
    (1) Cemetery sites. The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall certify 
specifically that the site is the burial place of one or more Natives. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall determine whether the cemetery site 
is in active or inactive use, and if active, it shall estimate the 
degree of use by Native groups and villages in the area which it shall 
identify.
    (2) Historical places. The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall describe 
the events that took place and qualities of the site which give it 
particular value and significance as a historical place.
    (k) The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall submit its report and 
certification along with the written comments and recommendations of the 
National Park Service and any other Federal agency, to the Bureau of 
Land Management. If the land is available, the Bureau of Land Management 
shall issue a decision to convey. However, where the issues in 
Sec. 2653.5(b) are raised by the reports of the Fish and Wildlife 
Service or the Forest Service, the State Director, Bureau of Land 
Management shall submit the record including a land status report, to 
the Secretary for a resolution of any conflicts. If the land is 
available for that purpose, the Secretary shall make his determination 
to convey or not to convey the site to the applicant.
    (l) The decision of the Bureau of Land Management or the Secretary 
shall be served on the applicant and all parties of record in accordance 
with the provisions of 43 CFR part 4, subpart E and shall be published 
in accordance with Sec. 2650.7 of this part. The decision of the Bureau 
of Land Management shall become final unless appealed to the Board of 
Land Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR part 4, subpart E. Any agency 
adversely affected by the certification of BIA or the decision of the 
Bureau of Land Management may also appeal the matter to the Board of 
Land Appeals. After a decision to convey an existing cemetery site or 
historical place has become final, the Bureau of Land Management shall 
adjust the segregation of the lands to conform with said conveyance.
    (m) For inactive cemeteries, the boundaries of such cemetery sites 
shall include an area encompassing all actual gravesites including a 
reasonable buffer zone of not more than 66 feet. For active cemeteries, 
the boundaries of such sites shall include an area of actual use and 
reasonable future expansion of not more than 10 acres, but the BLM in 
consultation with any affected Federal agency may include

[[Page 206]]

more than 10 acres upon a determination that special circumstances 
warrant it. For historical places, the boundaries shall include an area 
encompassing the actual site with a reasonable buffer zone of not more 
than 330 feet.

Sec. 2653.6  Native groups.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) The head or any authorized representative of a 
Native group incorporated pursuant to section 14(h)(2) of the Act may 
file on behalf of the group an application for a determination of its 
eligibility under said section of the Act. Such application shall be 
filed in duplicate with the appropriate officer, Bureau of Land 
Management, prior to April 16, 1976, in accordance with Sec. 2650.2(a) 
of this chapter. Upon serialization of the application, the Bureau of 
Land Management office will forward a copy of such application to the 
Director, Juneau Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, who shall 
investigate and report the findings of fact required to be made herein 
to the Bureau of Land Management with a certification thereof. A copy of 
an application by a group located within a National Wildlife Refuge or a 
National Forest will be furnished to the appropriate agency 
administering the area.
    (2) Each application must identify the section, township, and range 
in which the Native group is located, and must be accompanied by a list 
of the names of the Native members of the group, a listing of permanent 
improvements and periods of use of the locality by members, a conformed 
copy of the group's article of incorporation, and the regional 
corporation's concurrence and recommendation under Sec. 2653.2(b).
    (3) Notice of the filing of such application specifying the date of 
such filing, the identity and location of the Native group, and the date 
by which any protest of the application must be filed shall be prepared 
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and shall be published once in the 
Federal Register and in one or more newspapers of general circulation in 
Alaska once a week for three consecutive weeks by the Bureau of Land 
Management. Any protest to the application shall be filed with the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs within the time specified in the notice.
    (4) The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall investigate and determine 
whether each member of a Native group formed pursuant to section 
14(h)(2) of the Act is enrolled pursuant to section 5 of the Act. The 
Bureau of Indian Affairs shall determine whether the members of the 
Native group actually reside in and are enrolled to the locality 
specified in its application. The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall specify 
the number and names of Natives who actually reside in and are enrolled 
to the locality, including children who are members of the group and who 
are temporarily elsewhere for purposes of education, and it shall 
further determine whether the members of the Native group constitute the 
majority of the residents of the locality where the group resides. The 
Bureau of Indian Affairs shall determine and identify the exterior 
boundaries of the Native group's locality and the location of all those 
permanent structures of the Native group used as dwelling houses.
    (5) The Native group must have an identifiable physical location. 
The members of the group must use the group locality as a place where 
they actually live in permanent structures used as dwelling houses. The 
group must have the character of a separate community, distinguishable 
from nearby communities, and must be composed of more than a single 
family or household. Members of a group must have enrolled to the 
group's locality pursuant to section 5 of the Act, must actually have 
resided there as of the 1970 census enumeration date, and must have 
lived there as their principal place of residence since that date.
    (6) The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall issue its certification, 
containing its findings of fact required to be made herein and its 
determination of the eligibility of the Native group, except it shall 
issue a certification of ineligibility when it is notified by the Bureau 
of Land Management that the land is unavailable for selection by such 
Native group. It shall send a copy thereof by certified mail to the 
Bureau of Land

[[Page 207]]

Management, the Native group, its regional corporation and any party of 
record.
    (7) Appeals concerning the eligibility of a Native group may be made 
to the Board of Land Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR part 4, subpart 
E.
    (b) Selections. (1) Native group selections shall not exceed the 
amount recommended by the regional corporation or 320 acres for each 
Native member of a group, or 7,680 acres for each Native group, 
whichever is less. Any acreage selected in excess of that number shall 
be identified as alternate selections and shall be numerically ordered 
to indicate selection preference. Native groups will not receive land 
benefits unless the land which is occupied by their permanent structures 
used as dwelling houses is available, or in the case where such land is 
not State or federally owned, the land which is contiguous to and 
immediately surrounds the land occupied by their permanent structures 
used as dwelling houses is available, and is not within a wildlife 
refuge or forest, pursuant to section 14(h) of the Act. Public lands 
which may be available for this purpose are set forth in Sec. 2653.3 (a) 
and (c). Conveyances of lands reserved for the National Wildlife Refuge 
System made pursuant to this part are subject to the provisions of 
section 22(g) of the Act and Sec. 2650.4-6 of this chapter as though 
they were conveyances to a village corporation.
    (2) Upon receipt of the applications of a Native group for a 
determination of its eligibility under section 14(h)(2) of the Act, the 
Bureau of Land Management shall segregate the land encompassed within 
the group locality from land available for that purpose pursuant to 
Sec. 2653.6(b)(1). However, segregation of land for Native groups whose 
dwelling structures are located outside but adjacent to a National 
Wildlife Refuge or National Forest shall not include such reserved land, 
unless the Native group's dwelling structures are located on land 
excepted from the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge pursuant to Public 
Land Order 1634 (FR Doc. 58-3696, filed May 16, 1958).
    (3) The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall visit the locality of the 
group and shall recommend to the Bureau of Land Management the manner in 
which the segregation should be modified to encompass the residences of 
as many members as possible while allowing for the inclusion of the land 
most intensively used by members of the Native group. The recommended 
segregation must be contiguous and as compact as possible. The Bureau of 
Land Management may segregate the land accordingly provided such lands 
are otherwise available in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2). 
If the Bureau of Land Management finds the lands are unavailable for 
selection by a Native group, it shall notify the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs.
    (4) Selections shall be made from lands segregated for that purpose 
and shall be filed prior to July 1, 1976. Selections shall be contiguous 
and taking into account the situation and potential uses of the lands 
involved, the total area selected shall be reasonably compact except 
where separated by lands which are unavailable for selection. The total 
area selected will not be considered to be reasonably compact if (i) it 
excludes other lands available for selection within its exterior 
boundaries; or (ii) an isolated tract of public land of less than 640 
acres remains after selection. The lands selected shall be in quarter 
sections where they are available unless the exhaustion of the acreage 
which the group may be entitled to select does not permit the selection 
of a quarter section and shall include all available lands in less than 
quarter sections. Lands selected shall conform as nearly as practicable 
to the United States land survey system.
    (5) A Native group whose eligibility has not been finally determined 
may file its land selections as if it were determined to be eligible. 
The Bureau of Land Management shall release from segregation the lands 
not selected and shall continue segregation of the selected land until 
the lands are conveyed or the group is finally determined to be 
ineligible. However, in the case of a group determined to be ineligible 
by the Board of Land Appeals, the segregation shall be continued for a 
period of 60 days from the date of such decision.
    (6) Where any conflict in land selection occurs between any eligible 
Native

[[Page 208]]

groups, the Bureau of Land Management shall request the appropriate 
regional corporation to recommend the manner in which such conflict 
should be resolved.
    (7) The Bureau of Land Management shall issue a decision on the 
selection of a Native group determined to be eligible and shall serve a 
copy of such decision by certified mail on the Native group, its 
regional corporation and any party of record and the decision shall be 
published in accordance with Sec. 2650.7 of this part.
    (8) Appeals from the Bureau of Land Management decision on the 
selection by a Native group under this section shall be made to the 
Board of Land Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.

Sec. 2653.7  Sitka-Kenai-Juneau-Kodiak selections.

    (a) The corporations representing the Natives residing in Sitka, 
Kenai, Juneau, and Kodiak, who incorporate under the laws of the State 
of Alaska, may each select the surface estate of up to 23,040 acres of 
lands of similar character located in reasonable proximity to those 
municipalities.
    (b) The corporations representing the Natives residing in Sitka, 
Kenai, Juneau, and Kodiak, shall nominate not less than 92,160 acres of 
lands within 50 miles of each of the four named cities which are similar 
in character to the lands in which each of the cities is located. After 
review and public hearings, the Secretary shall withdraw up to 46,080 
acres near each of the cities from the lands nominated. Each corporation 
representing the Native residents of the four named cities may select 
not more than one-half the area withdrawn for selection by that 
corporation. The Secretary shall convey the area selected.


<R05>
Sec. 2653.8  Primary place of residence.

    (a) An application under this subpart may be made by a Native who 
occupied land as a primary place of residence on August 31, 1971.
    (b) Applications for a primary place of residence must be filed not 
later than December 18, 1973.


<R05>
Sec. 2653.8-1  Acreage to be conveyed.

    A Native may secure title to the surface estate of only a single 
tract not to exceed 160 acres under the provisions of this subpart, and 
shall be limited to the acreage actually occupied and used. An 
application for title under this subpart shall be accompanied by a 
certification by the applicant that he will not receive title to any 
other tract of land pursuant to sections 14 (c)(2), (h)(2), or 18 of the 
Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2653.8-2  Primary place of residence criteria.

    (a) Periods of occupancy. Casual or occasional use will not be 
considered as occupancy sufficient to make the tract applied for a 
primary place of residence.
    (b) Improvements constructed on the land. (1) Must have a dwelling.
    (2) May include associated structures such as food cellars, drying 
racks, caches etc.
    (c) Evidence of occupancy. Must have evidence of permanent or 
seasonal occupancy for substantial periods of time.


<R05>
Sec. 2653.8-3  Appeals.

    Appeals from decisions made by the Bureau of Land Management on 
applications filed pursuant to section 14(h)(5) of the Act shall be made 
to the Board of Land Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR part 4, subpart 
E.

<R05>
Sec. 2653.9  Regional selections.

    (a) Applications by a regional corporation for selection of land 
within its boundaries under section 14(h)(8) of the Act shall be filed 
with the proper office of the Bureau of Land Management in accordance 
with Sec. 2650.2(a). Selections made under section 14(h)(1), (2), (3), 
and (5) of the Act will take priority over selections made pursuant to 
section 14(h)(8). Lands available for section 14(h)(8) selections are 
those lands originally withdrawn under section 11(a)(1), (3), or 16(a) 
of the Act and not conveyed pursuant to selections made under sections 
12(a), (b), or (c), 16(b) or 19 of the Act.
    (b) A regional corporation may select a total area in excess of its 
entitlement

[[Page 209]]

to ensure that it will obtain its entitlement in the event of any 
conflicts. Any acreage in excess of its entitlement shall be identified 
as alternate selections and shall be numerically ordered on a section by 
section basis to indicate selection preference.
    (c) Selections need not be contiguous but must be made along section 
lines in reasonably compact tracts of at least 5,760 acres, not 
including any unavailable land contained therein. The exterior 
boundaries of such tracts shall be in linear segments of not less than 
two miles in length, except where adjoining unavailable lands or where 
shorter segments are necessary to follow section lines where township 
lines are offset along standard parallels caused by the convergence of 
the meridians. However, selected tracts may contain less than 5,760 
acres where there is good cause shown for such selection, taking into 
consideration good land management planning and principles for the 
potentially remaining public lands, and which would not leave unduly 
fragmented tracts of such public lands. Each tract selected shall not be 
considered to be reasonably compact if (1) it excludes other lands for 
selection within its exterior boundaries, or (2) an isolated tract of 
public land of less than 1,280 acres remains after selection of the 
total entitlement. Regional corporations shall not be precluded from 
selecting less than 5,760 acres where the entire tract available for 
selection constitutes less than 5,760 acres. Selection shall conform as 
nearly as practicable to the United States land survey system.
    (d) Notice of the filing of such selections, including the date by 
which any protest of the selection should be filed, shall be published 
once in the Federal Register and one or more newspapers of general 
circulation in Alaska once a week for three consecutive weeks by the 
Bureau of Land Management. Any protest to the application should be 
filed in the Bureau of Land Management office in which such selections 
were filed within the time specified in the notice.
    (e) Appeals from decisions made by the Bureau of Land Management 
with respect to such selections shall be made to the Board of Land 
Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.

Sec. 2653.11  Conveyance reservations.

    (a) Conveyances issued pursuant to this subpart are subject to the 
conveyance reservations described in Sec. 2650.4 of this chapter.
    (b) In addition to the reservations provided in paragraph (a) of 
this section, conveyance for cemetery sites or historical places will 
contain a covenant running with the land providing that (1) the regional 
corporation shall not authorize mining or mineral activity of any type; 
nor shall it authorize any use which is incompatible with or is in 
derogation of the values of the area as a cemetery site or historical 
place (standards for determining uses which are incompatible with or in 
derogation of the values of the area are found in relevant portions of 
36 CFR 800.9 (1974); and (2) that the United States reserves the right 
to seek enforcement of the covenant in an action in equity. The covenant 
placed in this subsection may be released by the Secretary, in his 
discretion, upon application of the regional corporation grantee showing 
that extraordinary to circumstances of a nature to warrant the release 
have arisen subsequent to the conveyance.
    (c) Conveyances for cemetery sites and historical places shall also 
contain the covenant required by Sec. 2650.4-6 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 2654.0-3  Authority.

    Section 19(b) of the Act authorizes any village corporation(s) 
located within a reserve defined in the act to acquire title to the 
surface and subsurface estates in any reserve set aside for the use and 
benefit of its stockholders or members prior to December 18, 1971. Such 
acquisition precludes any other benefits under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2654.0-5  Definitions.

    Reserve lands means any lands reserved prior to the date of 
enactment of the act which are subject to being taken in lieu of other 
benefits under the act pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2654.1  Exercise of option.

    (a) Any village corporation which has not, by December 18, 1973, 
elected to acquire title to the reserve lands will be deemed to have 
elected to receive for itself and its members the other benefits under 
the Act.
    (b) The election of a village to acquire title to the reserve lands 
shall be exercised in the manner provided by its articles of 
incorporation. However when two or more villages are located on the same 
reserve there must be a special election to acquire title to the reserve 
lands. A majority vote of all the stockholders or members of all 
corporations located on the reserve is required to acquire title to the 
reserve lands. For the purpose of this paragraph the stockholders or 
members shall be determined on the basis of the roll of village 
residents proposed to be promulgated under 25 CFR 43h.7.\1\ The regional 
corporation or village corporations or any member or stockholder of the 
village corporations involved may request that the election be observed 
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

such village corporation or corporations as being in conformity with the 
articles of incorporation and by-laws of the village corporation or 
corporations.


<R05>
Sec. 2654.2  Application procedures.

    (a) If the corporation or corporations elect to take title to the 
reserve lands, submission to the Secretary of the certificate of 
election will constitute an application to acquire title to those lands.
    (b) If the village corporation or corporations do not elect to take 
the reserve lands, they shall apply for their land selections pursuant 
to subpart 2651 of this chapter.

determine the smallest practicable tract enclosing land actually used in 
connection with the administration of Federal installations in Alaska.


<R05>
Sec. 2655.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Holding agency means any Federal agency claiming use of a tract 
of land subject to these regulations.
    (b) Appropriate selection period means the statutory or regulatory 
period within which the lands were available for Native selection under 
the act.

    (c) State Director means the Director, Alaska State Office, Bureau 
of Land Management.


<R05>
Sec. 2655.1  Lands subject to determination.

    (a) Holding agency lands located within areas withdrawn by sections 
11(a)(1), 16(a), or 16(d) of the Act and subsequently selected by a 
village or regional corporation under sections 12 or 16, or selected by 
the regional corporation under sections 12 or 16, or selected by the 
regional corporation for southeast Alaska in accordance with section 
14(h)(8)(B) are subject to a determination made under this subpart.
    (b) Lands in the National Park System, lands withdrawn or reserved 
for national defense purposes and those former Indian reserves elected 
under section 19 of the Act are not subject to a determination under 
section 3(e)(1) of the Act or this subpart. Lands withdrawn under 
section 11(a)(3) or 14(h), except 14(h)(8)(B), of the Act do not include 
lands withdrawn or otherwise appropriated by a Federal agency and, 
therefore, are not subject to a determination under section 3(e)(1) of 
the Act or this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 2655.2  Criteria for determinations.

    Land subject to determination under section 3(e)(1) of the Act will 
be subject to conveyance to Native corporations if they are determined 
to be public lands under this subpart. If the lands are determined not 
to be public lands, they will be retained by the holding agency. The 
Bureau of Land Management shall determine:
    (a) Nature and time of use.
    (1) If the holding agency used the lands for a purpose directly and 
necessarily connected with the Federal agency as of December 18, 1971; 
and
    (2) If use was continuous, taking into account the type of use, 
throughout the appropriate selection period; and
    (3) If the function of the holding agency is similiar to that of the 
Federal agency using the lands as of December 18, 1971.
    (b) Specifications for area to be retained by Federal agency.
    (1) Area shall be no larger than reasonably necessary to support the 
agency's use.
    (2) Tracts shall be described by U.S. Survey (or portion thereof), 
smallest aliquot part, metes and bounds or protraction diagram, as 
appropriate.
    (3) Tracts may include:
    (i) Improved lands;
    (ii) Buffer zone surrounding improved lands as is reasonably 
necessary for purposes such as safety measures, maintenance, security, 
erosion control, noise protection and drainage;
    (iii) Unimproved lands used for storage;
    (iv) Lands containing gravel or other materials used in direct 
connection with the agency's purpose and not used simply as a source of 
revenue or services. The extent of the areas reserved as a source of 
materials will be the area disturbed but not depleted as of the date of 
the end of the appropriate selection period; and
    (v) Lands used by a non-governmental entity or private person for a 
use that has a direct, necessary and substantial connection to the 
purpose of the holding agency but shall not include lands from which 
proceeds of the lease, permit, contract, or other means are used 
primarily to derive revenue.
    (c) Interest to be retained by Federal agency.
    (1) Generally, full fee title to the tract shall be retained; 
however, where the tract is used primarily for access, electronic, light 
or visibility clear zones or right-of-way, an easement may be reserved 
in lieu of full fee title where the State Director determines that an 
easement affords sufficient protection, that an easement is customary 
for the particular use and that it would further the objectives of the 
act.
    (2) Easements reserved in lieu of full fee title shall be reserved 
under the provisions of section 17(b) of the Act and Sec. 2650.4-7 of 
this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2655.3  Determination procedures.

    (a) The State Director shall make the determination pursuant to the 
provisions in this subpart. Where sufficient information has not already 
been provided, the State Director shall issue written notice to any 
Federal agency which the Bureau of Land Management has reason to believe 
might be a holding agency. The written notice shall provide that the 
information requested

[[Page 212]]

be furnished in triplicate to the State Director within 90 days from the 
receipt of the notice. Upon receipt of information the State Director 
will promptly provide affected Native corporations with copies of the 
documents. Upon adequate and justifiable showing as to the need for an 
extension by the holding agency, the State Director may grant a time 
extension up to 60 days to provide the information requested in this 
subpart.
    (b) The information to be provided by the holding agency shall 
include the following for each tract which is subject to determination:
    (1) The function and scope of the installation;
    (2) A plottable legal description of the lands used;
    (3) A list of structures or other alterations to the character of 
lands and their function, their location on the tract, and date of 
construction;
    (4) A description of the use and function of any unaltered lands;
    (5) A list of any rights, interests or permitted uses the agency has 
granted to others, including other Federal agencies, along with dates of 
issuance and expiration and copies of any relevant documents;
    (6) If available, site plans, drawings and annotated aerial 
photographs delineating the boundaries of the installation and locations 
of the areas used; and
    (7) A narrative explanation stating when Federal use of each area 
began; what use was being made of the lands as of December 18, 1971; 
whether any action has taken place between December 18, 1971, and the 
end of the appropriate selection period that would reduce the area 
needed, and the date this action occurred.
    (c) The State Director shall request comments from the selecting 
Native corporation relating to the identification of lands requiring a 
determination. The period for comment by the Native corporation shall be 
as provided for the agency in paragraph (a) of this section, but shall 
commence from the date of receipt of the latest copy of the holding 
agency's submission.
    (d) The holding agency has the burden of proof in proceedings before 
the State Director under this subpart. A determination of the lands to 
be retained by the holding agency under section 3(e) of the Act and this 
subpart shall be made based on the information available in the case 
file. If the holding agency fails to present adequate information on 
which to base a determination, all lands selected shall be approved for

<R04>
                 Subpart 2710--Sales: General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 2710.0-1  Purpose.

    The regulations in this part implement the sale authority of section 
203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 
1701, 1713).


<R05>
Sec. 2710.0-2  Objective.

    The objective is to provide for the orderly disposition at not less 
than fair market value of public lands identified for sale as part of 
the land use planning process.


<R05>
Sec. 2710.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The Secretary of the Interior is authorized by the Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701, 1713), to sell public 
lands where, as a result of land use planning, it is determined that the 
sale of such tract meets any or all of the following disposal criteria:
    (1) Such tract was acquired for a specific purpose and the tract is 
no longer required for that or any other Federal purpose; or
    (2) Disposal of such tract shall serve important public objectives, 
including but not limited to, expansion of communities and economic 
development, which cannot be achieved prudently or feasibly on lands 
other than public lands and which outweigh other public objectives and 
values, including, but not limited to, recreation and scenic values, 
which would be served by maintaining such tract in Federal ownership; or
    (3) Such tract, because of its location or other characteristics is 
difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands and is 
not suitable for management by another Federal department or agency.
    (b) The Secretary of the Interior is authorized by section 310 of 
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1740) to 
promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the purpose of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2710.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term
    (a) Public lands means any lands and interest in lands owned by the 
United States and administered by the Secretary through the Bureau of 
Land Management except:
    (1) Lands located on the Outer Continental Shelf;
    (2) Lands held for the benefit of Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos.
    (b) Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior.

[[Page 214]]

    (c) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management who has been delegated the authority to perform the duties 
described in this part.
    (d) Act means the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 
U.S.C. 1701).
    (e) Family sized farm means the unit of public lands determined to 
be chiefly valuable for agriculture, and that is of sufficient size, 
based on land use capabilities, development requirements and economic 
capability, to provide a level of net income, after payment of expenses 
and taxes, which will sustain a family sized agribusiness operation 
above the poverty level for a rural farm family of 4 as determined by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, for the 
calender year immediately preceeding the year of the proposed sale under 
the regulations of this part. The determination of the practical size is 
an economic decision to be made on a local area basis considering, but 
not limited to, factors such as: Climatic conditions, soil character, 
availability of irrigation water, topography, usual crop(s) of the 
locale, marketability of the crop(s), production and development costs, 
and other physical characteristics which shall give reasonable assurance 
of continued production under proper conservation management.


<R05>
Sec. 2710.0-6  Policy.

    (a) Sales under this part shall be made only in implementation of an 
approved land use plan or analysis in accordance with part 1600 of this 
title.
    (b) Public lands determined to be suitable for sale shall be offered 
only on the initiative of the Bureau of Land Management. Indications of 
interest to have specific tracts of public lands offered for sale shall 
be accomplished through public input to the land use planning process. 
(See Secs. 1601.1-1 and 1601.8 of this title). Nominations or requests 
to have specific tracts of public lands offered for sale may also be 
made by direct request to the authorized officer.
    (c)(1) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 
1713(f)) provides that sales of public lands under this section shall be 
conducted under competitive bidding procedures established by the 
Secretary. However, where the Secretary determines it necessary and 
proper in order to assure equitable distribution among purchasers of 
lands, or to recognize equitable considerations or public policies, 
including, but not limited to, a preference to users, lands may be sold 
by modified competitive bidding or without competitive bidding. In 
recognizing public policies, the Secretary shall give consideration to 
the following potential purchasers:
    (i) The State in which the lands are located;
    (ii) The local government entities in such State which are in 
vicinity of the lands;
    (iii) Adjoining landowners;
    (iv) Individuals; and
    (v) Any other person.
    (2) When a parcel of land meets the sale criteria of section 203 of 
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1713), several 
factors shall be considered in determining the method of sale. These 
factors include, but are not limited to: Competitive interest; needs of 
State and local governments; adjoining landowners; historical uses; and 
equitable distribution of land ownership.
    (3) Three methods of sale are provided for in Sec. 2711.3 of this 
title: competitive; modified competitive; and direct (non-competitive). 
The policy for selecting the method of sale is:
    (i) Competitive sale as provided in Sec. 2711.3-1 of this title is 
the general procedure for sales of public lands and may be used where 
there would be a number of interested parties bidding for the lands and 
(A) wherever in the judgment of the authorized officer the lands are 
accessible and usable regardless of adjoining land ownership and (B) 
wherever the lands are within a developing or urbanizing area and land 
values are increasing due to their location and interest on the 
competitive market.
    (ii) Modified competitive sales as provided in Sec. 2711.3-2 of this 
title may be used to permit the existing grazing user or adjoining 
landowner to meet the high bid at the public sale. This procedure will 
allow for limited competitive sales to protect on-going uses,

[[Page 215]]

to assure compatibility of the possible uses with adjacent lands, and 
avoid dislocation of existing users. Lands offered under this procedure 
would normally be public lands not located near urban expansion areas, 
or with rapidly increasing land values, and existing use of adjacent 
lands would be jeopardized by sale under competitive bidding procedures.
    (iii) Direct sale as provided in Sec. 2711.3-3 of this title may be 
used when the lands offered for sale are completely surrounded by lands 
in one ownership with no public access, or where the lands are needed by 
State or local governments or non-profit corporations, or where 
necessary to protect existing equities in the lands or resolve 
inadvertent unauthorized use or occupancy of said lands.
    (4) When lands have been offered for sale by one method of sale and 
the lands remain unsold, then the lands may be reoffered by another 
method of sale.
    (5) In no case shall lands be sold for less than fair market value.
    (d) Sales of public lands determined to be chiefly valuable for 
agriculture shall be no larger than necessary to support a family-sized 
farm.
    (e) The sale of family-sized farm units, at any given sale, shall be 
limited to one unit per bidder and one unit per family. The limit of one 
unit per family is not to be be construed as limiting children eighteen 
years or older from bidding in their own right.
    (f) Sales under this part shall not be made at less than fair market 
value. Such value is to be determined by an appraisal performed by a 
Federal or independent appraiser, as determined by the authorized 
officer, using the principles contained in the Uniform Appraisal 
Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions. The value of authorized 
improvements owned by anyone other than the United States upon lands 
being sold shall not be included in the determination of fair market 
value. Technical review and approval for conformance with appraisal 
standards shall be conducted by the authorized officer.
    (g) Constraint and discretion shall be used with regard to the 
terms, covenants, conditions and reservations authorized by section 208 
of the Act that are to be in sales patents and other conveyance 
documents, except where inclusion of such provisions is required by law 
or for protection of valid existing rights.

<R05>
Sec. 2710.0-8  Lands subject to sale.

    (a) All public lands, as defined by Sec. 2710.0-5 of this title, 
and, which meet the disposal criteria specified under Sec. 2710.0-3 of 
this title, are subject to sale pursuant to this part, except:
    (1) Those public lands within the revested Oregon California 
Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grants which are more 
suitable for management and administration for permanent forest 
protection and other purposes as provided for in the Acts of August 28, 
1937 (50 Stat. 874; 43 U.S.C. 1181(a)); May 24, 1939 (53 Stat. 753); and 
section 701(b) of the Act.
    (2) Public lands in units of the National Wilderness Preservation 
System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System and National System of 
Trails.
    (3) Public lands classified, withdrawn, reserved or otherwise 
designated as not available or subject to sale shall not be sold under 
the regulations of this part until issuance of an order or notice which 
either opens or provides for such disposition.
    (b) Unsurveyed public lands shall not be sold under the regulations 
of this part until they are officially surveyed under the public land 
survey system of the United States. Such survey shall be completed and 
approved by the Secretary prior to any sale.

Sec. 2711.1-1  Identification of tracts by land use planning.

    (a) Tracts of public lands shall only be offered for sale in

accordance with subpart 1601 of this title.
    (b) Public input proposing tracts of public lands for disposal 
through sale as part of the land use planning process

this title.
    (c) Nominations or requests for sales of public lands may be made to 
the District office of the Bureau of Land Management for the District in

<R05>
Sec. 2711.1-2  Notice of realty action.

    (a) A notice of realty action offering for sale a tract or tracts of 
public lands identified for disposal by sale shall be issued, published 
and sent to parties of interest by the authorized officer not less than 
60 days prior to the sale. The notice shall include the terms, 
convenants, conditions and reservations which are to be included in the 
conveyance document and the method of sale. The notice shall also 
provide 45 days after the date of issuance for the right of comment by 
the public and interested parties.
    (b) Not less than 60 days prior to sale, notice shall be sent to the 
Member of the U.S. House of Representatives in whose district the public 
lands proposed for sale are located and the U.S. Senators for the State 
in which the public lands proposed for sale are located, the Senate and 
House of Representatives, as required by paragraph (f) of this section, 
to Governor of the State within which the public lands are located, to 
the head of the governing body of any political subdivision having 
zoning or other land use regulatory responsibility in the geographic 
area within which the public lands are located and to the head of any 
political subdivision having administrative or public services 
responsibility in the geographic area within which the lands are 
located. The notice shall be sent to other known interested parties of 
record including, but not limited to, adjoining landowners and current 
land users.
    (c) The notice shall be published once in the Federal Register and 
once a week for 3 weeks thereafter in a newspaper of general circulation 
in the general vicinity of the public lands being proposed to be offered 
for sale.
    (d) The publication of the notice of realty action in the Federal 
Register shall segregate the public lands covered by the notice of 
realty action to the extent that they will not be subject to 
appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. Any 
subsequent application, shall not be accepted, shall not be considered 
as filed and shall be returned to the applicant, if the notice 
segregates the lands from the use applied for in the application. The 
segregative effect of the notice of realty action shall terminate upon 
issuance of patent or other document of conveyance to such lands, upon 
publication in the Federal Register of a termination of the segregation 
or 270 days from the date of publication, whichever occurs first.
    (e) The notice published under Sec. 1610.5 of this title may, if so 
designated in the notice and is the functional equivalent of a notice of 
realty action required by this section, serve as the notice of realty 
action required by paragraph (a) of this section and may segregate the 
public lands covered by the sale proposal to the same extent that they 
would have been segregated under a notice of realty action issued under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) For tracts of public lands in excess of 2,500 acres, the notice 
shall be submitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives not 
less than the 90 days prescribed by section 203 of the Act (43 U.S.C. 
1713(c)) prior to the date of sale. The sale may not be held prior to 
the completion of the congressional notice period unless such period is 
waived by Congress.

<R05>
Sec. 2711.1-3  Sales requiring grazing permit or lease cancellations.

    When lands are identified for disposal and such disposal will 
preclude livestock grazing, the sale shall not be made until the 
permittees and lessees are given 2 years prior notification, except in 
cases of emergency, that their grazing permit or grazing lease and 
grazing preference may be cancelled in accordance with Sec. 4110.4-2(b) 
of this title. A sale may be made of such identified lands if the sale 
is conditioned upon continued grazing by the current

[[Page 217]]

permittee/lessee until such time as the current grazing permit or lease 
would have expired or terminated. A permittee or lessee may 
unconditionally waive the 2-year prior notification. The publication of 
a notice of realty action as provided in Sec. 2711.1-2(c) of this title 
shall constitute notice to the grazing permittee or lessee if such 
notice has not been previously given.

Sec. 2711.3  Procedures for sale.


<R05>
Sec. 2711.3-1  Competitive bidding.

    When public lands are offered through competitive bidding:
    (a) The date, time, place, and manner for submitting bids shall be 
specified in the notice required by Sec. 2711.1-2 of this title.
    (b) Bids may be made by a principal or a duly qualified agent.
    (c) Sealed bids shall be considered only if received at the place of 
sale prior to the hour fixed in the notice and are made for at least the 
fair market value. Each bid shall be accompanied by certified check, 
postal money order, bank draft or cashier's check made payable to the 
Bureau of Land Management for the amount required in the notice of 
realty action which shall be not less than 10 percent or more than 30 
percent of the amount of the bid, and shall be enclosed in a sealed 
envelope which shall be marked as prescribed in the notice. If 2 or more 
envelopes containing valid bids of the same amount are received, the 
determination of which is to be considered the highest bid shall be by 
supplemental biddings. The designated high bidders shall be allowed to 
submit oral or sealed bids as designated by the authorized officer.
    (d) The highest qualifying sealed bid received shall be publicly 
declared by the authorized officer. If the notice published pursuant to 
Sec. 2711.1-2 of this title provides for oral bids, such bids, in 
increments specified by the authorized officer, shall then be invited. 
After oral bids, if any, are received, the highest qualifying bid, 
designated by type, whether sealed or oral, shall be declared by the 
authorized officer. The person declared to have entered the highest 
qualifying oral bid shall submit payment by cash, personal check, bank 
draft, money order, or any combination for not less than one-fifth of 
the amount of the bid immediately following the close of the sale. The 
successful bidder, whether such bid is a sealed or oral bid, shall 
submit the remainder of the full bid price prior to the expiration of 
180 days from the date of the sale. Failure to submit the full bid price 
prior to, but not including the 180th day following the day of the sale, 
shall result in cancellation of the sale of the specific parcel and the 
deposit shall be forfeited and disposed of as other receipts of sale. In 
the event the authorized officer rejects the highest qualified bid or 
releases the bidder from it, the authorized officer shall determine 
whether the public lands shall be withdrawn from the market or be 
reoffered.
    (e) If the public lands are not sold pursuant to the notice issued 
under Sec. 2711.1-2 of this subpart, they may remain available for sale 
on a continuing basis until sold as specified in the notice.
    (f) The acceptance or rejection of any offer to purchase shall be in 
writing no later than 30 days after receipt of such offer unless the 
offerer waives his right to a decision within such 30-day period. In 
case of a tract of land in excess of 2,500 acres, such acceptance or 
rejection shall not be given until the expiration of 30 days after the 
end of the notice to the Congress provided for in

[[Page 218]]

Sec. 2711.1-2(d) of this subpart. Prior to the expiration of such 
periods the authorized officer may refuse to accept any offer or may 
withdraw any tract from sale if he determines that:
    (1) Consummation of the sale would be inconsistent with the 
provisions of any existing law; or
    (2) Collusive or other activities have hindered or restrained free 
and open bidding; or
    (3) Consummation of the sale would encourage or promote speculation 
in public lands.
    (g) Until the acceptance of the offer and payment of the purchase 
price, the bidder has no contractual or other rights against the United 
States, and no action taken shall create any contractual or other 
obligations of the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 2711.3-2  Modified bidding.

    (a) Public lands may be offered for sale utilizing modified 
competitive bidding procedures when the authorized officer determines it 
is necessary in order to assure equitable distribution of land among 
purchasers or to recognize equitable considerations or public policies.
    (1) Modified competitive bidding includes, but is not limited to:
    (i) Offering to designated bidders the right to meet the highest 
bid. Refusal or failure to meet the highest bid shall constitute a 
waiver of such bidding provisions; or
    (ii) A limitation of persons permitted to bid on a specific tract of 
land offered for sale; or
    (iii) Offering to designated bidders the right of first refusal to 
purchase the lands at fair market value. Failure to accept an offer to 
purchase the offered lands within the time specified by the authorized 
officer shall constitute a waiver of his preference consideration.
    (2) Factors that shall be considered in determining when modified 
competitive bidding procedures shall be used, include but are not 
limited to: Needs of State and/or local government, adjoining 
landowners, historical users, and other needs for the tract. A 
description of the method of modified competitive bidding to be used and 
a statement indicating the purpose or objective of the bidding procedure 
selected shall be specified in the notice of realty action required in 
Sec. 2711.1-2 of this subpart.
    (b) Where 2 or more designated bidders exercise preference 
consideration awarded by the authorized officer in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, such bidders shall be offered the 
opportunity to agree upon a division of the lands among themselves. In 
the absence of a written agreement, the preference right bidders shall 
be allowed to continue bidding to determine the high bidder.
    (c) Where designated bidders fail to exercise the preference 
consideration offered by the authorized officer in the allowed time, the 
sale shall proceed using the procedures specified in Sec. 2711.3-1 of 
this subpart; and
    (d) Once the method of modified competitive or noncompetitive sale 
is determined and such determination has been issued, published and sent 
in accordance with procedures of this part, payment shall be by the same 
instruments as authorized in Sec. 2711.3-1(c) of this subpart.
    (e) Acceptance or rejection of any offer to purchase shall be in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 2711.3-1 (f) and (g) of 
this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 2711.3-3  Direct sales.

    (a) Direct sales (without competition) may be utilized, when in the 
opinion of the authorized officer, a competitive sale is not appropriate 
and the public interest would best be served by a direct sale. Examples 
include, but are not limited to:
    (1) A tract identified for transfer to State or local government or 
nonprofit organization; or
    (2) A tract identified for sale that is an integral part of a 
project or public importance and speculative bidding would jeopardize a 
timely completion and economic viability of the project; or
    (3) There is a need to recognize an authorized use such as an 
existing business which could suffer a substantial

[[Page 219]]

economic loss if the tract were purchased by other than the authorized 
user; or
    (4) The adjoining ownership pattern and access indicate a direct 
sale is appropriate; or
    (5) A need to resolve inadvertent unauthorized use or occupancy of 
the lands.
    (b) Once the authorized officer has determined that the lands will 
be offered by direct sale and such determination has been issued, 
published and sent in accordance with procedures of this part, payment 
shall be made by the same instruments as authorized in Sec. 2711.3-1(c) 
of this subpart.
    (c) Failure to accept an offer to purchase the offered lands within 
the time specified by the authorized officer shall constitute a waiver 
of this preference consideration.
    (d) Acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase the lands shall 
be in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 2711.3-1 (f) and 
(g) of this subpart.

improvements shall be given an opportunity to remove them if such owner 
has not been declared the purchaser of the lands sold, or the 
prospective purchaser may compensate the owner of such authorized 
private improvements and submit proof of compensation to the authorized 
officer.

<R04>
      Subpart 2720--Conveyance of Federally-Owned Mineral Interests


<R05>
Sec. 2720.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures under 
section 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 
U.S.C. 1719, for conveyance of mineral interests owned by the United 
States where the surface is or will be in non-Federal ownership.


<R05>
Sec. 2720.0-2  Objectives.

    The objective is to allow consolidation of surface and subsurface or 
mineral ownership where there are no known mineral values or in those 
instances where the reservation interferes with or precludes appropriate 
non-mineral development and such development is a more beneficial use of 
the land than the mineral development.


<R05>
Sec. 2720.0-3  Authority.

    (a) Section 209(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976, 43 U.S.C. 1719(b), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to 
convey mineral interests owned by the United States where the surface is 
or will be in non-Federal ownership, if certain specific conditions are 
met.
    (b) Section 310 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976, 43 U.S.C. 1740, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to 
promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2720.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Prospective record owner means a person who has a contract or 
other agreement to purchase a tract of land that is in non-Federal 
ownership with a reservation of minerals in the United States, or a 
person who is purchasing a tract of land under the provisions of the 
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 or other laws authorizing 
the conveyance of Federal lands subject to the reservation of a mineral 
interest.
    (b) Known mineral values means mineral rights in lands containing 
geologic formations that are valuable in the monetary sense for 
exploring, developing, or producing natural mineral deposits. The 
presence of such mineral deposits with potential for mineral development 
may be known because of previous exploration, or may be inferred based 
on geologic information.
    (c) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management to whom has been delegated the authority to perform the 
duties described in this part.
    (d) Proof of ownership means evidence of title acceptable in local 
realty practice by attorneys and title examiners and may include a 
current title attorney's opinon, based on a current abstract of title 
prepared by a bonded title insurance or title abstract company doing 
business in the locale where the lands are located.

FR 12711, Mar. 8, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 2720.0-6  Policy.

    As required by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the 
Bureau of Land Management may convey a federally owned mineral interest 
only when the authorized officer determines that it has no known mineral 
value, or that the mineral reservation is interfering with or precluding 
appropriate nonmineral development of the lands and that nonmineral 
development is a more beneficial use than mineral development. 
Allegation, hypothesis or speculation that such conditions could or may 
exist at some future time shall not be sufficient basis for conveyance.

[[Page 221]]

Failure to establish by convincing factual evidence that the requisite 
conditions of interference or preclusion presently exist, and that 
nonmineral development is a more beneficial use, shall result in the 
rejection of an application.

[51 FR 9657, Mar. 20, 1986, as amended at 60 FR 12711, Mar. 8, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 2720.0-9  Information collection.

    (a) The Office of Management and Budget has approved under 44 U.S.C. 
3507 the information collection requirements contained in part 2720 and 
assigned clearance number 1004-0153. The Bureau of Land Management is 
collecting the information to permit the authorized officer to determine 
whether the Bureau of Land Management should dispose of Federally-owned 
mineral interests. The Bureau of Land Management will use the 
information collected to make these determinations. A response is 
required to obtain a benefit.
    (b) The Bureau of Land Management estimates the public reporting 
burden for this information to average 8 hours per response, including 
the time for reviewing regulations, searching existing data sources, 
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing 
the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden 
estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, 
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information 
Collection Clearance Officer (783), Bureau of Land Management, 
Washington, D.C. 20240, and the Office of Management and Budget, 
Paperwork Reduction Project, 1004-0153, Washington, D.C. 20503.

<R05>
Sec. 2720.1  Application to purchase federally-owned mineral interests.


<R05>
Sec. 2720.1-1  Filing of application.

    (a) Any existing or prospective record owner of the surface of land 
in which mineral interests are reserved or otherwise owned by the United 
States may file an application to purchase such mineral interests if--
    (1) He has reason to believe that there are no known mineral values 
in the land, or
    (2) The reservation of ownership of the mineral interests in the 
United States interferes with or precludes appropriate non-mineral 
development of the land and such development would be a more beneficial 
use of the land than its mineral development.
    (b) Publication in the Federal Register of a notice of the filing of 
an application under this part shall segregate the mineral interests 
owned by the United States in the public lands covered by the 
application to the extent that they will not be subject to appropriation 
under the public land laws, including the mining laws. The segregative 
effect of the application shall terminate either upon issuance of a 
patent or other document of conveyance to such mineral interests, upon 
final rejection of the application or 2 years from the date of filing of 
the application which ever occurs first.

<R05>
Sec. 2720.1-2  Form of application.

    (a) An application shall be filed with the proper BLM Office as 
listed in Sec. 1821.2-1(d) of this title.
    (b) No specific form is required.
    (c) A non-refundable fee of $50 shall accompany the application.

    (3) In the case of non-Federal ownership of the surface, a certified 
copy of any patent or other instrument conveying the land included in 
the application and a showing of ownership in the applicant, with 
supporting survey evidence acceptable to the authorized officer, which 
may consist of a metes and bounds survey prepared and certified by a 
civil engineer or land surveyor licensed under the laws of the State in 
which the lands are located; and

[[Page 222]]

    (4) As complete a statement as possible concerning (i) the nature of 
federally-reserved or owned mineral values in the land, including 
explanatory information, (ii) the existing and proposed uses of the 
land, (iii) why the reservation of the mineral interests in the United 
States is interfering with or precluding appropriate non-mineral 
development of the land covered by the application (iv) how and why such 
development would be a more beneficial use of the land than its mineral 
development, and (v) a showing that the proposed use complies or will 
comply with State and local zoning and/or planning requirements.

[44 FR 1342, Jan. 4, 1979, as amended at 51 FR 9658, Mar. 20, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 2720.1-3  Action on application.

    (a) Within 90 days of receipt of an application to purchase 
federally-owned mineral interests, the authorized officer shall, if the 
application meets the requirements for further processing, determine the 
amount of deposit required and so inform the applicant.
    (b) No application filed under this subpart shall be processed until 
the applicant has either--
    (1) Deposited with the authorized officer an amount of money that 
the authorized officer estimates is needed to cover administrative costs 
of processing, including, but not limited to, costs of conducting an 
exploratory program, if one is required, to determine the character of 
the mineral deposits in the land, evaluating the existing data [or the 
data obtained under an approved exploratory program] to aid in 
determining the fair market value of the mineral interests to be 
conveyed, and preparing and issuing the documents of conveyance, or
    (2) Has obtained the consent of the authorized officer to conduct an 
exploratory program, such program to be conducted only under a plan of 
operations approved by the authorized officer and deposited with the 
authorized officer an amount of money the authorized officer estimates 
is needed to cover administrative costs of processing, including, but 
not limited to, costs of evaluating existing data and data submitted 
from an approved exploratory program to determine the fair market value 
of the mineral interests to be conveyed and preparing and issuing the 
documents of conveyance.


    The authorized officer, in reaching a determination as to whether 
there are any known mineral values in the land and, if so, the estimated 
costs of an exploratory program, if one is needed, will rely upon 
reports on minerals prepared by or reviewed and approved by the Bureau 
of Land Management.
    (c) The authorized officer shall inform the applicant of his 
determination as to the need for an exploratory program, and where 
appropriate, the estimated cost of such a program. The applicant may 
request that the exploratory program be arranged by the authorized 
officer or request the consent of the authorized officer to accomplish 
any required exploratory program by other means, at his own expense, 
under a plan of operations approved by the authorized officer and to 
provide the results to the authorized officer for his use and approval. 
The applicant shall, within 60 days of receipt of such notice, or any 
extension thereof, respond to the authorized officer's notice, stating 
whether he wishes to have the authorized officer arrange to have 
conducted the required exploratory program or requests the consent of 
the authorized officer to accomplish any required exploratory program by 
other means. Failure to respond to said notice shall void the 
application.
    (d) If the applicant requests that any required exploratory program 
be arranged by the authorized officer, he shall submit the sum of money 
required under paragraph (b) of this section and the authorized officer 
shall have the exploratory program accomplished so as to aid in 
determining the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests 
covered by the application.
    (e) If the applicant requests the consent of the authorized officer 
to accomplish any required exploratory program by other means, at his 
own expense, he shall at the time of making his request for such 
consent, file a plan of operations to carry out any required exploratory 
program for approval by the authorized officer. Such plan of operations 
shall be sufficient to provide the resource and economic data needed to

[[Page 223]]

aid in determining the fair market value of the Federal mineral 
interests to be conveyed. Said resource and economic data shall include, 
where appropriate, but not be limited to, geologic maps, geologic cross-
sections, tables and descriptive information encompassing lithologic, 
geochemical, and geophysical data, assays of samples, drill logs and 
outcrop sections, which aid in establishing the location, nature, 
quantity, and grade, and which aid in determining the fair market value 
of the Federal mineral interests in the land covered by the application. 
The plan of operations shall conform to the laws, regulations and 
ordinances of all governmental bodies having jurisdiction over the lands 
covered by the application. The authorized officer shall decide within 
90 days of receipt of said request whether he shall or shall not give 
his consent. The authorized officer shall not give his consent if he 
determines that the plan of operations is not adequate to supply the 
resource and economic data needed to aid him in determining the fair 
market value of the Federal mineral interests to be conveyed. If the 
authorized officer, in his discretion, approves the applicant's plan of 
operations, the applicant may proceed to execute the plan of operations, 
subject to the supervision of the authorized officer. If the authorized 
officer does not give his consent to the applicant's request, the 
applicant may, within 60 days of such refusal, avail himself of the 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. Failure to deposit the 
required sum within the 60 day period shall void the application. All 
resource and economic data obtained from the approved exploratory 
program shall be supplied the authorized officer. The authorized officer 
shall supply that data needed for determination of the economic value of 
mineral resources to the Bureau of Land Management. The authorized 
officer relying upon those determinations shall determine the fair 
market value of the Federal mineral interests in the land covered by the 
application. If the authorized officer determines that the resource and 
economic data supplied from an approved exploratory program is not 
adequate to aid in determining the fair market value of the Federal 
mineral interests to be conveyed, he shall so notify the applicant and 
state what additional data is needed.
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of 
this section, an application may be rejected without the applicant 
meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section if the 
authorized officer determines from an examination of the application or 
of data readily available to him relating to the land concerned that the 
application does not meet the requirements of the Act.

[44 FR 1342, Jan. 4, 1979, as amended at 51 FR 9658, Mar. 20, 1986; 60 
FR 12711, Mar. 8, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 2720.2  Determination that an exploratory program is not required.

    (a) In instances where available data indicate that there are no 
known mineral values in the land covered by the application, an 
exploratory program shall not be required.
    (b) The authorized officer will not require an exploratory program 
to ascertain the presence of mineral values where the authorized officer 
determines that a reasonable person would not make exploration 
expenditures with expectations of deriving economic gain from the 
mineral production.
    (c) The authorized officer will not require an exploratory program 
if the authorized officer determines that, for the mineral interests 
covered by the application, sufficient information is available to 
determine their fair market value.

[44 FR 1342, Jan. 4, 1979, as amended at 60 FR 12711, Mar. 8, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 2720.3  Action upon determination of the fair market value of the mineral interests.

    (a) Upon the authorized officer's determination that all of the 
requirements of the Act for conveyance of mineral interests have been 
met by the applicant and all actions necessary to determine the fair 
market value of the Federal mineral interests in land covered by the 
application have been completed, the authorized officer shall notify the 
applicant in writing of the fair market value of the Federal mineral 
interests, including the administrative costs involved in development of 
and issuance of conveyance documents, and

[[Page 224]]

give a full and complete statement of the costs incurred in reaching 
such determination including any sum due the United States or that may 
be unexpended from the deposit made by the applicant. If the 
administrative costs of determining the fair market value of the Federal 
mineral interests exceed the amount of the deposit required of the 
applicant under this subpart, he will be informed that he is required to 
pay the difference between the actual costs and the deposit. If the 
deposit exceeds the administrative costs of determining the fair market 
value of the Federal mineral interests, the applicant will be informed 
that he is entitled to a credit for or a refund of the excess. The 
notice must require the applicant to pay both the fair market value of 
the Federal mineral interests and the remaining administrative costs 
owed within 90 days after the date the authorized officer mails the 
notice. Failure to pay the required amount within the allotted time 
shall constitute a withdrawal of the application and the application 
will be dismissed and the case closed.
    (b) The Bureau of Land Management will convey mineral rights on 
lands for which this part does not require an exploratory program upon 
payment by the applicant of fair market value for those mineral 
interests and all administrative costs of processing the application to 
acquire the mineral rights.

<R05>
Sec. 2720.4  Issuance of document of conveyance.

    Upon receipt of the payment required by Sec. 2720.3 of this subpart, 
if any is required, the authorized officer shall issue the necessary 
document conveying to the applicant the mineral interests of the United 
States in the land covered by the application.


<R05>
Sec. 2720.5  Appeals.

    An applicant adversely affected by a decision of the authorized 
officer made pursuant to the provisions of this subpart shall have a 
right of appeal pursuant to part 4 of this title. Decisions of the 
authorized officer under this subpart shall be subject to reversal only 
if found to be arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion or 
otherwise not in accordance with law.

<R05>
Sec. 2740.0-6  Policy.

    (a) To assure development of public lands in accordance with a 
development plan and compliance with an approved management plan, the 
authorized officer may require that public lands first be leased under 
the provisions of subpart 2912 of this title for a period of time prior 
to issuance of a patent, except for conveyances under subpart 2743 of 
this title.
    (b) Municipal corporations may not secure public lands under this

inadvertence. Conduct which is otherwise regarded as being knowing or 
willful does not become innocent through the belief that the conduct is

of the right-of-way grant.
    (bb) Tenant means an occupant who rents space in a facility and

                               Use Permits


<R05>
Sec. 2801.1  Nature of interest.


<R05>
Sec. 2801.1-1  Nature of right-of-way interest.

    (a) All rights in public lands subject to a right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit not expressly granted are retained and may be 
exercised by the United States. These rights include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) A continuing right of access onto the public lands covered by 
the right-of-way grant or temporary use permit, and upon reasonable 
notice to the holder, access and entry to any facility constructed on 
the right-of-way or permit area:
    (2) The right to require common use of the right-of-way, and the 
right to authorize use of the right-of-way for compatible uses 
(including the subsurface and air space).
    (b) A right-of-way grant or temporary use permit may be used only 
for the purposes authorized. The holder may allow others to use the land 
as his/her agent in exercising the rights granted.
    (c) All right-of-way grants and temporary use permits shall be 
issued subject to valid existing rights.
    (d) A right-of-way grant or temporary use permit shall not give or 
authorize the holder to take from the public lands any mineral or 
vegetative

[[Page 238]]

material, including timber, without securing authorization under the 
Materials Act (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and paying in advance the fair 
market value of the material cut, removed, used, or destroyed. However, 
common varieties of stone and soil necessarily removed in the 
construction of a project may be used elsewhere along the same right-of-
way or permit area in the construction of the project without additional 
authorization and payment. The holder shall be allowed in the 
performance of normal maintenance to do minor trimming, pruning and 
clearing of vegetative material within the right-of-way or permit area 
and around facilities constructed thereon without additional 
authorization and payments. At his discretion and when it is in the 
public interest, the authorized officer may in lieu of requiring an 
advance payment for any mineral or vegetative materials, including 
timber, cut or excavated, require the holder to stockpile or stack the 
material as designated locations for later disposal by the United 
States.
    (e) A holder of a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit may 
assign a grant or permit to another, provided the holder obtains the 
written approval of the authorized officer.
    (f) The holder of a right-of-way grant may authorize other parties 
to use a facility constructed, except for roads, on the right-of-way 
with the prior written consent of the authorized officer and charge for 
such use. In any such arrangement, the holder shall continue to be 
responsible for compliance with all conditions of the grant. This 
paragraph does not limit in any way the authority of the authorized 
officer to issue additional right-of-way grants or temporary use permits 
for compatible uses on or adjacent to the right-of-way, nor does it 
authorize the holder to impose charges for the use of lands made subject 
to such additional right-of-way grants or temporary use permits. 
However, the holder of a right-of-way grant for communication purposes 
may authorize other parties to use a facility, without prior written 
consent of the authorized officer, if so provided by terms and 
conditions of the grant.
    (g) Each right-of-way grant or temporary use permit shall describe 
the public lands to be used or occupied and the grant or permit shall be 
limited to those lands which the authorized officer determines:
    (1) Will be occupied by the facilities authorized;
    (2) To be necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, 
and termination of the authorized facilities;
    (3) To be necessary to protect the public health and safety; and
    (4) Will do no unnecessary damage to the environment.
    (h) Each grant or permit shall specify its term. The term of the 
grant shall be limited to a reasonable period. A reasonable period for a 
right-of-way grant may range from a month to a year or a term of years 
to perpetuity. The term for a temporary use shall not exceed 3 years. In 
determining the period for any specific grant or permit, the authorized 
officer shall provide for a term necessary to accomplish the purpose of 
the authorization. Factors to be considered by the authorized officer 
for the purpose of establishing an equitable term pertaining to the use 
include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Public purpose served;
    (2) Cost and useful life of the facility; and
    (3) Time limitations imposed by required licenses or permits that 
the holder is required to secure from other Federal or State agencies.
    (i) Each grant issued for a term of 20 years or more shall contain a 
provision requiring periodic review of the grant at the end of the 
twentieth year and at regular intervals thereafter not to exceed 10 
years.
    (j) Each grant shall have a provision stating whether it is 
renewable or not and if renewable, the terms and conditions applicable 
to the renewal.
    (k) Each grant shall not only comply with the regulations of this 
part, but also, comply with the provisions of any other applicable law 
and implementing regulations as appropriate.

that a right-of-way for an access road is or shall be needed by the 
United States across lands directly or indirectly owned or controlled by 
an applicant for a right-of-way grant, he or she shall, if it is 
determined to be in the public interest, require the applicant, as a 
condition to receiving a right-of-way grant, to grant the United States 
an equivalent right-of-way that is adequate in duration and rights.


<R05>
Sec. 2801.2  Terms and conditions of interest granted.

fires.
    (b) All right-of-way grants and temporary use permits issued, 
renewed, amended or assigned under these regulations shall contain such

officer regarding extent, duration, survey, location, construction, 
operation, maintenance, use and termination. The authorized officer 
shall impose stipulations which shall include, but shall not be limited 
to:
    (1) Requirements for restoration, revegetation and curtailment of 
erosion of the surface of the land, or any other rehabilitation measure 
determined necessary;

<R05>
Sec. 2801.3  Unauthorized use, occupancy, or development.

    (a) Any use, occupancy, or development of the public lands that 
requires a right-of-way, temporary use permit, or other authorization 
pursuant to the regulations of that part and that has not been so 
authorized, or that is beyond the scope and specific limitations of such 
an authorization, or that causes unnecessary or undue degradation, is 
prohibited and shall constitute a trespass as defined in Sec. 2800.0-5.

[[Page 240]]

    (b) Anyone determined by the authorized officer to be in violation 
of paragraph (a) of this section shall be notified in writing of such 
trespass and shall be liable to the United States for:

    (2) For repeated nonwillful or willful trespass--an amount that is 2 
times the rental value and for roads, an amount 2 times the charges for 
road use, amortization and maintenance which have accrued since the 
inception of the trespass.
    (d) In no event shall settlement for trespass computed pursuant to 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section be less than the processing fee

granted until there has been compliance with the provisions of 
Sec. 9239.7-1 of this title.
    (f) Any person adversely affected by a decision of the authorized 
officer issued under this section may appeal that decision under the 
provisions of part 4 of this title.
    (g) In addition to the civil penalties provided for in this part, 
any person who knowingly and willfully violates the provisions of

Sec. 2802.4  Application processing.

    (a) The authorized officer shall acknowledge, in writing, receipt of 
the application and initial cost reimbursement payment required by 
subpart 2808 of this title. An application may be denied if the 
authorized officer determines that:
    (1) The proposed right-of-way or permit would be inconsistent with 
the purpose for which the public lands are managed;
    (2) That the proposed right-of-way or permit would not be in the 
public interest;
    (3) The applicant is not qualified;
    (4) The right-of-way or permit would otherwise be inconsistent with 
the act or other applicable laws; or
    (5) The applicant does not or cannot demonstrate that he/she has the 
technical or financial capacity.
    (b) Upon receipt of the acknowledgement, the applicant may continue 
his or her occupancy of the public land pursuant to Sec. 2802.1(d) of 
this title to continue to gather data necessary to perfect the 
application. However, if the applicant finds or the authorized officer 
determines that surface disturbing activities will occur in gathering 
the necessary data to perfect the application, the applicant shall file 
an application for a temporary use permit prior to entering into such 
activities on the public land.
    (c) The authorized officer may require the applicant for a right-of-
way grant to submit such additional information as he deems necessary 
for review of the application. All requests for additional information 
shall be in writing. Where the authorized officer determines that the 
information supplied by the applicant is incomplete or does not conform 
to the act or these regulations, the authorized officer shall notify the 
applicant of these deficiencies and afford the applicant an opportunity 
to file a correction. Where a deficiency notice has not been adequately 
complied with, the authorized officer may reject the application or 
notify

[[Page 243]]

the applicant of the continuing deficiency and afford the applicant an 
opportunity to file a correction.
    (d) Prior to issuing a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit, 
the authorized officer shall:
    (1) Complete an environmental analysis in accordance with the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969;
    (2) Determine compliance of the applicant's proposed plans with 
applicable Federal and State laws;
    (3) Consult with all other Federal, State, and local agencies having 
an interest, as appropriate; and
    (4) Take any other action necessary to fully evaluate and make a 
decision to approve or deny the application and prescribe suitable terms 
and conditions for the grant or permit.
    (e) The authorized officer may hold public meetings on an 
application for a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit if he 
determines that such meetings are appropriate and that sufficient public 
interest exists to warrant the time and expense of such meetings. Notice 
of public meetings shall be published in the Federal Register or in 
local newspapers or in both.
    (f) A right-of-way grant or temporary use permit need not conform to 
the applicant's proposal, but may contain such modifications, terms, 
stipulations or conditions, including changes in route or site location 
on public lands, as the authorized officer determines to be appropriate.
    (g) No right-of-way grant or temporary use permit shall be in effect 
until the applicant has accepted, in writing, the terms and conditions 
of the grant or permit. Written acceptance shall constitute an agreement 
between the applicant and the United States that, in consideration of 
the right to use public lands, the applicant shall comply with all terms 
and conditions contained in the authorization and the provisions of 
applicable laws and regulations.
    (h) The authorized officer may include in his/her decision to issue 
a grant a provision that shall be included in a right-of-way grant 
requiring that no construction on or use of the right-of-way shall occur 
until a detailed construction, operation, rehabilitation and 
environmental protection plan has been submitted to and approved by the 
authorized officer. This requirement may be imposed for all or any part 
of the right-of-way.

Sec. 2802.5  Special application procedures.

    (a) An applicant filing for a right-of-way within 4 years from the 
effective date of this subpart for an unauthorized right-of-way that 
existed on public land prior to October 21, 1976, is not:
    (1) Required to reimburse the United States for the processing, 
monitoring or other costs provided for in subpart 2808 of this title.
    (2) Required to pay rental fees for the period of unauthorized land 
use.
    (b) In order to facilitate management of the public lands, any 
person or State or local government which has constructed public 
highways under the authority of R. S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932, repealed 
October 21, 1976) may file a map showing the location of such public 
highways with the authorized officer. Maps filed under this paragraph 
shall be in sufficient detail to show the location of the R. S. 2477 
highway(s) on public lands in relation to State or county highway(s) or 
road(s) in the vicinity. The submission of such maps showing the 
location of R. S. 2477 highway(s) on public lands shall not be 
conclusive evidence as to their existence. Similiarly, a failure to show 
the location of R. S. 2477 highway(s) on any map shall not preclude a 
later finding as to their existence.

business management principles and, so far as practicable and feasible, 
using comparable commercial practices. Annual rent billing periods shall 
be set or adjusted to coincide with the calendar year (January 1 through 
December 31) by proration on the basis of 12 months; the initial month 
shall not be counted for right-of-way grants or temporary use permits 
having an anniversary date of the 15th or later in the month and the 
terminal month shall not be counted if the termination date is the 14th 
or earlier in the month. Rental shall be determined in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section; Provided, however, That 
in those instances where the annual payment is $100 or less, the 
authorized officer may require an advance lump sum payment for 5 years.
    (b)(1) No rental shall be collected where:
    (i) The holder is a Federal, State, or local government, or agency 
or instrumentality thereof, except parties who are using the space for 
commercial purposes, and municipal utilities and cooperatives whose 
principal source of revenue is customer charges:
    (ii) The right-of-way was issued pursuant to a statute that did not 
or does not require the payment of rental; or
    (iii) The facilities constructed on a site or linear right-of-way 
are or were financed in whole or in part under the Rural Electrification 
Act of 1936, as amended, or are extensions from such Rural 
Electrification Act financed facilities.
    (2) The authorized officer may reduce or waive the rental payment 
under the following instances:
    (i) The holder is a nonprofit corporation or association which is 
not controlled by or is not a subsidiary of a profit making corporation 
or business enterprise;
    (ii) The holder provides without charge, or at reduced rates, a 
valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary;
    (iii) The holder holds an outstanding permit, lease, license or 
contract for which the United States is already receiving compensation, 
except under an oil and gas lease where the lessee is required to secure 
a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit under part 2880 of this 
title; and:
    (A) Needs a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit within the 
exterior boundaries of the permit, lease, license or contract area; or
    (B) Needs a right-of-way across the public lands outside the permit, 
lease, license or contract area in order to reach said area;
    (iv) With the concurrence of the State Director, the authorized 
officer, after consultation with an applicant/holder, determines that 
the requirement to pay the full rental will cause undue hardship on the 
holder/applicant and that it is in the public interest to reduce or 
waive said rental. In order to complete such consultation, the State 
Director may require the applicant/holder to submit data, information 
and other written material in support of a proposed finding that the 
right-of-way grant or temporary use permit qualifies for a reduction or 
waiver of rental; and
    (v) A right-of-way involves a cost share road or reciprocal right-
of-way agreement not subject to part 2812 of this title. Any fair market 
value rental required to be paid under this paragraph (b)(2)(v) shall be 
determined by the proportion of use.
    (c)(1)(i) Except for those linear right-of-way grants or temporary 
use permits that the authorized officer determines under paragraph 
(c)(1)(v) of this section to require an individual appraisal, an 
applicant shall, prior to the issuance of a linear right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit, submit an annual rental payment in advance for 
such right-of-way grant or temporary use permit in accordance with the 
following schedule:

(The values are based on zone value  x  impact adjustment  x  interest
  rate (6.41--1-year Treasury Securities ``Constant Maturity'' rate for

  paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.)


A per acre rental schedule by State, County, and type of linear right-
of-way use, which will be updated annually, is available from any Bureau 
State or District office or may be obtained by writing: Director (330), 
Bureau of Land Management, Room 3660, Main Interior Bldg., 1800 C Street 
NW., Washington, DC 20240.
    (ii) The schedule will be adjusted annually by multiplying the 
current year's rental per acre by the annual change, second quarter to 
the second quarter (June 30 to June 30), in the Gross National Product 
Implicit Price Deflator Index as published in the Survey of Current 
Business of the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.
    (iii) At such times as the cumulative change in the index used in 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section exceeds 30 percent or the change in 
the 3-year average of the 1-year interest rate exceeds plus or minus 50 
percent, the zones and rental per acre figures shall be reviewed to 
determine whether market and business practices have differed 
sufficiently from the index to warrant a revision in the base zones and 
rental per acre figures. Measurements shall be taken at the end of the 
second quarter (June 30) of the year beginning with calendar year 1986. 
The initial bases (June 30, 1986) for these two indexes are: Gross 
National Product Price Implicit Price Deflator Index was 114.0 and the 
3-year average of the 1-year Treasury interest rate was 8.86%.
    (iv) Rental for the ensuing calendar year for any single right-of-
way grant or temporary use permit is the rental per acre from the 
current schedule multiplied by the number of acres embraced in the grant 
or permit, unless such rental is reduced or waived as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (v) The authorized officer will use the linear rental schedule 
unless the authorized officer determines:
    (A) A substantial segment or area within the right-of-way exceeds 
the zone(s) value by a factor of 10; and
    (B) In the judgment of the authorized officer, the expected 
valuation is sufficient to warrant a separate appraisal.

Once the rental for a right-of-way grant has been determined by use of 
the rental schedule, the provisions of this subparagraph shall not be 
used as a basis for removing it from the schedule.

    (2)(i) Existing linear right-of-way grants and temporary use permits 
may be made subject to the schedule provided by this paragraph upon 
reasonable notice to the holder.
    (ii) Where the new annual rental for linear rights-of-way exceeds 
$100 and is more than a 100 percent increase over the current rental, 
the amount of increase in excess of the 100 percent increase shall be 
phased in by equal increments, plus the annual adjustment, over a 3 year 
period.
    (d) The annual rental payment for communication uses listed in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section is based on rental payment schedules. 
The rental schedules apply to right-of-way holders and tenants 
authorized to operate and maintain communication facilities on public 
lands. They do not apply to holders who are public telecommunications 
service operators providing public television or radio broadcast 
services granted a waiver under Sec. 2803.1-2(b)(2)(i). Nor do they 
apply to communication site uses, facilities, or devices located 
exclusively within the exterior boundaries of an oil and gas lease and 
directly associated with the operations of the oil and gas lease 
(subpart 2880).
    (1) The schedules are applicable to communication uses that provide 
the following services:

FCC-licensed facilities used to broadcast UHF and VHF audio and video 
signals for general public reception, and communication equipment 
directly related to the operation, maintenance, and monitoring of the 
use. This category does not include holders licensed by the FCC to 
operate Low Power Television (LPTV) or rebroadcast devices such as 
translators, or transmitting devices such as microwave relays serving 
broadcast translators.
    (ii) AM and FM radio broadcast includes rights-of-way that contain 
FCC-licensed facilities primarily used to broadcast amplitude modulation 
(AM) or frequency modulation (FM) audio signals for general public 
reception, and communication equipment directly related to the 
operation, maintenance, and monitoring of the use. This category is not 
applicable to holders licensed by the FCC as a low-power FM radio. This 
category also does not include rebroadcast devices such as translators, 
boosters, or microwave relays serving broadcast translators.
    (iii) The broadcast translator and low power television category 
includes FCC-licensed translators and low power television, low power FM 
radio, and communication equipment directly related to the operation, 
maintenance, or monitoring of the use. Microwave facilities used in 
conjunction with LPTV and broadcast translators are included in this 
category.
    (iv) Cable television includes FCC-licensed facilities that transmit 
video programming to multiple subscribers in a community over a wired or 
wireless network, and communication equipment directly related to the 
operation, maintenance, or monitoring of the use. This category does not 
include rebroadcast devices that retransmit television signals of one or 
more television broadcast stations, personal or internal antenna systems 
such as private systems serving hotels or residences.
    (v) Commercial mobile radio service/facility manager includes FCC-
licensed commercial mobile radio facilities or their holders providing 
mobile communication service to individual customers, and communication 
equipment directly related to the operation, maintenance, or monitoring 
of the use. Such services generally include two-way voice and paging 
services such as community repeaters, trunked radio (specialized mobile 
radio), two-way radio dispatch, public switched network (telephone/data) 
interconnect service, microwave communications link equipment. Some 
holders in this category may not hold FCC licenses or operate 
communication equipment, but may lease building, tower, and related 
facility space to a variety of tenants as a part of their business 
enterprise, and may act as facility managers.
    (vi) Private Mobile Radio includes FCC-licensed private mobile radio 
systems primarily used by a single entity for mobile internal 
communications, and communication equipment directly related to the 
operation, maintenance, or monitoring of the use. This use is not sold

activities, or other organizational communication needs. Services 
generally include private local radio dispatch, private paging services, 
and ancillary microwave communications equipment for the control of the 
mobile facilities.
    (vii) Cellular telephone includes FCC-licensed systems and related 
technologies used for mobile communications using a combination of radio 
and telephone switching technology, and providing public switched 
network services to fixed and mobile users within a defined geographic 
area. The system consists of cell sites containing transmitting and 
receiving antennas, cellular base station radio, telephone equipment, 
and often microwave communications link equipment, and communication 
equipment directly related to the maintenance and monitoring of the use.
    (viii) Microwave includes FCC-licensed facilities used for long-line 
intrastate and interstate public telephone, television, information, and 
data transmissions, or used by pipeline and power companies, railroads, 
and land resource management companies in support of the holder's

equipment directly related to the operation, maintenance, or monitoring 
of the use.
    (ix) Other communication uses include holders of FCC-licensed 
private communication uses such as amateur radio, personal/private 
receive-only antennas, passive reflectors, natural resource and 
environmental monitoring equipment, and other small, low-power devices 
used to monitor or control remote activities.
    (2)(i) The rental schedules will be adjusted annually based on the 
U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers 
(CPI-U, U.S. City Average, published in July of each year), and Ranally 
Metro Area population rankings. Annual adjustments based on the CPI-U 
will be limited to no more than 5 percent. The rental schedule will be 
reviewed for possible update no later than 10 years after December 13, 
1995, and at least every 10 years thereafter, to ensure that the 
schedule reflects fair market value.
    (ii) Rights-of-way may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis 10 years 
after issuance or beginning [10 years and 30 days after the date of 
publication], whichever is later, and no more often than every 5 years 
thereafter, on holder request, to determine whether rents are 
appropriate.
    (3) Rent is based on the actual users in the facility. For a 
facility with a single user, the base rent is the schedule rent for the 
use. Base rent for authorizations that include more than one user will 
be based on the use in the facility with the highest rent as shown on 
the schedule. An additional amount will be assessed based on 25 percent 
of the schedule rent for all other users. (A facility manager is not 
considered a separate use for purposes of calculating the additional 
amount for tenants in the facility.)
    (4) Increases in base rental payments over 1996 levels in excess of 
$1,000 will be phased in over a 5-year period. In 1997, the rental 
payment will be the 1996 rental, plus $1,000. The amount exceeding 
$1,000 will be divided into 4 equal installments, and beginning in 1998 
the installment, plus the annual adjustment in the total rent, will be 
added to the previous year's rent.
    (5) Annual rental payments will be calculated and provided to the 
holder by December 31 for each ensuing calendar year based on the 
schedules published from time to time as necessary in the Federal 
Register.
    (6) Also, the right-of-way holder must submit a certified statement 
by October 15 of each year listing tenants in the facility and the 
category of use for each tenant as of September 30 of that year, and pay 
25 percent of the schedule rent for the category of use. Tenants 
occupying space in the facility under terms of the holder's right-of-way 
authorization will not be required to have a separate BLM authorization.
    (7) Other methods may be used to set rental payments for 
communication uses when the authorized officer determines one of the 
following:
    (i) The holder is eligible for a waiver or reduction in rent in 
accordance with Sec. 2803.1-2(b)(2);
    (ii) Payment of the rent will cause undue hardship under 
Sec. 2803.1-2(b)(2)(iv);
    (iii) The original right-of-way authorization has been or will be 
issued pursuant to a competitive bidding process;
    (iv) The State Director concurs in a determination made by the 
authorized officer that the expected rent exceeds the schedule rent by 5 
times, or the communication site serves a population of 1 million or 
more and the expected rent for the communication use is more than 
$10,000 above the schedule rent; or
    (v) The communication facilities are ancillary to and authorized 
under a right-of-way grant for a linear facility. In such cases, rent 
for the associated communication facilities is to be determined in 
accordance with the linear fee schedule.
    (e)(1) The rental for right-of-way grants and temporary use permits 
not covered by the right-of-way schedule in Sec. 2803.1-2(d)(5) will be 
determined by the authorized officer and paid annually in advance. 
Rental for communication site rights-of-way not covered by the schedule, 
except those issued pursuant to Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act 
(30 U.S.C. 185), will be based on comparative market surveys, 
appraisals, or other reasonable methods. All

[[Page 248]]

such rental determinations shall be documented, supported, and approved 
by the authorized officer. Where the authorized officer determines that 
a competitive interest exists for site type right-of-way grants such as 
for wind farms, communication sites, etc., rental may be determined 
through competitive bidding procedures set out in Sec. 2803.1-3.
    (2) To expedite the processing of any grant or permit covered by 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the authorized officer may estimate 
rental and collect a deposit in advance with the agreement that upon 
completion of a rental value determination, the advance deposit will be 
adjusted according to the final fair market rental value determination.
    (f) Decisions on rental determinations are subject to appeal under 
subpart 2804 of this title.
    (g) Upon the holder's written request, rentals may be prepaid for 5 
years in advance.
    (h) If the rental required by this section is not paid when due, and 
such default for nonpayment continues for 30 days after notice, action 
may be taken to terminate the right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit. After default has occurred, no structures, buildings or other 
equipment may be removed from the subservient lands except upon written 
permission from the authorized officer.

Sec. 2803.1-3  Competitive bidding.

    (a) The authorized officer may identify and offer public lands for 
competitive right-of-way use either on his/her own motion or as a result 
of nomination by the public. Competitive bidding shall be used only for 
site-type right-of-way grants such as wind farms and communication 
sites. The authorized officer shall give public notice of such decision 
through publication of a notice of realty action as provided in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The decision to offer public lands for 
competitive right-of-way use shall conform to the requirements of the 
Bureau's land use planning process. The authorized officer shall not 
offer public lands for competitive right-of-way use where equities such 
as prior or related use of said lands warrant issuance of a 
noncompetitive right-of-way grant(s).
    (b) A right-of-way grant issued pursuant to a competitive offer 
shall be awarded on the basis of the public benefit to be provided, the 
financial and technical capability of the bidder to undertake the 
project and the bid offer. Each bid shall be accompanied by the 
information required by the notice of realty action and a statement over 
the signature of the bidder or anyone authorized to sign for the bidder 
that he/she is in compliance with the requirements of the law and these 
regulations. A bid of less than the fair market rental value of the 
lands offered shall not be considered.
    (c) The offering of public lands for right-of-way use under 
competitive bidding procedures shall be conducted in accordance with the 
following:
    (1)(i) A notice of realty action indicating the availability of 
public lands for competitive right-of-way offering shall be published in 
the Federal Register and at least once a week for 3 consecutive weeks in 
a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the public lands 
are situated or in such other publication as the authorized officer may 
determine. The successful qualified bidder shall, prior to the issuance 
of the right-of-way grant, pay his/her proportionate share of the total 
cost of publication.
    (ii) The notice of realty action shall include the use proposed for 
the public lands and the time, date and place of the offering, including 
a description of the lands being offered, terms and conditions of the 
grant(s), rates, bidding requirements, payment required, where bid forms 
may be obtained, the form in which the bids shall be submitted and any 
other information or requirements determined appropriate by the 
authorized officer.
    (2) Bids may be made either by a principal or duly qualified agent.
    (3) All sealed bids shall be opened at the time and date specified 
in the notice of realty action, but no bids shall be accepted or 
rejected at that time. The right to reject any and all bids is reserved. 
Only those bids received by the close of business on the day prior

[[Page 249]]

to the bid opening or at such other time stated in the notice of realty 
action and made for at least the minimum acceptable bid shall be 
considered. Each bid shall be accompanied by U.S. currency or certified 
check, postal money order, bank draft or cashier's check payable in U.S. 
currency and made payable to the Department of the Interior--Bureau of 
Land Management for not less than one-fifth of the amount of the bid, 
and shall be enclosed in a sealed envelope which shall be marked as 
prescribed in the notice of realty action. If 2 or more envelopes 
containing valid bids of the same amount are received, the determination 
of which is to be considered the highest bid shall be by drawing unless 
another method is specified in the notice of realty action. The drawing 
shall be held by the authorized officer immediately following the 
opening of the sealed bids.
    (4) In the event the authorized officer rejects the highest 
qualified bid or releases the bidder from such bid, the authorized 
officer shall determine whether the public lands involved in the 
offering shall be offered to the next highest bidder, withdrawn from the 
market or reoffered.
    (5) If the highest qualified bid is accepted by the authorized 
officer, the grant form(s) shall be forwarded to the qualifying bidder 
for signing. The signed grant form(s) with the payment of the balance of 
the first year's rental and the publication costs shall be returned 
within 30 days of its receipt by the highest qualified bidder and shall 
qualify as acceptance of the right-of-way grant(s).
    (6) If the successful qualified bidder fails to execute the grant 
form(s) and pay the balance of the rental payment and the costs of 
publication within the allowed time, or otherwise fails to comply with 
the regulations of this subpart, the one-fifth remittance accompanying 
the bid shall be forfeited.

Sec. 2803.1-4  Bonding.

    The authorized officer may require the holder of a right-of-way 
grant or temporary use permit to furnish a bond or other security 
satisfactory to him, to secure the obligations imposed by the grant or 
permit and applicable laws and regulations.

Sec. 2803.1-5  Liability.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, each holder 
shall be fully liable to the United States for any damage or injury 
incurred by the United States in connection with the use and occupancy 
of the right-of-way or permit area by the holder.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, holders 
shall be held to a standard of strict liability for any activity or 
facility within a right-of-way or permit area which the authorized 
officer determines, in his discretion, presents a foreseeable hazard or 
risk of damage or injury to the United States. The activities and 
facilities to which such standards shall apply shall be specified in the 
right-of-way grant or temporary use permit. Strict liability shall not 
be imposed for damage or injury resulting primarily from an act of war, 
an Act of God or the negligence of the United States. To the extent 
consistent with other laws, strict liability shall extend to costs 
incurred by the United States for control and abatement of conditions, 
such as fire or oil spills, which threaten lives, property or the 
environment, regardless of whether the threat occurs on areas that are 
under Federal jurisdiction. Stipulations in right-of-way grants and 
temporary use permits imposing strict liability shall specify a maximum 
limitation on damages which, in the judgment of the authorized officer, 
is commensurate with the foreseeable risks or hazards presented. The 
maximum limitation shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any one event, and 
any liability in excess of such amount shall be determined by the 
ordinary rules of negligence of the jurisdiction in which the damage or 
injury occurred.
    (c) In any case where strict liability is imposed and the damage or 
injury was caused by a third party, the rules of subrogation shall apply 
in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the damage or 
injury occurred.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, holders 
shall be fully liable for injuries or damages to third

[[Page 250]]

parties resulting from activities or facilities on lands under Federal 
jurisdiction in which the damage or injury occurred.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, holders 
shall fully indemnify or hold harmless the United States for liability, 
damage or claims arising in connection with the holder's use and 
occupancy of rights-of-way or permit areas.
    (f) If a holder is a State or local government, or agency or 
instrumentality thereof, it shall be liable to the fullest extent its 
laws allow at the time it is granted a right-of-way grant or temporary 
use permit. To the extent such a holder does not have the power to 
assume liability, it shall be required to repair damages or make 
restitution to the fullest extent of its powers at the time of any 
damage or injury.
    (g) All owners of any interest in, and all affiliates or 
subsidiaries of any holder of a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit, except for corporate stockholders, shall be jointly and 
severally liable to the United States in the event that a claim cannot 
be satisfied by the holder.
    (h) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the 
provision in this section for a remedy is not intended to limit or 
exclude any other remedy.
    (i) If the right-of-way grant or temporary use permit is issued to 
more than one holder, each shall be jointly and severally liable under 
this section.

Sec. 2803.2  Holder activity.

    (a) If a notice to proceed requirement has been included in the 
grant or permit, the holder shall not initiate construction, occupancy 
or use until the authorized officer issues a notice to proceed.
    (b) Any substantial deviation in location or authorized use by the 
holder during construction, operation or maintenance shall be made only 
with prior approval of the authorized officer under Sec. 2803.6-1 of 
this title for the purposes of this paragraph, substantial deviation 
means:
    (1) With respect to location, the holder has constructed the 
authorized facility outside the prescribed boundaries of the right-of-
way authorized by the instant grant or permit.
    (2) With respect to use, the holder has changed or modified the 
authorized use by adding equipment, overhead or underground lines, 
pipelines, structures or other facilities not authorized in the instant 
grant or permit.
    (c) The holder shall notify the authorized officer of any change in 
status subsequent to the application or issuance of the right-of-way 
grant or temporary use permit. Such changes include, but are not limited 
to, legal mailing address, financial condition, business or corporate 
status. When requested by the authorized officer, the holder shall 
update and/or attest to the accuracy of any information previously 
submitted.
    (d) If required by the terms of the right-of-way grant or temporary 
use permit, the holder shall, subsequent to construction and prior to 
commencing operations, submit to the authorized officer a certification 
of construction, verifying that the facility has been constructed and 
tested in accordance with terms of the right-of-way grant or temporary 
use permit, and in compliance with any required plans and 
specifications, and applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 2803.3  Immediate temporary suspension of activities.

    (a) If the authorized officer determines that an immediate temporary 
suspension of activities within a right-of-way or permit area for 
violation of the terms and conditions of the right-of-way authorization 
is necessary to protect public health or safety or the environment, he/
she may promptly abate such activities prior to an administrative 
proceeding.
    (b) The authorized officer may give an immediate temporary 
suspension order orally or in writing at the site of the activity to the 
holder or a contractor or subcontractor of the holder, or to any 
representative, agent, employee or contractor of the holder, and the 
suspended activity shall cease at that time. As soon as practicable, the 
authorized officer shall confirm an oral order by a written notice to 
the holder

[[Page 251]]

addressed to the holder or the holder's designated agent.
    (c) An order of immediate temporary suspension of activities shall 
remain effective until the authorized officer issues an order permitting 
resumption of activities.
    (d) Any time after an order of immediate temporary suspension has 
been issued, the holder may file with the authorized officer a request 
for permission to resume. The request shall be in writing and shall 
contain a statement of the facts supporting the request.
    (e) The authorized officer may render an order to either grant or 
deny the request to resume within 5 working days of the date the request 
is filed. If the authorized officer does not render an order on the 
request within 5 working days, the request shall be considered denied, 
and the holder shall have the same right to appeal the denial as if a 
final order denying the request had been issued by the authorized 
officer.


<R05>
Sec. 2803.4  Suspension and termination of right-of-way authorizations.

    (a) If the right-of-way grant or temporary use permit provides by 
its terms that it shall terminate on the occurrence of a fixed or 
agreed-upon condition, event, or time, the right-of-way authorization 
shall thereupon automatically terminate by operation of law, unless some 
other procedure is specified in the right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit. The authorized officer may terminate a right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit when the holder requests or consents to its 
termination in writing.
    (b) The authorized officer may suspend or terminate a right-of-way 
grant or temporary use permit if he determines that the holder has 
failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any terms, 
conditions or stipulations of the right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit or has abandoned the right-of-way.
    (c) Failure of the holder of a right-of-way grant to use the right-
of-way for the purpose for which the authorization was issued for any 
continuous five-year period shall constitute a presumption of 
abandonment. The holder may rebut the presumption by proving that his 
failure to use the right-of-way was due to circumstances not within the 
holder's control.
    (d) Before suspending or terminating a right-of-way grant pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section, the authorized officer shall give the 
holder written notice that such action is contemplated and the grounds 
therefor and shall allow the holder a reasonable opportunity to cure 
such noncompliance.
    (e) In the case of a right-of-way grant that is under its terms an 
easement, the authorized officer shall give written notice to the holder 
of the suspension or termination and shall refer the matter to the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals for a hearing before an Administrative 
Law Judge pursuant to 43 CFR part 4. If the Administrative Law Judge 
determines that grounds for suspension or termination exist and such 
action is justified, the authorized officer shall suspend or terminate 
the right-of-way grant.

Sec. 2803.4-1  Disposition of improvements upon terminations.

    Within a reasonable time after termination, revocation or 
cancellation of a right-of-way grant, the holder shall, unless directed 
otherwise in writing by the authorized officer, remove such structures 
and improvements and shall restore the site to a condition satisfactory 
to the authorized officer. If the holder fails to remove all such 
structures or improvements within a reasonable period, as determined by 
the authorized officer, they shall become the property of the United 
States, but the holder shall remain liable for the cost of removal of 
the structures and improvements and for restoration of the site.

Sec. 2803.5  Change in Federal jurisdiction or disposal of lands.

    (a) Where a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit administered 
under these regulations traverses public lands that are transferred to 
another Federal agency, administration of the right-of-way shall, at the 
discretion of the authorized officer, be assigned to the acquiring 
agency unless such assignment would diminish the rights of the holder.

[[Page 252]]

    (b) Where a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit traverses 
public lands that are transferred out of Federal ownership, the transfer 
of the land shall, at the discretion of the authorized officer, include 
an assignment of the right-of-way, be made subject to the right-of-way, 
or the United States may reserve unto itself the land encumbered by the 
right-of-way.

<R05>
Sec. 2803.6-1  Amendments.

    (a) Any substantial deviation in location or use as set forth in 
Sec. 2803.2(b) of this title shall require the holder of a grant or

application and the filing are the same and shall be accomplished in the 
manner as set forth in subpart 2802 of this title.
    (b) Holders of right-of-way grants issued before October 21, 1976, 
who find it necessary to amend their grants shall comply with paragraph

grant shall be issued. To the fullest extent possible, and when in the 
public interest as determined from current land use plans and other 
management decisions, the amended grant shall contain the same terms and 
conditions set forth in the original grant with respect to annual rent, 
duration and nature of interest.

the amended application by the authorized officer, an amended right-of-
way grant shall be issued within 6 months of date of acceptance of the 
application. The date of acceptance of the application for the purpose 
of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 2802.4(a) 
of this title.
    (b) Notwithstanding the regulations of this part, the authorized 
officer may include in the amended grant the same terms and conditions 
of the original grant with respect to the payment of annual rental, 
duration, and nature of interest if he/she finds them to be in the 
public interest and the lands involved are not within an incorporated 
community and are of approximately equal value.

temporary use permit under the regulations of this part. In addition, 
the assignment shall be supported by a stipulation that the assignee 
agrees to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the 
grant to be assigned. No assignment shall be recognized unless and until 
it is approved in writing by the authorized officer. The authorized 
officer may, at the time of approval of the assignment, modify or add 
bonding requirements.

Sec. 2803.6-5  Renewals of right-of-way grants and temporary use permits.

    (a) When a grant provides that it may be renewed, the authorized 
officer shall renew the grant so long as the project or facility is 
still being used for purposes authorized in the original grant and is 
being operated and maintained in accordance with all the provisions of 
the grant and pursuant to the regulations of this title.

           Subpart 2806--Designation of Right-of-Way Corridors


<R05>
Sec. 2806.1  Corridor designation.

    (a) The authorized officer may, based upon his/her motion or receipt 
of an application, designate right-of-way corridors across any public 
lands in order to minimize adverse environmental impacts and the 
proliferation of separate rights-of-way. The designation of corridors 
shall not preclude the granting of separate rights-of-way over, upon, 
under or through the public lands where the authorized officer 
determines that confinement to a corridor is not appropriate.
    (b) Any existing transportation and utility corridor that is capable 
of accommodating an additional compatible right-of-way may be designated 
as a right-of-way corridor by the authorized officer without further 
review as required in Sec. 2806.2 of this title. Subsequent right-of-way 
grants shall, to the extent practical and as determined by the 
authorized officer, be confined to designated corridors, however, the 
designation of a right-of-way corridor is not a commitment by the 
authorized officer to issue right-of-way grants within the corridor. All 
applications for right-of-way grants, including those within designated 
corridors, are subject to the procedure for approval set forth in 
subpart 2802 of this title.

and State laws.
    (b) Environmental impacts on natural resources including soil, air, 
water, fish, wildlife, vegetation and on cultural resources.

placed therein due to geology, hydrology, meteorology, soil or land 
forms.
    (d) Economic efficiency of placing a right-of-way within a corridor, 
taking into consideration costs of construction, operation and 
maintenance, and costs of modifying or relocating existing facilities in 
a proposed corridor.
    (e) National security risks.
    (f) Potential health and safety hazards to the public lands users 
and the general public due to materials or activities within the right-
of-way corridor.
    (g) Engineering and technological compatibility of proposed and 
existing facilities.

Sec. 2808.3  Fees and payments.


<R05>

    (a) The fee by category for processing an application for a right-
of-way or temporary use permit is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Category                               Fee
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I..............................................................     $125
II.............................................................      300
III............................................................      550
IV.............................................................      925
V..............................................................      \1\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ As required.

    (b) Where the amount submitted by the applicant under paragraph (a) 
of this section exceeds the amount of the required fee determined by the 
authorized officer, the excess shall be refunded. If requested in 
writing by the applicant, the authorized officer may apply all or part 
of any such refund to

[[Page 256]]

the grant monitoring fee required under Sec. 2808.4 of this title or to 
the rental payment required by Sec. 2803.1-2 of this title.
    (c) Upon a determination that an application falls under Category V:
    (1) The authorized officer shall:
    (i) Complete a preliminary scoping of the issues involved;
    (ii) Prepare a preliminary work plan;
    (iii) Develop a preliminary financial plan, estimating the actual 
costs to be incurred by the United States in the processing of the 
application; and
    (iv) Discuss funding availability, options for cost reimbursement 
(i.e., a determination of actual costs under section 304(b) of the Act, 
paying all actual costs, or selecting the 1 percent ceiling), and 
information to be submitted by the applicant, including construction 
costs and other financial information.
    (2) An applicant/holder may submit a written analysis of the 
estimated actual cost showing specific monetary value considerations, 
public benefits, public services, or other data or information which 
would support a finding that an application for a right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit qualified for a reduction or waiver of cost 
reimbursement under section 303(b) of the Act or Sec. 2808.5 of this 
title. If the applicant elects a cost analysis under this paragraph, the 
provisions of paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply.
    (d) The authorized officer shall discuss the preliminary plans and 
data and verify the information that may be submitted under paragraph 
(c) of this section by the applicant. The applicant is encouraged to do 
all or part of any special study or analysis required in connection with 
the processing of the application to standards established by the 
authorized officer.
    (e) After coordination with the applicant as required by paragraph 
(d) of this section, the authorized officer shall develop final scoping, 
work and financial plans which reflect any work the applicant agrees to 
do and complete a final estimate of the amount of the actual costs to be 
reimbursed by the applicant, giving consideration to the factors set 
forth in section 304(b) of the Act.
    (f) An applicant may elect to waive consideration of reasonable 
costs under paragraph (e) of this section and either: (1) Agree to pay 
all actual costs incurred by the United States in processing the 
application and monitoring the grant or temporary use permit; or (2) pay 
the actual costs of processing the application and monitoring the right-
of-way grant up to the amount estimated by the authorized officer to 
equal 1 percent of the applicant's planned costs of construction of the 
project on the public lands for which a right-of-way grant is sought. 
Under this alternative, the applicant shall not be responsible for 
actual costs exceeding 1 percent of the estimated cost of constructing 
the proposed facilities on public lands. The request for a waiver shall 
be in writing and filed with the authorized officer.
    (g) The applicant shall reimburse the United States for the 
applicant's share of costs, as determined under paragraphs (e) and (f) 
of this section, before the grant or permit shall issue.
    (h) Where a State Director grants a reduction or waiver of cost 
reimbursement under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section and/
or Sec. 2808.5 of this title or where the reimbursable costs of 
processing an application are determined to exceed 1 percent of the cost 
of construction of the facilities under paragraph (f) of this section, 
the necessary funding shall be available either through the Bureau's 
appropriation process or otherwise made available for the processing of 
the application or such processing shall not proceed.
    (i) The authorized officer shall provide the applicant with a 
written determination of the reasonable costs to be reimbursed by the 
applicant or holder and those that will be funded by the United States 
under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and Sec. 2808.5 of this 
title. This determination is a final decision for purposes of appeal 
under Sec. 2804.1 of this title. Where an appeal is filed, actions 
pending decision on appeal shall be in accordance with Sec. 2808.6 of 
this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2808.3-2  Periodic advance payments.

    (a) The authorized officer may periodically estimate the reasonable 
costs expected to be incurred by the United

[[Page 257]]

States for specific work periods in processing an application determined 
to be in Category V or monitoring the right-of-way grant or temporary 
use permit under the provisions of Sec. 2808.3-1 (e) through (f) of this 
title and shall notify the applicant of the estimated amount to be 
reimbursed for the period and the applicant shall make payment of such 
estimated reimbursable costs prior to the incurring of such costs by the 
United States.
    (b) If the payments required by paragraph (a) of this section exceed 
the actual costs incurred by the United States, the authorized officer 
shall adjust the next billing to reflect the overpayment, or make a 
refund from applicable funds under the authority of 43 U.S.C. 1734. An 
applicant shall not set off or otherwise deduct any debt due it or any 
sum claimed to be owed it by the United States without the prior written 
approval of the authorized officer.
    (c) The authorized officer may re-estimate the actual costs 
determined under Sec. 2808.3-1 (e) through (g) of this title at any time 
it is determined that a change warranting a re-estimate occurs. An 
appeal of a re-estimate shall be treated in the same manner as an 
original estimate made under Sec. 2808.3-1(e) of this title.
    (d) Before issuance of a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit, 
an applicant shall pay such additional amounts as are necessary to 
reimburse the United States in full for any costs incurred, but not yet 
paid under Sec. 2808.3-1(h) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2808.3-3  Costs incurred for a withdrawn or denied application.

    (a) An applicant whose application is denied is liable for any costs 
incurred by the United States in processing the application. Those 
amounts that have not been paid are due within 30 days of the receipt of 
a bill from the authorized officer identifying the amount due.
    (b) An applicant who withdraws an application before a grant or 
temporary use permit is issued is liable for all costs incurred by the 
United States in processing the application up to the date the 
authorized officer receives the written notice of withdrawal, and for 
costs subsequently incurred in terminating the processing of said 
application. Those amounts that have not been paid are due within 30 
days of receipt of a bill from the authorized officer identifying the 
amount due.


<R05>
Sec. 2808.3-4  Joint liability for payments.

    (a) When 2 or more applications for a right-of-way grant are filed 
which the authorized officer determines to be in competition with each 
other, each applicant shall reimburse the United States as required by 
Sec. 2808.3 of this title, subject however, to the provisions of 
Sec. 2808.1(b) of this title. Each applicant shall be responsible for 
the reimbursement of the reasonable costs identified with his/her 
application. Costs that are not readily identifiable with either of the 
applications, such as costs for portions of an environmental impact 
statement that relate to all of the applications, generally, shall be 
paid by each applicant in equal shares or such other proportion as may 
be agreed to in writing by the applicants and the authorized officer 
prior to the United States incurring such costs.
    (b) When, through partnership, joint venture or other business 
arrangements, more than 1 person, partnership, corporation, association 
or other entity apply together for a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit, each such applicant shall be jointly and severally liable for 
costs under Sec. 2808.3 of this title for the entire system, subject 
however, to the provision of Sec. 2808.1(b) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 2808.4  Reimbursement of costs for monitoring.

    (a) A holder of a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit for 
which a fee was assessed under Sec. 2808.3 of this title shall, prior to 
the United States incurring such costs, reimburse the United States for 
costs to be incurred by the United States in monitoring the 
construction, operation, maintenance and termination of authorized 
facilities on the right-of-way grant or temporary use permit area, and 
for protection and rehabilitation of the lands involved, under the 
following schedule:
    (1) The same category as determined under Sec. 2808.2-2 of this 
title for processing of an application for a right-of-

[[Page 258]]

way grant or temporary use permit shall be used for monitoring. The one-
time fee for monitoring a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit 
determined to be in Categories I through IV is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Category                               Fee
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I..............................................................      $50
II.............................................................       75
III............................................................      100
IV.............................................................      200
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The monitoring fee for a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit determined to be in Category V shall be included with the costs 
determined under Secs. 2808.3-1 through 2808.3-4 of this title.
    (b) The holder shall submit the payment for the cost of monitoring 
required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the first periodic 
advance payment required under Sec. 2808.3-2 of this title, as 
appropriate, along with the written acceptance of the terms and 
conditions of the grant or permit. No right-of-way grant or temporary 
use permit shall be issued until the required payment is made.

[52 FR 25808, July 8, 1987; 52 FR 36576, Sept. 30, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 2808.5  Other cost considerations.

    (a) The State Director, after consultation with an applicant or 
holder making a request for a reduction or waiver of reimbursable costs 
under Sec. 2808.3-1 of this title, may reduce or waive reimbursement 
required under Secs. 2808.3-1 through 2808.3-4 of this title. In 
reaching a decision, the State Director may require the applicant/holder 
to submit in writing any information or data in addition to that 
required by Sec. 2808.3-1(c) of this title that he/she determines to be 
needed to support a proposed finding that an application, grant or 
temporary use permit qualifies for a reduction or waiver of cost 
reimbursement. Action on a Category V application shall be suspended 
pending the State Director's decision.
    (b) The State Director may base the decision to reduce or waive 
reimbursable costs on any of the following factors:
    (1) The applicant's/holder's financial condition is such that 
payment of the fee would result in undue financial hardship;
    (2) The application processing or grant monitoring costs are 
determined to be grossly excessive in relation to the costs of 
constructing the facilities or project requiring the right-of-way grant 
or temporary use permit on the public lands;
    (3) A major portion of the application processing or grant 
monitoring costs are the result of issues not related to the actual 
right-of-way grant or temporary use permit;
    (4) The applicant/holder is a nonprofit organization, corporation or 
association which is not controlled by or a subsidiary of a profitmaking 
enterprise;
    (5) The studies undertaken in connection with the processing of the 
application have a public benefit;
    (6) The facility or project requiring the right-of-way grant will 
provide a special service to the public or to a program of the 
Secretary;
    (7) A right-of-way grant is needed to construct a facility to 
prevent or mitigate damages to any lands or improvements or mitigate 
hazards or danger to public health and safety resulting from an Act of 
God, an act of war or negligence of the United States;
    (8) The holder of a valid existing right-of-way grant is required to 
secure a new right-of-way grant in order to relocate facilities which 
are required to be moved because the lands are needed for a Federal or 
federally funded project, if such relocation is not funded by the United 
States;
    (9) Relocation of a facility on a valid existing right-of-way grant 
requires a new or amended right-of-way grant in order to comply with the 
law, regulations or standards of public health and safety and 
environmental protection which were not in effect at the time the 
original right-of-way grant or temporary use permit was issued; or
    (10) It is demonstrated that because of compelling public benefits 
or public services provided, or for other causes, collection of 
reimbursable costs by the United States for processing an application, 
for a grant or permit would be inconsistent with prudent and appropriate 
management of the public lands

[[Page 259]]

and the equitable interest of the applicant/holder or of the United 
States.
    (c) The State Director may consider a reduction or waiver of fees 
under this section in determining reimbursable costs made under 
Sec. 2808.3 of this title. Said determination is a final decision for 
purposes of appeal under Sec. 2804.1 of this title. Where an appeal is 
filed, actions pending decision on appeal shall be in accordance with 
Sec. 2808.6 of this title.
    (d) Notwithstanding a finding by the State Director that there is a 
basis for reduction of the costs required to be reimbursed under this 
subpart, the State Director may not reduce such costs if funds to 
process the application(s) or to monitor the grant(s) or permit(s) are 
not otherwise available or may delay such decision pending the 
availability of funds.

<R05>
Sec. 2808.6  Action pending decision on appeal.

    (a) Where an appeal is filed on an application determined under 
Sec. 2808.2-2(a) of this title to be in Categories I through IV, an 
application shall not be accepted for processing without payment of the 
fee for such application according to the category determined by the 
authorized officer; however, when payment is made, the application may 
be processed and, if proper, the grant or temporary use permit issued. 
The authorized officer shall make any refund or other adjustment 
directed as a result of an appeal.
    (b) Where an appeal is filed for an application determined under 
Sec. 2808.2-2(a) of this title to be in Category V or for a related cost 
reimbursement determination under Sec. 2808.3-1 (e) through (g) or 
Sec. 2808.5(c) of this title, processing of the application shall be 
suspended pending the outcome of the appeal.

    (i) Direct control of a road, right-of-way, or land, by an applicant 
for a permit hereunder means that such applicant has authority to permit 
the United States and its licensees to use such road, right-of-way of 
land in accordance with this paragraph.
    (j) Indirect control of a road, right-of-way, or land, by an 
applicant hereunder means that such road, right-of-way, or land, is not 
directly controlled by him but is subject to use by him or by:
    (1) A principal, disclosed or undisclosed, of the applicant; or
    (2) A beneficiary of any trust or estate administered or established 
by the applicant; or
    (3) Any person having or exercising the right to designate the 
immediate destination of the timber to be transported over the right-of-
way for which application is made; or

[[Page 261]]

    (4) Any person who at any time has owned, or controlled the 
disposition of the timber to be transported over the right-of-way 
applied for, and during the 24 months preceding the filing of the 
application has disposed of such ownership or control to the applicant 
or his predecessor, under an agreement reserving or conferring upon the 
grantor the right to share directly or indirectly in the proceeds 
realized upon the grantee's disposal to third persons of the timber or 
products derived therefrom or the right to reacquire ownership or 
control of all or any part of the timber prior to the time when it 
undergoes its first mechanical alteration from the form of logs; or
    (5) Any person who stands in such relation to the applicant that 
there is liable to be absence of arm's length bargaining in transactions 
between them relating to such road, rights-of-way, or lands.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.0-6  Statement of policy.

    (a) The intermingled character of the O. and C. lands presents 
peculiar problems of management which require for their solution the 
cooperation between the Federal Government and the owners of the 
intermingled lands, particularly with respect to timber roads.
    (b) It is well established that the value of standing timber is 
determined in significant part by the cost of transporting the logs to 
the mill. Where there is an existing road which is adequate or can 
readily be made adequate for the removal of timber in the area, the 
failure to make such road available for access to all the mature and 
overmature timber it could tap leads to economic waste. Blocks of timber 
which are insufficient in volume or value to support the construction of 
a duplicating road may be left in the woods for lack of access over the 
existing road. Moreover, the duplication of an existing road reduces the 
value of the federal and other timber which is tapped by the existing 
road.
    (c) It is also clear that the Department of the Interior, which is 
responsible for the conservation of the resources of the O. and C. lands 
and is charged specifically with operating the timber lands on a 
sustained-yield basis, must have access to these lands for the purpose 
of managing them and their resources. In addition, where the public 
interest requires the disposition of Federal timber by competitive 
bidding, prospective bidders must have an opportunity to reach the 
timber to be sold. Likewise, where other timber is committed by 
cooperative agreement to coordinated administration with timber of the 
United States, there must be access to both.
    (d) Accordingly, to the extent that in the judgment of the 
authorized officer it appears necessary to accomplish these purposes, 
when the United States, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, 
grants a right-of-way across O. and C. lands to a private operator, the 
private operator will be required to grant to the United States for use 
by it and its licensees:
    (1) Rights-of-way across lands controlled directly or indirectly by 
him;
    (2) The right to use, to the extent indicated in Secs. 2812.3-5 and 
2812.3-6, any portions of the road system or rights-of-way controlled 
directly or indirectly by the private operator which is adequate or can 
economically be made adequate to accommodate the probable normal 
requirements of both the operator and of the United States and its 
licensees, and which form an integral part of or may be added to the 
road system with which the requested right-of-way will connect;
    (3) The right to extend such road system across the operator's lands 
to reach federal roads or timber; and
    (4) In addition, in the limited circumstances set forth in 
Sec. 2812.3-2 of this subpart the right to use certain other roads and 
rights-of-way. The permit will describe by legal subdivisions the lands 
of the operator as to which the United States receives rights. In 
addition, the extent and duration of the rights received by the United 
States will be specifically stated in the permit and ordinarily will 
embrace only those portions of such road system, rights-of-way and lands 
as may be actually needed for the management and removal of federal 
timber, or other timber committed by a cooperative agreement to 
coordinated administration with timber of the United States.
    (e) When the United States or a licensee of the United States uses 
any

[[Page 262]]

portion of a permittee's road system for the removal of forest products, 
the permittee will be entitled to receive just compensation, including a 
fair share of the maintenance and amortization charges attributable to 
such road, and to prescribe reasonable road operating rules, in 
accordance with Secs. 2812.3-7 to 2812.4-4.
    (f) As some examples of how this policy would be applied in 
particular instances, the United States may issue a permit under subpart 
2812 without requesting any rights with respect to roads, rights-of-way 
or lands which the authorized officer finds will not be required for 
management of or access to Federal timber, or timber included in a 
cooperative agreement. Where, however, the authorized officer finds that 
there is a road controlled directly or indirectly by the applicant, 
which will be needed for such purposes and which he finds either has 
capacity to accommodate the probable normal requirements both of the 
applicant and of the Government and its licensees, or such additional 
capacity can be most economically provided by an investment in such road 
system by the Government rather than by the construction of a duplicate 
road, he may require, for the period of time during which the United 
States and its licensees will have need for the road, the rights to use 
the road for the marketing and management of its timber and of timber 
included in a cooperative agreement in return for the granting of 
rights-of-way across O. and C. lands, and an agreement that the road 
builder will be paid a fair share of the cost of the road and its 
maintenance. Where it appears to the authorized officer that such a road 
will not be adequate or cannot economically be enlarged to handle the 
probable normal requirements both of the private operator and of the 
United States and its licensees, or even where the authorized officer 
has reasonable doubt as to such capacity, he will not request rights 
over such a road. Instead, the Bureau will make provision for its own 
road system either by providing in its timber sale contracts that in 
return for the road cost allowance made in fixing the appraised value of 
the timber, timber purchasers will construct or extend a different road 
system, or by expending for such construction or by extension monies 
appropriated for such purposes by the Congress, or, where feasible, by 
using an existing duplicating road over which the Government has 
obtained road rights. In such circumstances, however, road cost and 
maintenance allowances made in the stumpage price of O. and C. timber 
will be required to be applied to the road which the Bureau has the 
right to use, and thereafter will not in any circumstances be available 
for amortization or maintenance costs of the applicant's road.
    (g) When a right-of-way permit is issued for a road or road system 
over which the United States obtains rights of use for itself and its 
licensees, the authorized officer will seek to agree with the applicant 
respecting such matters as the time, route, and specifications for the 
future development of the road system involved; the portion of the 
capital and maintenance costs of the road system to be borne by the 
timber to be transported over the road system by the United States and 
its licensees; a formula for determining the proportion of the capacity 
of the road system which is to be available to the United States and its 
licensees for the transportation of forest products; and other similar 
matters respecting the use of the road by the United States and its 
licensees and the compensation payable therefor. To the extent that any 
such matter is not embraced in such an agreement, it will be settled by 
negotiation between the permittee and the individual licensees of the 
United States who use the road, and, in the event of their disagreement, 
by private arbitration between them in accordance with the laws of the 
State of Oregon.
    (h) The authorized officer may in his discretion, issue short term 
right-of-way permits for periods not exceeding three years, subject to 
one-year extensions in his discretion. Such permits shall specify the 
volume of timber which may be carried over the right-of-way and the area 
from which such timber may be logged. The permits shall be revocable by 
the authorized officer, the State Director, or the Secretary for 
violation of their terms and conditions or of these regulations or if 
hazardous

[[Page 263]]

conditions result from the construction, maintenance or use of the 
rights-of-way by the permittees or those acting under their authority. 
As a condition for the granting of such permits, the applicant must 
comply with Secs. 2812.3-1 and 2812.3-3 of this subpart to the extent 
that rights-of-way and road use rights are needed to remove government 
timber offered for sale in the same general area during the period for 
which the short term right-of-way is granted.
    (i) The authorized officer may, in his discretion, issue to private 
operators rights-of-way across O. and C. lands, needed for the conduct 
of salvage operations, for a period not to exceed five years. A salvage 
operation as used in this paragraph means the removal of trees injured 
or killed by windstorms, insect infestation, disease, or fire, together 
with any adjacent green timber needed to make an economic logging show. 
As a condition of the granting of such rights-of-way, the operator will 
be required, when the authorized officer deems it necessary, to grant to 
the United States and its licensees for the conduct of salvage 
operations on O. and C. lands for a period not to exceed five years, 
rights-of-way across lands controlled directly or indirectly by him and 
to grant the right to use to the extent indicated in Secs. 2812.3-5 and 
2812.3-6 any portions of the road system controlled directly or 
indirectly by the private operator which is adequate or can economically 
be made adequate to accommodate the requirements of both the operator 
and of the United States and its licensees.

<R05>
Sec. 2812.1-2  Contents.

    (a) An individual applicant and each member of any unincorporated 
association which is an applicant must state in the application whether 
he is a native born or a naturalized citizen of the United States. 
Naturalized citizens will be required to furnish evidence of 
naturalization pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 2802.1-4.
    (b) An application by a private corporation must be accompanied by 
two copies of its articles of incorporation, one of which must be 
certified by the proper official of the company under its corporate 
seal, or by the secretary of the State where organized. A corporation 
organized in a State other than Oregon must submit a certificate issued 
by the State of Oregon attesting that the corporation is authorized to 
transact business within that State. The requirements of this paragraph 
shall be deemed satisfied if the corporation, having once filed the 
required documents, makes specific reference to the date and case number 
of such previous applications, states what

[[Page 264]]

changes, if any, have been made since the prior filings, and includes a 
statement that the right of the company to do business in the State of 
Oregon has not lapsed or terminated.
    (c) Where the application is for a right-of-way on any portion of 
which the applicant proposes to construct a road, it must be accompanied 
by two copies of a map prepared on a scale of 4 inches or 8 inches to 
the mile. Showing the survey of the right-of-way so that it may be 
accurately located on the ground. The map should comply with the 
following requirements, except as the authorized officer may waive in 
any particular instance all or any of such requirements:

    Courses and distances of the center line of the right-of-way should 
be given; the courses referred to the true meridian and the distance in 
feet and decimals thereof. The initial and terminal points of the survey 
must be accurately connected by course and distance to the nearest 
readily identifiable corner of the public land surveys, or, if there be 
no such corner within two miles, then connected to two permanent and 
prominent monuments or natural objects. All subdivisions of the public 
lands surveys, any part of which is within the limits of the survey, 
should be shown in their entirety, based upon the official subsisting 
plat with subdivisions, section, township, and range clearly marked. The 
width of the right-of-way should be given; and if not of uniform width, 
the locations and amount of change must be definitely shown. There shall 
also be a statement on the face of or appended to the map indicating the 
grade and usable width of the road to be constructed, the type of 
material which will be used for the surface, the type and extent of the 
drainage facilities, and the type of construction and estimated capacity 
of any bridges. The map should bear upon its face the statement of the 
person who made the survey, if any, and the certificate of the 
applicant; such statement and certificate should be as set out in Forms 
as approved by the Director.


    (d) Where the application is for the use of an existing road, a map 
adequate to show the location thereof will be required, together with a 
statement of the specific nature and location of any proposed 
improvements to such road. A blank map suitable for most cases may be 
procured from the appropriate district forester.
    (e) Every application for a right-of-way must also be accompanied by 
a diagram indicating the roads and rights-of-way which form an integral 
part of the road system with which the requested right-of-way will 
connect, the portions of such road system which the applicant directly 
controls within the meaning of Sec. 2812.0-5(i), the portions thereof 
which the applicant indirectly controls within the meaning of 
Sec. 2812.0-5(j), and the portions thereof as to which the applicant has 
no control within the meaning of such sections. As to the portions over 
which the applicant has no control, he must furnish a statement showing 
for the two years preceding the date of the filing of the application, 
all periods of time that he had direct or indirect control thereof, and 
the date and nature of any changes in such control. The diagram shall 
also contain the name of the person whom the applicant believes directly 
controls any portion of such road system which the applicant does not 
directly control. Where a right-of-way for a railroad is involved, the 
applicant must indicate which portions of the right-of-way will be 
available for use as truck roads upon the removal of the rails and ties 
and the probable date of such removal. Blank diagram forms, suitable for 
most cases, may be obtained from the appropriate district forester.

<R05>
Sec. 2812.2  Nature of permit.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.2-1  Nonexclusive license.

    Permits for rights-of-way for tramroads, do not constitute 
easements, and do not confer any rights on the permittee to any material 
for construction or other purposes except, in accordance with the 
provisions of Secs. 2812.6-2 and 2812.8-3, such materials as may have 
been placed on such lands by a permittee. The permits are merely 
nonexclusive licenses to transport forest products owned by the 
permittee. Such permits may be canceled pursuant to Sec. 2812.8.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.2-2  Right of permittee to authorize use by third parties.

    A permittee may not authorize other persons to use the right-of-way 
for the transportation of forest products which are not owned by the 
permittee. Any person, other than the permittee or a licensee of the 
United States who desires to use the right-of-way for such purposes, is 
required to make application therefor and to comply with all the 
provisions of these regulations relating to applications and applicants: 
Provided, however, That upon the request of a permittee the authorized 
officer may, with respect to an independent contractor who desires to 
use such right-of-way for the transportation of forest products owned by 
such independent contractor and derived from timber or logs acquired by 
him from such permittee, waive the requirements of this sentence. Where 
the right-of-way involved has been substantially improved by the holder 
of an outstanding permit, any subsequent permit issued for the same 
right-of-way will be conditioned upon the subsequent permittee's 
agreement while the prior permit is outstanding, to be bound by the road 
rules of and to pay fair compensation to, the prior permittee, such 
rules and compensation to be agreed upon by the prior and subsequent 
permittee in accordance with the procedures and standards established by 
the regulations in Secs. 2812.4-1, 2812.4-3, and 2812.4-4 of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.2-3  Construction in advance of permit.

    The authorized officer may grant an applicant authority to construct 
improvements on a proposed right-of-way prior to a determination whether 
the permit should issue. Such advance authority shall not be construed 
as any representation or commitment that a permit will issue. Upon 
demand by the authorized officer, the applicant will fully and promptly 
comply with all the requirements imposed under and by this paragraph. 
Advance construction will not be authorized unless and until applicant 
has complied with Secs. 2812.1-1, 2812.1-2, 2812.3-1 and 2812.5-1.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3  Right-of-way and road use agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3-1  Rights over lands controlled by applicant.

    Where, in the judgment of the authorized officer, it appears 
necessary in order to carry out the policy set forth in Sec. 2812.0-6, 
he may require the applicant, as a condition precedent to the issuance 
of the permit:
    (a) To grant to the United States, for use by it and its licensees 
and permittees, rights-of-way across lands in the O. and C. area 
directly controlled by the applicant; and as to lands in such area which 
are indirectly controlled by him, either to obtain such rights for the 
United States or to make a showing satisfactory to the authorized 
officer that he has negotiated therefor in good faith and to waive as to 
the United States, its licensees and permittees any exclusive or 
restricted right he may have to such lands as are indirectly controlled 
by him.
    (b) In addition, to agree to permit the United States and its 
licensees, upon the payment of fair compensation as hereinafter 
provided, to use under the terms and conditions of this paragraph such 
portion as the applicant directly controls of the road system and 
rights-of-way which are an integral part of or may be added to the road 
system with which the right-of-way applied for will connect, and as to 
the portions of such road system or rights-of-way as the applicant 
indirectly controls, either to obtain such rights for the United

[[Page 266]]

States and its licensees or to make a showing satisfactory to the 
authorized officer that he has negotiated therefor in good faith and, in 
such latter circumstance, to waive as to the United States and its 
licensees any exclusive or restricted right he may have in such portion 
of the road system and rights-of-way.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3-2  Other roads and rights-of-way controlled by applicant.

    In addition to the private road systems and rights-of-way described 
in Sec. 2812.3-1 in the event the applicant controls directly or 
indirectly other roads or rights-of-way in any O. and C. area where the 
authorized officer of the Bureau finds that, as of the time of filing or 
during the pendency of the application, the United States is 
unreasonably denied access to its timber for management purposes or 
where, as of such time, competitive bidding by all prospective 
purchasers of timber managed by the Bureau in the O. and C. area, or of 
other Federal timber intermingled with or adjacent to such timber, is 
substantially precluded by reason of the applicant's control, direct or 
indirect, of such roads or rights-of-way, the authorized officer may 
require the applicant to negotiate an agreement granting to the United 
States and its licensees the right to use, in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of this paragraph such portion of such roads or rights-
of-way as may be necessary to accommodate such management or competitive 
bidding.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3-3  Form of grant to the United States, recordation.

    Any grant of rights to the United States under this section shall be 
executed on a form prescribed by the Director which shall constitute and 
form a part of any permit issued upon the application involved. The 
applicant shall record such agreement in the office of land records of 
the county or counties in which the roads, rights-of-way, or lands, 
subject to the agreement are located, and submit evidence of such 
recordation to the appropriate district manager.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3-4  Where no road use agreement is required.

    Where, in the judgment of the authorized officer, it is consistent 
with the policy set forth in subpart 2811 he may issue a permit without 
requesting the applicant to grant any rights to the United States under 
this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3-5  Use by the United States and its licensees of rights received from a permittee.

    The use by the United States and its licensees of any of the rights 
received from a permittee hereunder shall be limited to that which is 
necessary for management purposes, or to reach, by the most reasonably 
direct route, involving the shortest practicable use of the permittee's 
road system, a road or highway which is suitable for the transportation 
of forest products in the type and size of vehicle customarily used for 
such purposes and which is legally available for public use for ingress 
to and the removal of forest products from Government lands or from 
other lands during such periods of time as the timber thereon may be 
committed by a cooperative agreement to coordinated administration with 
timber of the United States. However, the type and size of vehicle which 
may be used by the licensee on the permittee's road shall be governed by 
Secs. 2812.3-7 and 2812.4-3.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3-6  Duration and location of rights granted or received by the United States.

    The rights-of-way granted by the United States under any permit 
issued under Sec. 2812.6, subject to the provisions of Sec. 2812.7, will 
be for a stated term or terms which may vary for each portion of the 
right-of-way granted; such term or terms will normally be coincident 
with the probable period of use for the removal of forest products by 
the permittee and any successor in interest of the various portions of 
the right-of-way requested. In the same manner the permit will also 
state the duration of the rights of the United States to use and to 
permit its licensees to use, and the location by legal subdivisions of, 
each of the various portions, if any, of the roads, rights-of-way, and 
lands

[[Page 267]]

which a permittee hereunder authorizes the United States and its 
licensees to use; and, similarly, the duration of such rights received 
by the United States will normally be coincident with the probable 
period of use for the removal of forest products, by the United States 
and its existing and prospective licensees, of such roads, rights-of-
way, and lands.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.3-7  Permittee's agreement with United States respecting compensation and adjustment of road use.

    (a) Where the United States receives rights over any road, right-of-
way, or lands, controlled directly or indirectly by a permittee, the 
authorized officer will seek to arrive at an advance agreement with the 
permittee respecting any or all of such matters as the time, route, and 
specifications for the development of the road system in the area; the 
total volume of timber to be moved over such road system, and the 
proportion of such timber which belongs to the United States or is 
embraced in a cooperative agreement for coordinated management with 
timber of the United States managed by the Bureau; the consequent 
proportion of the capital costs of the road system to be borne by such 
timber of the United States or embraced in such cooperative agreement; 
the period of time over, or rate at which, the United States or its 
licensees shall be required to amortise such capital cost; provisions 
for road maintenance; the use in addition to the uses set forth in 
Sec. 2812.3-5 which the United States and its licensees may make of the 
road system involved, a formula for determining the proportionate 
capacity of the road system or portions thereof which shall be available 
to the United States and its licensees for the transportation of forest 
products; the amount and type of insurance to be carried, and the type 
of security to be furnished by licensees of the United States who use 
such road; and such other similar matters as the authorized officer may 
deem appropriate. To the extent necessary to fulfill the obligations of 
the United States under any such advance agreement, subsequent contracts 
for the sale of timber managed by the Bureau and tapped by such road 
system, and subsequent cooperative agreements for the coordinated 
management of such timber with other timber, will contain such 
provisions as may be necessary or appropriate to require such licensees 
to comply with the terms of the advance agreement. Where such an advance 
agreement between the United States and the permittee includes 
provisions relating to the route and specifications for extensions of 
the road system involved, the authorized officer may agree that upon the 
filing of proper applications in the future the applicant or his 
successor in interest shall receive the necessary permits for such road 
extensions as may cross lands managed by the Bureau: Provided, however, 
That the applicant shall have substantially complied with the terms of 
such advance agreement and of the outstanding permits theretofore issued 
to him.
    (b) The provisions of Sec. 2812.4 shall not be applicable to any 
matters embraced in an agreement made pursuant to this section.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.4  Arbitration and agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.4-1  Agreements and arbitration between permittee and licensee respecting compensation payable by licensee to permittee for use of road.

    (a) In the event the United States exercises the rights received 
from a permittee hereunder to license a person to remove forest products 
over any road, right-of-way, or lands of the permittee or of his 
successor in interest, to the extent that such matters are not covered 
by an agreement under Sec. 2812.3-7 of this subpart, such licensee will 
be required to pay the permittee or his successor in interest such 
compensation and to furnish him such security, and to carry such 
liability insurance as the permittee or his successor in interest and 
the licensee may agree upon. If the parties do not agree, then upon the 
written request of either party delivered to the other party, the matter 
shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance 
with the procedures established by Sec. 2812.4-4. During the pendency of 
such arbitration proceedings the licensee shall be entitled to use the 
road, right-

[[Page 268]]

of-way, or lands involved upon payment, or tender thereof validly 
maintained, to the permittee of an amount to be determined by the 
authorized officer and upon the furnishing to the permittee of a 
corporate surety bond in an amount equal to the difference between the 
amount fixed by the authorized officer and the amount sought by the 
permittee. The licensee shall also, as a condition of use in such 
circumstances, maintain such liability insurance in such amounts 
covering any additional hazard and risk which might accrue by reason of 
the licensee's use of the road, as the authorized officer may prescribe.
    (b) The arbitrators shall base their award as to the compensation to 
be paid by the licensee to the permittee or his successor in interest 
upon the amortization of the replacement costs for a road of the type 
involved, including in such replacement costs an extraordinary cost 
peculiar to the construction of the particular road involved and 
subtracting therefrom any capital investment made by the United States 
or its licensees in the particular road involved or in improvements 
thereto used by and useful to the permittee or his successor in interest 
plus a reasonable interest allowance on the resulting cost figure, 
taking into account the risk involved, plus costs of maintenance if 
furnished by the permittee or his successor, including costs of gates 
and gateman. In arriving at the amortization item, the arbitrators shall 
take into account the probable period of time, past and present, during 
which such road may be in existence, and the volume of timber which has 
been moved and the volume of timber currently merchantable, which 
probably will be moved from all sources over such road. The arbitrators 
shall also take into account the extent to which the use which the 
licensee might otherwise economically make of the road system is limited 
by Sec. 2812.3-5. In addition, the arbitrators may fix the rate at which 
payments shall be made by the licensee during his use of the road. The 
arbitrators shall require the licensee to provide adequate bond, cash 
deposit, or other security to indemnify the permittee or his successor 
in interest against failure of the licensee to comply with the terms of 
the award and against damage to the road not incident to normal usage 
and for any other reasonable purpose, and also to carry appropriate 
liability insurance covering any additional hazard and risks which may 
accrue by reason of the licensee's use of the road.
    (c) Where improvements or additions are required to enable a 
licensee to use a road or right-of-way to remove timber or forest 
products, the cost of such improvements will be allowable to the 
licensee.
    (d) The full value at current stumpage prices will be allocable 
against a licensee for all timber to be cut, removed, or destroyed by 
the licensee on a permittee's land in the construction or improvement of 
the road involved.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.4-2  Compensation payable by United States to permittee for use of road.

    In the event the United States itself removes forest products over 
any road or right-of-way of the permittee or his successor in interest, 
the United States, if there has been no agreement under Sec. 2812.3-7 
covering the matter, shall pay to the permittee or his successor in 
interest reasonable compensation as determined by the State Director, 
who shall base his determination upon the same standards established by 
this paragraph for arbitrators in the determination of the compensation 
to be paid by a licensee to a permittee: Provided, however, That no bond 
or other security or liability insurance is to be required of the United 
States. When the United States constructs or improves a road on a 
permittee's land or right-of-way it shall pay to the permittee the full 
value at current stumpage prices of all timber of the permittee cut, 
removed, or destroyed in the construction or maintenance of such road or 
road improvements. Current stumpage prices shall be determined by the 
application of the standard appraisal formula, used in appraising O. and 
C. timber for sale, to the volume and grade of timber. Such volume and 
grade shall be determined by a cruise made by the permittee or, at his 
request, by the authorized officer. If either the permittee or the 
authorized officer does not accept the cruise

[[Page 269]]

made by the other, the volume and grade shall be determined by a person 
or persons acceptable both to the permittee and the State Director.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.4-3  Agreements and arbitration between permittee and licensee respecting adjustment of road use.

    (a) When the United States exercises the right received under this 
paragraph to use or to license any person to use a road of a permittee, 
the permittee or his successor in interest shall not unreasonably 
obstruct the United States or such licensee in such use. If there has 
been no agreement under Sec. 2812.3-7 covering such matters, the 
permittee shall have the right to prescribe reasonable operating 
regulations, to apply uniformly as between the permittee and such 
licensee, covering the use of such road for such matters as speed and 
load limits, scheduling of hauls during period of use by more than one 
timber operator, coordination of peak periods of use, and such other 
matters as are reasonably related to safe operations and protection of 
the road; if the capacity of such road should be inadequate to 
accommodate the use thereof which such licensee and permittee desire to 
make concurrently, they shall endeavor to adjust their respective uses 
by agreement.
    (b) If the permittee and such licensee are unable to agree as to the 
reasonableness of such operating regulations or on the adjustment of 
their respective uses where the capacity of the road is inadequate to 
accommodate their concurrent use, then upon the written request of 
either party delivered to the other party, the matter shall be referred 
to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the 
procedures established by Sec. 2812.4-4.
    (c) The arbitrators may make such disposition of a dispute involving 
the reasonableness of such operating regulations as appears equitable to 
them, taking into account the capacity and the construction of the road 
and the volume of use to which it will be subjected. In the 
determination of a dispute arising out of the inadequacy of the capacity 
of a road to accommodate the concurrent use by a permittee and a 
licensee, the arbitrators may make such disposition thereof as appears 
equitable to them, taking into account, among other pertinent facts, the 
commitments of the permittee and the licensee with respect to the 
cutting and removal of the timber involved and the disposition of the 
products derived therefrom; the extent to which each of the parties may 
practicably satisfy any of the aforesaid commitments from other timber 
currently controlled by him; the past normal use of such road by the 
permittee; the extent to which federal timber has contributed to the 
amortization of the capital costs of such road; and the extent to which 
the United States or its licensees have enlarged the road capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.4-4  Arbitration procedure.

    (a) Within 10 days after the delivery of a written request for 
arbitration under Sec. 2812.4-1 or Sec. 2812.4-3 of this subpart each of 
the parties to the disagreement shall appoint an arbitrator and the two 
arbitrators thus appointed shall select a third arbitrator. If either 
party fails to appoint an arbitrator as provided herein, the other party 
may apply to a court of record of the State of Oregon for the 
appointment of such an arbitrator, as provided by the laws of such 
State. If within ten days of the appointment of the second of them, the 
original two arbitrators are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator who 
will accept the appointment, either party may petition such a court of 
record of the State of Oregon for the appointment of a third arbitrator. 
Should any vacancy occur by reason of the resignation, death or 
inability of one or more of the arbitrators to serve, the vacancy shall 
be filled according to the procedures applicable to the appointment of 
the arbitrator whose death, disability, or other inability to serve, 
created the vacancy.
    (b) By mutual agreement, the parties may submit to a single 
arbitration proceeding controversies arising under both Secs. 2812.4-1 
and 2812.4-3.
    (c) The arbitrators shall hear and determine the controversy and 
make, file, and serve their award in accordance with the substantive 
standards prescribed in Secs. 2812.4-1 and 2812.4-3, for the type of 
controversy involved and in

[[Page 270]]

accordance with the procedures established by the laws of the State of 
Oregon pertaining to arbitration proceedings. A copy of the award shall 
also be served at the same time upon the authorized officer or the State 
Director, either personally or by registered mail.
    (d) Costs of the arbitration proceedings shall be assessed by the 
arbitrators against either or both of the parties, as may appear 
equitable to the arbitrators, taking into account the original 
contentions of the parties, the ultimate decision of the arbitrators and 
such other matter as may appear relevant to the arbitrators.

<R05>
Sec. 2812.5  Payment to the United States, bond.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.5-1  Payment required for O. and C. timber.

    An applicant will be required to pay to the Bureau of Land 
Management, in advance of the issuance of the permit, the full stumpage 
value as determined by the authorized officer of the estimated volume of 
all timber to be cut, removed, or destroyed, on O. and C. lands in the 
construction or operation of the road.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.5-2  Payment to the United States for road use.

    (a) A permittee shall pay a basic fee of $5 per year per mile or 
fraction thereof for the use of any existing road or of any road 
constructed by the permittee upon the right-of-way. If the term of the 
permit is for 5 years or less, the entire basic fee must be paid in 
advance of the issuance of the permit. If the term of the permit is 
longer than 5 years, the basic fee for each 5-year period or for the 
remainder of the last period, if less than 5 years, must be paid in 
advance at 5-year intervals: Provided, however, That in those cases 
where the permittee has executed under Secs. 2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5 an 
agreement respecting the use of roads, rights-of-way or lands, no such 
basic fee shall be paid: Provided further, This paragraph shall not 
apply where payment for road use is required under Sec. 2812.3-1(b).
    (b) Where the permittee receives a right to use a road constructed 
or acquired by the United States, which road is under the administrative 
jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, the permittee will be 
required to pay to the United States a fee to be determined by the 
authorized officer who may also fix the rate at which payments shall be 
made by the permittee during his use of the road. The authorized officer 
shall base his determination upon the amortization of the replacement 
costs for a road of the type involved, together with a reasonable 
interest allowance on such costs plus costs of maintenance if furnished 
by the United States and any extraordinary costs peculiar to the 
construction or acquisition of the particular road. In the case of 
federally acquired or constructed access roads, an allowance 
representing a reasonable allocation for recreational or other 
authorized uses shall be deducted from the replacement costs of the road 
before the amortization item is computed. A similar allowance and 
deduction shall be made in cases involving roads constructed as a part 
of a timber sale contract when, and if, subsequent to completion of such 
contract any such road becomes subject to recreational or other 
authorized uses. In arriving at the amortization item, the authorized 
officer shall take into account the probable period of time, past and 
present, during which such road may be in existence, and the volume of 
timber which has been moved, and the volume of timber currently 
merchantable which probably will be moved from all sources over such 
road: Provided, however, That this subdivision shall not apply where the 
permittee transports forest products purchased from the United States 
through the Bureau of Land Management, or where payment for such road 
use to another permittee is required under this subpart 2812: Provided 
further, That where the United States is entitled to charge a fee for 
the use of a road, the authorized officer may waive such fee if the 
permittee grants to the United States and its licensees the right to 
use, without charge, permittee's roads of approximately equal value as 
determined under the methods provided in this

[[Page 271]]

subdivision and Sec. 2812.4-1(b), as may be applicable.
    (c) If an application is filed to use a road built on O. and C. 
lands by the applicant or his predecessor in interest under a permit 
which has expired, the authorized officer may issue a new permit which 
provides that as to such road the applicant's road use payments shall be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section except that 
he shall be required to pay a road use fee which is adequate to amortize 
only his proportionate share of any capital improvements which have been 
or may be placed on the road by the United States or its licensees 
together with a reasonable interest allowance thereon plus cost of 
maintenance if furnished by the United States: Provided, however, That 
if the application is for use of a road which has been built by a 
predecessor in interest the permit shall provide that the applicant may 
use the road only for the purpose of reaching the lands of the 
predecessor in interest that were served by the road. As a condition for 
the granting of such a permit, the applicant must comply with 
Secs. 2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5 to the extent that rights-of-way and road use 
rights are needed to manage lands of the United States or to remove 
timber therefrom.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.5-3  Bonds in connection with existing roads.

    An applicant for permit or a permittee desiring to use an existing 
road owned or controlled by the United States, shall prior to such use 
post a bond on a form prescribed by the Director. The amount of the bond 
shall be determined by the authorized officer but in no event less than 
five hundred dollars ($500) per mile or fraction thereof. The bond shall 
be executed by an approved corporate surety, or the permittee may 
deposit an equivalent amount in cash or negotiable securities of the 
United States and the bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with 
subpart 2812 and the terms and conditions of the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.6  Approval and terms of permit.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.6-1  Approval.

    (a) Upon the applicant's compliance with the appropriate provisions 
of this paragraph and if it is determined that the approval of the 
application will be in the public interest, the authorized officer may, 
in his discretion, issue an appropriate permit, upon a form prescribed 
by the Director.
    (b) The authorized officer may waive the requirements of 
Secs. 2812.1-2 (c) and (e) and 2812.5-3 in the case of a natural person 
who applies for a right-of-way for not to exceed a period of twelve 
weeks. Not more than one such waiver shall be allowed in each 
consecutive twelve calendar months on behalf of or for the benefit of 
the same person.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.6-2  Terms and conditions of permit.

    (a) As to all permits: Every permittee shall agree:
    (1) To comply with the applicable regulations in effect as of the 
time when the permit is issued and, as to the permittee's roads as to 
which the United States has received rights under Secs. 2812.3-1 to 
2812.3-5 with such additional regulations as may be issued from time to 
time relating to the use of roads for the purpose of access by properly 
licensed hunters and fishermen and by other recreationalists to lands of 
the United States in the O. and C. area which are suitable for such 
recreational purposes, where such use will not unreasonably interfere 
with the use of the road by the permittee for the transportation of 
forest products or unduly enhance the risk of fire, collision, or other 
hazards on such road and on lands in the vicinity thereof. If, 
notwithstanding the request of the authorized officer that the permittee 
allow use of a road in conformity with such additional regulations the 
permittee shall unreasonably withhold his assent, the authorized officer 
shall refer the disagreement through the proper channels to the Director 
of the Bureau for his consideration, and, if the Director concurs in the 
conclusion of the authorized officer and if the matter is still in 
dispute, he shall refer the matter to the Secretary of the Interior for 
his consideration. In the event of the Secretary's concurrence in the 
conclusions of the authorized officer, and if the permittee nevertheless 
unreasonably withholds such assent, the United

[[Page 272]]

States may institute such judicial proceedings as may be appropriate to 
enforce said regulations.
    (2) Not to cut, remove, or destroy any timber not previously 
purchased on the right-of-way without having first obtained specific 
authority from the authorized officer and making payment therefor.
    (3) To take adequate precaution to prevent forest, brush, and grass 
fires; to endeavor with all available personnel to suppress any fire 
originating on or threatening the right-of-way on which a road is being 
used or constructed by the permittee or any fire caused by the 
permittee; to do no burning on or near the right-of-way without State 
permit during the seasons that permits are required and in no event to 
set fire on or near the right-of-way that will result in damage to any 
natural resource or improvement.
    (4) To submit to arbitration proceedings and to be bound by the 
resulting arbitral awards, pursuant to Secs. 2812.4-1, 2812.4-3, and 
2812.4-4.
    (5) In the event that the United States acquires by purchase or 
eminent domain the land or any interest therein, over which there passes 
a road which the United States has acquired the right to use under 
Secs. 2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5 of this subpart to waive compensation for the 
value of the road, equivalent to the proportion that the amount the 
United States has contributed bears to the total actual cost of 
construction of the road. Such contribution shall include any investment 
in or amortization of the cost of such road, or both, as the case may 
be, made by the United States or a licensee either by way of direct 
expenditures upon such road, or by way of payment by the United States 
or a licensee to the permittee, or by way of allowance made by the 
United States to the permittee in any timber sales contract for such 
amortization or capital investment.
    (6) To construct all roads and other improvements as described in 
the application for the permit, except as the authorized officer may 
authorize modification or abandonment of any such proposed construction.
    (7) To use the permit and right-of-way afforded subject to all valid 
existing rights, to such additional rights-of-way as may be granted 
under this paragraph to a reservation of rights-of-way for ditches and 
canals constructed under authority of the United States.
    (8) Not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for 
employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin, and to 
require an identical provision to be included in all subcontracts.
    (9) Except as the authorized officer may otherwise permit or direct 
to clean up and remove from the road and right-of-way within six months 
after the expiration or other termination of the permit, all debris, 
refuse, and waste material which may have resulted from his operations 
and use of said road; to repair all damage to said road resulting 
directly or indirectly from his use thereof; and to remove therefrom all 
structures, timbers, and other objects that may have been installed or 
placed thereon by him in connection with said operations or use; 
Provided, however, That the road and all usable road improvements shall 
be left in place.
    (10) Upon request of an authorized officer, to submit to the Bureau 
within 30 days with permission to publish, the detailed terms and 
conditions, including the fee which the permittee will ask as a 
condition of such licensee's use for the removal of forest products over 
any road or right-of-way which the United States and its licensees have 
acquired a right to use under Secs. 2812.1-3 to 2812.1-5.
    (11) To grant to the United States, upon request of an authorized 
officer in lieu of the rights-of-way across legal subdivisions granted 
pursuant to Secs. 2812.1-3 to 2812.1-5, such permanent easements on 
specifically described locations as may be necessary to permit the 
Bureau to construct roads on such legal subdivisions with appropriated 
funds: Provided, That at the time of the grant of such permanent 
easements the Bureau shall release, except for necessary connecting spur 
roads, the rights-of-way across such legal subdivisions previously 
granted: Provided further, That if the United States builds a road on 
such permanent easements it shall pay for any timber of the permittee 
which is cut, removed, or destroyed in accordance with Sec. 2812.4-2.

[[Page 273]]

The authorized officer shall waive the requirement under this paragraph, 
however, if the permittee makes a satisfactory showing to the authorized 
officer that he does not own a sufficient interest in the land to grant 
a permanent easement, and that he has negotiated therefor in good faith 
without success.
    (b) As to permits for the use of an existing road: In addition, 
every permittee to whom a permit is issued for the use of an existing 
road is required to agree:
    (1) To maintain such a road in an adequate and satisfactory 
condition or to arrange therefor with the other users of the road. In 
the absence of satisfactory performance, the authorized officer may have 
such maintenance work performed as may be necessary in his judgment, 
determine the proportionate share allocable to each user, and collect 
the cost thereof from the parties or the sureties on the bonds furnished 
by said parties.
    (2) Upon the expiration or other termination of his right to its 
use, to leave said road and right-of-way in at least as good a condition 
as existed prior to the commencement of his use.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.7  Assignment of permit.

    Any proposed assignment of a permit must be submitted in duplicate, 
within 90 days after the date of its execution, to the authorized 
officer for approval, accompanied by the same showing and undertaking by 
the assignee as is required of an applicant by Secs. 2812.1-2 and 
2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5, and must be supported by a stipulation that the 
assignee agrees to comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions 
of the permit and the applicable regulations of the Department of the 
Interior in force as of the date of such approval of the assignment.

<R05>
Sec. 2812.8  Cause for termination of permittee's rights.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.8-1  Notice of termination.

    (a) The authorized officer in his discretion may elect upon 30 days' 
notice to terminate any permit or right-of-way issued under this 
paragraph if:
    (1) In connection with the application made therefor, the applicant 
represented any material fact knowing the same to be false or made such 
representation in reckless disregard of the truth; or
    (2) A permittee, subsequent to the issuance of a permit or right-of-
way to him, represents any material fact to the Bureau, in accordance 
with any requirement of such permit or this paragraph, knowing such 
representation to be false, or makes such representation in reckless 
disregard of the truth.
    (b) The authorized officer in his discretion may elect to terminate 
any permit or right-of-way issued under this paragraph, if the permittee 
shall fail to comply with any of the provisions of such regulations or 
make defaults in the performance or obligation of any of the conditions 
of the permit, and such failure or default shall continue for 60 days 
after service of written notice thereof by the authorized officer.
    (c) Notice of such termination shall be served personally or by 
registered mail upon the permittee, shall specify the misrepresentation, 
failure or default involved, and shall be final, subject, however, to 
the permittee's right of appeal.
    (d) Termination of the permit and of the right-of-way under this 
section shall not operate to terminate any right granted to the United 
States pursuant to this paragraph, nor shall it affect the right of the 
permittee, after the termination of his permit and right-of-way to 
receive compensation and to establish road operating rules with respect 
to roads controlled by him which the United States has the right to use 
and to permit its licensees to use; nor shall it relieve the permittee 
of his duty under this paragraph, to submit to and be bound by 
arbitration pursuant to Secs. 2812.4-1, 2812.4-3, and 2812.4-4.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.8-2  Remedies for violations by licensee.

    (a) No licensee of the United States will be authorized to use the 
roads of a permittee except under the terms of a timber sale contract or 
a cooperative agreement with the United States

[[Page 274]]

which will require the licensee to comply with all the applicable 
provisions of this paragraph, and any agreements or awards made pursuant 
thereto. If a licensee fails to comply with the regulations, agreements, 
or awards, the authorized officer will take such action as may be 
appropriate under the provisions of the timber sale contract or 
cooperative agreement.
    (b) A permittee who believes that a licensee is violating the 
provisions of such a timber sale contract or cooperative agreement 
pertaining to use of the permittee's roads, rights-of-way, or lands, may 
petition the authorized officer, setting forth the grounds for his 
belief, to take such action against the licensee as may be appropriate 
under the contract or the cooperative agreement. In such event the 
permittee shall be bound by the decision of the authorized officer, 
subject, however, to a right of appeal pursuant to Sec. 2812.9 and 
subject, further, to the general provisions of law respecting review of 
administrative determinations. In the alternative, a permittee who 
believes that a licensee has violated the terms of the timber sale 
contract or cooperative agreement respecting the use of the permittee's 
roads may proceed against the licensee in any court of competent 
jurisdiction to obtain such relief as may be appropriate in the 
premises.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.8-3  Disposition of property on termination of permit.

    Upon the expiration or other termination of the permittee's rights, 
in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the permittee will be 
allowed 6 months in which to remove or otherwise dispose of all property 
or improvements, other than the road and usable improvements to the 
road, placed by him on the right-of-way, but if not removed within this 
period, all such property and improvements shall become the property of 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 2812.9  Appeals.

    An appeal pursuant to part 4 of 43 CFR Subtitle A, may be taken from 
any final decision of the authorized officer, to the Board of Land 
Appeals, Office of the Secretary.

Subpart 2881--Terms and Conditions of Right-of-Way Grants and Temporary 
                               Use Permits


<R05>
Sec. 2881.1  Nature of interest.


<R05>
Sec. 2881.1-1  Nature of right-of-way interest.

    (a) The United States retains a right to use a right-of-way and 
temporary use permit area or authorize the use of it to others in any 
manner not inconsistent with pipeline construction, operation, 
maintenance, and termination. The holder of a right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit has no right to any of the products of the land 
including, but not limited to, timber, forage, mineral, and animal 
resources. The holder may not allow the use of a right-of-way or 
temporary use permit area by others except its contractors, 
subcontractors, employees, agents or servants for purposes of 
construction, operation, maintenance, or termination of the pipeline.
    (b) A holder shall not use a right-of-way and temporary use permit 
area for any purpose other than for the construction, operation, 
maintenance, and termination of the pipeline specified in

[[Page 277]]

the holders right-of-way grant. A holder shall not locate or construct 
any other pipelines, including looping lines, or other improvements 
within a right-of-way without first securing appropriate authorization 
therefor.
    (c) The width of a right-of-way shall not exceed 50 feet plus the 
ground occupied by the pipeline (that is, the pipe and related 
facilities) unless the authorized officer finds and records the reasons 
for his finding, that a wider right-of-way is necessary for operation 
and maintenance after construction, or to protect the environment or 
public safety.
    (d) An applicant may apply to the authorized officer for a wider 
right-of-way in limited areas, if necessary:
    (1) For the operation and maintenance of the project after 
construction;
    (2) To protect the environment; or
    (3) To provide for the public safety. If the authorized officer 
finds that the additional width is necessary for one of the above 
reasons, he may authorize a wider width. Such authorization shall 
include a written report recording the reasons why the additional width 
is necessary.
    (e) A right-of-way grant issued or renewed under these regulations 
shall be limited to a reasonable term, not to exceed 30 years. No term 
shall be longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the 
grant. The authorized officer shall determine the duration of each 
right-of-way grant, taking into consideration, among other things:
    (1) The cost of the facility,
    (2) Its useful life,
    (3) Any public purpose it serves, and
    (4) Potentially conflicting uses of the land.
    (f) Except where a right-of-way grant has terminated by its terms 
upon the occurrence of a fixed or agreed upon condition, event, or time, 
it shall be renewed if the pipeline is being operated and maintained in 
accordance with all provisions of the right-of-way grant, these 
regulations and the Act. The authorized officer may modify the terms and 
conditions of the right-of-way grant at the time of renewal.
    (g) No purported transfer of an interest in a right-of-way grant, a 
right-of-way, or any portion of a pipeline system located within a 
right-of-way, shall be valid without the prior written approval of the 
authorized officer. Applications for such approval shall be directed to 
the authorized officer. A transferee shall meet all the requirements of 
an original pipeline right-of-way grantee is bound by and shall assume 
all of the transferor's responsibility to the United States with respect 
to the transferred interest and shall agree to be bound by all terms of 
any outstanding right-of-way grant or temporary use permit. Applications 
for a transfer of interest shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee 
of $50, except that where a holder assigns more than 1 right-of-way 
grant as part of a single action, the authorized officer, due to 
economies of scale, may set a fee of less than $50 per assignment.

[44 FR 58129, Oct. 9, 1979, as amended at 52 FR 25821, July 8, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 2881.1-2  Nature of temporary use permit interest.

    (a) A temporary use permit does not grant any interest in land and 
is revocable at will by the authorized officer.
    (b) The area covered by a temporary use permit shall be no greater 
than is necessary to accommodate the authorized use or to protect the 
environment or provide for public safety.
    (c) The duration of a temporary use permit shall be determined by 
the authorized officer in a manner that is consistent with construction 
activities, and is not to exceed that length of time needed to 
accomplish the purpose for which the permit is sought. The term of a 
temporary use permit shall not exceed 3 years subject to the provisions 
of this section.
    (d) A temporary use permit may be renewed at the discretion of the 
authorized officer, but the permittee has no right of renewal. The 
authorized officer may modify the terms and conditions of the temporary 
use permit at the time of renewal.
    (e) A temporary use permit may be assigned at the discretion of the 
authorized officer, provided the use for which the permit was issued 
continues.

    (4) To do everything reasonably within his or her power, both 
independently and upon request of the authorized officer, to prevent and 
suppress fires on or near the right-of-way and related facilities. This 
includes making available such construction and maintenance forces as 
may be reasonably obtained for the suppression of fires.
    (b) All right-of-way grants and temporary use permits issued, 
renewed, or amended under these regulations shall contain such terms, 
conditions, and stipulations as may be prescribed by the authorized 
officer regarding extent, duration, survey, location, construction, 
operation, maintenance, use, and termination. The authorized officer

Sec. 2882.3  Application processing.

    (a) The Secretary shall notify the House Committee on Interior and 
Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
promptly upon receipt of an application for a right-of-way grant for a 
pipeline 24 inches or more in diameter and no right-of-way grant for 
such a pipeline shall be issued until 60 days (not counting days on 
which the House of Representatives or the Senate has adjourned for more 
than 3 days) after a notice of intention to issue the right-of-way 
grant, together with the authorized officer's detailed findings as to 
terms and conditions he proposes to impose, has been submitted to such 
committees, unless each committee by resolution waives the waiting 
period.
    (b) Upon receipt of an application for a right-of-way grant, the 
authorized officer shall publish a notice of the application in the 
Federal Register and an announcement in a newspaper or newpapers having 
general circulation in the vicinity of the Federal lands affected, or, 
if in the opinion of the authorized officer, the pipeline impacts are of 
a minor nature, the notice of application may be waived or published 
only in a newspaper having general circulation in the area or areas in 
the vicinity of the affected Federal lands. The notice shall contain a 
description of the pipeline systems as required in Sec. 2882.2-3(a) (2) 
and (3) of this title, together with such other information as the 
authorized officer considers pertinent. The notice shall state where the 
application and related documents are available for interested persons 
to review. Copies of the notice shall be sent to the Governor of each 
State within which the pipeline system may be located, the head of each 
local government or jurisdiction within which the pipeline system may be 
located, and each agency head, for review and comment.
    (c) Where an application for a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit is incomplete or not in conformity with the Act or these 
regulations, the authorized officer may reject the application or notify 
the applicant of the deficiencies and afford the applicant an 
opportunity to file corrections. Where deficiency notices have not been 
adequately complied with, the authorized officer may reject the 
application or notify the applicant of the continuing deficiencies and 
afford the applicant an opportunity to file corrections.
    (d) The authorized officer may require the applicant for a right-of-
way grant or temporary use permit to submit such additional information 
as he deems necessary for review of the application.
    (e) An application for a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit 
which meets the requirements of the Act and of these regulations 
entitles the applicant only to full review of the application. Such 
application may be denied if the authorized officer determines that the 
right-of-way or use applied for would be inconsistent with the purpose 
to which the Federal lands involved have been committed, or would 
otherwise not be in the public interest.
    (f) The authorized officer shall hold public meetings or hearings on 
an application for a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit if he 
determines that such hearings or meetings are appropriate and sufficient 
public interest exists to warrant the time and expense

[[Page 282]]

of such meetings or hearings. Notice of any such meetings or hearings 
shall be published in the Federal Register and in local newspapers.
    (g) If the application involves a right-of-way through Federal lands 
under the jurisdiction of two or more Federal agencies, the authorized 
officer shall refer the application to the agency heads for consultation 
and other appropriate actions.
    (h) The authorized officer shall consult with other agencies as to 
any additional information which should be required from the applicant, 
conditions or stipulations which should be imposed, and whether the 
right-of-way grant or temporary use permit should be issued.
    (i) No right-of-way grant or temporary use permit over Federal lands 
under the jurisdiction of two or more Federal agencies and not within 
the jurisdiction of the agency by which the authorized officer is 
employed shall be issued or renewed by the authorized officer without 
the concurrence of the head of the agency administering such Federal 
lands or his authorized representative.
    (j) Where the surface of the Federal lands involved is administered 
by the Secretary or by two or more Federal agencies, the Secretary may, 
after consultation with the non-Interior agencies involved, grant or 
renew a right-of-way or temporary use permit through the Federal lands 
involved, with or without the concurrence of the heads of the agencies 
administering such Federal lands. A right-of-way through a Federal 
reservation shall not be granted if the Secretary determines that it 
would be inconsistent with the purposes of the reservation.
    (k) A right-of-way grant or temporary use permit need not conform to 
the applicant's proposal, but may contain such modifications, terms, 
stipulations or conditions including changes in route or site location 
as the authorized officer considers appropriate.
    (l) No right-of-way grant or temporary use permit shall be 
considered as being in effect until the applicant has accepted its 
terms, in writing. Written acceptance shall constitute an agreement 
between an applicant and the United States that, in consideration of the 
right to use Federal lands, the applicant shall abide by all terms and 
conditions contained therein and the provisions of applicable laws and 
regulations.
    (m) At the discretion of the authorized officer, a provision may be 
placed in a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit requiring that no 
construction or use shall occur until a detailed construction, 
operation, rehabilitation and environmental protection plan has been 
submitted to the authorized officer and a notice to proceed has been 
issued. This requirement may be imposed for all or any part of the 
right-of-way.

costs incurred by the United States in processing the application, 
including the preparation of reports and statements pursuant to the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), prior 
to the United States having incurred such costs. All costs shall be paid 
before the right-of-way grant or temporary use permit shall be issued 
under the regulations of this title.
    (2) The regulations contained in this subpart do not apply to State 
or local governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof where the

thereof or a municipal utility or cooperative whose principal source of 
revenue is derived from charges levied on customers for services 
rendered that are similar to services rendered by a profit making 
corporation or business enterprise.
    (3) The applicant shall submit with each application a nonrefundable 
application processing fee in the amount required by a schedule of fees 
for this purpose contained in paragraph (c) of this section which shall 
be based on a review of the use of the Federal lands for which the 
application is made, the resources affected and the complexity and costs 
to the United States for processing required by an application for a 
right-of-way grant and shall be established according to the following 
general categories:
    (i) Category I. An application for a right-of-way grant or temporary 
use permit to authorize a use of Federal lands for which the data 
necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act are 
available in the office of the authorized officer; and no field 
examination of the lands affected by the application is required;
    (ii) Category II. An application for a right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit to authorize a use of Federal lands for which the 
data necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act are 
available in the office of the authorized officer; and one field 
examination of the lands affected by the application to verify the 
existing data is required;
    (iii) Category III. An application for a right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit to authorize a use of Federal lands for which the 
data necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act are 
available in the office of the authorized officer; and two field 
examinations of the lands affected by the application to verify the data 
are required;
    (iv) Category IV. An application for a right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit to authorize a use of Federal lands for which some 
original data are required to be gathered to comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act; and two or three field examinations of the 
lands affected by the application are required;

purpose of determining the appropriate category and the nonrefundable 
application processing fee; however, the authorized officer shall 
collect the full amount of the nonrefundable application processing fee 
prior to processing such application. A record of the authorized 
officer's category determination shall be made and given to the 
applicant, and the decision is a final decision for purposes of appeal 
under Sec. 2884.1 of this title. Notwithstanding the pendency of such 
appeal, an application shall not be processed without payment of the fee 
determined by the authorized officer, and where such payment is made, 
the application may be processed and, if proper, the grant or permit 
issued. The authorized officer shall make any refund directed by the 
appeal decision. Where the amount of the nonrefundable application 
processing fee submitted by an applicant exceeds the amount of such fee 
as determined by the authorized officer, the authorized officer shall 
refund any excess unless requested in writing by the applicant to apply 
all or part of any such refund to the grant monitoring fee required by 
paragraph (b) of this section or to the rental payment for such grant or 
permit.
    (ii) During the processing of an application, the authorized officer 
may change a category determination to place an application in Category 
VI at any time that it is determined that the application requires 
preparation of an environmental impact statement. A record of change in 
category determination under this paragraph shall be

[[Page 284]]

made, and the decision is appealable in the same manner as an original 
category determination made under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) (i) An applicant whose application is determined to be in 
Category VI shall, in addition to the nonrefundable application 
processing fee, reimburse the United States for the full actual 
administrative and other costs of processing the application. The 
nonrefundable application processing fee required under the fee schedule 
shall be credited toward the total cost reimbursement obligation of such 
applicant. When such an application is filed, the authorized officer 
shall estimate the costs expected to be incurred in processing the 
application, inform the applicant of the estimated amount to be 
reimbursed and require the applicant to make periodic payments of such 
estimated reimbursable costs prior to such costs being incurred by the 
United States.
    (ii) If the payments required by paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section 
exceed the actual costs to the United States, the authorized officer may 
adjust the next billing to reflect the overpayment, or make a refund 
from applicable funds under the authority of 43 U.S.C. 1734. An 
applicant may not set off or otherwise deduct any debt due to it or any 
sum claimed to be owed it by the United States without the prior written 
approval of the authorized officer.
    (iii) Prior to issuance of a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit, an applicant subject to paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section 
shall pay such additional amounts as are necessary to reimburse the 
United States for any costs which exceed the payments required by 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.
    (iv) An applicant subject to paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section 
whose application is denied is responsible for costs incurred by the 
United States in processing the application, and such amounts as have 
not been paid in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section are 
due within 30 days of receipt of a bill from the authorized officer 
giving the amount due.
    (v) An applicant subject to paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section who 
withdraws an application before a decision is reached is responsible for 
costs incurred by the United States in processing the application up to 
the date the authorized officer receives written notice of the 
withdrawal, and for costs subsequently incurred in terminating the 
application review process. Such amounts as have not been paid in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section are due within 30 
days of receipt of a bill from the authorized officer giving the amount 
due.
    (6) When 2 or more applications for right-of-way grants are filed 
which the authorized officer determines to be in competition with each 
other, each applicant shall reimburse the United States as required by 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If reimbursement of actual costs is 
required under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, each applicant shall 
be responsible for the costs identifiable with his/her application. 
Costs that are not readily identifiable with one of the applications, 
such as costs for portions of an environmental impact statement that 
relate to all of the applications generally, shall be paid by each of 
the applicants in equal shares or such other proration as may be agreed 
to in writing by the applicants and authorized officer prior to the 
United States incurring such costs.
    (7) When, through partnership joint venture or other business 
arrangement, more than one person partnership, corporation, association 
or other entity apply together for a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit, each such applicant shall be jointly are severally liable for 
costs under this section.
    (8) When 2 or more noncompeting applications for right-of-way grants 
are received for what, in the judgment of the authorized officer, is one 
right-of-way system, all of the applicants shall be jointly and 
severally liable for costs under this section for the entire system, 
subject, however, to the provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (b) (1) After issuance of a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit for which a fee was assessed under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the holder thereof shall, prior to the United States having incurred 
such costs, reimburse the United States for costs incurred by the United 
States in monitoring the construction, operation,

[[Page 285]]

maintenance and termination of authorized facilities on the right-of-way 
or permit area, and for protection and rehabilitation of the lands 
involved. The monitoring cost category shall be the same as that for the 
application processing category for that project.
    (2) The holder shall submit a monitoring cost fee along with the 
written acceptance of the terms and conditions of the grant or permit 
pursuant to Sec. 2882.3(l) of this title. The amount of the required fee 
shall be determined by the schedule of fees described in paragraph (c) 
of this section. Acceptance of the terms and conditions of the grant or 
permit shall not be effective unless the required fee is paid.
    (3) A holder whose application was determined to be in Category VI 
for application processing purposes shall reimburse the United States 
for the actual administrative costs and other costs of monitoring the 
grant or permit. When such a grant or permit is issued, the authorized 
officer shall estimate the costs expected to be incurred in monitoring 
the grant or permit, inform the holder of the estimated amount to be 
reimbursed and require the holder to make periodic payment of such 
estimated reimburseable costs prior to such costs being incurred by the 
United States.
    (4) If the payments required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
exceed the actual costs of the United States, the authorized officer may 
adjust the next billing to reflect the overpayment, or make a refund 
from applicable funds under the authority of 43 U.S.C. 1734. A holder 
may not set off or otherwise deduct any debt due to it or any sum 
claimed to be owed it by the United States without the prior written 
approval of the authorized officer.
    (5) Following termination of a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit, any grantee or permittee that was determined to be in Category 
VI shall pay such additional amounts as are necessary to reimburse the 
United States for any costs which exceed the payments required by 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

administration of right-of-way grants and temporary use permits 
pertaining to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System shall be made by payment 
of such sums as the Secretary determines to be required to reimburse the 
Department of the Interior for the actual costs of these services. In 
processing applications and administering right-of-way grants and 
temporary use permits relating to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the 
Department of the Interior shall avoid unnecessary employment of 
personnel and needless expenditure of funds as determined by the 
Secretary. Reimbursement of costs shall be made for each quarter ending

<R05>
Sec. 2883.1-4  Liability.

incurred by the United States in connection with the use and occupancy 
of the right-of-way or permit area.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, holders 
shall be held to a standard of strict liability for any activity within 
a right-of-way or permit area which the authorized officer determines, 
in his discretion, presents a foreseeable hazard or risk of damage or 
injury to the United States. The activities and facilities to which such 
standard shall apply shall be specified in the right-of-way grant or 
temporary use permit. Strict liability shall not be imposed for damage 
or injury resulting primarily from an act of war or the negligence of 
the United States. To the extent consistent with other laws, strict 
liability shall extend to costs incurred by the United States for 
control and abatement of conditions, such as fire or oil spills, which 
threaten lives, property or the environment, regardless of whether the 
threat occurs on areas that are under Federal jurisdiction. Stipulations 
in right-of-way grants and temporary use permits imposing strict 
liability shall specify a maximum limitation on damages which, in the 
judgment of the authorized officer, is commensurate with the foreseeable 
risks or hazards presented. The maximum limitation shall not exceed 
$1,000,000 for any one event, and any liability in excess of such amount 
shall be determined by the ordinary rules of negligence of the 
jurisdiction in which the damage or injury occurred.
    (c) In any case where strict liability is imposed and the damage or 
injury was caused by a third party, the rules of subrogation shall apply 
in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the damage or 
injury occurred.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, holders 
shall be fully liable for injuries or damages to third parties resulting 
from activities or facilities on lands under Federal jurisdiction, in 
accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the damage or 
injury occurred.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, holders 
shall fully indemnify or hold harmless the United States for liability, 
damage or claims arising in connection with the use and occupancy of 
right-of-way or permit areas.
    (f) If a holder is a State or local government, or agency or 
instrumentality thereof, it shall be liable to the fullest extent its 
laws allow at the time it is granted a right-of-way grant or temporary 
use permit. To the extent such a holder does not have the power to 
assume liability, it shall be required to repair damage or make 
restitution to the fullest extent of its powers at the time of any 
damage or injury.
    (g) All owners of any interest in, and all affiliates or 
subsidiaries of any holder of a right-of-way grant or temporary use 
permit, except for corporate stockholders, shall be jointly and 
severally liable to the United States in the event that a claim cannot 
be satisfied by a holder.
    (h) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the 
provisions in this section for a remedy is not intended to limit or

lands. In the case of oil or gas produced from Federal lands or from the 
resources on the Federal lands in the vicinity of the pipeline, the 
Secretary may, after a full hearing with due notice thereof to 
interested parties and a proper finding of facts, determine the 
proportionate amounts to be accepted, conveyed, transported, or 
purchased.
    (b) The common carrier provisions of this section shall not apply to 
any natural gas pipeline operated by any person subject to regulation 
under the Natural Gas Act or by any public utility subject to regulation 
by a State or municipal regulatory agency having jurisdiction to 
regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers 
within the State or municipality. Where natural gas not subject to State 
regulatory or conservation laws governing its purchase by pipeline 
companies is offered for sale, each pipeline company shall purchase, 
without discrimination, any such natural gas produced in the vicinity of 
the pipeline.
    (c) The authorized officer shall require, prior to issuing or 
renewing a right-of-way grant, that the applicant submit and disclose 
all plans, contracts, agreements, or other information or material which 
the authorized officer considers necessary to determine whether a right-
of-way grant shall be issued or renewed and the terms and conditions 
which should be included in the grant. Such information may include, but 
is not limited to:
    (1) Conditions for, and agreements among, owners or operators 
regarding the addition of pumping facilities, looping, or otherwise 
increasing the pipeline or terminal's throughput capacity in response to 
actual or anticipated increases in demand;

are agreed to by the authorized officer and agency head.
    (b) An applicant shall promptly notify the authorized officer of any 
changes in its plans, financial condition, or other factors relevant to 
the application, and shall modify the application promptly to reflect 
any such changes. If the requirements of this subsection are not 
complied with in the opinion of the authorized officer, the application 
may be rejected.
    (c) The holder shall at all times keep the authorized officer 
informed of his or her address, and in the case of a corporation, of the 
address of its principle place of business and the names and addresses 
of its principle officers.
    (d) Any proposed change in the route of the pipeline or change in 
the use of Federal lands under the Act will require an amended or new 
right-of-way grant or temporary use permit from the authorized officer. 
Any unauthorized activity may be subject to prosecution under applicable 
laws.
    (e) Holders of pipeline right-of-way grants issued before November 
16, 1973, must apply under the Act and these regulations for 
modifications of the route or change in the use of Federal lands in 
connection with such right-of-way.
    (f) The authorized officer may ratify or confirm a right-of-way 
grant or temporary use permit that was issued under any provision of law 
if the right-of-way grant or temporary use permit is modified to comply 
with the provisions of the Act and regulations. Such modifications are

with any required plans and specifications, and applicable Federal and 
State laws and regulations.

Sec. 2883.5  Immediate temporary suspension of activities.

    (a) If the authorized officer determines that any activity being 
conducted or authorized by a holder within a right-of-way or temporary 
use permit area is endangering public health or safety or the 
environment, he may order the immediate suspension of that activity and 
immediate remedial action.
    (b) The authorized officer may order immediate suspension of an 
activity irrespective of any action that has been or is being taken by

<R05>
Sec. 2911.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Act means the Act of May 24, 1928, as amended (49 U.S.C. 
Appendix, 211-213).
    (b) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management who has been delegated the authority to perform the duties 
described in this subpart.
    (c) Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (d) Applicant means any individual who is a citizen of the United 
States; a group or association of citizens of the United States; any 
corporation, organized under the laws of the United States or of any 
State, authorized to conduct business in the State in which the land 
involved is located; or a State or political subdivisions or 
instrumentality thereof, including counties and municipalities; who 
submits an application for an airport lease under this subpart.
    (e) Public airport means an airport open to use by all persons 
without prior permission of the airport lessee or operator, and without 
restrictions within the physical capacities of its available facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 2911.0-8  Lands available for leasing.

    Any contiguous unreserved and unappropriated public lands, surveyed 
or unsurveyed, not exceeding 2,560 acres

[[Page 291]]

in area, may be leased under the provisions of the Act, subject to valid 
existing rights under the public land laws.


<R05>
Sec. 2911.1  Terms and conditions.

    (a) The lessee shall, within 1 year from the date of issuance of the 
lease, equip the airport as required by the Administrator and file a 
report thereof in the Bureau of Land Management District office having 
jurisdiction over the lands under lease.
    (b) At any time during the term of the lease, the Administrator may 
have an inspection made of the airport, and if the the airport does not 
comply with the ratings set by the Federal Aviation Administration, the 
Administrator shall submit a written statement describing the 
deficiencies to the Bureau of Land Management District office having 
jurisdiction over the lands under lease for appropriate action.
    (c) The authorized officer may cancel, in whole or in part, a lease 
issued under the Act for any of the following reasons: Lessee failure to 
use the leased premises or any part thereof for a period of at least 6 
months; use of the property or any part thereof for a purpose other than 
the authorized use; failure to pay the annual rental in full on or 
before the date due; failure to maintain the premises according to the 
ratings set by the Federal Aviation Administration; failure to comply 
with the regulations in this part or the terms of the lease.
    (d) Leases under the Act shall be for a period not to exceed 20

the laws of the United States or any State shall be at appraised fair 
market rental, with a minimum annual rental payment of $100. State or 
political subdivisions thereof, including counties and municipalities, 
shall pay to the lessor an annual rental calculated at the appraised 
fair market value of the rental of the property less 50%, with a minimum 
annual rental payment of $100. In fixing the rentals, consideration 
shall be given to all pertinent facts and circumstances, including use 
of the airport by government departments and agencies. Rental of each 
lease shall be reconsidered and revised at 5-year intervals to reflect 
current appraised fair market value. The first annual rental payment 
shall be made prior to issuance of the lease. All subsequent payments

<R05>
Sec. 2911.2-1  Preapplication activity.

    Persons seeking to lease public lands under this subpart shall first 
consult with the authorized officer in the District or Resource Area 
Office in which the lands are located. Such consultation is necessary to 
determine land availability and conformity of proposed use with approved 
land use plans, explain associated statutory and regulatory 
requirements, familiarize the potential applicant with respective 
management responsibilities, set forth the application processing 
procedures for the proposed action, and identify potential conflicts. 
Upon completion of the consultation, persons seeking to lease public 
lands for a public airport may submit an application for consideration 
by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 2911.2-2  Applications.

    (a) Each application shall clearly describe the lands applied for by 
legal subdivisions and/or by metes and bounds and contain a plan of 
development and use signed by the applicant or by a duly authorized 
agent or officer of the applicant. When required by the authorized 
officer, the application

[[Page 292]]

shall include copies of the appropriate State, county, or municipal 
airport licenses or permits, as well as such additional States and local 
clearances as may be required.
    (b) Each application shall be accompanied by a non-refundable filing 
fee of $100. Each applicant shall also be required to pay the cost of 
publication of a Notice of Reality Action in the Federal Register and a 
newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the lands are 
located.
    (c) If approval of an application results in cancellation of a 
grazing permit of lease or a reduction in grazing acreage, the 
provisions of Sec. 4110.4-2 of this title shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 2911.2-3  Report by Administrator; Notice of Realty Action.

    (a) Upon receipt of the application, the authorized officer shall 
send 1 copy to the Administrator for a determination concerning what 
fuel facilities, lights, and other furnishings are necessary to meet the 
rating set by that agency. After receiving the report of the 
Administrator, and before making a determination to issue a lease, the 
authorized officer shall publish a Notice of Realty Action in the 
Federal Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 
of the lands to be leased. The notice shall provide 45 days from the 
date of publication in the Federal Register for comments by the public. 
Comments shall be sent to the office issuing the notice. The notice 
shall not be published until the authorized officer has received the 
filing fee from the applicant and is satisfied that all statutory and 
regulatory requirements have been met.
    (b) The notice of realty action may segregate the lands or interests 
in lands to be conveyed to the extent that they will not be subject to 
appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. The 
segregative effect of the notice of realty action shall terminate either 
upon issuance of a document of conveyance or 1 year from the date of 
publication in the Federal Register, whichever occurs first.

its term, any rental paid for the unexpired portion of the term shall be 
returned to the lessee upon a proper application for repayment to the 
extent that the amount paid covers a full lease year or years of the 
remainder of the term of the original lease. Leases for recreational or 
historic-monument purposes to a State, county or other State or Federal

    Source: 35 FR 9665, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2916.0-3  Authority.

    The Act of July 3, 1926 (44 Stat. 821, 48 U.S.C. secs. 360, 361), 
authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease public lands on the 
mainland of or islands in Alaska, with the exception of the Pribilof 
Islands, for fur farming, for periods not exceeding ten years.


<R05>
Sec. 2916.0-6  Policy.

    (a) The authority to lease the public lands in Alaska for fur-
farming purposes was granted in order to promote the development of the 
production of furs in Alaska.
    (b) No lease for the purpose of raising beavers will be granted on 
any area already occupied by a beaver colony nor will any such lease be 
granted on streams or lakes where the activities of beavers may 
interfere with the run or spawning of salmon.
    (c) In order to offer more people an opportunity to lease lands, and 
to avoid tying up large areas of land unnecessarily, fur-farming leases 
on public lands will not be granted for areas greater than are justified 
by the needs and experience of the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 2916.0-8  Area subject to lease.

    (a) Acreage limitation and exceptions. (1) On the mainland such 
leases may be for an area not exceeding 640 acres. A lease may cover an 
entire island, provided the area thereof does not exceed 30 square 
miles, and provided the need for such entire island is clearly 
established. Islands so close together that animals can cross from one 
to the other and whose combined area does not exceed 30 square miles, 
will be treated as one island. Islands having an area of more than 30 
square miles will be treated as mainland.

[[Page 294]]

    (2) Where a lease is granted for an area in excess of 640 acres on 
an island, the manager may, after notice to the lessee, reduce the area 
to an amount not less than 640 acres, if he determines that the lessee 
cannot reasonably use all of the area for which the lease was granted.
    (b) Lands subject to lease. (1) Vacant, unreserved, and 
unappropriated public lands are subject to lease.
    (2) Except for lands under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Park Service, public lands withdrawn or 
reserved for any purpose are subject to lease, if the department or 
agency having jurisdiction thereof consents to the issuance of the 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 2916.1  Terms and conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 2916.1-1  Commencement of operations; stocking lands.

    The lessee shall, within one year from the date of issuance of the 
lease, commence operations by taking possession of the leased area, and 
by placing thereon within that period such improvements as may be needed 
for such operations and as will show good faith, and shall thereafter 
develop the fur-farming enterprise on the leased area with reasonable 
diligence. The lessee shall stock the leased area with the minimum of 
fur-bearing animals required by the lease within the periods specified 
in the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 2916.1-2  Rights reserved; protection of improvements and roads.

patenting of mineral resources in the leased area under laws applicable 
thereto.
    (b) The use and disposal of timber or other resources on or in the 
leased area under applicable laws.
    (c) The use and occupation of parts of leased areas for the taking, 
preparing, manufacturing, or storing of fish or fish products, or the

Director.
    (d) The acquisition or granting of rights-of-way or easements under 
applicable laws and regulations.
    (e) Hunting and fishing under applicable Federal and State hunting 
and fishing laws and regulations, but the authorized officer may 
prohibit or restrict, or he may authorize the lessee to prohibit or 
restrict hunting or fishing on such parts of the leased area and for 
such periods as he may determine to be necessary in order to prevent any 
substantial interference with the purposes for which the lease is 
issued.

duration as may be fixed, not exceeding 10 years. The filing of an 
application for renewal does not confer on

[[Page 296]]

the lessee any preference right to a renewal. The timely filing of an 
application will, however authorize the exclusive fur-farming use of the 
lands by the lessee in accordance with the terms of the prior lease 
pending final action on the renewal application.

any of the provisions of this part or of the lease, or shall devote the 
lease area primarily to any purpose other than the rearing of fur-
bearing animals as authorized. No lease will be canceled until the 
lessee has been formally notified of such default and such default shall 
continue for 60 days after service of such notice.
    (b) Removal of improvements and personal property. (1) Improvements 
or personal property may not be removed from the lands, except fur-
bearing animals disposed of in the regular course of business, unless 
all moneys due the United States under the lease have been paid. The 
lessee shall be allowed 90 days from the date of expiration or 
termination of the lease within which to remove his personal property 
and such improvements as are not disposed of in the manner set forth in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which he has a right to remove; if not 
removed or otherwise disposed of within the said period, such 
improvements or personal property shall become the property of the 
United States.
    (2) Upon the expiration of the lease or the earlier termination 
thereof, the authorizing officer may, in his discretion and upon a 
written petition filed by the lessee within 30 days from the date of 
such expiration or termination, require the subsequent lease applicant, 
prior to the execution of a new lease, to agree to compensate the lessee 
for any improvements of a permanent nature that he may have placed upon 
the leased area for fur-farming purposes during the period of the lease. 
If the interested parties are unable to reach an agreement as to the 
amount of compensation, the amount shall be fixed by the authorizing 
officer. All such agreements to be effective, must be approved by the 
authorizing officer. The failure of the subsequent lessee to pay the 
former lessee in accordance with such agreement will be just cause for 
cancellation of the lease.

     Subpart 2920--Leases, Permits and Easements: General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 2920.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations in this part is to establish 
procedures for the orderly and timely processing of proposals for non-
Federal use of the public lands. The procedural and informational 
requirements set by these regulations vary in relation to the nature of 
the anticipated use.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.0-3  Authority.

    Sections 302, 303 and 310 of the Federal Land Policy and Management 
Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1732, 1733, 1740) authorize the Secretary of the 
Interior to issue regulations providing for the use, occupancy, and 
development of the public lands through leases, permits, and easements.

[52 FR 49115, Dec. 29, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 2920.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    (a) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management to whom has been delegated the authority to perform the 
duties described in this part.
    (b) Easement means an authorization for a non-possessory, non-
exclusive interest in lands which specifies the rights of the holder and 
the obligation of the Bureau of Land Management to use and manage the 
lands in a manner consistent with the terms of the easement.
    (c) Lease means an authorization to possess and use public lands for 
a fixed period of time.
    (d) Permit means a short-term revocable authorization to use public 
lands for specified purposes.
    (e) Land use proposal means an informal statement, in writing, from 
any person to the authorized officer requesting consideration of a 
specified use of the public lands.
    (f) Land use plan means resource management plans or management 
framework plans prepared by the Bureau of Land Management pursuant to 
its land use planning system.
    (g) Public lands means lands or interests in lands administered by 
the Bureau of Land Management, except lands located on the Outer 
Continental Shelf and lands held for the benefit of Indians, Aleuts and 
Eskimos.
    (h) Person means any person or entity legally capable of conveying 
and holding lands or interests therein, under the laws of the State 
within which the lands or interests therein are located, who is a 
citizen of the United States, or in the case of a corporation, is 
subject to the laws of any State or of the United States.
    (i) Proponent means any person who submits a land use proposal, 
either on his/her own initiative or in response to a notice for 
submission of such proposals.
    (j) Applicant means any person who submits an application for a land 
use authorization under this part.
    (k) Casual use means any short term non-commercial activity which 
does not cause appreciable damage or disturbance to the public lands, 
their resources or improvements, and which is not prohibited by closure 
of the lands to such activities.
    (l) Land use authorization means any authorization to use the public 
lands issued under this part.
    (m) Knowing and willful means that a violation is knowingly and 
willfully committed if it constitutes the voluntary or conscious 
performance of an act which is prohibited or the voluntary or conscious 
failure to perform an act or duty that is required. The terms does not 
include performances or failures to perform which are honest mistakes or 
which are merely inadvertent. The term includes, but does not require, 
performances or failures to perform which result from a criminal or evil 
intent or from a specific intent to violate the law. The knowing or 
willful nature of conduct may be established by plain indifference to or 
reckless disregard of the requirements of law, regulations, orders, or 
terms of a lease. A consistent pattern of performance or failure to 
perform also may be sufficient to establish the knowing or willful 
nature of the conduct, where such consistent pattern is neither the 
result of honest mistake or mere inadvertency. Conduct which is 
otherwise regarded as being knowing or willful is

[[Page 298]]

rendered neither accidental nor mitigated in character by the belief 
that the conduct is reasonable or legal.

<R05>
Sec. 2920.1  Uses.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.1-1  Authorized use.

    Any use not specifically authorized under other laws or regulations 
and not specifically forbidden by law may be authorized under this part. 
Uses which may be authorized include residential, agricultural, 
industrial, and commercial, and uses that cannot be authorized under 
title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act or section 28 of 
the Mineral Leasing Act. Land use authorizations shall be granted under 
the following categories:
    (a) Leases shall be used to authorize uses of public lands involving 
substantial construction, development, or land improvement and the 
investment of large amounts of capital which are to be amortized over 
time. A lease conveys a possessory interest and is revocable only in 
accordance with its terms and the provisions of Sec. 2920.9-3 of this 
title. Leases shall be issued for a term, determined by the authorized 
officer, that is consistent with the time required to amortize the 
capital investment.
    (b) Permits shall be used to authorize uses of public lands for not 
to exceed 3 years that involve either little or no land improvement, 
construction, or investment, or investment which can be amortized within 
the term of the permit. A permit conveys no possessory interest. The 
permit is renewable at the discretion of the authorized officer and may 
be revoked in accordance with its terms and the provisions of 
Sec. 2920.9-3 of this title. Permits shall be issued on a form approved 
by the Director, Bureau of Land Management, that has been filed by the 
applicant with the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office.
    (c) Easements may be used to assure that uses of public lands are 
compatible with non-Federal uses occurring on adjacent or nearby land. 
The term of the easement shall be determined by the authorized officer. 
An easement granted under this part may be issued only for purposes not 
authorized under title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
or section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act.

[[Page 299]]

    (d) No land use authorization is required under the regulations in 
this part for casual use of the public lands.

[52 FR 49115, Dec. 29, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 2920.1-2  Unauthorized use.

    (a) Any use, occupancy, or development of the public lands, other 
than casual use as defined in Sec. 2920.0-5(k) of this title, without 
authorization under the procedures in Sec. 2920.1-1 of this title, shall 
be considered a trespass. Anyone determined by the authorized officer to 
be in trespass on the public lands shall be notified of such trespass 
and shall be liable to the United States for:
    (1) The administrative costs incurred by the United States as a 
consequence of such trespass; and
    (2) The fair market value rental of the lands for the current year 
and past years of trespass; and
    (3) Rehabilitating and stabilizing the lands that were the subject 
of such trespass, or if the person determined to be in trespass does not 
rehabilitate and stabilize the lands determined to be in trespass within 
the period set by the authorized officer in the notice, he/she shall be 
liable for the costs incurred by the United States in rehabilitating and 
stabilizing such lands.
    (b) In addition, the following penalties may be assessed by the 
authorized officer for a trespass not timely resolved under paragraph 
(a) of this section and where the trespass is determined to be:
    (1) Nonwillful, twice the fair market rental value which has accrued 
since the inception of the trespass, not to exceed a total of 6 years; 
or
    (2) Knowing and willful, three times the fair market rental value 
which has accrued since the inception of the trespass, not to exceed a 
total of 6 years.
    (c) For any person found to be in trespass on the public lands under 
this section, the authorized officer may take action under Sec. 2920.9-3 
of this title to terminate, revoke, or cancel any land use authorization 
issued to such person under this part.
    (d) Failure to satisfy the liability and penalty requirements 
imposed under this section for unauthorized use of the public lands may 
result in denial of:
    (1) A use authorization under this part; and
    (2) A request to purchase or exchange public lands filed under 
subparts 2711 and 2201 of this title.
    (e) Any person who knowingly and willfully violates the regulations 
in this part by using the public lands without the authorization 
required by this part, in addition to the civil penalties provided for 
in this part, may be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or 
imprisonment of not more than 12 months, or both under subpart 9262 of 
this title.
    (f) Any person adversely affected by a decision issued under this 
section, may appeal that decision under the provisions of part 4 of this 
title.

<R05>
Sec. 2920.2  Procedures for public-initiated land use proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.2-1  Discussion of proposals.

    (a) Suggestions by land use proponent. Any person who seeks to use 
public lands may contact the Bureau of Land Management office having 
jurisdiction over the public lands in question and discuss the land use 
proposal. This contact should be made as early as possible so that 
administrative requirements and potential conflicts with other land uses 
can be identified.
    (b) Response by the authorized officer. The authorized officer will 
discuss with the land use proponent whether the requested land use, 
suitability or non-suitability of the requested land use based on a 
preliminary examination of existing land use plans, where available, is 
or is not in conformance with Bureau of Land Management policies and 
programs for the lands, local zoning ordinances and any other pertinent 
information. The authorized officer will discuss administrative 
requirements for the type of land use authorization which may be granted 
(lease, permit or easement), including, but not limited to: additional 
information which may be required; qualifications; cost reimbursement 
requirements; associated clearances, other permits or licenses which may 
be required; environmental and management considerations; and special 
requirements such as competitive bidding and identification of on-the-
ground investigations

[[Page 300]]

which may be required in order to issue a land use authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.2-2  Minimum impact permits.

    (a) The authorized officer may, without publication of a notice of 
realty action, issue a permit for a land use upon a determination that 
the proposed use is in conformance with Bureau of Land Management plans, 
policies and programs, local zoning ordinances and any other 
requirements and will not cause appreciable damage or disturbance to the 
public lands, their resources or improvements.
    (b) Permit decisions made under paragraph (a) of this section take 
effect immediately upon execution, and remain in effect during the 
period of time specified in the decision to issue the permit. Any person 
whose interest is adversely affected by a decision to grant or deny a 
permit under paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the Board of 
Land Appeals under part 4 of this title. However, decisions and permits 
issued under paragraph (a) of this section will remain in effect until 
stayed.

<R05>
Sec. 2920.2-3  Other land use proposals.

    (a) A proposal for a land use authorization, including permits not 
covered by Sec. 2920.2-2 of this title, shall be submitted in writing to 
the Bureau of Land Management office having jurisdiction over the public 
lands covered by the proposal.
    (b) The submission of a proposal gives no right to use the public 
lands.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.2-4  Proposal content.

    (a) Proposals for a land use authorization shall include a 
description of the proposed land use in sufficient detail to enable the 
authorized officer to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed land use, 
the impacts if any, on the environment, the public or other benefits 
from the proposed land use, the approximate cost of the proposal, any 
threat to the public health and safety posed by the proposal and whether 
the proposal is, in the proponent's opinion, in conformance with Bureau 
of Land Management plans, programs and policies for the public lands 
covered by the proposal. The description shall include, but not be 
limited to:
    (1) Details of the proposed uses and activities;
    (2) A description of all facilities for which authorization is 
sought, access needs and special types of easements that may be needed;
    (3) A map of sufficient scale to allow all of the required 
information to be legible and a legal description of primary and 
alternative project locations; and
    (4) A schedule for construction of any facilities.
    (b) The proposal shall include the name, legal mailing address and 
telephone number of the land use proponent.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.2-5  Proposal review.

    (a) A land use proposal shall, upon submission, be reviewed to 
determine if the public lands covered by the proposal are appropriate 
for the proposed land use and if the proposal is otherwise legal.
    (b) If the proposal is found to be appropriate for further 
consideration, the authorized officer shall examine the proposal and 
make one of the following determinations:
    (1) The proposed land use is in conformance with the appropriate 
land use plan and can be approved;
    (2) The proposed land use has not been addressed in an existing land 
use plan and shall be addressed in accordance with the procedure in part 
1600 of this title;
    (3) The proposed land use is in an area not covered in an existing 
land use plan and shall be processed in accordance with the procedure in 
Sec. 1601.8 of this title; or
    (4) The proposed land use is not in conformance with the approved 
land use plan. This determination may be appealed under 43 CFR 4.400 for 
review of the question of conformance with the land use plan.
    (c)(1) If a proposed land use does not meet the requirements of this 
subpart or is found not to be in conformance with the land use plan, the 
authorized officer shall so advise the proponent and shall provide a 
written explanation of the reasons the proposed use does

[[Page 301]]

not meet the requirements of this subpart and/or is not in conformance 
with an existing land use plan.
    (2) Where a proposed land use is determined not to be in conformance 
with an approved land use plan, with the land use plan, the authorized 
officer may consider the proposal for land use as an application to 
amend or revise the existing land use plan under part 1600 of this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.3  Bureau of Land Management initiated land use proposals.

    Where, as a result of the land use planning process, the 
desirability of allowing use of the public lands or providing increased 
service to the public from such use of the public lands is demonstrated, 
the authorized officer may identify a use for the public land and notify 
the public that proposals for utilizing the land through a lease, permit 
or easement will be considered.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.4  Notice of realty action.

    (a) A notice of realty action indicating the availability of public 
lands for non-Federal uses through lease, permit or easement shall be 
issued, published and sent to parties of interest by the authorized 
officer, including, but not limited to, adjoining land owners and 
current or past land users, when a determination has been made that such 
public lands are available for a particular use either through the 
submission of a public initiated proposal or through the land use 
planning process.
    (b) The notice shall include the use proposed for the public lands 
and shall notify the public that applications for a lease, permit or 
easement shall be considered. The notice shall specify the form of 
negotiation, whether by competitive or non-competitive bidding, under 
which the land use authorization shall be issued. A notice of realty 
action is not a specific action implementing a resource management plan 
or amendment.
    (c) The notice of realty action shall be published once in the 
Federal Register and once a week for 3 weeks thereafter in a newspaper 
of general circulation in the vicinity of the public lands included in 
the land use proposal.
    (d) An application submitted before a notice of realty action is 
published shall not be processed and shall be returned to the person who

    (a) Applications for land use authorizations shall include a 
reference to the notice of realty action under which the application is 
filed and a description of the proposed land use in sufficient detail to 
enable the authorized officer to evaluate the feasibility of the 
proposed land use, the impacts, if any, on the environment, the public 
or other benefits from the land use, the approximate cost of the 
proposed land use, any threat to the public health and safety posed by 
the proposed use and whether the proposed use is, in the opinion of the

programs and policies for the public lands covered by the proposed use. 
The description shall include, but not be limited to:
    (1) Details of the proposed uses and activities;
    (2) A description of all facilities for which authorization is 
sought, access needs and special types of easements that may be needed;
    (3) A map of sufficient scale to allow all of the required 
information to be legible and a legal description of primary and 
alternative project locations; and
    (4) A schedule for construction of any facilities.
    (b) Additional information:
    (1) After review of the project description, the authorized officer 
may require the applicant(s) to fund or to perform additional studies or 
submit

[[Page 302]]

additional environmental data, or both, so as to enable the Bureau of 
Land Management to prepare an environmental analysis in accordance with 
section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and comply with the requirements of the National 
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470); The Archeological and 
Historic Preservation Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 469 et seq.); Executive 
Order 11593, ``Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment'' 
of May 13, 1971 (36 FR 8921); ``Procedures for the Protection of 
Historic and Cultural Properties'' (36 CFR part 300); and other laws and 
regulations as applicable.
    (2) An application for the use of public lands may require 
additional private, State, local or other Federal agency licenses, 
permits, easements, certificates or other approval documents. The 
authorized officer may require the applicant to furnish such documents, 
or proof of application for such documents, as part of the application.
    (3) The authorized officer may require evidence that the applicant 
has, or prior to commencement of construction will have, the technical 
and financial capability to construct, operate, maintain and terminate 
the authorized land use.
    (c) The application shall include the name and legal mailing address 
of the applicant.
    (d) Business Associations. If the applicant is other than an 
individual, the application shall include the name and address of an 
agent authorized to receive notice of actions pertaining to the 
application.
    (e) Federal departments and agencies. Federal departments and 
agencies are not qualified to hold land use authorizations under this 
authority.

been submitted as part of a land use proposal submitted under 
Sec. 2920.2 of this title, the application need only refer to that 
proposal by filing date, office and case number. The applicant shall 
certify that there have been no changes in any of the information.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.5-3  Application review.

    Every application shall be reviewed to determine if it conforms to

requirements of this subpart, the application may be denied, and the 
applicant shall be so advised in writing, with an explanation.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.5-4  Competitive or non-competitive bids.

    (a) Competitive. Land use authorizations may be offered on a 
competitive basis if, in the judgment of the authorized officer, a 
competitive interest exists or if no equities, such as prior use of the 
lands, warrant non-competitive land use authorization. Land use 
authorizations shall be awarded on the basis of the public benefit to be 
provided, the financial and technical capability of the bidder to 
undertake the project and the bid offered. A bid at less than fair 
market value shall not be considered. Each bidder shall submit 
information required by the notice of realty action.
    (b) Non-competitive. Land use authorizations may be offered on a 
negotiated, non-competitive basis, when, in the judgement of the 
authorized officer equities, such as prior use of the lands, exist, no 
competitive interest exists or where competitive bidding would represent 
unfair competitive and economic disadvantage to the originator of the 
unique land use concept. The non-competitive bid shall not be for less 
than fair market value.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.5-5  Application processing.

applicant, in writing, of the selection. All other applications shall be 
rejected and returned to the applicants.
    (b) The selected land use applicant shall submit any additional 
information that the authorized officer considers necessary to process 
the land use authorization.

[[Page 303]]


<R05>
Sec. 2920.6  Reimbursement of costs.

    (a) When two or more applications are submitted for a land use 
authorization, each applicant shall be liable for the identifiable costs 
of processing his (or her) application. Where the costs of processing 
two or more applications cannot be readily identified with particular 
applications, all applicants shall be liable for such costs, to be 
divided equally among them.
    (b) The selected land use applicant shall reimburse the United 
States for reasonable administrative and other costs incurred by the 
United States in processing a land use authorization application and in 
monitoring construction, operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of 
facilities authorized under this part, including preparation of reports 
and statements required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(43 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). The reimbursement of costs shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2803.1-1 of this title, except 
that any permit whose total rental is less than $250 shall be exempt 
from reimbursement of costs requirements.
    (c) The authorized officer may, before beginning any processing of a 
land use authorization application, require payment, as may be needed, 
to cover the estimated costs of processing the application. Before 
granting a land use authorization, the authorized officer shall assess 
and collect the actual costs of processing after furnishing the 
applicant with a statement of costs. This payment shall be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2803 of this title.
    (d) A selected applicant who withdraws, in writing, a land use 
application before a final decision is reached on the authorization is 
responsible for all costs incurred by the United States in processing 
the application up to the day that the authorized officer receives 
notice of the withdrawal and for costs subsequently incurred by the 
United States in terminating the proposed land use authorization 
process. Reimbursement of such costs shall be paid within 30 days of 
receipt of notice from the authorized officer of the amount due.
    (e) Advance payments based on a schedule of rates developed by the 
authorized officer, are required for monitoring of operations and 
maintenance during the term of the land use authorization, which amount 
shall be paid simultaneously with the rental payment required by 
Sec. 2920.8(a) of this title.
    (f) The selected applicant shall, before a land use authorization is 
issued, submit a payment based on a schedule of rates developed by the 
Director, Bureau of Land Management, for monitoring rehabilitation or 
restoration of the lands upon expiration of the land use authorization.
    (g) If payment, as required by paragraphs (b), (d) and (e) of this 
section, exceeds actual costs to the United States, refund may be made 
by the authorized officer from applicable funds under authority of 43 
U.S.C. 1734, or the authorized officer may adjust the next billing to 
reflect the overpayment. Neither an applicant nor a holder of land use 
authorization shall set off or otherwise deduct any debt due to or any 
sum claimed to be owed them by the United States without the prior 
written approval of the authorized officer.
    (h) The authorized officer shall, on request, give a selected 
applicant an estimate, based on the best available cost information, of 
the costs, which may be incurred by the United States in processing the 
proposed land use authorization. However, reimbursement shall not be 
limited to the estimate of the authorized officer if actual costs exceed 
the projected estimate.
    (i) When through partnership, joint venture or other business 
arrangement, more than one person, partnership, corporation, association 
or other entity jointly make application for a land use authorization, 
each such party shall be jointly and severally liable for the costs 
under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 2920.7  Terms and conditions.

    (a) In all land use authorizations the United States reserves the 
right to use the public lands or to authorize the use

[[Page 304]]

of the public lands by the general public in any way compatible or 
consistent with the authorized land use and such reservations shall be 
included as a part of all land use authorizations. Authorized 
representatives of the Department of the Interior, other Federal 
agencies and State and local law enforcement personnel shall at all 
times have the right to enter the premises on official business. Holders 
shall not close or otherwise obstruct the use of roads or trails 
commonly in public use.
    (b) Each land use authorization shall contain terms and conditions 
which shall:
    (1) Carry out the purposes of applicable law and regulations issued 
thereunder;
    (2) Minimize damage to scenic, cultural and aesthetic values, fish 
and wildlife habitat and otherwise protect the environment;
    (3) Require compliance with air and water quality standards 
established pursuant to applicable Federal or State law; and
    (4) Require compliance with State standards for public health and 
safety, environmental protection, siting, construction, operation and 
maintenance of, or for, such use if those standards are more stringent 
than applicable Federal standards.
    (c) Land use authorizations shall also contain such other terms and 
conditions as the authorized officer considers necessary to:
    (1) Protect Federal property and economic interests;
    (2) Manage efficiently the public lands which are subject to the use 
or adjacent to or occupied by such use;
    (3) Protect lives and property;
    (4) Protect the interests of individuals living in the general area 
of the use who rely on the fish, wildlife and other biotic resources of 
the area for subsistence purposes;
    (5) Require the use to be located in an area which shall cause least 
damage to the environment, taking into consideration feasibility and 
other relevant factors; and
    (6) Otherwise protect the public interest.
    (d) A holder shall be required to secure authorization under 
applicable law to pay in advance the fair market value, as determined by 
the authorized officer, of any mineral, vegetative materials (including 
timber) to be cut, removed, used or destroyed on public lands.
    (e) A holder shall not use the public lands for any purposes other 
than those specified in the land use authorization without the approval 
of the authorized officer.
    (f) Liability provisions:
    (1) Holders of a land use authorization and all owners of any 
interest in, and all affiliates or subsidiaries of any holder of a land 
use authorization issued under these regulations shall pay the United 
States the full value for all injuries or damage to public lands or 
other property of the United States caused by the holder or by its 
employees, agents or servants, or by a contractor, its employees, agents 
or servants, except holders shall be held to standards of strict 
liability where the Secretary of the Interior determines that the 
activities taking place on the area covered by the land use 
authorization present a foreseeable hazard or risk of danger to public 
lands or other property of the United States. Strict liability shall not 
be applied where such damages or injuries result from acts of war or 
negligence of the United States.
    (2) Holders of a land use authorization and all owners of any 
interest in, and affiliates or subsidiaries of any holder of a land use 
authorization issued under these regulations shall pay third parties the 
full value of all injuries or damage to life, person or property caused 
by the holder, its employees, agents or servants or by a contractor, its 
employees, agents or servants.
    (3) Holders of a land use authorization shall indemnify or hold 
harmless the United States against any liability for damages to life, 
person or property arising from the authorized occupancy or use of the 
public lands under the land use authorization. Where a land use 
authorization is issued to a State or local government or any agency or 
instrumentality thereof, which has no legal power to assume such 
liability with respect to damages caused by it to lands or property, 
such State or local government or agency in lieu thereof shall be 
required to repair all damages.

[[Page 305]]

    (g) The authorized officer may require a bond or other security 
satisfactory to him/her to insure the fulfillment of the terms and 
conditions of the land use authorization.
    (h) Any land use authorization existing on the effective date of 
this regulation is not affected by this regulation and shall continue to 
be administered under the statutory authority under which it was issued. 
However, by filing a proposal for amendment or renewal, the holder of a 
land use authorization shall be considered to have agreed to convert the 
entire authorization to the current statutory authority and the 
regulations in effect at the time of approval of the amendment or 
renewal.
    (i) The holder of a land use authorization who has complied with the 
provisions thereof, shall, upon the filing of a request for renewal, be 
the preferred user for a new land use authorization provided that the 
public lands are not needed for another use. Renewal, if granted, shall 
be subject to new terms and conditions. If so specified in the terms of 
a permit, the permit may be automatically renewable upon payment of the 
annual rental unless the authorized officer notifies the permittee 
within 60 days of the expiration date of the permit that the permit 
shall not be renewed.
    (j) Land use authorizations may be transferred in whole or in part 
but only under the following conditions:
    (1) The transferee shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 2920.2-3 
of this title;
    (2) The authorized officer may modify the terms and conditions of 
the land use authorization and the transferee shall agree, in writing, 
to comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions of the 
authorization as modified; and
    (3) Transfers shall not take effect until approved by the authorized 
officer.
    (k) If public lands included in a lease or easement are to be 
disposed of, the conveyance shall be made subject to the lease or 
easement. Permits shall be revoked prior to disposal of the public 
lands.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.8  Fees.

    (a) Rental. (1) Holders of a land use authorization shall pay 
annually or otherwise as determined by the authorized officer, in 
advance, a rental as determined by the authorized officer. The rental 
shall be based either upon the fair market value of the rights 
authorized in the land use authorization or as determined by competitive 
bidding. In no case shall the rental be less than fair market value.
    (2) Rental fees for leases and easements may be adjusted every 5 
years or earlier, as determined by the authorized officer, to reflect 
current fair market value.
    (3) The rental fees required by this section are payable when due, 
and a late charge of 1 percent per month of the unpaid amount or $15 per 
month, whichever is greater, shall be assessed if subsequent billings 
are required. Failure to pay the rental fee in a timely manner is cause 
for termination of the land use authorization.
    (b) Processing fee. Each request for renewal, transfer or assignment 
of a lease or easement shall be accompanied by a non-refundable 
processing fee of $25. The authorized officer may waive or reduce this 
fee for requests for permit renewals which can be processed with a 
minimal amount of work.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.9  Supervision of the land use authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.9-1    Construction phase.

    (a) Unless otherwise stated in the land use authorization, 
construction may proceed immediately upon receipt and acceptance of the 
land use authorization by the selected applicant.
    (b) Where an authorization to use public lands provides that no 
construction shall occur until specific permission to begin construction 
is granted, no construction shall occur until an appropriate Notice to 
Proceed has been issued by the authorized officer, following the 
submission and approval of required plans or documents.
    (c) The authorized officer shall inspect and monitor construction as 
necessary, to assure compliance with approved plans and protection of 
the resources, the environment and the public health, safety and 
welfare.
    (d) The holder of a land use authorization may be required to 
designate a field representative who can accept and

[[Page 306]]

act on guidance and instructions from the authorized officer.
    (e) The holder of a land use authorization may be required to 
provide proof of construction to the approved plan and required 
standards. Thereafter, operation of the authorized facilities may begin.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.9-2  Operation and maintenance.

    The authorized officer shall inspect and monitor the operation and 
maintenance of the land use authorization area, its facilities and 
improvements to assure compliance with the plan of management and 
protection of the resources, the environment and the public health, 
safety and welfare, and the holder of the land use authorization shall 
take corrective action as required by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 2920.9-3  Termination and suspension.

    (a) Land use authorizations may be terminated under the following 
circumstances:
    (1) If a land use authorization provides by its terms that it shall 
terminate on the occurrence of a fixed or agreed-upon event, the land 
use authorization shall thereupon automatically terminate by operation 
of law upon the occurrence of such event.
    (2) Noncompliance with applicable law, regulations or terms and 
conditions of the land use authorization.
    (3) Failure of the holder to use the land use authorization for the 
purpose for which it was authorized. Failure to construct or nonuse for 
any continuous 2-year period shall constitute a presumption of 
abandonment and termination.
    (4) Mutual agreement that the land use authorization should be 
terminated.
    (5) Nonpayment of rent for 2 consecutive months, following notice of 
payment due.
    (6) So that the public lands covered by the permit can be disposed 
of or used for any other purpose.
    (b)(1) Upon determination that there is noncompliance with the terms 
and conditions of a land use authorization which adversely affects the 
public health, safety or welfare or the environment, the authorized 
officer shall issue an immediate temporary suspension.
    (2) The authorized officer may give an immediate temporary susension 
order orally or in writing at the site of the activity to the holder or 
a contractor or subcontractor of the holder, or to any representative, 
agent, employee or contractor of any of them, and the suspended activity 
shall cease at that time. As soon as practicable, the authorized officer 
shall confirm the order by a written notice to the holder addressed to 
the holder or the holder's designated agent. The authorized officer may 
also take such action considered necessary to require correction of such 
defects prior to an administrative proceeding.
    (3) The authorized officer may order immediate temporary suspension 
of an activity regardless of any action that has been or is being taken 
by another Federal agency or a State agency.
    (4) An order of temporary suspension of activities shall remain 
effective until the authorized officer issues an order permitting 
resumption of activities.
    (5) Any time after an order of suspension has been issued, the 
holder may file with the authorized officer a request for permission to 
resume. The request shall be in writing and shall contain a statement of 
the facts supporting the request.
    (6) The authorized officer may render an order to either grant or 
deny the request to resume within 5 working days of the date the request 
is filed. If the authorized officer does not render an order on the 
request within 5 working days, the request shall be considered denied, 
the holder shall have the same right to appeal the denial as if an order 
denying the request had been issued.
    (c) Process for termination or suspension other than temporary 
immediate suspension.
    (1) Prior to commencing any proceeding to suspend or terminate a 
land use authorization, the authorized officer shall give written notice 
to the holder of the legal grounds for such action and shall give the 
holder a reasonable time to correct any noncompliance.
    (2) After due notice of termination or suspension to the holder of a 
land use

[[Page 307]]

authorization, if noncompliance still exists after a reasonable time, 
the authorized officer shall give written notice to the holder and refer 
the matter to the Office of Hearings and Appeals for a hearing before an 
Administrative Law Judge pursuant to 43 CFR 4.420-4.439. The authorized 
officer shall suspend or revoke the land use authorization if the 
Administrative Law Judge determines that grounds for suspension or 
revocation exists and that such action is justified.
    (3) The authorized officer shall terminate a suspension order when 
the authorized officer determines that the violation causing such 
suspension has been rectified.
    (d) Upon termination, revocation or cancellation of a land use 
authorization, the holder shall remove all structures and improvements 
except those owned by the United States within 60 days of the notice of 
termination, revocation or cancellation and shall restore the site to 
its pre-use condition, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing or in the 
land use authorization. If the holder fails to remove all such 
structures or improvements within a reasonable period, they shall become 
the property of the United States, but that shall not relieve the holder 
of liability for the cost of their removal and restoration of the site.

Sec. 3100.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    (a) Operator means any person or entity, including, but not limited 
to, the lessee or operating rights owner, who has stated in writing to 
the authorized officer that it is responsible under the terms and 
conditions of the lease for the operations conducted on the leased lands 
or a portion thereof.
    (b) Unit operator means the person authorized under the agreement 
approved by the Department of the Interior to conduct operations within 
the unit.
    (c) Record title means a lessee's interest in a lease which includes 
the obligation to pay rent, and the rights to assign and relinquish the 
lease. Overriding royalty and operating rights are severable from record 
title interests.
    (d) Operating right (working interest) means the interest created 
out of a lease authorizing the holder of that right to enter upon the 
leased lands to conduct drilling and related operations, including 
production of oil or gas from such lands in accordance with the terms of 
the lease.
    (e) Transfer means any conveyance of an interest in a lease by 
assignment, sublease or otherwise. This definition includes the terms: 
Assignment which means a transfer of all or a portion of the lessee's 
record title interest in a lease; and sublease which means a transfer of 
a non-record title interest in a lease, i.e., a transfer of operating 
rights is normally a sublease and a sublease also is a subsidiary 
arrangement between the lessee (sublessor) and the sublessee, but a 
sublease does not include a transfer of a purely financial interest, 
such as overriding royalty interest or payment out of production, nor 
does it affect the relationship imposed by a lease between the lessee(s) 
and the United States.
    (f) National Wildlife Refuge System Lands means lands and water, or 
interests therein, administered by the Secretary as wildlife refuges, 
areas for the protection and conservation of fish and wildlife that are 
threatened with extinction, wildlife management areas or waterfowl 
production areas.
    (g) Actual drilling operations includes not only the physical 
drilling of a well, but the testing, completing or equipping of such 
well for production.
    (h)(1) Primary term of lease subject to section 4(d) of the Act 
prior to the revision of 1960 (30 U.S.C. 226-1(d)) means all periods of 
the life of the lease prior to its extension by reason of production of 
oil and gas in paying quantities; and
    (2) Primary term of all other leases means the initial term of the 
lease. For competitive leases, except those within the National 
Petroleum Reserve--Alaska, this means 5 years and for noncompetitive 
leases this means 10 years.
    (i) Lessee means a person or entity holding record title in a lease 
issued by the United States.
    (j) Operating rights owner means a person or entity holding 
operating rights in a lease issued by the United States. A lessee also 
may be an operating rights owner if the operating rights in a lease or 
portion thereof have not been severed from record title.
    (k) Bid means an amount of remittance offered as partial 
compensation for a lease equal to or in excess of the national minimum 
acceptable bonus bid set by statute or by the Secretary, submitted by a 
person or entity for a lease parcel in a competitive lease sale.

    (1) BLM will withhold such records as may be withheld under an 
exemption to FOIA when it receives a request for information related to 
tribal or Indian minerals held in trust or subject to restrictions on 
alienation;
    (2) BLM will notify the Indian mineral owner(s) identified in the 
records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and BIA, and give them a 
reasonable period of time to state objections to disclosure, using the 
standards and procedures of Sec. 2.15(d) of this title, before making a 
decision about the applicability of FOIA exemption 4 to:
    (i) Information obtained from a person outside the United States 
Government; when
    (ii) Following consultation with a submitter under Sec. 2.15(d) of

Sec. 3101.1-2  Surface use rights.

    A lessee shall have the right to use so much of the leased lands as 
is necessary to explore for, drill for, mine, extract, remove and 
dispose of all the leased resource in a leasehold subject to: 
Stipulations attached to the lease; restrictions deriving from specific, 
nondiscretionary statutes; and such reasonable measures as may be 
required by the authorized officer to minimize adverse impacts to other 
resource values, land uses or users not addressed in the lease 
stipulations at the time operations are proposed. To the extent 
consistent with lease rights granted, such reasonable measures may 
include, but are not limited to, modification to siting or design of 
facilities, timing of operations, and specification of interim and final 
reclamation measures. At a minimum, measures shall be deemed consistent 
with lease rights granted provided that they do not: require relocation 
of proposed operations by more than 200 meters; require that operations 
be sited off the leasehold; or prohibit new surface disturbing 
operations for a period in excess of 60 days in any lease year.

<R05>
Sec. 3101.1-3  Stipulations and information notices.

    The authorized officer may require stipulations as conditions of 
lease issuance. Stipulations shall become part of the lease and shall 
supersede inconsistent provisions of the standard lease form. Any party 
submitting a bid under subpart 3120 of this title, or an offer under 
Sec. 3110.1(b) of this title during the period when use of the parcel 
number is required pursuant to Sec. 3110.5-1 of this title, shall be 
deemed to have agreed to stipulations applicable to the specific parcel 
as indicated in the List of Lands Available for Competitive Nominations 
or the Notice of Competitive Lease Sale available from the proper BLM 
office. A party filing a noncompetitive offer in accordance with 
Sec. 3110.1(a) of this title shall be deemed to have agreed to 
stipulations applicable to the specific parcel as indicated in the List 
of Lands Available for Competitive Nominations or the Notice of 
Competitive Lease Sale, unless the offer is withdrawn in accordance with 
Sec. 3110.6 of this title. An information notice has no legal 
consequences, except to give notice of existing requirements, and may be 
attached to a lease by the authorized officer at the time of lease 
issuance to convey certain operational, procedural or administrative 
requirements relative to lease management within the terms and 
conditions of the standard lease form. Information notices shall not be 
a basis for denial of lease operations.

Sec. 3101.1-4  Modification or waiver of lease terms and stipulations.

    A stipulation included in an oil and gas lease shall be subject to 
modification or waiver only if the authorized officer determines that 
the factors leading to its inclusion in the lease have changed 
sufficiently to make the protection provided by the stipulation no 
longer justified or if proposed operations would not cause unacceptable 
impacts. If the authorized officer has determined, prior to lease 
issuance, that a stipulation involves an issue of major concern to the 
public, modification or waiver of the stipulation shall be subject to 
public review for at least a 30-day period. In such cases, the 
stipulation shall indicate that public review is required before 
modification or waiver. If subsequent to lease issuance the authorized 
officer determines that a modification or waiver of a lease term or 
stipulation is substantial, the modification or waiver shall be subject

[[Page 318]]

to public review for at least a 30-day period.

Sec. 3101.2-2  Acquired lands.

    An acreage limitation separate from, but equal to the acreage 
limitation for public domain lands described in Sec. 3101.2-1 of this 
title, applies to acquired lands. Where the United States owns only a 
fractional interest in the mineral resources of the lands involved in a

acreage holdings. The acreage embraced in a future interest lease shall 
not be charged as acreage holdings until the lease for the future 
interest becomes effective.

drilling or development contract a party holds or controls excess 
accountable acreage, said party shall have 90 days from that date to 
reduce the holdings to the prescribed limitation and to file proof of 
the reduction in the proper BLM office. Where as a result of a merger or 
the purchase of the controlling interest in a corporation, acreage in 
excess of the amount permitted is acquired, the party holding the excess 
acreage shall have 180 days from the date of the merger or purchase to 
divest the excess acreage. If additional time is required to complete 
the divestiture of the excess acreage, a petition requesting additional 
time, along with a full justification for the additional time, may be 
filed with the authorized officer prior to the termination of the 180-
day period provided herein.
    (b) If any person or entity is found to hold accountable acreage in 
violation of the provisions of these regulations, lease(s) or interests 
therein shall be subject to cancellation or forfeiture in their 
entirety, until sufficient acreage has been eliminated to comply with 
the acreage limitation. Excess acreage or interest shall be cancelled in 
the inverse order of acquisition.

shall be the party's proportionate part of the total lease acreage. The 
accountable acreage of a party who is the beneficial owner of more than 
10 percent of the stock of a corporation which holds Federal oil and gas 
leases shall be the party's proportionate part of the corporation's 
accountable acreage. Parties to a contract for development of leased 
lands and co-parties, except those operating, drilling or development 
contracts subject to Sec. 3101.2-3 of this title, shall be charged with 
their proportionate interests in the lease. No holding of acreage in 
common by the same persons in excess of the maximum acreage specified in 
the laws for any one party shall be permitted.

Sec. 3101.5-1  Wildlife refuge lands.

    (a) Wildlife refuge lands are those lands embraced in a withdrawal 
of public domain and acquired lands of the United States for the 
protection of all species of wildlife within a particular area. Sole and 
complete jurisdiction over such lands for wildlife conservation purposes 
is vested in the Fish and Wildlife Service even though such lands may be 
subject to prior rights for other public purposes or, by the terms of 
the withdrawal order, may be subject to mineral leasing.
    (b) No offers for oil and gas leases covering wildlife refuge lands 
shall be accepted and no leases covering such lands shall be issued 
except as provided in Sec. 3100.2 of this title. There shall be no 
drilling or prospecting under any lease heretofore or hereafter issued 
on lands within a wildlife refuge except with the consent and approval 
of the Secretary with the concurrence of the Fish and Wildlife Service 
as to the time, place and nature of such operations in order to give 
complete protection to wildlife populations and wildlife habitat on the

by long-term leases or agreements between the Department of Agriculture 
and the game commissions of the various States pursuant to the Bankhead-
Jones Farm Tenant Act (50 Stat. 525), as amended, where such lands were 
subsequently transferred to the Department of the Interior, with the 
Fish and Wildlife Service as the custodial agency of the United States.
    (b) Representatives of the Bureau and the Fish and Wildlife Service 
shall, in cooperation with the authorized members of the various State 
game commissions, confer for the purpose of determining by agreement 
those coordination lands which shall not be subject to oil and gas 
leasing. Coordination lands not closed to oil and gas leasing shall be 
subject to leasing on the imposition of such stipulations as are agreed 
upon by the State Game Commission, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the 
Bureau.

    (a) Acquired lands shall be leased only with the consent of the 
surface managing agency, which upon receipt of a description of the 
lands from the authorized officer, shall report to the authorized 
officer that it consents to leasing with stipulations, if any, or 
withholds consent or objects to leasing.
    (b) Public domain lands shall be leased only after the Bureau has 
consulted with the surface managing agency and has provided it with a 
description of the lands, and the surface managing agency has reported 
its recommendation to lease with stipulations, if any, or not to lease 
to the authorized officer. If consent or lack of objection of the 
surface managing agency is required by statute to lease public domain 
lands, the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.
    (c) National Forest System lands whether acquired or reserved from 
the public domain shall not be leased over the objection of the Forest 
Service. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to 
such National Forest System lands.

Sec. 3101.7-2  Action by the Bureau of Land Management.

    (a) Where the surface managing agency has consented to leasing with 
required stipulations, and the Secretary decides to issue a lease, the 
authorized officer shall incorporate the stipulations into any lease 
which it may issue. The authorized officer may add additional 
stipulations.
    (b) The authorized officer shall not issue a lease and shall reject 
any lease offer on lands to which the surface managing agency objects or 
withholds consent required by statute. In all other instances, the 
Secretary has the final authority and discretion to decide to issue a 
lease.

[[Page 321]]

    (c) The authorized officer shall review all recommendations and 
shall accept all reasonable recommendations of the surface managing 
agency.

Sec. 3101.7-3  Appeals.

    (a) The decision of the authorized officer to reject an offer to 
lease or to issue a lease with stipulations recommended by the surface 
managing agency may be appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals 
under part 4 of this title.
    (b) Where, as provided by statute, the surface managing agency has 
required that certain stipulations be included in a lease or has 
consented, or objected or refused to consent to leasing, any appeal by 
an affected lease offeror shall be pursuant to the administrative 
remedies provided by the particular surface managing agency.

[53 FR 22837, June 17, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 3101.8  State's or charitable organization's ownership of surface overlying Federally-owned minerals.

    Where the United States has conveyed title to, or otherwise 
transferred the control of the surface of lands to any State or 
political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, or a college 
or any other educational corporation or association, or a charitable or 
religious corporation or association, with reservation of the oil and 
gas rights to the United States, such party shall be given an 
opportunity to suggest any lease stipulations deemed necessary for the 
protection of existing surface improvements or uses, to set forth the 
facts supporting the necessity of the stipulations and also to file any 
objections it may have to the issuance of a lease. Where a party 
controlling the surface opposes the issuance of a lease or wishes to 
place such restrictive stipulations upon the lease that it could not be 
operated upon or become part of a drilling unit and hence is without 
mineral value, the facts submitted in support of the opposition or 
request for restrictive stipulations shall be given consideration and 
each case decided on its merits. The opposition to lease or necessity 
for restrictive stipulations expressed by the party controlling the 
surface affords no legal basis or authority to refuse to issue the lease 
or to issue the lease with the requested restrictive stipulations for 
the reserved minerals in the lands; in such case, the final 
determination whether to issue and with what stipulations, or not to 
issue the lease depends upon whether or not the interests of the United 
States would best be served by the issuance of the lease.

behalf. Such legal

[[Page 322]]

date only 1 original request for approval of a transfer.
    (c) Documents signed by any party other than the present or 
potential lessee shall be rendered in a manner to reveal the name of the 
present or potential lessee, the name of the signatory and their 
relationship. A signatory who is a member of the organization that 
constitutes the present or potential lessee (e.g., officer of a

<R05>
Sec. 3102.5-1  Compliance.

    In order to actually or potentially own, hold, or control an 
interest in a lease or prospective lease, all parties, including 
corporations, and all members of associations, including partnerships of 
all types, shall, without exception, be qualified and in compliance with 
the act. Compliance means that the lessee, potential lessee, and all 
such parties (as defined in Sec. 3000.0-5(k)) are:
    (a) Citizens of the United States (see Sec. 3102.1) or alien 
stockholders in a corporation organized under State or Federal law (see 
Sec. 3102.2);
    (b) In compliance with the Federal acreage limitations (see 
Sec. 3101.2);
    (c) Not minors (see Sec. 3102.3);
    (d) Except for an assignment or transfer under subpart 3106 of this 
title, in compliance with section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Act, in which case 
the signature on an offer or lease constitutes evidence of compliance. A 
lease issued to any entity in violation of this paragraph (d) shall be 
subject to the cancellation provisions of Sec. 3108.3 of this title. The 
term entity is defined at Sec. 3400.0-5(rr) of this title.
    (e) Not in violation of the provisions of section 41 of the Act; and
    (f) In compliance with section 17(g) of the Act, in which case the 
signature on an offer, lease, assignment, transfer, constitutes evidence 
of compliance that the signatory and any subsidiary, affiliate, or 
person, association, or corporation controlled by or under common 
control with the signatory, as defined in Sec. 3400.0-5(rr) of this 
title, has not failed or refused to comply with reclamation requirements 
with respect to all leases and operations thereon in which such person 
or entity has an interest. Noncompliance with section 17(g) of the Act 
begins on the effective date of the imposition of a civil penalty by the 
authorized officer under Sec. 3163.2 of this title, or when the bond is 
attached by the authorized officer for reclamation purposes, whichever 
comes first. A lease issued, or an assignment or transfer approved, to 
any such person or entity in violation of this paragraph (f) shall be 
subject to the cancellation provisions of Sec. 3108.3 of this title, 
notwithstanding any administrative or judicial appeals that may be 
pending with respect to violations or penalties assessed for failure to 
comply with the prescribed reclamation standards on any lease holdings. 
Noncompliance shall end upon a determination by the authorized officer 
that all required reclamation has been completed and that the United 
States has been fully reimbursed for any costs incurred due to the 
required reclamation.
    (g) In compliance with Sec. 3106.1(b) of this title and section 30A 
of the Act. The authorized officer may accept the signature on a request 
for approval of

[[Page 323]]

an assignment of less than 640 acres outside of Alaska (2,560 acres 
within Alaska) as acceptable certification that the assignment would 
further the development of oil and gas, or the authorized officer may

including a publicly traded partnership, shall certify that constituent 
members of the corporation, association or partnership holding or 
controlling more than 10 percent of the instruments of ownership of the 
corporation, association or partnership are in compliance with the act.

Sec. 3103.4-1  Royalty reductions.

    (a) In order to encourage the greatest ultimate recovery of oil or 
gas and in the interest of conservation, the Secretary, upon a 
determination that it is necessary to promote development or that the 
leases cannot be successfully operated under the terms provided therein, 
may waive, suspend or reduce the rental or minimum royalty or reduce the 
royalty on an entire leasehold, or any portion thereof.
    (b)(1) An application for the benefits under paragraph (a) of this 
section on other than stripper oil well leases or heavy oil properties 
must be filed by the operator/payor in the proper BLM office. (Royalty 
reductions specifically for stripper oil well leases or heavy oil 
properties are discussed in Sec. 3103.4-2 and Sec. 3103.4-3 
respectively.) The application must contain the serial number of the 
leases, the names of the record title holders, operating rights owners 
(sublessees), and operators for each lease, the description of lands by 
legal subdivision and a description of the relief requested.

[[Page 326]]

    (2) Each application shall show the number, location and status of 
each well drilled, a tabulated statement for each month covering a 
period of not less than 6 months prior to the date of filing the 
application of the aggregate amount of oil or gas subject to royalty, 
the number of wells counted as producing each month and the average 
production per well per day.
    (3) Every application shall contain a detailed statement of expenses 
and costs of operating the entire lease, the income from the sale of any 
production and all facts tending to show whether the wells can be 
successfully operated upon the fixed royalty or rental. Where the 
application is for a reduction in royalty, full information shall be 
furnished as to whether overriding royalties, payments out of 
production, or similar interests are paid to others than the United 
States, the amounts so paid and efforts made to reduce them. The 
applicant shall also file agreements of the holders to a reduction of 
all other royalties or similar payments from the leasehold to an 
aggregate not in excess of one-half the royalties due the United States.
    (c) Petition may be made for reduction of royalty under Sec. 3108.2-
3(f) for leases reinstated under Sec. 3108.2-3 of this title and under 
Sec. 3108.2-4(i) for noncompetitive leases issued under Sec. 3108.2-4 of 
this title. Petitions to waive, suspend or reduce rental or minimum 
royalty for leases reinstated under Sec. 3108.2-3 of this title or for 
leases issued under Sec. 3108.2-4 of this title may be made under this 
section.

Sec. 3103.4-2  Stripper well royalty reductions.

    (a)(1) A stripper well property is any Federal lease or portion 
thereof segregated for royalty purposes, a communitization agreement, or 
a participating area of a unit agreement, operated by the same operator, 
that produces an average of less than 15 barrels of oil per eligible 
well per well-day for the qualifying period.
    (2) An eligible well is an oil well that produces or an injection 
well that injects and is integral to production for any period of time 
during the qualifying or subsequent 12-month period.
    (3) An oil completion is a completion from which the energy 
equivalent of the oil produced exceeds the energy equivalent of the gas 
produced (including the entrained liquid hydrocarbons) or any completion 
producing oil and less than 60 MCF of gas per day.
    (4) An injection well is a well that injects a fluid for secondary 
or enhanced oil recovery, including reservoir pressure maintenance 
operations.
    (b) Stripper oil well property royalty rate reduction shall be 
administered according to the following requirements and procedures.
    (1) An application for the benefits under paragraph (a) of this 
section for stripper oil well properties is not required.
    (2) Total oil production (regardless of disposition) for the subject 
period from the eligible wells on the property is totaled and then 
divided by the total number of well days or portions of days, both 
producing and injection days, as reported on Form MMS-3160 or MMS-4054 
for the eligible wells to determine the property average daily 
production rate. For those properties in communitization agreements and 
participating areas of unit agreements that have allocated (not actual) 
production, the production rate for all eligible well(s) in that 
specific communitization agreement or participating area is determined 
and shall be assigned to that allocated property in that communitization 
agreement or participating area.
    (3) Procedures to be used by operator:
    (i) Qualifying determination.
    (A) Calculate an average daily production rate for the property in 
order to verify that the property qualifies as a stripper property.
    (B) The initial qualifying period for producing properties is the 
period August 1, 1990, through July 31, 1991. For the properties that 
were shut-in for 12 consecutive months or longer, the qualifying period 
is the 12-month production period immediately prior to the shut-in. If 
the property does not qualify during the initial qualifying period, it 
may later qualify due to production decline. In those cases, the 12-

[[Page 327]]

month qualifying period will be the first consecutive 12-month period 
beginning after August 31, 1990, during which the property qualifies.
    (ii) Qualifying royalty rate calculation. If the property qualifies, 
use the production rate rounded down to the next whole number (e.g., 6.7 
becomes 6) for the qualifying period, and apply the following formula to 
determine the maximum royalty rate for oil production from the Federal 
leases for the life of the program.


Royalty Rate (%) = 0.5 + (0.8  x  the average daily production rate)


    The formula-calculated royalty rate shall apply to all oil 
production (except condensate) from the property for the first 12 
months. The rate shall be effective the first day of the production 
month after the Minerals Management Service (MMS) receives notification. 
If the production rate is 15 barrels or greater, the royalty rate will 
be the rate in the lease terms.
    (iii) Outyears royalty rate calculations.
    (A) At the end of each 12-month period, the property average daily 
production rate shall be determined for that period. A royalty rate 
shall then be calculated using the formula in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of 
this section.
    (B) The new calculated royalty rate shall be compared to the 
qualifying period royalty rate. The lower of the two rates shall be used 
for the current period provided that the operator notifies the MMS of 
the new royalty rate. The new royalty rate shall not become effective 
until the first day of the month after the MMS receives notification. 
Notification shall be received on Form MMS-4377 and mailed to Minerals 
Management Service, P.O. Box 17110, Denver, CO 80217. If the operator 
does not notify the MMS of the new royalty rate within 60 days after the 
end of the subject 12-month period, the royalty rate for the property 
shall revert back to the royalty rate established as the qualifying 
period royalty rate, effective at the beginning of the current 12-month 
period.
    (C) The royalty rate shall never exceed the calculated qualifying 
royalty rate for the life of this program.
    (iv) Prohibition. For the qualifying period and any subsequent 12-
month period, the production rate shall be the result of routine 
operational and economic factors for that period and for that property 
and not the result of production manipulation for the purpose of 
obtaining a lower royalty rate. A production rate that is determined to 
have resulted from production manipulation will not receive the benefit 
of a royalty rate reduction.
    (v) Certification. The applicable royalty rate shall be used by the 
operator/payor when submitting the required royalty reports/payments to 
MSS. By submitting royalty reports/payments using the royalty rate 
reduction benefits of this program, the operator certifies that the 
production rate for the qualifying and subsequent 12-month period was 
not subject to manipulation for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of 
a royalty rate reduction, and the royalty rate was calculated in 
accordance with the instructions and procedures in these regulations.
    (vi) Agency action. If a royalty rate is improperly calculated, the 
MMS will calculate the correct rate and inform the operator/payors. Any 
additional royalties due are payable immediately upon notification. Late 
payment or underpayment charges will be assessed in accordance with 30 
CFR 218.102. The BLM may terminate a royalty rate reduction if it is 
determined that the production rate was manipulated by the operator for 
the purpose of receiving a royalty rate reduction. Terminations of 
royalty rate reductions will be effective on the effective date of the 
royalty rate reduction resulting from the manipulated production rate 
(i.e., the termination will be retroactive to the effective date of the 
improper reduction). The operator/payor shall pay the difference in 
royalty resulting from the retroactive application of the unmanipulated 
rate. Late payment or underpayment charges will be assessed in 
accordance with 30 CFR 218.102.
    (4) The royalty rate reduction provision for stripper well 
properties shall be effective as of October 1, 1992. If the oil price, 
adjusted for inflation by BLM and MMS, using the implicit price deflator 
for gross national product with 1991 as the base year, remains on

[[Page 328]]

average above $28 per barrel, based on West Texas Intermediate crude 
average posted price for a period of 6 consecutive months, the benefits 
of the royalty rate reduction under this section may be terminated upon 
6 months' notice, published in the Federal Register.
    (5) The Secretary will evaluate the effectiveness of the stripper 
well royalty reduction program and may at any time after September 10, 
1997, terminate any or all royalty reductions granted under this section 
upon 6 months notice.
    (6) The stripper well property royalty rate reduction benefits shall 
apply to all oil produced from the property.
    (7) The royalty for gas production (including liquids produced in 
association with gas) for oil completions shall be calculated separately 
using the lease royalty rate.
    (8) If the lease royalty rate is lower than the benefits provided in 
this stripper oil property royalty rate reduction program, the lease 
rate prevails.
    (9) The minimum royalty provisions of Sec. 3103.3-2 apply.
    (10) Examples.

[[Page 329]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01FE91.071

                         Explanation, Example 1

    1. Property production rate per well for qualifying period (August 
1, 1990-July 31, 1991) is 10 barrels of oil per day (BOPD).
    2. Using the formula, the royalty rate for the first year is 
calculated to be 8.5 percent. This rate is also the maximum royalty rate 
for the life of the program.

8.5%=0.5+(0.8 x 10)

    3. Production rate for the first year is 8 BOPD.
    4. Using the formula, the royalty rate is calculated at 6.9 percent. 
Since 6.9 percent is less than the first year rate of 8.5 percent, 6.9 
percent is the applicable royalty rate for the second year.

6.9%=0.5+(0.8 x 8)


[[Page 330]]


    5. Production rate for the second year is 12 BOPD.
    6. Using the formula, the royalty rate is calculated at 10.1 
percent. Since the 8.5 percent first year royalty rate is less than 10.1 
percent, the applicable royalty rate for third year is 8.5 percent.

10.1%=0.5+(0.8 x 12)

    7. Production rate for the third year is 23 BOPD.
    8. Since the production rate of 23 BOPD is greater than the 15 BOPD 
threshold for the program, the calculated royalty rate would be the 
property royalty rate. However, since the 8.5 percent first year royalty 
rate is less than the property rate, the royalty rate for the fourth 
year is 8.5 percent.
    9. Production rate for the fourth year is 15 BOPD.
    10. Since the production is at the 15 BOPD threshold, the royalty 
rate would be the property royalty rate. However, since the 8.5 percent 
first year royalty rate is less than the lease rate, the royalty rate 
for the fifth year is 8.5 percent.

[[Page 331]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01FE91.072

                         Explanation, Example 2

    1. Property production rate of 23 BOPD per well (for the August 1, 
1990-July 31, 1991, qualifying period prior to the effective date of the 
program) is greater than the 15 BOPD which qualifies a property for a 
royalty rate reduction. Therefore, the property is not entitled to a 
royalty rate reduction for the first year of the program.
    2. Property royalty rate for the first year is the rate as stated in 
the lease.
    3. Production rate for the first year is 8 BOPD.
    4. Using the formula, the royalty rate is calculated to be 6.9 
percent for the second year. This rate is also the maximum royalty rate 
for the life of the program.

6.9%=0.5+(0.8 x 8)


[[Page 332]]


    5. Production rate for the second year is 12 BOPD.
    6. Using the formula, the royalty rate is calculated at 10.1 
percent. Since the 6.9 percent second year royalty rate is less than 
10.1 percent, the applicable royalty rate for third year is 6.9 percent.

10.1%=0.5+(0.8 x 12)

    7. Production rate third year is 7 BOPD.
    8. Using the formula, the royalty rate is calculated at 6.1 percent. 
Since the 6.1 percent third year royalty rate is less than the 
qualifying (maximum) rate of 6.9 percent, the royalty rate for the 
fourth year is 6.1 percent.

6.1%=0.5+(0.8 x 7)

    9. Production rate for the fourth year is 15 BOPD.
    10. Since the production is at the 15 BOPD threshold, the royalty 
rate would be the lease royalty rate. However, since the 6.9 percent 
second year royalty rate is less than the lease rate, the royalty rate 
for the fifth year is 6.9 percent.

Sec. 3103.4-3  Heavy oil royalty reductions.

    (a)(1) A heavy oil well property is any Federal lease or portion 
thereof segregated for royalty purposes, a communitization area, or a 
unit participating area, operated by the same operator, that produces 
crude oil with a weighted average gravity of less than 20 degrees as 
measured on the American Petroleum Institute (API) scale.
    (2) An oil completion is a completion from which the energy 
equivalent of the oil produced exceeds the energy equivalent of the gas 
produced (including the entrained liquefiable hydrocarbons) or any 
completion producing oil and less than 60 MCF of gas per day.
    (b) Heavy oil well property royalty rate reductions will be 
administered according to the following requirements and procedures:
    (1) The Bureau of Land Management requires no specific application 
form for the benefits under paragraph (a) of this section for heavy oil 
well properties. However, the operator/payor must notify, in writing, 
the proper BLM office that it is seeking a heavy oil royalty rate 
reduction. The letter must contain the serial number of the affected 
leases (or, as appropriate, the communitization agreement number or the 
unit agreement name); the names of the operators for each lease; the 
calculated new royalty rate as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section; and copies of the Purchaser's Statements (sales receipts) to 
document the weighted average API gravity for a property.
    (2) The operator must determine the weighted average API gravity for 
a property by averaging (adjusted to rate of production) the API 
gravities reported on the operator's Purchaser's Statement for the last 
3 calendar months preceding the operator's written notice of intent to 
seek a royalty rate reduction, during each of which at least one sale 
was held. This is shown in the following 3 illustrations:
    (i) If a property has oil sales every month prior to requesting the 
royalty rate reduction in October of 1996, the operator must submit 
Purchaser's Statements for July, August, and September of 1996;
    (ii) If a property has sales only every 6 months, during the months 
of March and September, prior to requesting the rate reduction in 
October of 1996, the operator must submit Purchaser's Statements for the 
months of September 1995, and March and September 1996; and
    (iii) If a property has multiple sales each month, the operator must 
submit Purchaser's Statements for every sale for the 3 entire calendar 
months immediately preceding the request for a rate reduction.
    (3) The following equation must be used by the operator/payor for 
calculating the weighted average API gravity for a heavy oil well 
property:

    Example: Lease ``A'' has 3 wells producing at the following average 
rates over 3 sales months with the following associated average 
gravities: Well #1, 4,000 bbls, 13 deg. API; Well #2, 6000 bbls, 21 deg. 
API; Well #3, 2,000 bbls,
14 deg. API. Using the equation above--

    (4) For those properties subject to a communitization agreement or a 
unit participating area, the weighted average API oil gravity for the 
lands dedicated to that specific communitization agreement or unit 
participating area must be determined in the manner prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section and assigned to all property subject to 
Federal royalties in the communitization agreement or unit participating 
area.
    (5) The operator/payor must use the following procedures in order to 
obtain a royalty rate reduction under this section:
    (i) Qualifying royalty rate determination.
    (A) The operator/payor must calculate the weighted average API 
gravity for the property proposed for the royalty rate reduction in 
order to verify that the property qualifies as a heavy oil well 
property.
    (B) Properties that have removed or sold oil less than 3 times in 
their productive life may still qualify for this royalty rate reduction. 
However, no additional royalty reductions will be granted until the 
property has a sales history of at least 3 production months (see 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section).
    (ii) Calculating the qualifying royalty rate. If the Federal leases 
or portions thereof (e.g., communitization or unit agreements) qualify 
as heavy oil property, the operator/payor must use the weighted average 
API gravity rounded down to the next whole degree (e.g., 11.7 degrees 
API becomes 11 degrees), and determine the appropriate royalty rate from 
the following table:

    (iii) New royalty rate effective date. The new royalty rate will be 
effective on the first day of production 2 months after BLM receives 
notification by the operator/payor. The rate will apply to all oil 
production from the property for the next 12 months (plus the 2 calendar 
month grace period during which the next 12 months' royalty rate is 
determined in the next year). If the API oil gravity is 20 degrees or 
greater, the royalty rate will be the rate in the lease terms.

    Example: BLM receives notification from an operator on June 8, 1996. 
There is a two month period before new royalty rate is effective--July 
and August. New royalty rate is effective September 1, 1996.

    (iv) Royalty rate determinations in subsequent years.
    (A) At the end of each 12-month period, beginning on the first day 
of the calendar month the royalty rate reduction went into effect, the 
operator/payor must determine the weighted average API oil gravity for 
the property for that period. The operator/payor must then determine the 
royalty rate for the following year using the table in paragraph 
(b)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (B) The operator/payor must notify BLM of its determinations under 
this paragraph and paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section. The new 
royalty rate (effective for the next 12 month period) will become 
effective the first day of the third month after the prior 12 month 
period comes to a close, and will remain effective for 12 calendar 
months (plus the 2 calendar month grace period during which the next 12 
months' royalty rate is determined in the next year). Notification must 
include copies

[[Page 336]]

of the Purchaser's Statements (sales receipts) and be mailed to the 
proper BLM office. If the operator does not notify the BLM of the new 
royalty rate within 60 days after the end of the subject 12-month 
period, the royalty rate for the heavy oil well property will return to 
the rate in the lease terms.

    Example: On September 30, 1997, at the end of a 12-month royalty 
reduction period, the operator/payor determines what the weighted 
average API oil gravity for the property for that period has been. The 
operator/payor then determines the new royalty rate for the next 12 
month using the table in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. Given 
that there is a 2-month delay period for the operator/payor to calculate 
the new royalty rate, the new royalty rate would be effective December 
1, 1997 through November 30, 1998 (plus the 2 calendar month grace 
period during which the next 12 months' royalty rate is determined--
December 1, 1998 through January 31, 1999).


    (v) Prohibition. Any heavy oil property reporting an API average oil 
gravity determined by BLM to have resulted from any manipulation of 
normal production or adulteration of oil sold from the property will not 
receive the benefit of a royalty rate reduction under this paragraph 
(b).
    (vi) Certification. The operator/payor must use the applicable 
royalty rate when submitting the required royalty reports/payments to 
the Minerals Management Service (MMS). In submitting royalty reports/
payments using a royalty rate reduction authorized by this paragraph 
(b), the operator/payor must certify that the API oil gravity for the 
initial and subsequent 12-month periods was not subject to manipulation 
or adulteration and the royalty rate was determined in accordance with 
the requirements and procedures of this paragraph (b).
    (vii) Agency action. If an operator/payor incorrectly calculates the 
royalty rate, the BLM will determine the correct rate and notify the 
operator/payor in writing. Any additional royalties due are payable to 
MMS immediately upon receipt of this notice. Late payment or 
underpayment charges will be assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102. 
The BLM will terminate a royalty rate reduction for a property if BLM 
determines that the API oil gravity was manipulated or adulterated by 
the operator/payor. Terminations of royalty rate reductions for 
individual properties will be effective on the effective date of the 
royalty rate reduction resulting from a manipulated or adulterated API 
oil gravity so that the termination will be retroactive to the effective 
date of the improper reduction. The operator/payor must pay the 
difference in royalty resulting from the retroactive application of the 
non-manipulated rate. The late payment or underpayment charges will 
assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102.
    (6) The BLM may suspend or terminate all royalty reductions granted 
under this paragraph (b) and terminate the availability of further heavy 
oil royalty relief under this section--
    (i) Upon 6 month's notice in the Federal Register when BLM 
determines that the average oil price has remained above $24 per barrel 
over a period of 6 consecutive months (based on the WTI Crude average 
posted prices and adjusted for inflation using the implicit price 
deflator for gross national product with 1991 as the base year), or
    (ii) After September 10, 1999, if the Secretary determines the 
royalty rate reductions authorized by this paragraph (b) have not been 
effective in reducing the loss of otherwise recoverable reserves. This 
will be determined by evaluating the expected versus the actual 
abandonment rate, the number of enhanced recovery projects, and the 
amount of operator reinvestment in heavy oil production that can be 
attributed to this rule.
    (7) The heavy oil well property royalty rate reduction applies to 
all Federal oil produced from a heavy oil property.
    (8) If the lease royalty rate is lower than the benefits provided in 
this heavy oil well property royalty rate reduction program, the lease 
rate prevails.
    (9) If the property qualifies for a stripper well property royalty 
rate reduction, as well as a heavy oil well property reduction, the 
lower of the two rates applies.
    (10) The operator/payor must separately calculate the royalty for 
gas production (including condensate produced in association with gas) 
from oil

completions using the lease royalty rate.
    (11) The minimum royalty provisions of Sec. 3103.3-2 will continue 
to apply.

Sec. 3103.4-4  Suspension of operations and/or production.

    (a) A suspension of all operations and production may be directed or 
consented to by the authorized officer only in the interest of 
conservation of natural resources. A suspension of operations only or a 
suspension of production only may be directed or consented to by the 
authorized officer in cases where the lessee is prevented from operating 
on the lease or producing from the lease, despite the exercise of due 
care and diligence, by reason of force majeure, that is, by matters 
beyond the reasonable control of the lessee. Applications for any 
suspension shall be filed in the proper BLM office. Complete information 
showing the necessity of such relief shall be furnished.
    (b) The term of any lease shall be extended by adding thereto the 
period of the suspension, and no lease shall be deemed to expire during 
any suspension.
    (c) A suspension shall take effect as of the time specified in the 
direction or assent of the authorized officer, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 3165.1 of this title.
    (d) Rental and minimum royalty payments shall be suspended during 
any period of suspension of all operations and production directed or 
assented to by the authorized officer beginning with the first day of 
the lease month in which the suspension of all operations and production 
becomes effective, or if the suspension of all operations and production 
becomes effective on any date other than the first day of a lease month, 
beginning with the first day of the lease month following such effective 
date. Rental and minimum royalty payments shall resume on the first day 
of the lease month in which the suspension of all operations and 
production is terminated. Where rentals are creditable against royalties 
and have been paid in advance, proper credit shall be allowed on the 
next rental or royalty due under the terms of the lease. Rental and 
minimum royalty payments shall not be suspended during any period of 
suspension of operations only or suspension of production only.
    (e) Where all operations and production are suspended on a lease on 
which there is a well capable of producing in paying quantities and the 
authorized officer approves resumption of operations and production, 
such resumption shall be regarded as terminating the suspension, 
including the suspension of rental and minimum royalty payments, as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) The relief authorized under this section also may be obtained 
for any Federal lease included within an approved unit or cooperative 
plan of development and operation. Unit or cooperative plan obligations 
shall not be suspended by relief obtained under this section but shall 
be suspended only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
specific unit or cooperative plan.

Sec. 3104.4  Unit operator's bond.

    In lieu of individual lease, statewide, or nationwide bonds for 
operations conducted on leases committed to an approved unit agreement, 
the unit operator may furnish a unit operator bond in the manner set 
forth in Sec. 3104.1 of this title. The amount of such a bond shall be 
determined by the authorized officer. The format for such a surety bond 
is set forth in Sec. 3186.2 of this title. Where a unit operator is 
covered by a nationwide or statewide bond, coverage for such a unit may 
be provided by a rider to such bond specifically covering the unit and 
increasing the bond in such amount as may be determined appropriate by 
the authorized officer.

<R05>
Sec. 3104.5  Increased amount of bonds.

    (a) When an operator desiring approval of an Application for Permit 
to Drill has caused the Bureau to make a demand for payment under a bond 
or other financial guarantee within the 5-year period prior to 
submission of the Application for Permit to Drill, due to failure to 
plug a well or reclaim lands completely in a timely manner, the 
authorized officer shall require, prior to approval of the Application 
for Permit to Drill, a bond in an amount equal to the costs as estimated 
by the authorized officer of plugging the well and reclaiming the 
disturbed area involved in the proposed operation, or in the minimum 
amount as prescribed in this subpart, whichever is greater.
    (b) The authorized officer may require an increase in the amount of 
any bond whenever it is determined that the operator poses a risk due to 
factors, including, but not limited to, a history of previous 
violations, a notice from the Service that there are uncollected 
royalties due, or the total cost of plugging existing wells and 
reclaiming lands exceeds the present bond amount based on the estimates 
determined by the authorized officer. The increase in bond amount may be 
to any level specified by the authorized officer, but in no 
circumstances shall it exceed the total of the estimated costs of 
plugging and reclamation, the amount of uncollected royalties due to the 
Service, plus the amount of monies owed to the lessor due to previous 
violations remaining outstanding.

Sec. 3104.6  Where filed and number of copies.

    All bonds shall be filed in the proper BLM office on a current form 
approved by the Director. A single copy executed by the principal or, in 
the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable surety 
is sufficient. A bond filed on a form not currently in use shall be 
acceptable, unless such form has been declared obsolete by the Director 
prior to the filing of such bond. For purposes of Secs. 3104.2 and 
3104.3(a) of this title, bonds or bond riders shall be filed in the 
Bureau State office having jurisdiction of the lease or operations 
covered by the bond or rider. Nationwide bonds may be filed in any

Sec. 3104.7  Default.

    (a) Where, upon a default, the surety makes a payment to the United 
States of an obligation incurred under a lease, the face amount of the 
surety bond or personal bonds and the surety's liability thereunder 
shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.
    (b) After default, where the obligation in default equals or is less 
than the face amount of the bond(s), the principal shall either post a 
new bond or restore the existing bond(s) to the amount previously held 
or a larger amount as determined by the authorized officer. In lieu 
thereof, the principal may file separate or substitute bonds for each 
lease covered by the deficient bond(s). Where the obligation incurred 
exceeds the face amount of the bond(s), the principal shall make full 
payment to the United States for all obligations incurred that are in 
excess of the face amount of the bond(s) and shall post a new bond in 
the amount previously held or such larger amount as determined by the 
authorized officer. The restoration of a bond or posting of a new bond 
shall be made within 6 months or less after receipt of notice from the 
authorized officer. Failure to comply with these requirements may 
subject all leases covered

    The suggested contents of such an agreement and the procedures for 
obtaining approval are contained in 43 CFR part 3180.


<R05>
Sec. 3105.2  Communitization or drilling agreements.


<R05>

Departmental approval, a minimum of 3 signed counterparts shall be 
submitted. If State lands are involved, 1 additional counterpart shall 
be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 3105.2-2  Purpose.

    When a lease or a portion thereof cannot be independently developed 
and operated in conformity with an established well-spacing or well-
development program, the authorized officer may approve communitization 
or drilling agreements for such lands with other lands, whether or not 
owned by the United States, upon a determination that it is in the 
public interest. Operations or production under such an agreement shall 
be deemed to be operations or production as to each lease committed 
thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 3105.2-3  Requirements.

    (a) The communitization or drilling agreement shall describe the 
separate tracts comprising the drilling or spacing unit, shall show the 
apportionment of the production or royalties to the several parties and 
the name of the operator, and shall contain adequate provisions for the 
protection of the interests of the United States. The agreement shall be 
signed by or on behalf of all necessary parties and shall be filed prior 
to the expiration of the Federal lease(s) involved in order to confer 
the benefits of the agreement upon such lease(s).
    (b) The agreement shall be effective as to the Federal lease(s) 
involved only if approved by the authorized officer. Approved 
communitization agreements are considered effective from the date of the 
agreement or from the date of the onset of production from the 
communitized formation, whichever is earlier, except when the spacing 
unit is subject to a State pooling order after the date of first sale, 
then the effective date of the agreement may be the effective date of 
the order.
    (c) The public interest requirement for an approved communitization 
agreement shall be satisfied only if the well dedicated thereto has been 
completed for production in the communitized formation at the time the 
agreement is approved or, if not, that the operator thereafter commences 
and/or diligently continues drilling operations to a depth sufficient to 
test the communitized formation or establish to the satisfaction of the 
authorized officer that further drilling of the well would be 
unwarranted or impracticable. If an application is received for 
voluntary termination of a communitization agreement during its fixed 
term or such an agreement automatically expires at the end of its fixed 
term without the public interest requirement having been satisfied, the 
approval of that agreement by the authorized officer shall be invalid 
and no Federal lease shall be eligible for extension under Sec. 3107.4 
of this title.

Sec. 3105.3-2  Purpose.

    Approval of operating, drilling or development contracts ordinarily 
shall be granted only to permit operators or pipeline companies to enter 
into contracts with a number of lessees sufficient to justify operations 
on a scale large enough to justify the discovery, development, 
production or transportation of oil or gas and to finance the same.


<R05>
Sec. 3105.3-3  Requirements.

    The contract shall be accompanied by a statement showing all the 
interests held by the contractor in the area or field and the proposed 
or agreed plan for development and operation of the field. All the 
contracts held by the same contractor in the area or field shall be 
submitted for approval at the same time and full disclosure of the 
projects made.

<R05>
Sec. 3105.4-2  Purpose.

    Upon obtaining approval of the authorized officer, lessees may 
combine their interests in leases for the purpose of constructing and 
carrying on the business of a refinery or of establishing and 
constructing as a common carrier a pipeline or lines or railroads to be 
operated and used by them jointly in the transportation of oil or gas 
from their wells or from the wells of other lessees.


<R05>
Sec. 3105.4-3  Requirements.

    The application shall show a reasonable need for the combination and 
that it will not result in any concentration of control over the 
production or sale of oil and gas which would be inconsistent with the 
anti-monopoly provisions of law.


<R05>
Sec. 3105.4-4  Rights-of-way.

    Rights-of-way for pipelines may be granted as provided in part 2880

<R05>
Sec. 3105.5-1  Where filed.

    (a) Applications for subsurface storage shall be filed in the proper 
BLM office.
    (b) Enough copies of the final agreement signed by all the parties 
in interest shall be submitted to permit the retention of 5 copies by 
the Department after approval.


<R05>
Sec. 3105.5-2  Purpose.

    In order to avoid waste and to promote conservation of natural 
resources, the Secretary, upon application by the interested parties, 
may authorize the subsurface storage of oil and gas, whether or not 
produced from lands owned by the United States. Such authorization shall 
provide for the payment of such storage fee or rental on the stored oil 
or gas as may be determined adequate in each case, or, in lieu thereof, 
for a royalty other than that prescribed in the lease when such stored 
oil or gas is produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously 
produced.

Sec. 3106.1  Transfers, general.

    (a) Leases may be transferred by assignment or sublease as to all or 
part of the acreage in the lease or as to either a divided or undivided 
interest therein. An assignment of a separate zone or deposit, or of 
part of a legal subdivision, shall be disapproved.
    (b) An assignment of less than 640 acres outside Alaska or of less 
than 2,560 acres within Alaska shall be disapproved unless the 
assignment constitutes the entire lease or is demonstrated to further 
the development of oil and gas to the satisfaction of the authorized 
officer. Execution and submission of a request for approval of such an 
assignment shall certify that the assignment would further the 
development of oil and gas, subject to the provisions of Sec. 3102.5-3 
of this title. The rights of the transferee to a lease or an interest 
therein shall not be recognized by the Department until the transfer has 
been approved by the authorized officer. A transfer may be withdrawn in 
writing, signed by the transferor and the transferee, if the transfer 
has not been approved by the authorized officer. A request for approval 
of a transfer of a lease or interest in a lease shall be filed within 90 
days from the date of its execution. The 90-day filing period shall 
begin on the date the transferor signs and dates the transfer. If the 
transfer is filed after the 90th day, the authorized officer may require 
verification that the transfer is still in force and effect. A transfer 
of production payments or overriding royalty or other similar payments, 
arrangements, or interests shall be filed in the proper BLM office but 
shall not require approval.
    (c) No transfer of an offer to lease or interest in a lease shall be 
approved prior to the issuance of the lease.

Sec. 3106.6  Bonds.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.6-1  Lease bond.

    Where a lease bond is maintained by the lessee or operating rights 
owner (sublessee) in connection with a particular lease, the transferee 
of record title interest or operating rights in such lease shall 
furnish, if bond coverage continues to be required, either a proper bond 
or consent of the surety under the existing bond to become co-principal 
on such bond if the transferor's bond does not expressly contain such 
consent. Where bond coverage is provided by an operator, the new 
operator shall furnish an appropriate replacement bond or provide 
evidence of consent of the surety under the existing bond to become co-
principal on such bond.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.6-2  Statewide/nationwide bond.

    If the transferee is maintaining a statewide or nationwide bond, a

[[Page 344]]


<R05>
Sec. 3106.7  Approval of transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.7-1  Failure to qualify.

    No transfer of record title or of operating rights (sublease) shall 
be approved if the transferee or any other parties in interest are not 
qualified to hold the transferred interest(s), or if the bond, should 
one be required, is insufficient. Transfers are approved for 
administrative purposes only. Approval does not warrant or certify that 
either party to a transfer holds legal or equitable title to a lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.7-2  Continuing responsibility.

    The transferor and its surety shall continue to be responsible for 
the performance of all obligations under the lease until a transfer of 
record title or of operating rights (sublease) is approved by the 
authorized officer. If a transfer of record title is not approved, the 
obligation of the transferor and its surety to the United States shall 
continue as though no such transfer had been filed for approval. After 
approval of the transfer of record title, the transferee and its surety 
shall be responsible for the performance of all lease obligations, 
notwithstanding any terms in the transfer to the contrary. When a 
transfer of operating rights (sublease) is approved, the sublessee is 
responsible for all obligations under the lease rights transferred to 
the sublessee.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.7-3  Lease account status.

    A transfer of record title or of operating rights (sublease) in a 
producing lease shall not be approved unless the lease account is in 
good standing.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.7-4  Effective date of transfer.

    The signature of the authorized officer on the official form shall 
constitute approval of the transfer of record title or of operating 
rights (sublease) which shall take effect as of the first day of the 
lease month following the date of filing in the proper BLM office of all 
documents and statements required by this subpart and an appropriate 
bond, if one is required.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.7-5  Effect of transfer.

    A transfer of record title to 100 percent of a portion of the lease 
segregates the transferred portion and the retained portion into 
separate leases. Each resulting lease retains the anniversary date and 
the terms and conditions of the original lease. A transfer of an 
undivided record title interest or a transfer of operating rights 
(sublease) shall not segregate the transferred and retained portions 
into separate leases.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.8  Other types of transfers.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.8-1  Heirs and devisees.

rights shall be transferred to the heirs, devisees, executor or 
administrator of the estate, as appropriate, upon the filing of a 
statement that all parties are qualified to hold a lease in accordance 
with subpart 3102 of this title. No filing fee is required. A bond rider 
or replacement bond may be required for any bond(s) previously furnished 
by the decedent.
    (b) Any ownership or interest otherwise forbidden by the regulations 
in this group which may be acquired by descent, will, judgement or 
decree may be held for a period not to exceed 2 years after its 
acquisition. Any such forbidden ownership or interest held for a period 
of more than 2 years after acquisition shall be subject to cancellation.

    A change of name of a lessee shall be reported to the proper BLM 
office. No filing fee is required. The notice of name change shall be 
submitted in writing and be accompanied by a list of the serial numbers 
of the leases affected by the name change. If a bond(s) has been 
furnished, change of name may be made by surety consent or a rider to 
the original bond or by a replacement bond.


<R05>
Sec. 3106.8-3  Corporate merger.

    Where a corporate merger affects leases situated in a State where 
the transfer of property of the dissolving corporation to the surviving 
corporation is accomplished by operation of law, no transfer of any 
affected lease interest is required. A notification of the merger shall 
be furnished with a

[[Page 345]]

list, by serial number, of all lease interests affected. No filing fee 
is required. A bond rider or replacement bond conditioned to cover the 
obligations of all affected corporations may be required by the 
authorized officer as a prerequisite to recognition of the merger.

the end of the primary term or any lease which is part of an approved 
communitization agreement or cooperative or unit plan of development or 
operation upon which such drilling takes place, shall be extended for 2 
years subject to the rental being timely paid as required by Sec. 3103.2 
of this title, and subject to the provisions of Sec. 3105.2-3 and 
Sec. 3186.1 of this title, if applicable. Actual drilling operations

gas could be expected to make in that particular area, given the 
existing knowledge of geologic and other pertinent facts. In drilling a 
new well on a lease or for the benefit of a lease under the terms of an 
approved agreement or plan, it shall be taken to a depth sufficient to 
penetrate at least 1 formation recognized in the area as potentially 
productive of oil or gas, or where an existing well is reentered, it 
shall be taken to a depth sufficient to penetrate at least 1 new and 
deeper formation recognized in the area as potentially productive of oil 
or gas. The authorized officer may determine that further drilling is 
unwarranted or impracticable.

authorized officer after receipt of notice by certified mail from the 
authorized officer to do so. Such production shall be continued unless 
and until suspension of production is granted by the authorized officer.

plan, which covers lands within and lands outside the area covered by 
the plan,

[[Page 346]]

shall be segregated, as of the effective date of unitization, into 
separate leases; one covering the lands committed to the plan, the other 
lands not committed to the plan. The segregated lease covering the 
nonunitized portion of the lands shall continue in force and effect for 
the term of the lease or for 2 years from the date of segregation, 
whichever is longer. However, for any lease segregated from a unit, if 
the public interest requirement for the unit is not satisfied, such 
segregation shall be declared invalid by the authorized officer. 
Further, the segregation shall be conditioned to state that no 
operations shall be approved on the segregated portion of the lease past 
the expiration date of the original lease until the public interest 
requirement of the unit has been satisfied.

<R05>
Sec. 3107.6  Extension of reinstated leases.

    Where a reinstatement of a terminated lease is granted under 
Sec. 3108.2 of this title and the authorized officer finds that the 
reinstatement will not afford the lessee a reasonable opportunity to 
continue operations under the lease, the authorized officer may extend 
the term of such lease for a period sufficient to give the lessee such 
an opportunity. Any extension shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
    (a) No extension shall exceed a period equal to the unexpired 
portion of the lease or any extension thereof remaining at the date of 
termination.

[[Page 347]]

    (b) When the reinstatement occurs after the expiration of the term

shall be forwarded to the lessee for execution. Upon receipt of the 
executed lease forms, which constitutes certification of compliance with 
Sec. 3102.5 of this title, and any required bond, the authorized officer 
shall execute the lease and deliver 1 copy to the lessee.
    (b) If overriding royalties and payments out of production or 
similar interests in excess of 5 percent of gross production constitute 
a burden to lease operations that will retard, or impair, or cause 
premature abandonment, the lease application shall be suspended until 
overriding royalties and payments out of production or similar interests 
are reduced to not more then 5 percent of the value of the production. 
If the holders of outstanding overriding royalty or other interests 
payable out of production, the operator and the lessee are unable to

be afforded within a fixed period of time to submit proof that such 
adjustment has been effected. Upon failure to submit such proof within 
the time so fixed, the application for renewal shall be denied.

on which there is no well capable of producing oil or gas in paying 
quantities shall automatically terminate by operation of law (30 U.S.C. 
188) if the lessee fails to pay the rental at the designated Service 
office on or before the anniversary date of such lease. However, if the 
designated Service office is closed on the anniversary date, a rental 
payment received on the next day the Service office is open to the 
public shall be considered as timely made.
    (b) If the rental payment due under a lease is paid on or before its 
anniversary date but the amount of the payment is deficient and the 
deficiency is nominal as defined in this section, or the amount of 
payment made was determined in accordance with the rental or acreage 
figure stated in a bill rendered by the designated Service office, or 
decision rendered by the authorized officer, and such figure is found to 
be in error resulting in a deficiency, such lease shall not have 
automatically terminated unless the lessee fails to pay the deficiency 
within the period prescribed in the Notice of Deficiency provided for in 
this section. A deficiency shall be considered nominal if it is not more 
than $100 or more than 5 percent of the total payment due, whichever is 
less. The designated Service office shall send a Notice of Deficiency to 
the lessee. The Notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, and shall allow the lessee 15 days from the date of receipt 
or until the due date, whichever is later, to submit the full balance 
due to the designated Service office. If the payment required by the

Sec. 3108.2-2  Reinstatement at existing rental and royalty rates: Class I reinstatements.

    (a) Except as hereinafter provided, the authorized officer may 
reinstate a lease which has terminated for failure to pay on or before 
the anniversary date the full amount of rental due, provided that:
    (1) Such rental was paid or tendered within 20 days after the 
anniversary date; and
    (2) It is shown to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that 
the failure to timely submit the full amount of the rental due was 
either justified or not due to a lack of reasonable diligence on the 
part of the lessee (reasonable diligence shall include a rental payment 
which is postmarked by the

[[Page 349]]

U.S. Postal Service, common carrier, or their equivalent (not including 
private postal meters) on or before the lease anniversary date or, if 
the designated Service office is closed on the anniversary date, 
postmarked on the next day the Service office is open to the public); 
and
    (3) A petition for reinstatement, together with a nonrefundable 
filing fee of $25 and the required rental, including any back rental 
which has accrued from the date of the termination of the lease, is 
filed with the proper BLM office within 60 days after receipt of Notice 
of Termination of Lease due to late payment of rental. If a terminated 
lease becomes productive prior to the time the lease is reinstated, all 
required royalty that has accrued shall be paid to the Service.
    (b) The burden of showing that the failure to pay on or before the 
anniversary date was justified or not due to lack of reasonable 
diligence shall be on the lessee.
    (c) Under no circumstances shall a terminated lease be reinstated 
if:
    (1) A valid oil and gas lease has been issued prior to the filing of 
a petition for reinstatement affecting any of the lands covered by that 
terminated lease; or
    (2) The oil and gas interests of the United States in the lands have 
been disposed of or otherwise have become unavailable for leasing.
    (d) The authorized officer shall not issue a lease for lands which 
have been covered by a lease which terminated automatically until 90 
days after the date of termination.

<R05>
Sec. 3108.2-3  Reinstatement at higher rental and royalty rates: Class II reinstatements.

    (a) The authorized officer may, if the requirements of this section 
are met, reinstate an oil and gas lease which was terminated by 
operation of law for failure to pay rental timely when the rental was 
not paid or tendered within 20 days of the termination date and it is 
shown to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that such failure 
was justified or not due to a lack of reasonable diligence, or no matter 
when the rental was paid, it is shown to the satisfaction of the 
authorized officer that such failure was inadvertent.
    (b)(1) For leases that terminate on or after January 12, 1983, 
consideration may be given to reinstatement if the required back rental 
and royalty at the increased rates accruing from the date of 
termination, together with a petition for reinstatement, are filed on or 
before the earlier of:
    (i) Sixty days after the receipt of the Notice of Termination sent 
to the lessee of record; or
    (ii) Fifteen months after termination of the lease.
    (2) After determining that the requirements for filing of the 
petition for reinstatement have been timely met, the authorized officer 
may reinstate the lease if:
    (i) No valid lease has been issued prior to the filing of the 
petition for reinstatement affecting any of the lands covered by the 
terminated lease, whether such lease is still in effect or not;
    (ii) The oil and gas interests of the United States in the lands 
have not been disposed of or have not otherwise become unavailable for 
leasing;
    (iii) Payment of all back rentals and royalties at the rates 
established for the reinstated lease, including the release to the 
United States of funds being held in escrow, as appropriate;
    (iv) An agreement has been signed by the lessee and attached to and 
made a part of the lease specifying future rentals at the applicable 
rates specified for reinstated leases in Sec. 3103.2-2 of this title and 
future royalties at the rates set in Sec. 3103.3-1 of this title for all 
production removed or sold from such lease or shared by such lease from 
production allocated to the lease by virtue of its participation in a 
unit or communitization agreement or other form of approved joint 
development agreement or plan;
    (v) A notice of the proposed reinstatement of the terminated lease 
and the terms and conditions of reinstatement has been published in the 
Federal Register at least 30 days prior to the date of reinstatement for 
which the lessee shall reimburse the Bureau for the full costs incurred 
in the publishing of said notice; and

[[Page 350]]

    (vi) The lessee has paid the Bureau a nonrefundable administrative 
fee of $500.
    (c) The authorized officer shall not, after the receipt of a 
petition for reinstatement, issue a new lease affecting any of the lands 
covered by the terminated lease until all action on the petition is 
final.
    (d) The authorized officer shall furnish to the Chairpersons of the 
Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of 
Representatives and of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of 
the Senate, at least 30 days prior to the date of reinstatement, a copy 
of the notice, together with information concerning rental, royalty, 
volume of production, if any, and any other matter which the authorized 
officer considers significant in making the determination to reinstate.
    (e) If the authorized officer reinstates the lease, the 
reinstatement shall be as of the date of termination, for the unexpired 
portion of the original lease or any extension thereof remaining on the 
date of termination, and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in 
paying quantities. Where a lease is reinstated under this section and 
the authorized officer finds that the reinstatement of such lease either 
(1) occurs after the expiration of the primary term or any extension 
thereof, or (2) will not afford the lessee a reasonable opportunity to 
continue operations under the lease, the authorized officer may extend 
the term of the reinstated lease for such period as determined 
reasonable, but in no event for more than 2 years from the date of the 
reinstatement and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying 
quantities.
    (f) The authorized officer may, either in acting on a petition for 
reinstatement or in response to a request filed after reinstatement, or 
both, reduce the royalty in that reinstated lease on the entire 
leasehold or any tract or portion thereof segregated for royalty 
purposes, if he/she determines there are either economic or other 
circumstances which could cause undue economic hardship or premature 
termination of production; or because of any written action of the 
United States, its agents or employees, which preceded, and was a major 
consideration in, the lessee's expenditure of funds to develop the lands 
covered by the lease after the rental had become due and had not been 
paid; or if the authorized officer determines it is equitable to do so 
for any other reason.

    (a) For any unpatented oil placer mining claim validly located prior 
to February 24, 1920, which has been or is currently producing or is

covered by the abandoned unpatented oil placer mining claim, a 
noncompetitive oil and gas lease consistent with the provisions of

at the rates specified in Secs. 3103.2-2 and 3103.3-1 of this title, for 
any claim deemed conclusively abandoned after January 12, 1983. The 
petition shall have been filed on or before the 120th day after the 
final notification by the Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction 
of the determination of the abandonment of the oil placer mining claim.
    (c) The authorized officer shall not issue a noncompetitive oil and 
gas lease under this section if a valid oil and gas lease has been

the filing of the petition for issuance of a noncompetitive oil and gas 
lease.
    (d) After the filing of a petition for issuance of a noncompetitive 
oil and gas lease covering an abandoned oil placer claim, the authorized 
officer shall not issue any new lease affecting any lands covered by 
such petition until all action on the petition is final.
    (e) Any noncompetitive lease issued under this section shall 
include:
    (1) Terms and conditions for the payment of rental in accordance 
with Sec. 3103.2-2(j) of this title. Payment of back rentals accruing 
from the date of abandonment of the oil placer mining claim, at the

the claim was deemed conclusively abandoned prior to the lease issuance.
    (f) Noncompetitive oil and gas leases issued under this section 
shall be subject to all regulations in part 3100 of this title except 
for those terms and conditions mandated by Title IV of the Federal Oil

claim into a noncompetitive oil and gas lease, including the terms and 
conditions of conversion, shall be published in the Federal Register at 
least 30 days prior to the issuance of a noncompetitive oil and gas 
lease. The mining claim owner shall reimburse the Bureau for the full 
costs incurred in the publishing of said notice.
    (h) The mining claim owner shall pay the Bureau a nonrefundable 
administrative fee of $500 prior to the issuance of the noncompetitive 
lease.
    (i) The authorized officer may, either in acting on a petition to 
issue a noncompetitive oil and gas lease or in response to a request 
filed after issuance, or both, reduce the royalty in such lease, if he/
she determines there are either economic or other circumstances which 
could cause undue economic hardship or premature termination of 
production.

Sec. 3109.1-1  Generally.

    The Act of May 21, 1930 (30 U.S.C. 301-306), authorizes either the 
leasing of oil and gas deposits under railroad and other rights-of-way 
to the owner of the right-of-way or the entering of a compensatory

seq.), or pursuant to earlier railroad right-of-way statutes, and with 
respect to rights-of-way and easements issued pursuant to the Act of 
March 3, 1891 (43 U.S.C. 946 et seq.). The oil and gas underlying any 
other right-of-way or easement is included within any oil and gas lease 
issued pursuant to the Act which covers the lands within the right-of-
way, subject to the limitations on use of the surface, if any, set out 
in the statute under which, or permit by which, the right-of-way or

applications shall be filed by the owner of the right-of-way or by his/
her transferee and be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee of $75, 
and if filed by a transferee, by a duly executed transfer of the right 
to lease. The application shall detail the facts as to the ownership of 
the right-of-way, and of the transfer if the application is filed by a 
transferee; the development of oil or gas in adjacent or nearby lands, 
the location and depth of the wells, the production and the probability 
of drainage of the deposits in the right-of-way. A description by metes 
and bounds of the right-of-way is not required but each legal 
subdivision through which a portion of the right-of-way desired to be 
leased extends shall be described.

reasonable time, as provided in the notice, within which to submit a bid 
for the amount or percent of compensatory royalty, the owner or lessee 
shall pay for the extraction of the oil and gas underlying the right-of-
way through wells on such adjoining lands. The owner of the right-of-way 
shall be given the same time period to submit a bid for the lease.

the

[[Page 356]]

authorized officer. Noncompetitive leases, except future interest leases 
issued under Sec. 3110.9 of this title, shall be effective as of the 
first day of the month following the date the leases are issued. A lease 
may be made effective on the first day of the month within which it is

the authorized officer. Future interest leases issued under Sec. 3110.9 
of this title shall be effective as of the date the mineral interests 
vest in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.3-3  Lease offer size.

    (a) Lease offers for public domain minerals shall not be made for 
less than 640 acres or 1 full section, whichever is larger, where the 
lands have been surveyed under the rectangular survey system or are 
within an approved protracted survey, except where the offer includes 
all available lands within a section and there are no contiguous lands 
available for lease. Such public domain lease offers in Alaska shall not 
be made for less than 2,560 acres or 4 full contiguous sections, 
whichever is larger, where the lands have been surveyed under the 
rectangular survey system or are within an approved protracted survey, 
except where the offer includes all available lands within the subject 
section and there are no contiguous lands available for lease. Where an 
offer exceeds the minimum 640-acre provision of this paragraph, the 
offer may include less than all available lands in any given section. 
Cornering lands are not considered contiguous lands. This paragraph 
shall not apply to offers made under Sec. 3108.2-4 of this title or 
where the offer is filed on an entire parcel as it was offered by the 
Bureau in a competitive sale during that period specified under 
Sec. 3110.5-1 of this title.
    (b) An offer to lease public domain or acquired lands may not 
include more than 10,240 acres. The lands in an offer shall be entirely 
within an area of 6 miles square or within an area not exceeding 6 
surveyed sections in length or width measured in cardinal directions. An 
offer to lease acquired lands may exceed the 6 mile square limit if:
    (1) The lands are not surveyed under the rectangular survey system 
of public land surveys and are not within the area of the public land 
surveys; and
    (2) The tract desired is described by the acquisition or tract 
number assigned by the acquiring agency and less than 50 percent of the 
tract lies outside the 6 mile square area, and such acquisition or tract 
number is provided in accordance with Sec. 3110.5-2(d) of this title in 
lieu of any other description.
    (c) If an offer exceeds the 10,240 acre maximum by not more than 160 
acres, the offeror shall be granted 30 days from notice of the excess to 
withdraw the excess acreage from the offer, failing which the offer 
shall be rejected and priority lost.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.4  Requirements for offer.

    (a) An offer to lease shall be made on a current form approved by 
the Director, or on unofficial copies of that form in current use. For 
noncompetitive leases processed under Sec. 3108.2-4 of this title, the 
current lease form shall be used. Copies shall be exact reproductions on 
1 page of both sides of the official approved form, without additions, 
omissions, or other changes, or advertising. The original copy of each 
offer shall be typewritten or printed plainly in ink, signed in ink and 
dated by the offeror or the offeror's duly authorized agent, and shall 
be accompanied by the first year's rental and a nonrefundable filing fee 
of $75. The original and 2 copies of each offer to lease, with each copy 
showing that the original has been signed, shall be filed in the proper 
BLM office. A noncompetitive offer to lease a future interest applied 
for under ``Sec. 3110.9'' of this title shall be accompanied by a 
nonrefundable filing fee of $75. Where remittances for offers are 
returned for insufficient funds, the offer shall not obtain priority of 
filing until the date the remittance is properly made.
    (b) Where a correction to an offer is made, whether at the option of 
the offeror or at the request of the authorized officer, it shall gain 
priority as of the date the filing is correct and complete. The priority 
that existed before the date the corrected offer is filed, may be 
defeated by an intervening offer to the extent of any conflict in such 
offers, except as provided under Secs. 3103.2-1(a) and 3110.3-3(c) of 
this title.

[[Page 357]]

    (c) An offer shall be limited to either public domain minerals or 
acquired lands minerals, subject to the provisions for corrections under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Compliance with subpart 3102 shall be required.
    (e) All offers for leases should name the United States agency from 
which consent to the issuance of a lease shall be obtained, or the 
agency that may have title records covering the ownership for the 
mineral interest involved, and identify the project, if any, of which 
the lands covered by the offer are a part.

the end of that same month, the only acceptable description for a 
noncompetitive lease offer for the lands covered by that competitive 
process shall be the parcel number on the List of Lands Available for 
Competitive Nominations or the Notice of Competitive Lease Sale, 
whichever is appropriate. Each such offer shall contain only a single 
parcel. Thereafter, the description of the lands shall be made in 
accordance with the remainder of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.5-2  Public domain.

    (a) If the lands have been surveyed under the public land 
rectangular survey system, each offer shall describe the lands by legal 
subdivision, section, township, range, and, if needed, meridian.
    (b) If the lands have not been surveyed under the public land 
rectangular system, each offer shall describe the lands by metes and 
bounds, giving courses and distances between the successive angle points 
on the boundary of the tract, and connected by courses and distances to 
an official corner of the public land surveys.
    (c) When protracted surveys have been approved and the effective 
date thereof published in the Federal Register, all offers to lease 
lands shown on such protracted surveys, filed on or after such effective 
date, shall describe the lands in the same manner as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section for officially surveyed lands.
    (d)(1) Where offers are pending for unsurveyed lands that are 
subsequently surveyed or protracted before the lease issuance, the 
description in the lease shall be conformed to the subdivisions of the 
approved protracted survey or the public land survey, whichever is 
appropriate.
    (2) The description of lands in an existing lease shall be conformed 
to a subsequent resurvey or amended protraction survey, whichever is 
appropriate.
    (e) The requirements of this section shall apply to applications for

Sec. 3110.5-3  Acquired lands.

    (a) If the lands applied for lie within and conform to the 
rectangular system of public land surveys and constitute either all or a 
portion of the tract acquired by the United States, such lands shall be 
described by legal subdivision, section, township, range, and, if 
needed, meridian.
    (b) If the lands applied for do not conform to the rectangular 
system of public land surveys, but lie within an area of the public land 
surveys and constitute the entire tract acquired by the United States, 
such lands shall be described by metes and bounds, giving courses and 
distances between the successive angle points with appropriate ties to 
the nearest official survey corner, or a copy of the deed or other 
conveyance document by which the United States acquired title to the 
lands may be attached to the offer and referred to therein in lieu of 
redescribing the lands on the offer form. If the desired lands 
constitute less than the entire tract acquired by the United States, 
such lands shall be described by metes and bounds, giving courses and 
distances between the successive angle points with appropriate ties to 
the nearest official survey corner. If a portion of the boundary of the 
desired lands coincides with the boundary in the deed or other 
conveyance document, that boundary need not be redescribed on the offer

[[Page 358]]

form, provided that a copy of the deed or other conveyance document upon 
which the coinciding description is clearly identified is attached to 
the offer. That portion of the description not coinciding shall be tied 
by description on the offer by courses and distances between successive 
angle points into the description in the deed or other conveyance 
document.
    (c) If the lands applied for lie outside an area of the public land 
surveys and constitute the entire tract acquired by the United States, 
such lands shall be described as in the deed or other conveyance 
document by which the United States acquired title to the lands, or a 
copy of that document may be attached to the offer and referred to 
therein in lieu of redescribing the lands on the offer form. If the 
desired lands constitute less than the entire tract acquired by the 
United States, such lands shall be described by courses and distances 
between successive angle points tying by courses and distances into the 
description in the deed or other conveyance document. If a portion of 
the boundary of the desired lands coincides with the boundary in the 
deed or other conveyance document, that boundary need not be redescribed

document upon which the coinciding description is clearly identified is 
attached to the offer. That portion of the description not coinciding 
shall be tied by description in the offer by courses and distances 
between successive angle points into the description in the deed or 
other conveyance document.
    (d) Where the acquiring agency has assigned an acquisition or tract 
number covering the lands applied for, without loss of priority to the 
offeror, the authorized officer may require that number in addition to 
any description otherwise required by this section. If the authorized 
officer determines that the acquisition or tract number, together with 
identification of the State and county, constitutes an adequate 
description, the authorized officer may allow the description in this 
manner in lieu of other descriptions required by this section.
    (e) Where the lands applied for do not conform to the rectangular 
system of public land surveys, without loss of priority to the offeror, 
the authorized officer may require 3 copies of a map upon which the 
location of the desired lands are clearly marked with respect to the 
administrative unit or project of which they are a part.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.5-4  Accreted lands.

    Where an offer includes any accreted lands, the accreted lands shall 
be described by metes and bounds, giving courses and distances between

<R05>
Sec. 3110.6  Withdrawal of offer.

    An offer for noncompetitive lease under this subpart may be 
withdrawn in whole or in part by the offeror. However, a withdrawal of 
an offer made in accordance with Sec. 3110.1(b) of this title may be 
made only if the withdrawal is received by the proper BLM office after 
60 days from the date of filing of such offer. No withdrawal may be made 
once the lease, an amendment of the lease, or a separate lease, 
whichever covers the lands so described in the withdrawal, has been 
signed on behalf of the United States. If a public domain offer is 
partially withdrawn, the lands retained in the offer shall comply with 
Sec. 3110.3-3(a) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.7  Action on offer.

    (a) No lease shall be issued before final action has been taken on 
any prior offer to lease the lands or any extension of, or petition for 
reinstatement of, an existing or former lease on the lands. If a lease 
is issued before final action, it shall be canceled, if the prior 
offeror is qualified to receive a

[[Page 359]]

lease or the petitioner is entitled to reinstatement of a former lease.
    (b) The authorized officer shall not issue a lease for lands covered 
by a lease which terminated automatically, until 90 days after the date 
of termination.
    (c) The United States shall indicate its acceptance of the lease 
offer, in whole or in part, and the issuance of the lease, by signature 
of the authorized officer on the current lease form. A signed copy of

this group, an offer that is not filed in accordance with the 
regulations in this part shall be rejected.
    (e) Filing an offer on a lease form not currently in use, unless 
such lease form has been declared obsolete by the Director prior to the 
filing shall be allowed, on the condition that the offeror is bound by 
the terms and conditions of the lease form currently in use.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.8  Amendment to lease.

    After the competitive process has concluded in accordance with 
subpart 3120 of this title, if any of the lands described in a lease 
offer for lands available during the 2-year period are open to oil and 
gas filing when the offer is filed but are omitted from the lease for 
any reason the original lease shall be amended to include the omitted 
lands unless, before the issuance of the amendment, the proper BLM 
office receives a withdrawal of the offer with respect to such lands or 
the offeror elects to receive a separate lease in lieu of an amendment. 
Such election shall be made by submission of a signed statement of the 
offeror requesting a separate lease, and a new offer on the required 
form executed pursuant to this part describing the remaining lands in 
the original offer. The new offer shall have the same priority as the 
old offer. No new application fee is required with the new offer. The 
rental payment held in connection with the original offer shall be 
applied to the new offer. The rental and the term of the lease for the 
lands added by an amendment shall be the same as if the lands had been 
included in the original lease when it was issued. If a separate lease 
is issued, it shall be dated in accordance with Sec. 3110.3-2 of this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.9  Future interest offers.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.9-1  Availability.

    A noncompetitive future interest lease shall not be issued until the 
lands covered by the offer have been made available for competitive 
lease under subpart 3120 of this title. An offer made for lands that are 
leased competitively shall be rejected.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.9-2  Form of offer.

    An offer to lease a future interest shall be filed in accordance 
with this subpart, and may include tracts in which the United States 
owns a fractional present interest as well as the future interest for 
which a lease is sought.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.9-3  Fractional present and future interest.

    Where the United States owns both a present fractional interest and 
a future fractional interest in the minerals in the same tract, the 
lease, when issued, shall cover both the present and future interests in 
the lands. The effective date and primary term of the present interest 
lease is unaffected by the vesting of a future fractional interest. The 
lease for the future fractional interest, when such interest vests in 
the United States, shall have the same primary term and anniversary date 
as the present fractional interest lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3110.9-4  Future interest terms and conditions.

    (a) No rental or royalty shall be due to the United States prior to 
the vesting of the oil and gas rights in the United States. However, the 
future interest lessee shall agree that if he/she is or becomes the 
holder of any present interest operating rights in the lands:
    (1) The future interest lessee transfers all or a part of the 
lessee's present oil and gas interests, such lessee shall file in the 
proper BLM office an assignment or transfer, in accordance with subpart 
3106 of this title, of the future interest lease of the same type and 
proportion as the transfer of the present interest, and

[[Page 360]]

    (2) The future interest lessee's present lease interests are 
relinquished, cancelled, terminated, or expired, the future interest 
lease rights with the United States also shall cease and terminate to 
the same extent.
    (b) Upon vesting of the oil and gas rights in the United States, the 
future interest lease rental and royalty shall be as for any 
noncompetitive lease issued under this subpart, as provided in subpart 
3103 of this title, and the acreage shall be chargeable in accordance 
with Sec. 3101.2 of this title.

cancelled or relinquished.
    (b) Lands for which authority to lease has been delegated from the 
General Services Administration.
    (c) If, in proceeding to cancel a lease, interest in a lease, option 
to acquire a lease or an interest therein, acquired in violation of any 
of the provisions of the act, an underlying lease, interest or option in 
the lease is cancelled or forfeited to the United States and there are 
valid interests therein that are not subject to cancellation, 
forfeiture, or compulsory disposition, such underlying lease, interest, 
or option shall be sold to the highest responsible qualified bidder by 
competitive bidding under this subpart, subject to all outstanding valid 
interests therein and valid options pertaining thereto. If less than the 
whole interest in the lease, interest, or option is cancelled or 
forfeited, such partial interest shall likewise be sold by competitive 
bidding. If no satisfactory bid is obtained as a result of the 
competitive offering of such whole or partial interests, such interests 
may be sold in accordance with section 27 of the Act by such other 
methods as the authorized officer deems appropriate, but on terms no 
less favorable to the United States than those of the best competitive 
bid received. Interest in outstanding leases(s) so sold shall be subject 
to the terms and conditions of the existing lease(s).
    (d) Lands which are otherwise unavailable for leasing but which are 
subject to drainage (protective leasing).

<R05>
Sec. 3140.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to provide for the conversion of 
existing oil and gas leases and valid claims based on mineral locations 
within Special Tar Sand Areas to combined hydrocarbon leases.


<R05>
Sec. 3140.0-3  Authority.

    These regulations are issued under the authority of the Mineral 
Lands Leasing Act of February 25, 1920 (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), the 
Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands (30 U.S.C. 351 et seq.), and the 
Combined Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-78).


<R05>
Sec. 3140.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Combined hydrocarbon lease means a lease issued in a Special Tar 
Sand Area for the removal of gas and nongaseous hydrocarbon substances 
other than coal, oil shale or gilsonite.
    (b) A complete plan of operations means a plan of operations which 
is in substantial compliance with the information requirements of 43 CFR 
3572.1 for both exploration plans and mining plans, as well as any 
additional information required in these regulations and under 43 CFR 
3572.1, as may be appropriate.
    (c) Special Tar Sand Area means an area designated by the Department 
of the Interior's orders of November 20, 1980 (45 FR 76800), and January 
21, 1981 (46 FR 6077) referred to in those orders as Designated Tar Sand 
Areas, as containing substantial deposits of tar sand.
    (d) Owner of an oil and gas lease means all of the record title 
holders of an oil gas lease.
    (e) Owner of a valid claim based on a mineral location means all 
parties appearing on the title records recognized as official under 
State law as having the right to sell or transfer any part of

[[Page 374]]

the mining claim, which was located within a Special Tar Sand Area prior 
to January 21, 1926, for any hydrocarbon resource, except coal, oil 
shale or gilsonite, leasable under the Combined Hydrocarbon Leasing Act.
    (f) Unitization means unitization as that term is defined in 43 CFR 
part 3180.

<R05>
Sec. 3140.1-1  Existing rights.

    (a) The owner of an oil and gas lease issued prior to November 16, 
1981, or the owner of a valid claim based on a mineral location situated 
within a Special Tar Sand Area may convert that portion of the lease or 
claim so situated to a combined hydrocarbon lease, provided that such 
conversion is consistent with the provisions of this subpart.
    (b) Owners of oil and gas leases in Special Tar Sand Areas who elect 
not to convert their leases to a combined hydrocarbon lease do not 
acquire the rights to any hydrocarbon resource except oil and gas as 
those terms were defined prior to the enactment of the Combined 
Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of 1981. The failure to file an application to 
convert a valid claim based on a mineral location within the time herein 
provided shall have no effect on the validity of the mining claim nor 
the right to maintain that claim.


<R05>
Sec. 3140.1-2  Notice of intent to convert.

    (a) Owners of oil and gas leases in Special Tar Sand Areas which are 
scheduled to expire prior to the effective date of these regulations or 
within 6 months thereafter, may preserve the right to convert their 
leases to combined hydrocarbon leases by filing a Notice of Intent to 
Convert with the State Director, Utah State Office, Bureau of Land 
Management, 136 E. South Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111.
    (b) A letter, submitted by the lessee, notifying the Bureau of Land 
Management of the lessee's intention to submit a plan of operations 
shall constitute a notice of intent to convert a lease. The Notice of 
Intent shall contain the lease number.

Sec. 3140.1-3  Exploration plans.

    (a) The authorized officer may grant permission to holders of 
existing oil and gas leases to gather information to develop, perfect, 
complete or amend a plan of operations required for conversion upon the 
approval of the authorized officer of an exploration plan developed in 
accordance with 43 CFR 3592.1.
    (b) The approval of an exploration plan in units of the National 
Park System requires the consent of the Regional Director of the 
National Park Service in accordance with Sec. 3140.7 of this title.
    (c) The filing of an exploration plan alone shall be insufficient to 
meet the requirements of a complete plan of operations as set forth in 
Sec. 3140.2-3 of this title.

[47 FR 22478, May 24, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 12351, Apr. 3, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 3140.1-4  Other provisions.

    (a) A combined hydrocarbon lease shall be for no more than 5,120 
acres. Acreage held under lease in a Special Tar Sand Area is not 
chargeable to State oil and gas limitations allowable in Sec. 3101.2 of 
this title.
    (b) The rental rate for a combined hydrocarbon lease shall be $2 per 
acre per year and shall be payable annually in advance.
    (c)(1) The royalty rate for a combined hydrocarbon lease converted 
from an oil and gas lease shall be that provided for in the original oil 
and gas lease.
    (2) The royalty rate for a combined hydrocarbon lease converted from 
a valid claim based on a mineral location shall be 12\1/2\ percent.
    (3) A reduction of royalties may be granted either as provided in 
Sec. 3103.4 of this title or, at the request of the lessee and upon a 
review of information provided by the lessee, prior to commencement of 
commercial operations if the purpose of the request is to promote 
development and the maximum production of tar sand.

[[Page 375]]

    (d)(1) Existing oil and gas leases and valid claims based on mineral 
locations may be unitized prior to or after the lease or claim has been 
converted to a combined hydrocarbon lease. The requirements of 43 CFR 
part 3180 shall provide the procedures and general guidelines for 
unitization of combined hydrocarbon leases. For leases within units of 
the National Park System, unitization requires the consent of the 
Regional Director of the National Park Service in accordance with 
Sec. 3140.4-1(b) of this title.
    (2) If the plan of operations submitted for conversion is designed 
to cover a unit, a fully executed unit agreement shall be approved 
before the plan of operations applicable to the unit may be approved 
under Sec. 3140.2 of this title. The proposed plan of operations and the 
proposed unit agreement may be reviewed concurrently. The approved unit 
agreement shall be effective after the leases or claims subject to it 
are converted to combined hydrocarbon leases. The plan of operations 
shall explain how and when each lease included in the unit operation 
will be developed.
    (e) Except as provided for in this subpart, the regulations set out 
in part 3100 of this title are applicable, as appropriate, to all 
combined hydrocarbon leases issued under this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 3140.2-3  Application requirements.

    (a) The applicant shall submit to the State Director, Utah State 
Office of the Bureau of Land Management, a written request for a 
combined hydrocarbon lease signed by the owner of the lease or valid 
claim which shall be accompanied by 3 copies of a plan of operations 
which shall meet the requirements of 43 CFR 3592.1 and which shall 
provide for reasonable protection of the environment and diligent 
development of the resources requiring enhanced recovery methods of 
development or mining.
    (b) A plan of operations may be modified or amended before or after 
conversion of a lease or valid claim to reflect changes in technology, 
slippages in schedule beyond the control of the lessee, new information 
about the resource or the economic or environmental aspects of its 
development, changes to or initiation of applicable unit agreements or 
for other purposes. To obtain approval of a modification or amended 
plan, the applicant shall submit a written statement of the proposed 
changes or supplements and the justification for the changes proposed. 
Any modifications shall be in accordance with 43 CFR 3592.1(c). The 
approval of the modification or amendment is the responsibility of the 
authorized officer. Changes or modification to the plan of operations 
shall have no effect on the primary term of the lease. The authorized 
officer shall, prior to approving any amendment or modification, review 
the modification or amendment with the appropriate surface management 
agency. For leases within units of the National Park System, no 
amendment or modification shall be approved without the consent of the 
Regional Director of the National Park Service in accordance with 
Sec. 3140.7 of this title.
    (c) The plan of operations may be for a single existing oil and gas 
lease or valid claim or for an area of proposed unit operation.
    (d) The plan of operations shall identify by lease number all 
Federal oil and gas leases proposed for conversion and identify valid 
claims proposed for conversion by the recordation number of the mining 
claim.

[[Page 376]]

    (e) The plan of operations shall include any proposed designation of 
operator or proposed operating agreement.
    (f) The plan of operations may include an exploration phase, if 
necessary, but it shall include a development phase. Such a plan can be 
approved even though it may indicate work under the exploration phase is 
necessary to perfect the proposed plan for the development phase as long 
as the overall plan demonstrates reasonable protection of the 
environment and diligent development of the resources requiring enhanced 
recovery methods of mining.
    (g)(1) Upon determination that the plan of operations is complete, 
the authorized officer shall suspend the term of the Federal oil and gas 
lease(s) as of the date that the complete plan was filed until the plan 
is finally approved or rejected. Only the term of the oil and gas lease 
shall be suspended, not any operation and production requirements 
thereunder.
    (2) If the authorized officer determines that the plan of operations 
is not complete, the applicant shall be notified that the plan is 
subject to rejection if not completed within the period specified in the 
notice.
    (3) The authorized officer may request additional data after the 
plan of operations has been determined to be complete. This request for 
additional information shall have no effect on the suspension of the 
running of the oil and gas lease.

[[Page 383]]


<R05>
Sec. 3142.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in part 3140 of this title, the term production in paying 
quantities means:
    (a) Production, in compliance with an approved plaln of operations 
and by nonconventional methods, of oil and gas which can be marketed; or
    (b) Production of oil or gas by conventional methods as the term is 
currently used in part 3160 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3142.1  Diligent development.

    A lessee shall have met his/her diligent development obligation if:
    (a) The lessee is conducting activity on the lease in accordance 
with an approved plan of operations; and
    (b) The lessee files with the authorized officer, not later than the 
end of the eighth lease year, a supplement to the approved plan of 
operations which shall include the estimated recoverable tar sand 
reserves and a detailed development plan for the next stage of 
operations;
    (c) The lessee has achieved production in paying quantities, as that 
term is defined in Sec. 3142.0-5(a) of this title, by the end of the 
primary term; and
    (d) The lessee annually produces the minimum amount of tar sand 
established by the authorized officer under the lease in the minimum 
production schedule which shall be made part of the plan of operations 
or pays annually advance royalty in lieu of this minimum production.


<R05>
Sec. 3142.2  Minimum production levels.


<R05>
Sec. 3142.2-1  Minimum production schedule.

    Upon receipt of the supplement to the plan of operations described 
in Sec. 3142.1(b) of this title, the authorized officer shall examine 
the information furnished by the lessee and determine if the estimate of 
the recoverable tar sand reserves is adequate and reasonable. In making 
this determination, the authorized officer may request, and the lessee 
shall furnish, any information that is the basis of the lessee's 
estimate of the recoverable tar sand reserves. As part of the authorized 
officer's determination that the estimate of the recoverable tar sand 
reserves is adequate and reasonable, he/she may consider, but is not 
limited to, the following: or grade, strip ratio, vertical and horizal 
continuity, extract process recoverability, and proven or unproven 
status of extraction technology, terrain, environmental mitigation 
factors, marketability of products and capital operations costs. The 
authorized officer shall then establish as soon as possible, but prior 
to the beginning of the eleventh year, based upon the estimate of the 
recoverable tar sand reserves, a minimum annual tar sand production 
schedule for the lease or unit operations which shall start in the 
eleventh year of the lease. This minimum production level shall escalate 
in equal annual increments to a maximum of 1 percent of the estimated 
recoverable tar sand reserves in the twentieth year of the lease and 
remain at 1 percent each year thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 3142.2-2  Advance royalties in lieu of production.

    (a) Failure to meet the minimum annual tar sand production schedule 
level in any year shall result in the assessment of an advance royalty 
in lieu of production which shall be credited to future production 
royalty assessments applicable to the lease or unit.
    (b) If there is no production during the lease year, and the lessee 
has reason to believe that there shall be no production during the 
remainder of the lease year, the lessee shall submit to the authorized 
officer a request for suspension of production at least 90 days prior to 
the end of that lease year and a payment sufficient to cover any advance 
royalty due and owing as a result of the failure to produce. Upon 
receipt of the request for suspension of production and the accompanying 
payment, the authorized officer shall approve a suspension of production 
for that lease year and the lease shall not expire during that year for 
lack of production.
    (c) If there is production on the lease or unit during the lease 
year, but such production fails to meet the minimum production schedule 
required by the plan of operations for that lease or unit, the lessee 
shall pay an advance royalty within 60 days of the end of the lease year 
in an amount sufficient to

[[Page 384]]

cover the difference between such actual production and the production 
schedule required by the plan of operations for that lease or unit and 
the authorized officer shall direct a suspension of production for those 
periods during which no production occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 3142.3  Expiration.

    Failure of the lessee to pay advance royalty within the time 
prescribed by the authorized officer, or failure of the lessee to comply 
with any other provisions of this subpart following the end of the 
primary term of the lease, shall result in the automatic expiration of 
the lease as of the first of the month following notice to the lessee of 
its failure to comply. The lessee shall remain subject to the 
requirement of applicable laws, regulations and lease terms which have 
not been met at the expiration of the lease.

   Subpart 3150--Onshore Oil and Gas Geophysical Exploration; General


<R05>
Sec. 3150.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish procedures for conducting 
oil and gas geophysical exploration operations when authorization for 
such operations is required from the Bureau of Land Management. 
Geophysical exploration on public lands, the surface of which is 
administered by the Bureau, requires Bureau approval. The procedures in 
this part also apply to geophysical exploration conducted under the 
rights granted by any Federal oil and gas lease unless the surface is 
administered by the U.S. Forest Service. However, a lessee may elect to 
conduct exploration operations outside of the rights granted by the 
lease, in which case authorization from the surface managing agency or 
surface owner may be required. At the request of any other surface 
managing agency, the procedures in this part may be applied on a case-
by-case basis to unleased public lands administered by such agency. The 
procedures of this part do not apply to:
    (a) Casual use activities;
    (b) Operations conducted on private surface overlying public lands 
unless such operations are conducted by a lessee under the rights 
granted by the Federal oil and gas lease; and
    (c) Exploration operations conducted in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge in accordance with section 1002 of the Alaska National Interest 
Lands Conservation Act (See 50 CFR part 37).


<R05>
Sec. 3150.0-3  Authority.

    The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended and supplemented, (30 
U.S.C. 181 et seq.), the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947, 
as amended (30

[[Page 385]]

U.S.C. 351-359), the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 
U.S.C. 3101 et seq.), the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 
(43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 
1952 (31 U.S.C. 483a), the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 
1976 (42 U.S.C. 6504) and the Department of the Interior Appropriations 
Act, Fiscal Year 1981 (42 U.S.C. 6508).


<R05>
Sec. 3150.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    (a) Oil and gas geophysical exploration means activity relating to 
the search for evidence of oil and gas which requires the physical 
presence upon the lands and which may result in damage to the lands or 
the resources located thereon. It includes, but is not limited to, 
geophysical operations, construction of roads and trails and cross-
country transit of vehicles over such lands. It does not include core 
drilling for subsurface geologic information or drilling for oil and 
gas; these activities shall be authorized only by the issuance of an oil 
and gas lease and the approval of an Application for a Permit to Drill. 
The regulations in this part, however, are not intended to prevent 
drilling operations necessary for placing explosive charges, where 
permissible, for seismic exploration.
    (b) Casual use means activities that involve practices which do not 
ordinarily lead to any appreciable disturbance or damage to lands, 
resources and improvements. For example, activities which do not involve 
use of heavy equipment or explosives and which do not involve vehicular 
movement except over established roads and trails are casual use.

[53 FR 17359, May 16, 1988; 53 FR 31959, Aug. 22, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 3150.1  Suspension, revocation or cancellation.

    The right to conduct exploration under notices of intent and oil and 
gas geophysical exploration permits may be revoked or suspended, after 
notice, by the authorized officer and upon a final administrative 
finding of a violation of any term or condition of the instrument, 
including, but not limited to, terms and conditions requiring compliance 
with regulations issued under Acts applicable to the public lands and 
applicable State air and water quality standards or implementation 
plans. The Secretary may order an immediate temporary suspension of 
activities authorized under a permit or other use authorization prior to 
a hearing or final administrative finding if he/she determines that such 
a suspension is necessary to protect health or safety or the 
environment. Further, where other applicable law contains specific 
provisions for suspension, revocation, or cancellation of a permit or 
other authorization to use, occupy, or develop the public lands, the 
specific provisions of such law shall prevail.


<R05>
Sec. 3150.2  Appeals.

    (a) A party adversely affected by a decision or approval of the 
authorized officer may appeal that decision to the Interior Board of 
Land Appeals as set forth in part 4 of this title.
    (b) All decisions and approvals of the authorized officer under this 
part shall remain effective pending appeal unless the Interior Board of 
Land Appeals determines otherwise upon consideration of the standards 
stated in this paragraph. The provisions of 43 CFR 4.21(a) shall not 
apply to any decision or approval of the authorized officer under this 
part. A petition for a stay of a decision or approval of the authorized 
officer shall be filed with the Interior Board of Land Appeals, Office 
of Hearings and Appeals, Department of the Interior, and shall show 
sufficient justification based on the following standards:
    (1) The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or 
denied,
    (2) The likelihood of the appellant's success on the merits,
    (3) The likelihood of irreparable harm to the appellant or resources 
if the stay is not granted, and
    (4) Whether the public interest favors granting the stay.

Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish the discretionary authority of 
the authorized officer to stay the effectiveness of a decision subject 
to appeal pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section upon a request by an 
adversely affected party or on the authorized officer's own initiative. 
If the authorized officer

[[Page 386]]

denies such a request, the requester can petition for a stay of the 
denial decision by filing a petition with the Interior Board of Land 
Appeals that addresses the standards described above in this paragraph.

    (a) Authorized representative means any entity or individual 
authorized by the Secretary to perform duties by cooperative agreement, 
delegation or contract.

[[Page 390]]

    (b) Avoidably lost means the venting or flaring of produced gas 
without the prior authorization, approval, ratification or acceptance of 
the authorized officer and the loss of produced oil or gas when the 
authorized officer determines that such loss occurred as a result of:
    (1) Negligence on the part of the operator; or
    (2) The failure of the operator to take all reasonable measures to 
prevent and/or control the loss; or
    (3) The failure of the operator to comply fully with the applicable 
lease terms and regulations, applicable orders and notices, or the 
written orders of the authorized officer; or
    (4) Any combination of the foregoing.
    (c) Federal lands means all lands and interests in lands owned by 
the United States which are subject to the mineral leasing laws, 
including mineral resources or mineral estates reserved to the United 
States in the conveyance of a surface or nonmineral estate.
    (d) Fresh water means water containing not more than 1,000 ppm of 
total dissolved solids, provided that such water does not contain 
objectionable levels of any constituent that is toxic to animal, plant 
or acquatic life, unless otherwise specified in applicable notices or 
orders.
    (e) Knowingly or willfully means a violation that constitutes the 
voluntary or conscious performance of an act that is prohibited or the 
voluntary or conscious failure to perform an act or duty that is 
required. It does not include performances or failures to perform that 
are honest mistakes or merely inadvertent. It includes, but does not 
require, performances or failures to perform that result from a criminal 
or evil intent or from a specific intent to violate the law. The knowing 
or willful nature of conduct may be established by plain indifference to 
or reckless disregard of the requirements of the law, regulations, 
orders, or terms of the lease. A consistent pattern of performance or 
failure to perform also may be sufficient to establish the knowing or 
willful nature of the conduct, where such consistent pattern is neither 
the result of honest mistakes or mere inadvertency. Conduct that is 
otherwise regarded as being knowing or willful is rendered neither 
accidental nor mitigated in character by the belief that the conduct is 
reasonable or legal.
    (f) Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint 
venture or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under 
a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, extraction of or 
removal of oil or gas.
    (g) Lease site means any lands, including the surface of a severed 
mineral estate, on which exploration for, or extraction and removal of, 
oil or gas is authorized under a lease.
    (h) Lessee means a person or entity holding record title in a lease 
issued by the United States.
    (i) Lessor means the party to a lease who holds legal or beneficial 
title to the mineral estate in the leased lands.
    (j) Major violation means noncompliance that causes or threatens 
immediate, substantial, and adverse impacts on public health and safety, 
the environment, production accountability, or royalty income.
    (k) Maximum ultimate economic recovery means the recovery of oil and 
gas from leased lands which a prudent operator could be expected to make 
from that field or reservoir given existing knowledge of reservoir and 
other pertinent facts and utilizing common industry practices for 
primary, secondary or tertiary recovery operations.
    (l) Minor violation means noncompliance that does not rise to the 
level of a major violation.
    (m) New or resumed production under section 102(b)(3) of the Federal 
Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act means the date on which a well 
commences production, or resumes production after having been off 
production for more than 90 days, and is to be construed as follows:
    (1) For an oil well, the date on which liquid hydrocarbons are first 
sold or shipped from a temporary storage facility, such as a test tank, 
or the date on which liquid hydrocarbons are first produced into a 
permanent storage facility, whichever first occurs; and
    (2) For a gas well, the date on which gas is first measured through 
sales metering facilities or the date on which associated liquid 
hydrocarbons are first sold or shipped from a temporary storage 
facility, whichever first occurs. For purposes of this provision, a gas 
well

incapable of production.
    (n) Notice to lessees and operators (NTL) means a written notice 
issued by the authorized officer. NTL's implement the regulations in 
this part and operating orders, and serve as instructions on specific 
item(s) of importance within a State, District, or Area.
    (o) Onshore oil and gas order means a formal numbered order issued 
by the Director that implements and supplements the regulations in this 
part.
    (p) Operating rights owner means a person or entity holding 
operating rights in a lease issued by the United States. A lessee also 
may be an operating rights owner if the operating rights in a lease or 
portion thereof have not been severed from record title.
    (q) Operator means any person or entity including but not limited to 
the lessee or operating rights owner, who has stated in writing to the 
authorized officer that it is responsible under the terms and conditions 
of the lease for the operations conducted on the leased lands or a 
portion thereof.
    (r) Paying well means a well that is capable of producing oil or gas 
of sufficient value to exceed direct operating costs and the costs of 
lease rentals or minimum royalty.
    (s) Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium or joint venture.
    (t) Production in paying quantities means production from a lease of 
oil and/or gas of sufficient value to exceed direct operating costs and 
the cost of lease rentals or minimum royalties.
    (u) Superintendent means the superintendent of an Indian Agency, or 
other officer authorized to act in matters of record and law with 
respect to oil and gas leases on restricted Indian lands.
    (v) Surface use plan of operations means a plan for surface use, 
disturbance, and reclamation.
    (w) Waste of oil or gas means any act or failure to act by the 
operator that is not sanctioned by the authorized officer as necessary

at least 30 days before commencement of operations is desired. Prior to 
approval, the application shall be administratively and technically 
complete. A complete application consists of Form 3160-3 and the 
following attachments:
    (1) A drilling plan, which may already be on file, containing 
information required by paragraph (e) of this section and appropriate 
orders and notices.
    (2) A surface use plan of operations containing information required 
by paragraph (f) of this section and appropriate orders and notices.

[[Page 395]]

    (3) Evidence of bond coverage as required by the Department of the 
Interior regulations, and
    (4) Such other information as may be required by applicable orders 
and notices.
    (e) Each drilling plan shall contain the information specified in 
applicable notices or orders, including a description of the drilling 
program, the surface and projected completion zone location, pertinent 
geologic data, expected hazards, and proposed mitigation measures to 
address such hazards. A drilling plan may be submitted for a single well 
or for several wells proposed to be drilled to the same zone within a 
field or area of geological and environmental similarity. A drilling 
plan may be modified from time to time as circumstances may warrant, 
with the approval of the authorized officer.
    (f) The surface use plan of operations shall contain information 
specified in applicable orders or notices, including the road and 
drillpad location, details of pad construction, methods for containment 
and disposal of waste material, plans for reclamation of the surface, 
and other pertinent data as the authorized officer may require. A 
surface use plan of operations may be submitted for a single well or for 
several wells proposed to be drilled in an area of environmental 
similarity.
    (g) For Federal lands, upon receipt of the Application for Permit to 
Drill or Notice of Staking, the authorized officer shall post the 
following information for public inspection at least 30 days before 
action to approve the Application for Permit to Drill: the company/
operator name; the well name/number; the well location described to the 
nearest quarter-quarter section (40 acres), or similar land description 
in the case of lands described by metes and bounds, or maps showing the 
affected lands and the location of all tracts to be leased and of all 
leases already issued in the general area; and any substantial 
modifications to the lease terms. Where the inclusion of maps in such 
posting is not practicable, maps of the affected lands shall be made 
available to the public for review. This information also shall be 
provided promptly by the authorized officer to the appropriate office of 
the Federal surface management agency, for lands the surface of which is 
not under Bureau jurisdiction, requesting such agency to post the 
proposed action for public inspection for at least 30 days. The posting 
shall be in the office of the authorized officer and in the appropriate 
surface managing agency if other than the Bureau. The posting of an 
Application for Permit to Drill is for information purposes only and is 
not an appealable decision.
    (h) Upon initiation of the Application for Permit to Drill process, 
the authorized officer shall consult with the appropriate Federal 
surface management agency and with other interested parties as 
appropriate and shall take one of the following actions as soon as 
practical, but in no event later than 5 working days after the 
conclusion of the 30-day notice period for Federal lands, or within 30 
days from receipt of the application for Indian lands:
    (1) Approve the application as submitted or with appropriate 
modifications or conditions;
    (2) Return the application and advise the applicant of the reasons 
for disapproval; or
    (3) Advise the applicant, either in writing or orally with 
subsequent written confirmation, of the reasons why final action will be 
delayed along with the date such final action can be expected.

The surface use plan of operations for National Forest System lands 
shall be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture or his/her 
representative prior to approval of the Application for Permit to Drill 
by the authorized officer. Appeals from the denial of approval of such 
surface use plan of operations shall be submitted to the Secretary of 
Agriculture.
    (i) Approval of the Application for Permit to Drill does not warrant 
or certify that the applicant holds legal or equitable title to the

Sec. 3162.3-2  Subsequent well operations.

    (a) A proposal for further well operations shall be submitted by the 
operator on Form 3160-5 for approval by the authorized officer prior to 
commencing operations to redrill, deepen, perform casing repairs, plug-
back, alter casing, perform nonroutine fracturing jobs, recomplete in a 
different interval, perform water shut off, commingling production 
between intervals and/or conversion to injection. If there is additional 
surface distubance, the proposal shall include a surface use plan of 
operations. A subsequent report on these operations also will be filed 
on Form 3160-5. The authorized officer may prescribe that each proposal 
contain all or a portion of the information set forth in Sec. 3162.3-1 
of this title.
    (b) Unless additional surface disturbance is involved and if the 
operations conform to the standard of prudent operating practice, prior 
approval is not required for routine fracturing or acidizing jobs, or 
recompletion in the same interval; however, a subsequent report on these 
operations must be filed on Form 3160-5.
    (c) No prior approval or a subsequent report is required for well 
cleanout work, routine well maintenance, or bottom hole pressure 
surveys.

Sec. 3162.3-4  Well abandonment.

    (a) The operator shall promptly plug and abandon, in accordance with 
a plan first approved in writing or prescribed by the authorized 
officer, each newly completed or recompleted well in which oil or gas is 
not encountered in paying quantities or which, after being completed as 
a producing well, is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the authorized 
officer to be no longer capable of producing oil or gas in paying 
quantities, unless the authorized officer shall approve the use of the 
well as a service well for injection to recover additional oil or gas or 
for subsurface disposal of produced water. In the case of a newly 
drilled or recompleted well, the approval to abandon may be written or 
oral with written confirmation.
    (b) Completion of a well as plugged and abandoned may also include 
conditioning the well as water supply source for lease operations or for 
use by the surface owner or appropriate Government Agency, when 
authorized by the authorized officer. All costs over and above the 
normal plugging and abandonment expense will be paid by the party 
accepting the water well.
    (c) No well may be temporarily abandoned for more than 30 days 
without the prior approval of the authorized officer. The authorized 
officer may authorize a delay in the permanent abandonment of a well for 
a period of 12 months. When justified by the operator, the authorized 
officer may authorize additional delays, no one of which may exceed an 
additional 12 months. Upon the removal of drilling or producing 
equipment from the site of a well which is to be permanently abandoned, 
the surface of the lands disturbed in connection with the conduct of 
operations shall be reclaimed in accordance with a plan first approved 
or prescribed by the authorized officer.

<R05>
Sec. 3162.5-1  Environmental obligations.

    (a) The operator shall conduct operations in a manner which protects 
the mineral resources, other natural resources, and environmental 
quality. In that respect, the operator shall comply with the pertinent 
orders of the authorized officer and other standards and procedures as 
set forth in the applicable laws, regulations, lease terms and 
conditions, and the approved drilling plan or subsequent operations 
plan. Before approving any Application for Permit to Drill submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 3162.3-1 of this title, or other plan requiring 
environmental review, the authorized officer shall prepare an 
environmental record of review or an environmental assessment, as 
appropriate. These environmental documents will be used in determining 
whether or not an environmental impact statement is required and in 
determining any appropriate terms and conditions of approval of the 
submitted plan.
    (b) The operator shall exercise due care and diligence to assure 
that leasehold operations do not result in undue damage to surface or 
subsurface resources or surface improvements. All produced water must be 
disposed of by injection into the subsurface, by approved pits, or by 
other methods which have been approved by the authorized officer. Upon 
the conclusion of operations, the operator shall reclaim the disturbed 
surface in a manner approved or reasonably prescribed by the authorized 
officer.
    (c) All spills or leakages of oil, gas, produced water, toxic 
liquids, or waste materials, blowouts, fires, personal injuries, and 
fatalities shall be reported by the operator in accordance with these

Sec. 3162.5-2  Control of wells.

    (a) Drilling wells. The operator shall take all necessary 
precautions to keep each well under control at all times, and shall 
utilize and maintain materials and equipment necessary to insure the 
safety of operating conditions and procedures.
    (b) Vertical drilling. The operator shall conduct drilling 
operations in a manner so that the completed well does not deviate 
significantly from the vertical without the prior written approval of 
the authorized officer. Significant deviation means a projected 
deviation of the well bore from the vertical of 10 deg. or more, or a 
projected bottom hole location which could be less than 200 feet from 
the spacing unit or lease boundary. Any well which deviates more than 
10 deg. from the vertical or could result in a bottom hole location less 
than 200 feet from the spacing unit or lease boundary without prior 
written approval must be promptly reported to the authorized officer. In 
these cases, a directional survey is required.
    (c) High pressure or loss of circulation. The operator shall take 
immediate steps and utilize necessary resources to maintain or restore 
control of any well in which the pressure equilibrium has become 
unbalanced.
    (d) Protection of fresh water and other minerals. The operator shall 
isolate freshwater-bearing and other usable water containing 5,000 ppm 
or less of dissolved solids and other mineral-bearing formations and 
protect them from contamination. Tests and surveys of the effectiveness 
of such measures shall be conducted by the operator using procedures and 
practices approved or prescribed by the authorized officer.

Sec. 3162.6  Well and facility identification.

    (a) Every well within a Federal or Indian lease or supervised 
agreement shall have a well indentification sign. All signs shall be 
maintained in a legible condition.
    (b) For wells located on Federal and Indian lands, the operator 
shall properly identify, by a sign in a conspicuous place, each well, 
other than those permanently abandoned. The well sign shall include the 
well number, the name of the operator, the lease serial number, the 
surveyed location (the quarter-quarter section, section, township and 
range or other authorized survey designation acceptable to the 
authorized officer; such as metes and bounds). When approved by the 
authorized officer, individual well signs may display only a unique well 
name and number. When specifically requested by the authorized officer, 
the sign shall include the unit or communitization name or number. The 
authorized officer may also require the sign to include the name of the 
Indian allottee lessor(s) preceding the lease serial number. In all 
cases, individual well signs in place on the effective date of this 
rulemaking which do not have the unit or communitization agreement 
number or do not have quarter-quarter identification will satisfy these 
requirements until such time as the sign is replaced. All new signs 
shall have identification as above, including quarter-quarter section.
    (c) All facilities at which Federal or Indian oil is stored shall be 
clearly identified with a sign that contains the name of the operator, 
the lease serial number or communitization or unit agreement 
identification number, as appropriate, and in public land states, the 
quarter-quarter section, township, and range. On Indian leases, the sign

[[Page 400]]

also shall include the name of the appropriate Tribe and whether the 
lease is tribal or allotted. For situations of 1 tank battery servicing 
1 well in the same location, the requirements of this paragraph and 
paragraph (b) of this section may be met by 1 sign as long as it 
includes the information required by both paragraphs. In addition, each 
storage tank shall be clearly identified by a unique number. All 
identification shall be maintained in legible condition and shall be 
clearly apparent to any person at or approaching the sales or 
transportation point. With regard to the quarter-quarter designation and 
the unique tank number, any such designation established by state law or 
regulation shall satisfy this requirement.
    (d) All abandoned wells shall be marked with a permanent monument 
containing the information in paragraph (b) of this section. The 
requirement for a permanent monument may be waived in writing by the 
authorized officer.

<R05>
Sec. 3162.7-1  Disposition of production.

    (a) The operator shall put into marketable condition, if 
economically feasible, all oil, other hydrocarbons, gas, and sulphur 
produced from the leased land.
    (b) Where oil accumulates in a pit, such oil must either be (1) 
recirculated through the regular treating system and returned to the 
stock tanks for sale, or (2) pumped into a stock tank without treatment 
and measured for sale in the same manner as from any sales tank in 
accordance with applicable orders and notices. In the absence of prior 
approval from the authorized officer, no oil should go to a pit except 
in an emergency. Each such occurrence must be reported to the authorized 
officer and the oil promptly recovered in accordance with applicable 
orders and notices.
    (c)(1) Any person engaged in transporting by motor vehicle any oil 
from any lease site, or allocated to any such lease site, shall carry on 
his/her person, in his/her vehicle, or in his/her immediate control, 
documentation showing at a minimum; the amount, origin, and intended 
first purchaser of the oil.
    (2) Any person engaged in transporting any oil or gas by pipeline 
from any lease site, or allocated to any lease site, shall maintain 
documentation showing, at a minimum, the amount, origin, and intended 
first purchaser of such oil or gas.
    (3) On any lease site, any authorized representative who is properly 
identified may stop and inspect any motor vehicle that he/she has 
probable cause to believe is carrying oil from any such lease site, or 
allocated to such lease site, to determine whether the driver possesses 
proper documentation for the load of oil.
    (4) Any authorized representative who is properly identified and who 
is accompanied by an appropriate law enforcement officer, or an 
appropriate law enforcement officer alone, may stop and inspect any 
motor vehicle which is not on a lease site if he/she has probable cause 
to believe the vehicle is carrying oil from a lease site, or allocated 
to a lease site, to determine whether the driver possesses proper 
documentation for the load of oil.
    (d) The operator shall conduct operations in such a manner as to 
prevent avoidable loss of oil and gas. A operator shall be liable for 
royalty payments on oil or gas lost or wasted from a lease site, or 
allocated to a lease site, when such loss or waste is due to negligence 
on the part of the operator of such lease, or due to the failure of the 
operator to comply with any regulation, order or citation issued 
pursuant to this part.
    (e) When requested by the authorized officer, the operator shall 
furnish storage for royalty oil, on the leasehold or at a mutually 
agreed upon delivery point off the leased land without cost to the 
lessor, for 30 days following the end of the calendar month in which the 
royalty accrued.
    (f) Any records generated under this section shall be maintained for 
6 years from the date they were generated or, if notified by the 
Secretary, or his designee, that such records are involved in an audit 
or investigation, the records shall be maintained until the

[[Page 401]]

recordholder is released by the Secretary from the obligation to 
maintain them.

Sec. 3162.7-2  Measurement of oil.

    All oil production shall be measured on the lease by tank gauging, 
positive displacement metering system, or other methods acceptable to 
the authorized officer, pursuant to methods and procedures prescribed in 
applicable orders and notices. Where production cannot be measured due 
to spillage or leakage, the amount of production shall be determined in 
accordance with the methods and procedures approved or prescribed by the 
authorized officer. Off-lease storage or measurement, or commingling 
with production from other sources prior to measurement, may be approved 
by the authorized officer.

<R05>
Sec. 3162.7-3  Measurement of gas.

    All gas production shall be measured by orifice meters or other 
methods acceptable to the authorized officer on the lease pursuant to 
methods and procedures prescribed in applicable orders and notices. The 
measurement of the volume of all gas produced shall be adjusted by 
computation to the standard pressure and temperature of 14.73 psia and 
60 deg. F unless otherwise prescribed by the authorized officer, 
regardless of the pressure and temperature at which the gas is actually 
measured. Gas lost without measurement by meter shall be estimated in 
accordance with methods prescribed in applicable orders and notices. 
Off-lease measurement or commingling with production from other sources 
prior to measurement may be approved by the authorized officer.

<R05>
Sec. 3162.7-4  Royalty rates on oil; sliding and step-scale leases (public land only).

    Sliding- and step-scale royalties are based on the average daily 
production per well. The authorized officer shall specify which wells on 
a leasehold are commercially productive, including in that category all 
wells, whether produced or not, for which the annual value of 
permissible production would be greater than the estimated reasonable 
annual lifting cost, but only wells that yield a commercial volume of 
production during at least part of the month shall be considered in 
ascertaining the average daily production per well. The average daily 
production per well for a lease is computed on the basis of a 28-, 29-, 
30-, or 31-day month (as the case may be), the number of wells on the 
leasehold counted as producing, and the gross production from the 
leasehold. The authorized officer will determine which commercially 
productive wells shall be considered each month as producing wells for 
the purpose of computing royalty in accordance with the following rules, 
and in the authorized officer's discretion may count as producing any 
commercially productive well shut in for conservation purposes.
    (a) For a previously producing leasehold, count as producing for 
every day of the month each previously producing well that produced 15 
days or more during the month, and disregard wells that produced less 
than 15 days during the month.
    (b) Wells approved by the authorized officer as input wells shall be 
counted as producing wells for the entire month if so used 15 days or 
more during the month and shall be disregarded if so used less than 15 
days during the month.
    (c) When the initial production of a leasehold is made during the 
calendar month, compute royalty on the basis of producing well days.
    (d) When a new well is completed for production on a previously 
producing leasehold and produces for 10 days or more during the calendar 
month in which it is brought in, count such new wells as producing every 
day of the month in arriving at the number of producing well days. Do 
not count any

[[Page 402]]

new well that produces for less than 10 days during the calendar month.
    (e) Consider ``head wells'' that make their best production by 
intermittent pumping or flowing as producing every day of the month, 
provided they are regularly operated in this manner with approval of the 
authorized officer.
    (f) For previously producing leaseholds on which no wells produced 
for 15 days or more, compute royalty on the basis of actual producing 
well days.
    (g) For previously producing leaseholds on which no wells were 
productive during the calendar month but from which oil was shipped, 
compute royalty at the same royalty percentage as that of the last 
preceding calendar month in which production and shipments were normal.
    (h) Rules for special cases not subject to definition, such as those 
arising from averaging the production from two distinct sands or 
horizons when the production of one sand or horizon is relatively 
insignificant compared to that of the other, shall be made by the 
authorized officer as need arises.
    (i)(1) In the following summary of operations on a typical leasehold 
for the month of June, the wells considered for the purpose of computing 
royalty on the entire production of the property for the months are 
indicated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Well No. and record                   Count (marked X)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Produced full time for 30 days.............  X
2. Produced for 26 days; down 4 days for        X
 repairs.
3. Produced for 28 days; down June 5, 12        X
 hours, rods; June 14, 6 hours, engine down;
 June 26, 24 hours, pulling rods and tubing.
4. Produced for 12 days; down June 13 to 30...
5. Produced for 8 hours every day (head well).  X
6. Idle producer (not operated)...............
7. New well, completed June 17; produced for    X
 14 days.
8. New well, completed June 22; produced for 9
 days.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) In this example, there are eight wells on the leasehold, but 
wells No. 4, 6, and 8 are not counted in computing royalties. Wells No. 
1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are counted as producing for 30 days. The average 
production per well per day is determined by dividing the total 
production of the leasehold for the month (including the oil produced by 
wells 4 and 8) by 5 (the number of wells counted as producing), and 
dividing the quotient thus obtained by the number of days in the month.

Sec. 3162.7-5  Site security on Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil and gas leases.

    (a) Definitions.
    Appropriate valves. Those valves in a particular piping system, 
i.e., fill lines, equalizer or overflow lines, sales lines, circulating 
lines, and drain lines that shall be sealed during a given operation.
    Effectively sealed. The placement of a seal in such a manner that 
the position of the sealed valve may not be altered without the seal 
being destroyed.
    Production phase. That period of time or mode of operation during 
which crude oil is delivered directly to or through production vessels 
to the storage facilities and includes all operations at the facility 
other than those defined by the sales phase.
    Sales phase. That period of time or mode of operation during which 
crude oil is removed from the storage facilities for sales, 
transportation or other purposes.
    Seal. A device, uniquely numbered, which completely secures a valve.
    (b) Minimum Standards. Each operator of a Federal or Indian lease 
shall comply with the following minimum standards to assist in providing 
accountability of oil or gas production:
    (1) All lines entering or leaving oil storage tanks shall have 
valves capable of being effectively sealed during the production and 
sales operations unless otherwise modified by other subparagraphs of 
this paragraph, and any equipment needed for effective sealing, 
excluding the seals, shall be located at the site. For a minimum of 6 
years the operator shall maintain a record of seal numbers used and 
shall document on which valves or connections they were used as well as 
when they were installed and removed. The site facility diagram(s) shall 
show which valves will be sealed in which position during both the 
production and sales phases of operation.
    (2) Each Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) system shall employ

[[Page 403]]

meters that have non-resettable totalizers. There shall be no by-pass 
piping around the LACT. All components of the LACT that are used for 
volume or quality determinations of the oil shall be effectively sealed. 
For systems where production may only be removed through the LACT, no 
sales or equalizer valves need be sealed. However, any valves which may 
allow access for removal of oil before measurement through the LACT 
shall be effectively sealed.
    (3) There shall be no by-pass piping around gas meters. Equipment 
which permits changing the orifice plate without bleeding the pressure 
off the gas meter run is not considered a by-pass.
    (4) For oil measured and sold by hand gauging, all appropriate 
valves shall be sealed during the production or sales phase, as 
applicable.
    (5) Circulating lines having valves which may allow access to remove 
oil from storage and sales facilities to any other source except through 
the treating equipment back to storage shall be effectively sealed as 
near the storage tank as possible.
    (6) The operator, with reasonable frequency, shall inspect all 
leases to determine production volumes and that the minimum site 
security standards are being met. The operator shall retain records of 
such inspections and measurements for 6 years from generation. Such 
records and measurements shall be available to any authorized officer or 
authorized representative upon request.
    (7) Any person removing oil from a facility by motor vehicle shall 
possess the identification documentation required by appicable NTL's or 
onshore Orders while the oil is removed and transported.
    (8) Theft or mishandling of oil from a Federal or Indian lease shall 
be reported to the authorized officer as soon as discovered, but not 
later than the next business day. Said report shall include an estimate 
of the volume of oil involved. Operators also are expected to report 
such thefts promptly to local law enforcement agencies and internal 
company security.
    (9) Any operator may request the authorized officer to approve a 
variance from any of the minimum standards prescribed by this section. 
The variance request shall be submitted in writing to the authorized 
officer who may consider such factors as regional oil field facility 
characteristics and fenced, guarded sites. The authorized officer may 
approve a variance if the proposed alternative will ensure measures 
equal to or in excess of the minimum standards provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section wil be put in place to detect or prevent internal and 
external theft, and will result in proper production accountability.
    (c) Site security plans. (1) Site security plans, which include the 
operator's plan for complying with the minimum standards enumerated in 
paragraph (b) of this section for ensuring accountability of oil/
condensate production are required for all facilities and such 
facilities shall be maintained in compliance with the plan. For new 
facilities, notice shall be given that it is subject to a specific 
existing plan, or a notice of a new plan shall be submitted, no later 
than 60 days after completion of construction or first production or 
following the inclusion of a well on committed non-Federal lands into a 
federally supervised unit or communitization agreement, whichever occurs 
first, and on that date the facilities shall be in compliance with the 
plan. At the operator's option, a single plan may include all of the 
operator's leases, unit and communitized areas, within a single BLM 
district, provided the plan clearly identifies each lease, unit, or 
communitized area included within the scope of the plan and the extent 
to which the plan is applicable to each lease, unit, or communitized 
area so identified.
    (2) The operator shall retain the plan but shall notify the 
authorized officer of its completion and which leases, unit and 
communitized areas are involved. Such notification is due at the time 
the plan is completed as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
Such notification shall include the location and normal business hours 
of the office where the plan will be maintained. Upon request, all plans 
shall be made available to the authorized officer.

[[Page 404]]

    (3) The plan shall include the frequency and method of the 
operator's inspection and production volume recordation. The authorized 
officer may, upon examination, require adjustment of the method or 
frequency of inspection.
    (d) Site facility diagrams. (1) Facility diagrams are required for 
all facilities which are used in storing oil/condensate produced from, 
or allocated to, Federal or Indian lands. Facility diagrams shall be 
filed within 60 days after new measurement facilities are installed or 
existing facilities are modified or following the inclusion of the 
facility into a federally supervised unit or communitization agreement.
    (2) No format is prescribed for facility diagrams. They are to be 
prepared on 8\1/2\"  x  11" paper, if possible, and be legible and 
comprehensible to a person with ordinary working knowledge of oil field 
operations and equipment. The diagram need not be drawn to scale.
    (3) A site facility diagram shall accurately reflect the actual 
conditions at the site and shall, commencing with the header if 
applicable, clearly identify the vessels, piping, metering system, and 
pits, if any, which apply to the handling and disposal of oil, gas and 
water. The diagram shall indicate which valves shall be sealed and in 
what position during the production or sales phase. The diagram shall 
clearly identify the lease on which the facility is located and the site 
security plan to which it is subject, along with the location of the 
plan.

         Subpart 3163--Noncompliance, Assessments, and Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 3163.1  Remedies for acts of noncompliance.

    (a) Whenever an operating rights owner or operator fails or refuses 
to comply with the regulations in this part, the terms of any lease or 
permit, or the requirements of any notice or order, the authorized 
officer shall notify the operating rights owner or operator, as 
appropriate, in writing of the violation or default. Such notice shall 
also set forth a reasonable abatement period:
    (1) If the violation or default is not corrected within the time 
allowed, the authorized officer may subject the operating rights owner 
or operator, as appropriate, to an assessment of not more than $500 per 
day for each day nonabatement continues where the violation or default 
is deemed a major violation;
    (2) Where noncompliance involves a minor violation, the authorized 
officer may subject the operating rights owner or operator, as 
appropriate, to an assessment of $250 for failure to abate the violation 
or correct the default within the time allowed;
    (3) When necessary for compliance, or where operations have been 
commenced without approval, or where continued operations could result 
in immediate, substantial, and adverse impacts on public health and 
safety, the environment, production accountability, or royalty income, 
the authorized officer may shut down operations. Immediate shut-in 
action may be taken where operations are initiated and conducted without 
prior approval, or where continued operations could result in immediate, 
substantial, and adverse impacts on public health and safety, the 
environment, production accountability, or royalty income. Shut-in 
actions for other situations may be taken only after due notice, in 
writing, has been given;
    (4) When necessary for compliance, the authorized officer may enter 
upon a lease and perform, or have performed, at the sole risk and 
expense of the operator, operations that the operator fails to perform 
when directed in writing by the authorized officer. Appropriate charges 
shall include the actual cost of performance, plus an additional 25 
percent of such amount to compensate the United States for 
administrative costs. The operator shall be provided with a reasonable 
period of time either to take corrective action or to show why the lease 
should not be entered;
    (5) Continued noncompliance may subject the lease to cancellation 
and forfeiture under the bond. The operator

[[Page 405]]

shall be provided with a reasonable period of time either to take 
corrective action or to show why the lease should not be recommended for 
cancellation;
    (6) Where actual loss or damage has occurred as a result of the 
operator's noncompliance, the actual amount of such loss or damage shall 
be charged to the operator.
    (b) Certain instances of noncompliance are violations of such a 
serious nature as to warrant the imposition of immediate assessments 
upon discovery. Upon discovery the following violations shall result in 
immediate assessments, which may be retroactive, in the following 
specified amounts per violation:
    (1) For failure to install blowout preventer or other equivalent 
well control equipment, as required by the approved drilling plan, $500 
per day for each day that the violation existed, including days the

    (3) For failure to obtain approval of a plan for well abandonment 
prior to commencement of such operations, $500.
    (c) Assessments under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not 
exceed $1,000 per day, per operating rights owner or operator, per 
lease. Assessments under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not 
exceed a total of $500 per operating rights owner or operator, per 
lease, per inspection.
    (d) Continued noncompliance shall subject the operating rights owner 
or operator, as appropriate, to penalties described in Sec. 3163.2 of 
this title.
    (e) On a case-by-case basis, the State Director may compromise or 
reduce assessments under this section. In compromising or reducing the 
amount of the assessment, the State Director shall state in the record 
the reasons for such determination.

written agreement with the Indian surface owner and approved by the 
Superintendent of the Indian agency having jurisdiction.
    (b) Except for the National Forest System lands, the authorized 
officer is responsible for approving and supervising the surface use of 
all drilling, development, and production activities on the leasehold. 
This includes storage tanks and processing facilities, sales facilities, 
all pipelines upstream from such facilities, and other facilities to aid 
production such as water disposal pits and lines, and gas or water 
injection lines.
    (c) On National Forest System lands, the Forest Service shall 
regulate all surface disturbing activities in accordance with Forest 
Service regulations, including providing to the authorized

[[Page 409]]

officer appropriate approvals of such activities.

Sec. 3165.1  Relief from operating and producing requirements.

    (a) Applications for relief from either the operating or the 
producing requirements of a lease, or both, shall be filed with the 
authorized officer, and shall include a full statement of the 
circumstances that render such relief necessary.
    (b) The authorized officer shall act on applications submitted for a 
suspension of operations or production, or both, filed pursuant to 
Sec. 3103.4-4 of this title. The application for suspension shall be 
filed with the authorized officer prior to the expiration date of the 
lease; shall be executed by all operating rights owners or, in the case 
of a Federal unit approved under part 3180 of this title, by the unit 
operator on behalf of the committed tracts or by all operating rights 
owners of such tracts; and shall include a full statement of the 
circumstances that makes such relief necessary.
    (c) If approved, a suspension of operations and production will be 
effective on the first of the month in which the completed application 
was filed or the date specified by the authorized officer. Suspensions 
will terminate when they are no longer justified in the interest of 
conservation, when such action is in the interest of the lessor, or as 
otherwise stated by the authorized officer in the approval letter.

Sec. 3165.2  Conflicts between regulations.

    In the event of any conflict between the regulations in this part 
and the regulations in title 25 CFR concerning oil and gas operations on

<R05>
Sec. 3165.3  Notice, State Director review and hearing on the record.

    (a) Notice. Whenever an operating rights owner or operator, as 
appropriate, fails to comply with any provisions of the lease, the 
regulations in this part, applicable orders or notices, or any other 
appropriate orders of the authorized officer, written notice shall be 
given the appropriate party to remedy any defaults or violations. 
Written orders or a notice of violation, assessment, or proposed penalty 
shall be issued and served by personal service by an authorized officer 
or by certified mail. Service shall be deemed to occur when received or 
7 business days after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier. Any 
person may designate a representative to receive any notice of 
violation, assessment, or proposed penalty on his/her behalf. In the 
case of a major violation, the authorized officer shall make a good 
faith effort to contact such designated representative by telephone to 
be followed by a written notice. Receipt of notice shall be deemed to 
occur at the time of such verbal communication, and the time of

[[Page 410]]

notice and the name of the receiving party shall be confirmed in the 
file. If the good faith effort to contact the designated representative 
is unsuccessful, notice of the major violation may be given to any 
person conducting or supervising operations subject to the regulations 
in this part. In the case of a minor violation, written notice shall be 
provided as described above. A copy of all orders, notices, or 
instructions served on any contractor or field employee or designated 
representative shall also be mailed to the operator. Any notice 
involving a civil penalty shall be mailed to the operating rights owner.
    (b) State Director review. Any adversely affected party that 
contests a notice of violation or assessment or an instruction, order, 
or decision of the authorized officer issued under the regulations in 
this part, may request an administrative review, before the State 
Director, either with or without oral presentation. Such request, 
including all supporting documentation, shall be filed in writing with 
the appropriate State Director within 20 business days of the date such 
notice of violation or assessment or instruction, order, or decision was 
received or considered to have been received and shall be filed with the 
appropriate State Director. Upon request and showing of good cause, an 
extension for submitting supporting data may be granted by the State 
Director. Such review shall include all factors or circumstances 
relevant to the particular case. Any party who is adversely affected by 
the State Director's decision may appeal that decision to the Interior 
Board of Land Appeals as provided in Sec. 3165.4 of this part.
    (c) Review of proposed penalties. Any adversely affected party 
wishing to contest a notice of proposed penalty shall request an 
administrative review before the State Director under the procedures set 
out in paragraph (b) of this section. However, no civil penalty shall be 
assessed under this part until the party charged with the violation has 
been given the opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance 
with section 109(e) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act. 
Therefore, any party adversely affected by the State Director's decision 
on the proposed penalty, may request a hearing on the record before an 
Administrative Law Judge or, in lieu of a hearing, may appeal that 
decision directly to the Interior Board of Land Appeals as provided in 
Sec. 3165.4(b)(2) of this part. If such party elects to request a 
hearing on the record, such request shall be filed in the office of the 
State Director having jurisdiction over the lands covered by the lease 
within 30 days of receipt of the State Director's decision on the notice 
of proposed penalty. Where a hearing on the record is requested, the 
State Director shall refer the complete case file to the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge in 
accordance with part 4 of this title. A decision shall be issued 
following completion of the hearing and shall be served on the parties. 
Any party, including the United States, adversely affected by the 
decision of the Administrative Law Judge may appeal to the Interior 
Board of Land Appeals as provided in Sec. 3163.4 of this title.
    (d) Action on request for State Director review. Action on request 
for administrative review. The State Director shall issue a final 
decision within 10 business days of the receipt of a complete request 
for administrative review or, where oral presentation has been made, 
within 10 business days therefrom. Such decision shall represent the 
final Bureau decision from which further review may be obtained as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section for proposed penalties, and in 
Sec. 3165.4 of this title for all decisions.
    (e) Effect of request for State Director review or for hearing on 
the record. (1) Any request for review by the State Director under this 
section shall not result in a suspension of the requirement for 
compliance with the notice of violation or proposed penalty, or stop the 
daily accumulation of assessments or penalties, unless the State 
Director to whom the request is made so determines.
    (2) Any request for a hearing on the record before an administrative 
law judge under this section shall not result in a suspension of the 
requirement

[[Page 411]]

for compliance with the decision, unless the administrative law judge so 
determines. Any request for hearing on the record shall stop the 
accumulation of additional daily penalties until such time as a final 
decision is rendered, except that within 10 days of receipt of a request 
for a hearing on the record, the State Director may, after review of 
such request, recommend that the Director reinstate the accumulation of 
daily civil penalties until the violation is abated. Within 45 days of 
the filing of the request for a hearing on the record, the Director may 
reinstate the accumulation of civil penalties if he/she determines that 
the public interest requires a reinstatement of the accumulation and 
that the violation is causing or threating immediate, substantial and 
adverse impacts on public health and safety, the environment, production 
accountability, or royalty income. If the Director does not reinstate 
the daily accumulation within 45 days of the filing of the request for a 
hearing on the record, the suspension shall continue.

[52 FR 5394, Feb. 20, 1987; 52 FR 10225, Mar. 31, 1987, as amended at 53 
FR 17365, May 16, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 3165.4  Appeals.

    (a) Appeal of decision of State Director. Any party adversely 
affected by the decision of the State Director after State Director 
review, under Sec. 3165.3(b) of this title, of a notice of violation or 
assessment or of an instruction, order, or decision may appeal that 
decision to the Interior Board of Land Appeals pursuant to the 
regulations set out in part 4 of this title.
    (b) Appeal from decision on a proposed penalty after a hearing on 
the record. (1) Any party adversely affected by the decision of an 
Administrative Law Judge on a proposed penalty after a hearing on the 
record under Sec. 3165.3(c) of this title may appeal that decision to 
the Interior Board of Land Appeals pursuant to the regulations in part 4 
of this title.
    (2) In lieu of a hearing on the record under Sec. 3165.3(c) of this 
title, any party adversely affected by the decision of the State 
Director on a proposed penalty may waive the opportunity for such a 
hearing on the record by appealing directly to the Interior Board of 
Land Appeals under part 4 of this title. However, if the right to a 
hearing on the record is waived, further appeal to the District Court 
under section 109(j) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act 
is precluded.
    (c) Effect of an appeal on an approval/decision by a State Director 
or Administrative Law Judge. All decisions and approvals of a State 
Director or Administrator Law Judge under this part shall remain 
effective pending appeal unless the Interior Board of Land Appeals 
determines otherwise upon consideration of the standards stated in this 
paragraph. The provisions of 43 CFR 4.21(a) shall not apply to any 
decision or approval of a State Director or Administrative Law Judge 
under this part. A petition for a stay of a decision or approval of a 
State Director or Administrative Law Judge shall be filed with the 
Interior Board of Land Appeals, Office of Hearings and Appeals, 
Department of the Interior, and shall show sufficient justification 
based on the following standards:
    (1) The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or 
denied,
    (2) The likelihood of the appellant's success on the merits,
    (3) The likelihood of irreparable harm to the appellant or resources 
if the stay is not granted, and
    (4) Whether the public interest favors granting the stay.

Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish the discretionary authority of 
a State Director or Administrative Law Judge to stay the effectiveness 
of a decision subject to appeal pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section upon a request by an adversely affected party or on the State 
Director's or Administrative Law Judge's own initiative. If a State 
Director or Administrative Law Judge denies such a request, the 
requester can petition for a stay of the denial decision by filing a 
petition with the Interior Board of Land Appeals that addresses the 
standards described above in this paragraph.
    (d) Effect of appeal on compliance requirements. Except as provided 
in paragraph (d) of this section, any appeal filed pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not result in a suspension 
of the requirement for compliance with the order or decision from

[[Page 412]]

which the appeal is taken unless the Interior Board of Land Appeals 
determines that suspension of the requirements of the order or decision 
will not be detrimental to the interests of the lessor or upon 
submission and acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the 
lessor from loss or damage.
    (e) Effect of appeal on assessments and penalties. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an appeal filed pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section shall suspend the accumulation of 
additional daily assessments. However, the pendency of an appeal shall 
not bar the authorized officer from assessing civil penalties under 
Sec. 3163.2 of this title in the event the operator has failed to abate 
the violation which resulted in the assessment. The Board of Land 
Appeals may issue appropriate orders to coordinate the pending appeal 
and the pending civil penalty proceeding.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an 
appeal filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall suspend the 
accumulation of additional daily civil penalties.
    (3) When an appeal is filed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, the State Director may, within 10 days of receipt of the notice 
of appeal, recommend that the Director reinstate the accumulation of 
assessments and daily civil penalties until such time as a final 
decision is rendered or until the violation is abated. The Director may, 
if he/she determines that the public interest requires it, reinstate 
such accumulation(s) upon a finding that the violation is causing or 
threatening immediate substantial and adverse impacts on public health 
and safety, the environment, production accountability, or royalty 
income. If the Director does not act on the recommendation to reinstate 
the accumulation(s) within 45 days of the filing of the notice of 
appeal, the suspension shall continue.
    (f) Judicial review. Any person who is aggrieved by a final order of 
the Secretary under this section may seek review of such order in the 
United States District Court for the judicial district in which the 
alleged violation occurred. Because section 109 of the Federal Oil and 
Gas Royalty Management Act provides for judicial review of civil penalty 
determinations only where a person has requested a hearing on the 
record, a waiver of such hearing precludes further review by the 
district court. Review by the district court shall be on the 
administrative record only and not de novo. Such an action shall be 
barred unless filed within 90 days after issuance of final decision as 
provided in Sec. 4.21 of this title.

       Subpart 3180--Onshore Oil and Gas Unit Agreements: General


<R05>
Sec. 3180.0-1  Purpose.

    The regulations in this part prescribe the procedures to be followed 
and the requirements to be met by the owners of any right, title or 
interest in Federal oil and gas leases (see Sec. 3160.0-5 of this title) 
and their representatives who wish to unite with each other, or jointly 
or separately with others, in collectively adopting and operating under 
a unit plan for the development of any oil or gas pool, field or like 
area, or any part thereof. All unit agreements on Federal leases are 
subject to the regulations contained in part 3160 of this title, Onshore 
Oil and Gas Operations. All unit operations on non-Federal lands 
included within Federal unit plans are subject to the reporting 
requirements of part 3160 of this title.

[48 FR 36587, Aug. 12, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 3180.0-2  Policy.

    Subject to the supervisory authority of the Secretary of the 
Interior, the administration of the regulations in this part shall be 
under the jurisdiction of the authorized officer. In the exercise of 
his/her discretion, the authorized officer shall be subject to the 
direction and supervisory authority of the Director, Bureau of Land 
Management, who may exercise the jurisdiction of the authorized officer.

[48 FR 36587, Aug. 12, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 3180.0-3  Authority.

    The Mineral Leasing Act, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 181, 
189, 226(e) and 226(j)), and Order Number 3087, dated December 3, 1982, 
as amended on February 7, 1983 (48 FR 8983), under which the Secretary 
consolidated and transferred the onshore minerals management functions 
of the Department, except mineral revenue functions and the 
responsibility for leasing of restricted Indian lands, to the Bureau of 
Land Management.

[48 FR 36587, Aug. 12, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 3180.0-5  Definitions.

    The following terms, as used in this part or in any unit agreement 
approved under the regulations in this part, shall have the meanings 
here indicated unless otherwise defined in such unit agreement:
    Federal lease. A lease issued under the Act of February 25, 1920, as 
amended (30 U.S.C. 181, et seq.); the Act of May 21, 1930 (30 U.S.C. 
351-359); the Act of August 7, 1947 (30 U.S.C. 351, et seq.); or the Act 
of November 16, 1981 (Pub. L. 97-98, 95 Stat. 1070).
    Participating area. That part of a unit area which is considered 
reasonably proven to be productive of unitized substances in paying 
quantities or which is necessary for unit operations and to which 
production is allocated in the manner prescribed in the unit agreement.
    Unit area. The area described in an agreement as constituting the 
land logically subject to exploration and/or development under such 
agreement.
    Unitized land. Those lands and formations within a unit area which 
are committed to an approved agreement or plan.
    Unitized substances. Deposits of oil and gas contained in the 
unitized land which are recoverable in paying quantities by operation 
under and pursuant to an agreement.

[[Page 414]]

    Working interest. An interest held in unitized substances or in 
lands containing the same by virtue of a lease, operating agreement, fee 
title, or otherwise, under which, except as otherwise provided in the 
agreement, the owner of such interest is vested with the right to 
explore for, develop, and produce such substances. The rights delegated 
to the unit operator by the unit agreement are not regarded as a working 
interest.

Aug. 12, 1983; 51 FR 34603, Sept. 30, 1986]


<R04>
              Subpart 3181--Application for Unit Agreement


<R05>
Sec. 3181.1  Preliminary consideration of unit agreement.

    The model unit agreement set forth in Sec. 3186.1 of this title, is 
acceptable for use in unproven areas. Unique situations requiring 
special provisions should be clearly identified, since these and other 
special conditions may necessitate a modification of the model unit 
agreement set forth in Sec. 3186.1 of this title. Any proposed special 
provisions or other modifications of the model agreement should be 
submitted for preliminary consideration so that any necessary revision 
may be prescribed prior to execution by the interested parties. Where 
Federal lands constitute less than 10 percent of the total unit area, a 
non-Federal unit agreement may be used. Upon submission of such an 
agreement, the authorized officer will take appropriate action to commit 
the Federal lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3181.2  Designation of unit area; depth of test well.

    An application for designation of an area as logically subject to 
development under a unit agreement and for determination of the depth of 
a test well may be filed by a proponent of such an agreement at the 
proper BLM office. Such application shall be accompanied by a map or 
diagram on a scale of not less than 2 inches to 1 mile, outlining the 
area sought to be designated under this section. The Federal, State, 
Indian and privately owned land should be indicated by distinctive 
symbols or colors. Federal and Indian oil and gas leases and lease 
applications should be identified by lease serial numbers. Geologic 
information, including the results of any geophysical surveys, and any 
other available information showing that unitization is necessary and 
advisable in the public interest should be furnished.All information 
submitted under this section is subject to part 2 of this title, which 
sets forth the rules of the Department of the Interior relating to 
public availability of information contained in Departmental records, as 
provided under this part at Sec. 3100.4 of this chapter. These data will 
be considered by the authorized officer and the applicant will be 
informed of the decision reached. The designation of an area, pursuant 
to an application filed under this section, shall not create an 
exclusive right to submit an agreement for such area, nor preclude the 
inclusion of such area or any party thereof in another unit area.

and amended at 63 FR 52953, Oct. 1, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 3181.3  Parties to unit agreement.

    The owners of any right, title, or interest in the oil and gas 
deposits to be unitized are regarded as proper parties to a proposed 
agreement. All such parties must be invited to join the agreement. If 
any party fails or refuses to join the agreement, the proponent of the 
agreement, at the time it is filed for approval, must submit evidence of 
reasonable effort made to obtain joinder of such party and, when 
requested, the reasons for such nonjoinders. The address of each 
signatory party to the agreement should be inserted below the signature. 
Each signature should be attested by at least one witness if not 
notarized. The signing parties may execute any number of counterparts of 
the agreement with the same force and effect as if all parties signed 
the same document, or may execute a ratification or consent in a 
separate instrument with like force and effect.


<R05>
Sec. 3181.4  Inclusion of non-Federal lands.

    (a) Where State-owned land is to be unitized with Federal lands, 
approval of the agreement by appropriate State

[[Page 415]]

officials must be obtained prior to its submission to the proper BLM 
office for final approval. When authorized by the laws of the State in 
which the unitized land is situated, appropriate provision may be made 
in the agreement, recognizing such laws to the extent that they are 
applicable to non-Federal unitized land.
    (b) When Indian lands are included, modification of the unit 
agreement will be required where appropriate. Approval of an agreement 
containing Indian lands by the Bureau of Indian Affairs must be obtained 
prior to final approval by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 3181.5  Compensatory royalty payment for unleased Federal land.

    The unit agreement submitted by the unit proponent for approval by 
the authorized officer shall provide for payment to the Federal 
Government of a 12\1/2\ percent royalty on production that would be 
attributable to unleased Federal lands in a PA of the unit if said lands 
were leased and committed to the unit agreement. The value of production 
subject to compensatory royalty payment shall be determined pursuant to 
30 CFR part 206, provided that no additional royalty shall be due on any 
production subject to compensatory royalty under this provision.

<R04>
              Subpart 3182--Qualifications of Unit Operator


<R05>
Sec. 3182.1  Qualifications of unit operator.

    A unit operator must qualify as to citizenship in the same manner as 
those holding interests in Federal oil and gas leases under the 
regulations at subpart 3102 of this title. The unit operator may be an 
owner of a working interest in the unit area or such other party as may 
be selected by the owners of working interests. The unit operator shall 
execute an acceptance of the duties and obligations imposed by the 
agreement. No designation of or change in a unit operator will become 
effective until approved by the authorized officer, and no such approval 
will be granted unless the successor unit operator is deemed qualified 
to fulfill the duties and obligations prescribed in the agreement.


<R04>
             Subpart 3183--Filing and Approval of Documents


<R05>
Sec. 3183.1  Where to file papers.

    All papers, instruments, documents, and proposals submitted under

Sec. 3183.2  Designation of area.

    An application for designation of a proposed unit area and 
determination of the required depth of test well(s) shall be filed in 
duplicate. A like number of counterparts should be filed of any geologic 
data and any other information submitted in support of such application.


<R05>
Sec. 3183.3  Executed agreements.

    Where a duly executed agreement is submitted for final approval, a 
minimum of four signed counterparts should be filed. The number of 
counterparts to be filed for supplementing, modifying, or amending an 
existing agreement, including change of unit operator, designation of 
new unit operator, establishment or revision of a participating area, 
and termination shall be prescribed by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 3183.4  Approval of executed agreement.

    (a) A unit agreement shall be approved by the authorized officer 
upon a determination that such agreement is necessary or advisable in 
the public interest and is for the purpose of more properly conserving 
natural resources. Such approval shall be incorporated in a 
Certification-Determination document appended to the agreement (see 
Sec. 3186.1 of this part for an example), and the unit agreement shall 
not be deemed effective until the authorized officer has executed the 
Certification-Determination document. No such agreement shall be 
approved unless the parties signatory to the agreement hold sufficient 
interests in the unit area to

[[Page 416]]

provide reasonably effective control of operations.
    (b) The public interest requirement of an approved unit agreement 
for unproven areas shall be satisfied only if the unit operator 
commences actual drilling operations and thereafter diligently 
prosecutes such operations in accordance with the terms of said 
agreement. If an application is received for voluntary termination of a 
unit agreement for an unproven area during its fixed term or such an 
agreement automatically expires at the end of its fixed term without the 
public interest requirement having been satisfied, the approval of that 
agreement by the authorized officer and lease segregations and 
extensions under Sec. 3107.3-2 of this title shall be invalid, and no 
Federal lease shall be eligible for extensions under Sec. 3107.4 of this 
title.
    (c) Any modification of an approved agreement shall require the 
prior approval of the authorized officer.

applicable).

WITNESSETH:
    WHEREAS, the parties hereto are the owners of working, royalty, or 
other oil and gas interests in the unit area subject to this agreement; 
and
    WHEREAS, the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, 41 Stat. 437, 
as amended, 30 U.S.C. Sec. 181 et seq., authorizes Federal lessees and 
their representatives to unite with each other, or jointly or separately 
with others, in collectively adopting and operating under a unit plan of 
development or operations of any oil and gas pool, field, or like area, 
or any part thereof for the purpose of more properly conserving the 
natural resources thereof whenever determined and certified by the 
Secretary of the Interior to be necessary or advisable in the public 
interest; and
    WHEREAS, the parties hereto hold sufficient interests in the 
__________ Unit Area covering the land hereinafter described to give 
reasonably effective control of operations therein; and
    WHEREAS, it is the purpose of the parties hereto to conserve natural 
resources, prevent waste, and secure other benefits obtainable through 
development and operation of the area subject to this agreement under 
the terms, conditions, and limitations herein set forth;
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the promises 
herein contained, the parties hereto commit to this agreement their 
respective interests in the below-defined unit area, and agree severally 
among themselves as follows:
    1. ENABLING ACT AND REGULATIONS. The Mineral Leasing Act of February 
25, 1920, as amended, supra, and all valid pertinent regulations 
including operating and unit plan regulations, heretofore issued 
thereunder or valid, pertinent, and reasonable regulations hereafter 
issued thereunder are accepted and made a part of this agreement as to 
Federal lands, provided such regulations are not inconsistent with the 
terms of this agreement; and as to non-Federal lands, the oil and gas 
operating regulations in effect as of the effective date hereof 
governing drilling and producing operations, not inconsistent with the 
terms hereof or the laws of the State in which the non-Federal land is 
located, are hereby accepted and made a part of this agreement.
    2. UNIT AREA. The area specified on the map attached hereto marked 
Exhibit A is hereby designated and recognized as constituting the unit 
area, containing ______ acres, more or less.
    Exhibit A shows, in addition to the boundary of the unit area, the 
boundaries and identity of tracts and leases in said area to the extent 
known to the Unit Operator. Exhibit B attached hereto is a schedule 
showing to the extent known to the Unit Operator, the acreage, 
percentage, and kind of ownership of oil and gas interests in all lands 
in the unit area. However, nothing herein or in Exhibits A or B shall be 
construed as a representation by any party hereto as to the ownership of 
any interest other than such interest or interests as are shown in the 
Exhibits as owned by such party. Exhibits A and B shall be revised by 
the Unit Operator whenever changes in the unit area or in the ownership 
interests in the individual tracts render such revision necessary, or 
when requested by the Authorized Officer, hereinafter referred to as AO 
and not less than four copies of the revised Exhibits shall be filed 
with the proper BLM office.

[[Page 418]]

    The above-described unit area shall when practicable be expanded to 
include therein any additional lands or shall be contracted to exclude 
lands whenever such expansion or contraction is deemed to be necessary 
or advisable to conform with the purposes of this agreement. Such 
expansion or contraction shall be effected in the following manner:
    (a) Unit Operator, on its own motion (after preliminary concurrence 
by the AO), or on demand of the AO, shall prepare a notice of proposed 
expansion or contraction describing the contemplated changes in the 
boundaries of the unit area, the reasons therefor, any plans for 
additional drilling, and the proposed effective date of the expansion or 
contraction, preferably the first day of a month subsequent to the date 
of notice.
    (b) Said notice shall be delivered to the proper BLM office, and 
copies thereof mailed to the last known address of each working interest 
owner, lessee and lessor whose interests are affected, advising that 30 
days will be allowed for submission to the Unit Operator of any 
objections.
    (c) Upon expiration of the 30-day period provided in the preceding 
item (b) hereof, Unit Operator shall file with the AO evidence of 
mailing of the notice of expansion or contraction and a copy of any 
objections thereto which have been filed with Unit Operator, together 
with an application in triplicate, for approval of such expansion or 
contraction and with appropriate joinders.
    (d) After due consideration of all pertinent information, the 
expansion or contraction shall, upon approval by the AO, become 
effective as of the date prescribed in the notice thereof or such other 
appropriate date.
    (e) All legal subdivisions of lands (i.e., 40 acres by Government 
survey or its nearest lot or tract equivalent; in instances of irregular 
surveys, unusually large lots or tracts shall be considered in multiples 
of 40 acres or the nearest aliquot equivalent thereof), no parts of 
which are in or entitled to be in a participating area on or before the 
fifth anniversary of the effective date of the first initial 
participating area established under this unit agreement, shall be 
eliminated automatically from this agreement, effective as of said fifth 
anniversary, and such lands shall no longer be a part of the unit area 
and shall no longer be subject to this agreement, unless diligent 
drilling operations are in progress on unitized lands not entitled to 
participation on said fifth anniversary, in which event all such lands 
shall remain subject hereto for so long as such drilling operations are 
continued diligently, with not more than 90-days time elapsing between 
the completion of one such well and the commencement of the next such 
well. All legal subdivisions of lands not entitled to be in a 
participating area within 10 years after the effective date of the first 
initial participating area approved under this agreement shall be 
automatically eliminated from this agreement as of said tenth 
anniversary. The Unit Operator shall, within 90 days after the effective 
date of any elimination hereunder, describe the area so eliminated to 
the satisfaction of the AO and promptly notify all parties in interest. 
All lands reasonably proved productive of unitized substances in paying 
quantities by diligent drilling operations after the aforesaid 5-year 
period shall become participating in the same manner as during said 
first 5-year period. However, when such diligent drilling operations 
cease, all nonparticipating lands not then entitled to be in a 
participating area shall be automatically eliminated effective as the 
91st day thereafter.
    Any expansion of the unit area pursuant to this section which 
embraces lands theretofore eliminated pursuant to this subsection 2(e) 
shall not be considered automatic commitment or recommitment of such 
lands. If conditions warrant extension of the 10-year period specified 
in this subsection, a single extension of not to exceed 2 years may be 
accomplished by consent of the owners of 90 percent of the working 
interest in the current nonparticipating unitized lands and the owners 
of 60 percent of the basic royalty interests (exclusive of the basic 
royalty interests of the United States) in nonparticipating unitized 
lands with approval of the AO, provided such extension application is 
submitted not later

[[Page 419]]

than 60 days prior to the expiration of said 10-year period.
    3. UNITIZED LAND AND UNITIZED SUBSTANCES. All land now or hereafter 
committed to this agreement shall constitute land referred to herein as 
``unitized land'' or ``land subject to this agreement.'' All oil and gas 
in any and all formations of the unitized land are unitized under the 
terms of this agreement and herein are called ``unitized substances.''
    4. UNIT OPERATOR. __________ is hereby designated as Unit Operator 
and by signature hereto as Unit Operator agrees and consents to accept 
the duties and obligations of Unit Operator for the discovery, 
development, and production of unitized substances as herein provided. 
Whenever reference is made herein to the Unit Operator, such reference 
means the Unit Operator acting in that capacity and not as an owner of 
interest in unitized substances, and the term ``working interest owner'' 
when used herein shall include or refer to Unit Operator as the owner of 
a working interest only when such an interest is owned by it.
    5. RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF UNIT OPERATOR. Unit Operator shall have 
the right to resign at any time prior to the establishment of a 
participating area or areas hereunder, but such resignation shall not 
become effective so as to release Unit Operator from the duties and 
obligations of Unit Operator and terminate Unit Operator's rights as 
such for a period of 6 months after notice of intention to resign has 
been served by Unit Operator on all working interest owners and the AO 
and until all wells then drilled hereunder are placed in a satisfactory 
condition for suspension or abandonment, whichever is required by the 
AO, unless a new Unit Operator shall have been selected and approved and 
shall have taken over and assumed the duties and obligations of Unit 
Operator prior to the expiration of said period.
    Unit Operator shall have the right to resign in like manner and 
subject to like limitations as above provided at any time after a 
participating area established hereunder is in existence, but in all 
instances of resignation or removal, until a successor Unit Operator is 
selected and approved as hereinafter provided, the working interest 
owners shall be jointly responsible for performance of the duties of 
Unit Operator, and shall not later than 30 days before such resignation 
or removal becomes effective appoint a common agent to represent them in 
any action to be taken hereunder.
    The resignation of Unit Operator shall not release Unit Operator 
from any liability for any default by it hereunder occurring prior to 
the effective date of its resignation.
    The Unit Operator may, upon default or failure in the performance of 
its duties or obligations hereunder, be subject to removal by the same 
percentage vote of the owners of working interests as herein provided 
for the selection of a new Unit Operator. Such removal shall be 
effective upon notice thereof to the AO.
    The resignation or removal of Unit Operator under this agreement 
shall not terminate its right, title, or interest as the owner of 
working interest or other interest in unitized substances, but upon the 
resignation or removal of Unit Operator becoming effective, such Unit 
Operator shall deliver possession of all wells, equipment, materials, 
and appurtenances used in conducting the unit operations to the new duly 
qualified successor Unit Operator or to the common agent, if no such new 
Unit Operator is selected to be used for the purpose of conducting unit 
operations hereunder. Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing 
removal of any material, equipment, or appurtenances needed for the 
preservation of any wells.
    6. SUCCESSOR UNIT OPERATOR. Whenever the Unit Operator shall tender 
his or its resignation as Unit Operator or shall be removed as 
hereinabove provided, or a change of Unit Operator is negotiated by the 
working interest owners, the owners of the working interests according 
to their respective acreage interests in all unitized land shall, 
pursuant to the Approval of the Parties requirements of the unit 
operating agreement, select a successor Unit Operator. Such selection 
shall not become effective until:
    (a) a Unit Operator so selected shall accept in writing the duties 
and responsibilities of Unit Operator, and

[[Page 420]]

    (b) the selection shall have been approved by the AO.
    If no successor Unit Operator is selected and qualified as herein 
provided, the AO at his election may declare this unit agreement 
terminated.
    7. ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS AND UNIT OPERATING AGREEMENT. If the Unit 
Operator is not the sole owner of working interests, costs and expenses 
incurred by Unit Operator in conducting unit operations hereunder shall 
be paid and apportioned among and borne by the owners of working 
interests, all in accordance with the agreement or agreements entered 
into by and between the Unit Operator and the owners of working 
interests, whether one or more, separately or collectively. Any 
agreement or agreements entered into between the working interest owners 
and the Unit Operator as provided in this section, whether one or more, 
are herein referred to as the ``unit operating agreement.'' Such unit 
operating agreement shall also provide the manner in which the working 
interest owners shall be entitled to receive their respective 
proportionate and allocated share of the benefits accruing hereto in 
conformity with their underlying operating agreements, leases, or other 
independent contracts, and such other rights and obligations as between 
Unit Operator and the working interest owners as may be agreed upon by 
Unit Operator and the working interest owners; however, no such unit 
operating agreement shall be deemed either to modify any of the terms 
and conditions of this unit agreement or to relieve the Unit Operator of 
any right or obligation established under this unit agreement, and in 
case of any inconsistency or conflict between this agreement and the 
unit operating agreement, this agreement shall govern. Two copies of any 
unit operating agreement executed pursuant to this section shall be 
filed in the proper BLM office prior to approval of this unit agreement.
    8. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF UNIT OPERATOR. Except as otherwise 
specifically provided herein, the exclusive right, privilege, and duty 
of exercising any and all rights of the parties hereto which are 
necessary or convenient for prospecting for, producing, storing, 
allocating, and distributing the unitized substances are hereby 
delegated to and shall be exercised by the Unit Operator as herein 
provided. Acceptable evidence of title to said rights shall be deposited 
with Unit Operator and, together with this agreement, shall constitute 
and define the rights, privileges, and obligations of Unit Operator. 
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to transfer title to any 
land or to any lease or operating agreement, it being understood that 
under this agreement the Unit Operator, in its capacity as Unit 
Operator, shall exercise the rights of possession and use vested in the 
parties hereto only for the purposes herein specified.
    9. DRILLING TO DISCOVERY. Within 6 months after the effective date 
hereof, the Unit Operator shall commence to drill an adequate test well 
at a location approved by the AO, unless on such effective date a well 
is being drilled in conformity with the terms hereof, and thereafter 
continue such drilling diligently until the ______ formation has been 
tested or until at a lesser depth unitized substances shall be 
discovered which can be produced in paying quantities (to wit: 
quantities sufficient to repay the costs of drilling, completing, and 
producing operations, with a reasonable profit) or the Unit Operator 
shall at any time establish to the satisfaction of the AO that further 
drilling of said well would be unwarranted or impracticable, provided, 
however, that Unit Operator shall not in any event be required to drill 
said well to a depth in excess of ____ feet. Until the discovery of 
unitized substances capable of being produced in paying quantities, the 
Unit Operator shall continue drilling one well at a time, allowing not 
more than 6 months between the completion of one well and the 
commencement of drilling operations for the next well, until a well 
capable of producing unitized substances in paying quantities is 
completed to the satisfaction of the AO or until it is reasonably proved 
that the unitized land is incapable of producing unitized substances in 
paying quantities in the formations drilled hereunder. Nothing in this 
section shall be deemed to limit the right of the Unit Operator to 
resign as provided in Section 5, hereof, or as

[[Page 421]]

requiring Unit Operator to commence or continue any drilling during the 
period pending such resignation becoming effective in order to comply 
with the requirements of this section.
    The AO may modify any of the drilling requirements of this section 
by granting reasonable extensions of time when, in his opinion, such 
action is warranted.
    \2\ 9a. Multiple well requirements. Notwithstanding anything in this 
unit agreement to the contrary, except Section 25, UNAVOIDABLE DELAY, 
____ wells shall be drilled with not more than 6-months time elapsing 
between the completion of the first well and commencement of drilling 
operations for the second well and with not more than 6-months time 
elapsing between completion of the second well and the commencement of 
drilling operations for the third well, . . . regardless of whether a 
discovery has been made in any well drilled under this provision. Both 
the initial well and the second well must be drilled in compliance with 
the above specified formation or depth requirements in order to meet the 
dictates of this section; and the second well must be located a minimum 
of ____ miles from the initial well in order to be accepted by the AO as 
the second unit test well, within the meaning of this section. The third 
test well shall be diligently drilled, at a location approved by the AO, 
to test the ______ formation or to a depth of ____ feet, whichever is 
the lesser, and must be located a minimum of ____ miles from both the 
initial and the second test wells. Nevertheless, in the event of the 
discovery of unitized substances in paying quantities by any well, this 
unit agreement shall not terminate for failure to complete the ______ 
well program, but the unit area shall be contracted automatically, 
effective the first day of the month following the default, to eliminate 
by subdivisions (as defined in Section 2(e) hereof) all lands not then 
entitled to be in a participating area. \2\

    \2\ Provisions to be included only when a multiple well obligation 
is required.

    Until the establishment of a participating area, the failure to 
commence a well subsequent to the drilling of the initial obligation 
well, or in the case of multiple well requirements, if specified, 
subsequent to the drilling of those multiple wells, as provided for in 
this (these) section(s), within the time allowed including any extension 
of time granted by the AO, shall cause this agreement to terminate 
automatically. Upon failure to continue drilling diligently any well 
other than the obligation well(s) commenced hereunder, the AO may, after 
15 days notice to the Unit Operator, declare this unit agreement 
terminated. Failure to commence drilling the initial obligation well, or 
the first of multiple obligation wells, on time and to drill it 
diligently shall result in the unit agreement approval being declared 
invalid ab initio by the AO. In the case of multiple well requirements, 
failure to commence drilling the required multiple wells beyond the 
first well, and to drill them diligently, may result in the unit 
agreement approval being declared invalid ab initio by the AO;
    10. PLAN OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION. Within 6 months after 
completion of a well capable of producing unitized substances in paying 
quantities, the Unit Operator shall submit for the approval of the AO an 
acceptable plan of development and operation for the unitized land 
which, when approved by the authorized officier, shall constitute the 
further drilling and development obligations of the Unit Operator under 
this agreement for the period specified therein. Thereafter, from time 
to time before the expiration of any existing plan, the Unit Operator 
shall submit for the approval of the AO a plan for an additional 
specified period for the development and operation of the unitized land. 
Subsequent plans should normally be filed on a calender year basis not 
later than March 1 each year. Any proposed modification or addition to 
the existing plan should be filed as a supplement to the plan.
    Any plan submitted pursuant to this section shall provide for the 
timely exploration of the unitized area, and for the diligent drilling 
necessary for determination of the area or areas capable of producing 
unitized substances in paying quantities in each and every productive 
formation. This plan shall

[[Page 422]]

be as complete and adequate as the AO may determine to be necessary for 
timely development and proper conservation of the oil and gas resources 
in the unitized area and shall:
    (a) Specify the number and locations of any wells to be drilled and 
the proposed order and time for such drilling; and
    (b) Provide a summary of operations and production for the previous 
year.
    Plans shall be modified or supplemented when necessary to meet 
changed conditions or to protect the interests of all parties to this 
agreement. Reasonable diligence shall be exercised in complying with the 
obligations of the approved plan of development and operation. The AO is 
authorized to grant a reasonable extension of the 6-month period herein 
prescribed for submission of an initial plan of development and 
operation where such action is justified because of unusual conditions 
or circumstances.
    After completion of a well capable of producing unitized substances 
in paying quantities, no further wells, except such as may be necessary 
to afford protection against operations not under this agreement and 
such as may be specifically approved by the AO, shall be drilled except 
in accordance with an approved plan of development and operation.
    11. PARTICIPATION AFTER DISCOVERY. Upon completion of a well capable 
of producing unitized substances in paying quantities, or as soon 
thereafter as required by the AO, the Unit Operator shall submit for 
approval by the AO, a schedule, based on subdivisions of the public-land 
survey or aliquot parts thereof, of all land then regarded as reasonably 
proved to be productive of unitized substances in paying quantities. 
These lands shall constitute a participating area on approval of the AO, 
effective as of the date of completion of such well or the effective 
date of this unit agreement, whichever is later. The acreages of both 
Federal and non-Federal lands shall be based upon appropriate 
computations from the courses and distances shown on the last approved 
public-land survey as of the effective date of each initial 
participating area. The schedule shall also set forth the percentage of 
unitized substances to be allocated, as provided in Section 12, to each 
committed tract in the participating area so established, and shall 
govern the allocation of production commencing with the effective date 
of the participating area. A different participating area shall be 
established for each separate pool or deposit of unitized substances or 
for any group thereof which is produced as a single pool or zone, and 
any two or more participating areas so established may be combined into 
one, on approval of the AO. When production from two or more 
participating areas is subsequently found to be from a common pool or 
deposit, the participating areas shall be combined into one, effective 
as of such appropriate date as may be approved or prescribed by the AO. 
The participating area or areas so established shall be revised from 
time to time, subject to the approval of the AO, to include additional 
lands then regarded as reasonably proved to be productive of unitized 
substances in paying quantities or which are necessary for unit 
operations, or to exclude lands then regarded as reasonably proved not 
to be productive of unitized substances in paying quantities, and the 
schedule of allocation percentages shall be revised accordingly. The 
effective date of any revision shall be the first of the month in which 
the knowledge or information is obtained on which such revision is 
predicated; provided, however, that a more appropriate effective date 
may be used if justified by Unit Operator and approved by the AO. No 
land shall be excluded from a participating area on account of depletion 
of its unitized substances, except that any participating area 
established under the provisions of this unit agreement shall terminate 
automatically whenever all completions in the formation on which the 
participating area is based are abandoned.
    It is the intent of this section that a participating area shall 
represent the area known or reasonably proved to be productive of 
unitized substances in paying quantities or which are necessary for unit 
operations; but, regardless of any revision of the participating area, 
nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring any retroactive

[[Page 423]]

adjustment for production obtained prior to the effective date of the 
revision of the participating area.
    In the absence of agreement at any time between the Unit Operator 
and the AO as to the proper definition or redefinition of a 
participating area, or until a participating area has, or areas have, 
been established, the portion of all payments affected thereby shall, 
except royalty due the United States, be impounded in a manner mutually 
acceptable to the owners of committed working interests. Royalties due 
the United States shall be determined by the AO and the amount thereof 
shall be deposited, as directed by the AO, until a participating area is 
finally approved and then adjusted in accordance with a determination of 
the sum due as Federal royalty on the basis of such approved 
participating area.
    Whenever it is determined, subject to the approval of the AO, that a 
well drilled under this agreement is not capable of production of 
unitized substances in paying quantities and inclusion in a 
participating area of the land on which it is situated is unwarranted, 
production from such well shall, for the purposes of settlement among 
all parties other than working interest owners, be allocated to the land 
on which the well is located, unless such land is already within the 
participating area established for the pool or deposit from which such 
production is obtained. Settlement for working interest benefits from 
such a nonpaying unit well shall be made as provided in the unit 
operating agreement.
    12. ALLOCATION OF PRODUCTION. All unitized substances produced from 
a participating area established under this agreement, except any part 
thereof used in conformity with good operating practices within the 
unitized area for drilling, operating, and other production or 
development purposes, or for repressuring or recycling in accordance 
with a plan of development and operations that has been approved by the 
AO, or unavoidably lost, shall be deemed to be produced equally on an 
acreage basis from the several tracts of unitized land and unleased 
Federal land, if any, included in the participating area established for 
such production. Each such tract shall have allocated to it such 
percentage of said production as the number of acres of such tract 
included in said participating area bears to the total acres of unitized 
land and unleased Federal land, if any, included in said participating 
area. There shall be allocated to the working interest owner(s) of each 
tract of unitized land in said participating area, in addition, such 
percentage of the production attributable to the unleased Federal land 
within the participating area as the number of acres of such unitized 
tract included in said participating area bears to the total acres of 
unitized land in said participating area, for the payment of the 
compensatory royalty specified in section 17 of this agreement. 
Allocation of production hereunder for purposes other than for 
settlement of the royalty, overriding royalty, or payment out of 
production obligations of the respective working interest owners, 
including compensatory royalty obligations under section 17, shall be 
prescribed as set forth in the unit operating agreement or as otherwise 
mutually agreed by the affected parties. It is hereby agreed that 
production of unitized substances from a participating area shall be 
allocated as provided herein, regardless or whether any wells are 
drilled on any particular part or tract of the participating area. If 
any gas produced from one participating area is used for repressuring or 
recycling purposes in another participating area, the first gas 
withdrawn from the latter participating area for sale during the life of 
this agreement shall be considered to be the gas so transferred, until 
an amount equal to that transferred shall be so produced for sale and 
such gas shall be allocated to the participating area from which 
initially produced as such area was defined at the time that such 
transferred gas was finally produced and sold.
    13. DEVELOPMENT OR OPERATION OF NONPARTICIPATING LAND OR FORMATIONS. 
Any operator may with the approval of the AO, at such party's sole risk, 
costs, and expense, drill a well on the unitized land to test any 
formation provided the well is outside any participating area 
established for that formation, unless within 90 days of receipt of 
notice from said party of

[[Page 424]]

his intention to drill the well, the Unit Operator elects and commences 
to drill the well in a like manner as other wells are drilled by the 
Unit Operator under this agreement.
    If any well drilled under this section by a non-unit operator 
results in production of unitized substances in paying quantities such 
that the land upon which it is situated may properly be included in a 
participating area, such participating area shall be established or 
enlarged as provided in this agreement and the well shall thereafter be 
operated by the Unit Operator in accordance with the terms of this 
agreement and the unit operating agreement.
    If any well drilled under this section by a non-unit operator that 
obtains production in quantities insufficient to justify the inclusion 
of the land upon which such well is situated in a participating area, 
such well may be operated and produced by the party drilling the same, 
subject to the conservation requirements of this agreement. The 
royalties in amount or value of production from any such well shall be 
paid as specified in the underlying lease and agreements affected.
    14. ROYALTY SETTLEMENT. The United States and any State and any 
royalty owner who is entitled to take in kind a share of the substances 
now unitized hereunder shall be hereafter be entitled to the right to 
take in kind its share of the unitized substances, and Unit Operator, or 
the non-unit operator in the case of the operation of a well by a non-
unit operator as herein provided for in special cases, shall make 
deliveries of such royalty share taken in kind in conformity with the 
applicable contracts, laws, and regulations. Settlement for royalty 
interest not taken in kind shall be made by an operator responsible 
therefor under existing contracts, laws and regulations, or by the Unit 
Operator on or before the last day of each month for unitized substances 
produced during the preceding calendar month; provided, however, that 
nothing in this section shall operate to relieve the responsible parties 
of any land from their respective lease obligations for the payment of 
any royalties due under their leases.
    If gas obtained from lands not subject to this agreement is 
introduced into any participating area hereunder, for use in 
repressuring, stimulation of production, or increasing ultimate 
recovery, in conformity with a plan of development and operation 
approved by the AO, a like amount of gas, after settlement as herein 
provided for any gas transferred from any other participating area and 
with appropriate deduction for loss from any cause, may be withdrawn 
from the formation into which the gas is introduced, royalty free as to 
dry gas, but not as to any products which may be extracted therefrom; 
provided that such withdrawal shall be at such time as may be provided 
in the approved plan of development and operation or as may otherwise be 
consented to by the AO as conforming to good petroleum engineering 
practice; and provided further, that such right of withdrawal shall 
terminate on the termination of this unit agreement.
    Royalty due the United States shall be computed as provided in 30 
CFR Group 200 and paid in value or delivered in kind as to all unitized 
substances on the basis of the amounts thereof allocated to unitized 
Federal land as provided in Section 12 at the rates specified in the 
respective Federal leases, or at such other rate or rates as may be 
authorized by law or regulation and approved by the AO; provided, that 
for leases on which the royalty rate depends on the daily average 
production per well, said average production shall be determined in 
accordance with the operating regulations as though each participating 
area were a single consolidated lease.
    15. RENTAL SETTLEMENT. Rental or minimum royalties due on leases 
committed hereto shall be paid by the appropriate parties under existing 
contracts, laws, and regulations, provided that nothing herein contained 
shall operate to relieve the responsible parties of the land from their 
respective obligations for the payment of any rental or minimum royalty 
due under their leases. Rental or minimum royalty for lands of the 
United States subject to this agreement shall be paid at the rate 
specified in the respective leases from the United States unless such 
rental or

[[Page 425]]

minimum royalty is waived, suspended, or reduced by law or by approval 
of the Secretary or his duly authorized representative.
    With respect to any lease on non-Federal land containing provisions 
which would terminate such lease unless drilling operations are 
commenced upon the land covered thereby within the time therein 
specified or rentals are paid for the privilege of deferring such 
drilling operations, the rentals required thereby shall, notwithstanding 
any other provision of this agreement, be deemed to accure and become 
payable during the term thereof as extended by this agreement and until 
the required drilling operations are commenced upon the land covered 
thereby, or until some portion of such land is included within a 
participating area.
    16. CONSERVATION. Operations hereunder and production of unitized 
substances shall be conducted to provide for the most economical and 
efficient recovery of said substances without waste, as defined by or 
pursuant to State or Federal law or regulation.
    17. DRAINAGE. (a) The Unit Operator shall take such measures as the 
AO deems appropriate and adequate to prevent drainage of unitized 
substances from unitized land by wells on land not subject to this 
agreement, which shall include the drilling of protective wells and 
which may include the payment of a fair and reasonable compensatory 
royalty, as determined by the AO.
    (b) Whenever a participating area approved under section 11 of this 
agreement contains unleased Federal lands, the value of 12\1/2\ percent 
of the production that would be allocated to such Federal lands under 
section 12 of this agreement, if such lands were leased, committed, and 
entitled to participation, shall be payable as compensatory royalties to 
the Federal Government. Parties to this agreement holding working 
interests in committed leases within the applicable participating area 
shall be responsible for such compensatory royalty payment on the volume 
of production reallocated from the unleased Federal lands to their 
unitized tracts under section 12. The value of such production subject 
to the payment of said royalties shall be determined pursuant to 30 CFR 
part 206. Payment of compensatory royalties on the production 
reallocated from unleased Federal land to the committed tracts within 
the participating area shall fulfill the Federal royalty obligation for 
such production, and said production shall be subject to no further 
royalty assessment under section 14 of this agreement. Payment of 
compensatory royalties as provided herein shall accrue from the date the 
committed tracts in the participating area that includes unleased 
Federal lands receive a production allocation, and shall be due and 
payable monthly by the last day of the calendar month next following the 
calendar month of actual production. If leased Federal lands receiving a 
production allocation from the participating area become unleased, 
compensatory royalties shall accrue from the date the Federal lands 
become unleased. Payment due under this provision shall end when the 
unleased Federal tract is leased or when production of unitized 
substances ceases within the participating area and the participating 
area is terminated, whichever occurs first.
    18. LEASES AND CONTRACTS CONFORMED AND EXTENDED. The terms, 
conditions, and provisions of all leases, subleases, and other contracts 
relating to exploration, drilling, development or operation for oil or 
gas on lands committed to this agreement are hereby expressly modified 
and amended to the extent necessary to make the same conform to the 
provisions hereof, but otherwise to remain in full force and effect; and 
the parties hereto hereby consent that the Secretary shall and by his 
approval hereof, or by the approval hereof by his duly authorized 
representative, does hereby establish, alter, change, or revoke the 
drilling, producing, rental, minimum royalty, and royalty requirements 
of Federal leases committed hereto and the regulations in respect 
thereto to conform said requirements to the provisions of this 
agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all 
leases, subleases, and contracts are particularly modified in accordance 
with the following:
    (a) The development and operation of lands subject to this agreement 
under the terms hereof shall be deemed full

[[Page 426]]

performance of all obligations for development and operation with 
respect to each and every separately owned tract subject to this 
agreement, regardless of whether there is any development of any 
particular tract of this unit area.
    (b) Drilling and producing operations performed hereunder upon any 
tract of unitized lands will be accepted and deemed to be performed upon 
and for the benefit of each and every tract of unitized land, and no 
lease shall be deemed to expire by reason of failure to drill or produce 
wells situated on the land therein embraced.
    (c) Suspension of drilling or producing operations on all unitized 
lands pursuant to direction or consent of the AO shall be deemed to 
constitute such suspension pursuant to such direction or consent as to 
each and every tract of unitized land. A suspension of drilling or 
producing operations limited to specified lands shall be applicable only 
to such lands.
    (d) Each lease, sublease, or contract relating to the exploration, 
drilling, development, or operation for oil or gas of lands other than 
those of the United States committed to this agreement which, by its 
terms might expire prior to the termination of this agreement, is hereby 
extended beyond any such term so provided therein so that it shall be 
continued in full force and effect for and during the term of this 
agreement.
    (e) Any Federal lease committed hereto shall continue in force 
beyond the term so provided therein or by law as to the land committed 
so long as such lease remains subject hereto, provided that production 
of unitized substances in paying quantities is established under this 
unit agreement prior to the expiration date of the term of such lease, 
or in the event actual drilling operations are commenced on unitized 
land, in accordance with provisions of this agreement, prior to the end 
of the primary term of such lease and are being diligently prosecuted at 
that time, such lease shall be extended for 2 years, and so long 
thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities in accordance 
with the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended.
    (f) Each sublease or contract relating to the operation and 
development of unitized substances from lands of the United States 
committed to this agreement, which by its terms would expire prior to 
the time at which the underlying lease, as extended by the immediately 
preceding paragraph, will expire is hereby extended beyond any such term 
so provided therein so that it shall be continued in full force and 
effect for and during the term of the underlying lease as such term is 
herein extended.
    (g) The segregation of any Federal lease committed to this agreement 
is governed by the following provision in the fourth paragraph of sec. 
17(m) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended by the Act of September 2, 
1960 (74 Stat. 781-784) (30 U.S.C. 226(m)):
    ``Any [Federal] lease heretofore or hereafter committed to any such 
[unit] plan embracing lands that are in part within and in part outside 
of the area covered by any such plan shall be segregated into separate 
leases as to the lands committed and the lands not committed as of the 
effective date of unitization: Provided, however, That any such lease as 
to the nonunitized portion shall continue in force and effect for the 
term thereof but for not less than two years from the date of such 
segregation and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying 
quantities.''


If the public interest requirement is not satisfied, the segregation of 
a lease and/or extension of a lease pursuant to 43 CFR 3107.3-2 and 43 
CFR 3107.4, respectively, shall not be effective.
    \3\ (h) Any lease, other than a Federal lease, having only a portion 
of its lands committed hereto shall be segregated as to the portion 
committed and the portion not committed, and the provisions of such 
lease shall apply separately to such segregated portions commencing as 
of the effective date hereof. In the event any such lease provides for a 
lump-sum rental payment, such payment shall be prorated between the 
portions so segregated in proportion to the acreage of the respective 
tracts.

    \3\ Optional paragraph to be used only when applicable.

    19. CONVENANTS RUN WITH LAND. The covenants herein shall be 
construed to be covenants running with the land with respect to the 
interests of the parties hereto and their successors in interest until 
this agreement terminates, and any grant, transfer or conveyance of 
interest in land or leases subject hereto shall be and hereby is 
conditioned upon the assumption of all privileges and obligations 
hereunder by the grantee, transferee, or other successor in interest. No 
assignment or transfer of any working interest, royalty, or other 
interest subject hereto shall be binding upon Unit Operator until the 
first day of the calendar month after Unit Operator is furnished with 
the original, photostatic, or certified copy of the instrument of 
transfer.
    20. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM. This agreement shall become effective 
upon approval by the AO and shall automatically terminate 5 years from 
said effective date unless:
    (a) Upon application by the Unit Operator such date of expiration is 
extended by the AO, or
    (b) It is reasonably determined prior to the expiration of the fixed 
term or any extension thereof that the unitized land is incapable of 
production of unitized substances in paying quantities in the formations 
tested hereunder, and after notice of intention to terminate this 
agreement on such ground is given by the Unit Operator to all parties in 
interest at their last known addresses, this agreement is terminated 
with the approval of the AO, or
    (c) A valuable discovery of unitized substances in paying quantities 
has been made or accepted on unitized land during said initial term or 
any extension thereof, in which event this agreement shall remain in 
effect for such term and so long thereafter as unitized substances can 
be produced in quantities sufficient to pay for the cost of producing 
same from wells on unitized land within any participating area 
established hereunder. Should production cease and diligent drilling or 
reworking operations to restore production or new production are not in 
progress within 60 days and production is not restored or should new 
production not be obtained in paying quantities on committed lands 
within this unit area, this agreement will automatically terminate 
effective the last day of the month in which the last unitized 
production occurred, or
    (d) It is voluntarily terminated as provided in this agreement. 
Except as noted herein, this agreement may be terminated at any time 
prior to the discovery of unitized substances which can be produced in 
paying quantities by not less than 75 per centum, on an acreage basis, 
of the working interest owners signatory hereto, with the approval of 
the AO. The Unit Operator shall give notice of any such approval to all 
parties herto. If the public interest requirement is not satisfied, the 
approval of this unit by the AO shall be invalid.
    21. RATE OF PROSPECTING, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRODUCTION. The AO is 
hereby vested with authority to alter or modify from time to time, in 
his discretion, the quantity and rate of production under this agreement 
when such quantity and rate are not fixed pursuant to Federal or State 
law, or do not conform to any Statewide voluntary conservation or 
allocation program which is established, recognized, and generally 
adhered to by the majority of operators in such State. The above 
authority is hereby limited to alteration or modifications which are in 
the public interest. The public interest to be served and the purpose 
thereof, must be stated in the order of alteration or modification. 
Without regard to the foregoing, the AO is also hereby vested with 
authority to alter or modify from time to time, in his discretion, the 
rate of prospecting and development and the quantity and rate of 
production under this agreement when such alteration or modification is 
in the interest of attaining the conservation objectives stated in this 
agreement and is not in violation of any applicable Federal or State 
law.
    Powers is the section vested in the AO shall only be exercised after 
notice to Unit Operator and opportunity for hearing to be held not less 
than 15 days from notice.
    22. APPEARANCES. The Unit Operator shall, after notice to other 
parties affected, have the right to appear for and on behalf of any and 
all interests

[[Page 428]]

affected hereby before the Department of the Interior and to appeal from 
orders issued under the regulations of said Department, or to apply for 
relief from any of said regulations, or in any proceedings relative to 
operations before the Department, or any other legally constituted 
authority; provided, however, that any other interested party shall also 
have the right at its own expense to be heard in any such proceeding.
    23. NOTICES. All notices, demands, or statements required hereunder 
to be given or rendered to the parties hereto shall be in writing and 
shall be personally delivered to the party or parties, or sent by 
postpaid registered or certified mail, to the last-known address of the 
party or parties.
    24. NO WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS. Nothing contained in this agreement 
shall be construed as a waiver by any party hereto of the right to 
assert any legal or constitutional right or defense as to the validity 
or invalidity of any law of the State where the unitized lands are 
located, or of the United States, or regulations issued thereunder in 
any way affecting such party, or as a waiver by any such party of any 
right beyond his or its authority to waive.
    25. UNAVOIDABLE DELAY. All obligations under this agreement 
requiring the Unit Operator to commence or continue drilling, or to 
operate on, or produce unitized substances from any of the lands covered 
by this agreement, shall be suspended while the Unit Operator, despite 
the exercise of due care and diligence, is prevented from complying with 
such obligations, in whole or in part, by strikes, acts of God, Federal, 
State, or municipal law or agencies, unavoidable accidents, 
uncontrollable delays in transportation, inability to obtain necessary 
materials or equipment in the open market, or other matters beyond the 
reasonable control of the Unit Operator, whether similar to matters 
herein enumerated or not.
    26. NONDISCRIMINATION. In connection with the performance of work 
under this agreement, the Unit Operator agrees to comply with all the 
provisions of section 202 (1) to (7) inclusive, of Executive Order 11246 
(30 FR 12319), as amended, which are hereby incorporated by reference in 
this agreement.
    27. LOSS OF TITLE. In the event title to any tract of unitized land 
shall fail and the true owner cannot be induced to join in this unit 
agreement, such tract shall be automatically regarded as not committed 
hereto, and there shall be such readjustment of future costs and 
benefits as may be required on account of the loss of such title. In the 
event of a dispute as to title to any royalty, working interest, or 
other interests subject thereto, payment or delivery on account thereof 
may be withheld without liability for interest until the dispute is 
finally settled; provided, that, as to Federal lands or leases, no 
payments of funds due the United States shall be withheld, but such 
funds shall be deposited as directed by the AO, to be held as unearned 
money pending final settlement of the title dispute, and then applied as 
earned or returned in accordance with such final settlement.
    Unit Operator as such is relieved from any responsibility for any 
defect or failure of any title hereunder.
    28. NONJOINDER AND SUBSEQUENT JOINDER. If the owner of any 
substantial interest in a tract within the unit area fails or refuses to 
subscribe or consent to this agreement, the owner of the working 
interest in that tract may withdraw the tract from this agreement by 
written notice delivered to the proper BLM office and the Unit Operator 
prior to the approval of this agreement by the AO. Any oil or gas 
interests in lands within the unit area not committed hereto prior to 
final approval may thereafter be committed hereto by the owner or owners 
thereof subscribing or consenting to this agreement, and, if the 
interest is a working interest, by the owner of such interest also 
subscribing to the unit operating agreement. After operations are 
commenced hereunder, the right of subsequent joinder, as provided in 
this section, by a working interest owner is subject to such 
requirements or approval(s), if any, pertaining to such joinder, as may 
be provided for in the unit operating agreement. After final

[[Page 429]]

approval hereof, joinder by a nonworking interest owner must be 
consented to in writing by the working interest owner committed hereto 
and responsible for the payment of any benefits that may accrue 
hereunder in behalf of such nonworking interest. A nonworking interest 
may not be committed to this unit agreement unless the corresponding 
working interest is committed hereto. Joinder to the unit agreement by a 
working interest owner, at any time, must be accompanied by appropriate 
joinder to the unit operating agreement, in order for the interest to be 
regarded as committed to this agreement. Except as may otherwise herein 
be provided, subsequent joinders to this agreement shall be effective as 
of the date of the filing with the AO of duly executed counterparts of 
all or any papers necessary to establish effective commitment of any 
interest and/or tract to this agreement.
    29. COUNTERPARTS. This agreement may be executed in any number of 
counterparts, no one of which needs to be executed by all parties, or 
may be ratified or consented to by separate instrument in writing 
specifically referring hereto and shall be binding upon all those 
parties who have executed such a counterpart, ratification, or consent 
hereto with the same force and effect as if all such parties had signed 
the same document, and regardless of whether or not it is executed by 
all other parties owning or claiming an interest in the lands within the 
above-described unit area.
    \4\ 30. SURRENDER. Nothing in this agreement shall prohibit the 
exercise by any working interest owner of the right to surrender vested 
in such party by any lease, sublease, or operating agreement as to all 
or any part of the lands covered thereby, provided that each party who 
will or might acquire such working interest by such surrender or by 
forfeiture as hereafter set forth, is bound by the terms of this 
agreement.

    \4\ Optional sections and subsection. (Agreements submitted for 
final approval should not identify section or provision as 
``optional.'')

    If as a result of any such surrender, the working interest rights as 
to such lands become vested in any party other than the fee owner of the 
unitized substances, said party may forfeit such rights and further 
benefits from operations hereunder as to said land to the party next in 
the chain of title who shall be and become the owner of such working 
interest.
    If as the result of any such surrender or forfeiture working 
interest rights become vested in the fee owner of the unitized 
substances, such owner may:
    (a) Accept those working interest rights subject to this agreement 
and the unit operating agreement; or
    (b) Lease the portion of such land as is included in a participating 
area established hereunder subject to this agreement and the unit 
operating agreement; or
    (c) Provide for the independent operation of any part of such land 
that is not then included within a participating area established 
hereunder.
    If the fee owner of the unitized substances does not accept the 
working interest rights subject to this agreement and the unit operating 
agreement or lease such lands as above provided within 6 months after 
the surrendered or forfeited, working interest rights become vested in 
the fee owner; the benefits and obligations of operations accruing to 
such lands under this agreement and the unit operating agreement shall 
be shared by the remaining owners of unitized working interests in 
accordance with their respective working interest ownerships, and such 
owners of working interests shall compensate the fee owner of unitized 
substances in such lands by paying sums equal to the rentals, minimum 
royalties, and royalties applicable to such lands under the lease in 
effect when the lands were unitized.
    An appropriate accounting and settlement shall be made for all 
benefits accruing to or payments and expenditures made or incurred on 
behalf of such surrendered or forfeited working interests subsequent to 
the date of surrender or forfeiture, and payment of any moneys found to 
be owing by such an accounting shall be made as between the parties 
within 30 days.

[[Page 430]]

    The exercise of any right vested in a working interest owner to 
reassign such working interest to the party from whom obtained shall be 
subject to the same conditions as set forth in this section in regard to 
the exercise of a right to surrender.
    \4\ 31. TAXES. The working interest owners shall render and pay for 
their account and the account of the royalty owners all valid taxes on 
or measured by the unitized substances in and under or that may be 
produced, gathered and sold from the land covered by this agreement 
after its effective date, or upon the proceeds derived therefrom. The 
working interest owners on each tract shall and may charge the proper 
proportion of said taxes to royalty owners having interests in said-
tract, and may currently retain and deduct a sufficient amount of the 
unitized substances or derivative products, or net proceeds thereof, 
from the allocated share of each royalty owner to secure reimbursement 
for the taxes so paid. No such taxes shall be charged to the United 
States or the State of ____ or to any lessor who has a contract with his 
lessee which requires the lessee to pay such taxes.
    \4\ 32. NO PARTNERSHIP. It is expressly agreed that the relation of 
the parties hereto is that of independent contractors and nothing 
contained in this agreement, expressed or implied, nor any operations 
conducted hereunder, shall create or be deemed to have created a 
partnership or association between the parties hereto or any of them.
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this agreement to 
be executed and have set opposite their respective names the date of 
execution.

    The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures 
governing the sale of helium to Federal agencies with major helium 
requirements. In order to

[[Page 444]]

sell a major helium requirement to a Federal agency, a Federal helium 
supplier must be under contract with BLM to purchase from BLM an amount 
of crude helium equivalent to the amount of refined helium it has 
supplied to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 3195.11  What terms do I need to know to understand this subpart?

    To understand this subpart you need to know that:
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management, Helium Operations, United 
States Department of the Interior, Amarillo, TX 79101.
    Buyer means anyone who is purchasing refined helium for a Federal 
agency or Federal agency contractor.
    Crude helium means a helium-gas mixture containing no more than 
ninety-nine (99) percent helium by volume.
    Federal agency means any department, independent establishment, 
commission, administration, foundation, authority, board, or bureau of 
the United States, or any corporation owned, controlled, or in which the 
United States has a proprietary interest, as these terms are used in 5 
U.S.C. 101-105; 5 U.S.C. 551(1); or in 18 U.S.C. 6, but does not include 
Federal agency contractors.
    Federal helium supplier means a private helium merchant who has an 
In-Kind Crude Helium Sales Contract with an effective date of January 1, 
1998, or later, with BLM, and who has helium available for sale to:
    (1) Federal agencies; or
    (2) Private helium purchasers for use in Federal Government 
contracts.
    Helium means the element helium regardless of its physical state.
    Helium use location means the location where the major helium 
requirement will be used.
    Like (equivalent) amount of crude helium means the amount of crude 
helium measured at a pressure of 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute 
(psia) and a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (F), and rounded up to 
the nearest thousand (1,000) cubic feet, that is equivalent to a 
specified amount of refined helium measured at 14.7 psia and 70 degrees 
Fahrenheit.
    Major helium requirement means an estimated refined helium 
requirement greater than 200,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of gaseous 
helium or 7510 liters of liquid helium delivered to a helium use 
location per year.
    Standard cubic foot (SCF) means the volume of gaseous helium 
occupying one cubic foot at a pressure of 14.7 psia and a temperature of 
70 degrees Fahrenheit. One liter of liquid helium is equivalent to 26.63 
scf of gaseous helium. One U.S. gallon of liquid helium is equivalent to 
100.8 scf of gaseous helium. One pound of liquid helium is equivalent to 
96.72 scf of gaseous helium. If BLM approves, you may use appropriate 
gaseous equivalents of volumes of helium mixtures different from these 
figures.


<R05>
Sec. 3195.12  What is an In-Kind Crude Helium Sales Contract?

    It is a written contract between BLM and a Federal helium supplier 
requiring that whenever a supplier sells a major helium requirement to a 
Federal agency or its contractors, the supplier must purchase a like 
amount of crude helium from BLM.


<R05>
Sec. 3195.13  If I am a Federal helium supplier or buyer, what reports must I submit to BLM?

<R05>
Sec. 3202.12  Are other persons allowed to act on my behalf to file an offer to lease?

    Another person may act on your behalf to file an offer to lease. The 
person acting for you must be qualified to hold a lease under 43 CFR 
3202.10, and must do the following:
    (a) Sign the document;
    (b) State his or her title;
    (c) Identify you as the person he or she is acting for; and
    (d) Provide written proof of his or her qualifications and authority 
to take such action, if BLM requests it.


<R05>
Sec. 3202.13  What happens if the offeror dies before the lease is issued?

    If the offeror dies before the lease is issued, BLM will issue the 
lease to either the administrator or executor of the estate or the 
heirs. If the heirs are minors, BLM will issue the lease to either a 
legal guardian or trustee, provided that the legal guardian or trustee 
is qualified to hold a lease under 43 CFR 3202.10.


<R04>
                     Subpart 3203--Obtaining a Lease


<R05>
Sec. 3203.10  How can I obtain a geothermal lease?

    (a) If the lands are located in a known geothermal resource area 
(KGRA), BLM leases those lands through a competitive sale. To obtain a 
lease, follow the procedures for submitting a bid set out in subpart 
3205 of this part. BLM will issue a competitive lease to the person who 
submits the highest qualified bid.
    (b) If the lands are located outside a KGRA, you may obtain a 
noncompetitive lease. Follow the procedures in subpart 3204 of this 
part. BLM issues noncompetitive leases to the first qualified offeror. 
BLM may issue a lease for a fractional interest if it serves the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 3203.11  How is a KGRA determined?

    BLM determines the boundaries of a KGRA based on:
    (a) Geologic and technical evidence. BLM will designate a KGRA if 
this evidence would cause a person who understands geothermal resource 
development to spend money developing the area;
    (b) Proximity to wells capable of production in commercial 
quantities. BLM will designate a KGRA if the lands are:
    (1) Within 5 miles of a well which is capable of producing steam in 
commercial quantities, or

[[Page 457]]

    (2) In the same geologic structure as a well capable of producing 
steam in commercial quantities; and
    (c) Existence of competitive interest. A competitive interest exists 
where two or more people apply to lease some or all of the same lands 
for geothermal resources. BLM will not designate a KGRA based on 
competitive interest alone; we will also review the other factors 
discussed in this section to decide whether a KGRA designation is 
warranted.


<R04>
                  Subpart 3204--Noncompetitive Leasing


<R05>
Sec. 3204.10  How do I file a lease offer?

    Submit two (2) executed copies of Form 3200-24 to BLM. At least one 
form must have an original signature. We will accept only exact copies 
of the form on one two-sided page. You must accurately describe the 
lands covered by your offer on the form or BLM may reject of all or part 
of your offer. To obtain this form (and other BLM forms), contact the 
nearest BLM Office.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.11  How do I describe the lands in my lease offer?

    Describe the lands as follows:
    (a) For lands surveyed under the public land rectangular survey 
system, describe the lands by legal subdivision, section, township, and 
range;
    (b) For unsurveyed lands, describe the lands by metes and bounds, 
giving courses and distances, and tie this information to an official 
corner of the public land surveys, or to a prominent topographic 
feature;
    (c) For approved protracted surveys, include an entire section, 
township, and range. Do not divide protracted sections into aliquot 
parts;
    (d) For unsurveyed lands in Louisiana and Alaska that have water 
boundaries, discuss the description with BLM before submission; and
    (e) For fractional interest lands, identify the United States 
mineral ownership by percentage.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.12  What fees must I pay with my lease offer?

    Submit a non-refundable filing fee of $75 for each lease offer, and 
an advance rent in the amount of $1 per acre (or fraction of an acre). 
BLM will refund the advance rent if we reject the lease offer, or if you 
withdraw the lease offer before BLM accepts it. If the advance rental 
payment you send is more than 10 percent below the correct amount, BLM 
will reject the lease offer.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.13  May I combine acquired and public domain lands on the same lease offer?

    Yes, you may combine acquired and public domain lands on the same 
lease offer if you clearly identify both the acquired lands and the 
public domain lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.14  What is the largest and smallest lease I can apply for?

    Lease offers must cover all lands available for leasing in a 
section. The smallest lease you can apply for is 640 acres, or all lands 
available for leasing in the section, whichever is less. You may not 
apply for a lease which is larger than 2,560 acres, although BLM will 
make an exception to this requirement when your lease offer includes an 
irregular subdivision. Leases must not extend outside a 6 square mile 
area. If your offer does not meet these requirements, we will reject it.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.15  What happens when two or more offerors apply for a noncompetitive lease for the same land?

    BLM begins processing offers as soon as we receive them. If more 
than one person makes a lease offer for the same lands, BLM will give 
priority to the qualified offer which we received first. Once BLM 
approves a noncompetitive lease offer, we will reject any later offers 
received for the same land. However, if BLM receives additional offers 
for the same land while the original offer is still pending, BLM must 
determine if the overlapping offers warrant converting the land at issue 
to a KGRA:
    (a) If BLM determines that the land should be considered a KGRA, 
then we reject all noncompetitive offers, and offerors must follow the 
competitive bidding procedures to lease the lands.
    (b) If BLM determines that KGRA status is not warranted despite the

[[Page 458]]

multiple offers, then we will award the lease to the first qualified 
offeror.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.16  How does BLM determine the first qualified offeror?

    BLM determines the first qualified offeror based on when we received 
the offer and whether the offeror is qualified to hold a lease. We will 
issue a noncompetitive lease to the offeror who is first to file a lease 
offer that meets all the requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.17  May I withdraw my lease offer?

    You may withdraw your lease offer in whole or in part before we 
issue you a lease. If you withdraw only part of your offer, the lands 
remaining must meet the acreage requirements of 43 CFR 3204.14. If a 
partial withdrawal causes your lease offer to contain less than the 
minimum acreage required under 43 CFR 3204.14, we will reject the lease 
offer.


<R05>
Sec. 3204.18  May I amend my lease offer?

    You may amend your lease offer before we issue the lease, provided 
your amended lease offer meets all the lease offer requirements in this 
subpart. BLM will determine your priority based on the date we receive 
your amended lease offer, not the date of the original lease offer.


<R04>
                    Subpart 3205--Competitive Leasing


<R05>
Sec. 3205.10  How does BLM lease lands competitively?

    (a) We lease some Federal lands through competitive sales using 
sealed bids. Those lands which we lease competitively include lands from 
terminated, expired, or relinquished leases, and lands within a KGRA 
(see 43 CFR 3203.11). BLM may also use a competitive lease sale if there 
is public interest.
    (b) BLM lists these parcels, with any stipulations, in a sale 
notice. This sale notice will tell you where and when to submit your 
bids. We will post the sale notice in appropriate BLM offices, and may 
take other measures such as:
    (1) Publishing news releases;
    (2) Notifying interested parties of the lease sale;
    (3) Publishing the notice in newspapers; or
    (4) Posting the list on the Internet.


<R05>
Sec. 3205.11  How do I get information about competitive lease terms and conditions?

    See our notice posted in the BLM office conducting the sale, and 
otherwise publicized as described in 43 CFR 3205.10. This notice will 
include the terms and conditions of the lease(s), including the rental 
and royalty rates, and will also tell you where you may obtain a form on 
which to submit your bid.


<R05>
Sec. 3205.12  How do I bid for a parcel?

    (a) Submit your bid during the time period and to the BLM office 
specified in the sale notice;
    (b) Submit your bid on Form 3000-2 (or exact copy on one two-sided 
page);
    (c) Submit your bid in a separate, sealed envelope for each full 
parcel;
    (d) Include in each bid a certified or cashier's check, bank draft, 
or money order equal to one-fifth of the bid amount, payable to the 
``Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management;''
    (e) Label each envelope with the parcel number and the statement 
``Not to be opened before (date posted in the sale notice);'' and
    (f) Be aware that unlawful combination or intimidation of bidders is 
prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 1860.


<R05>
Sec. 3205.13  What is the minimum acceptable bid?

    BLM will not accept bids which do not meet or exceed the fair market 
value, which BLM determines using generally acceptable appraisal 
methods. BLM determines the fair market value prior to the sale, but 
does not disclose it to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 3205.14  How does BLM conduct the sale?

    We will open, announce and record bids on the date, and at the place 
and time set out in the sale notice. We will not accept or reject any 
bid at that time. You do not need to attend the sale in order to bid.

[[Page 459]]


<R05>
Sec. 3205.15  To whom does BLM issue the lease?

    We will issue the lease to the highest bidder who qualifies for a 
lease. All other bids are rejected. If we determine that the highest bid 
is too low, we will also reject that bid. BLM reserves the right to 
reject any and all bids.


<R05>
Sec. 3205.16  How will I know whether my bid is accepted?

    (a) If BLM accepts your bid, we will send you a notice informing you 
of our decision within 30 days after the sale. We will also include 3 
copies of the lease. When you receive the notice and lease forms, you 
have 15 days in which to send BLM:
    (1) Signed lease forms;
    (2) The remaining four-fifths of the bonus bid;
    (3) The first year's advance rent; and
    (4) Signed stipulations, if applicable.
    (b) If you do not meet the requirements of this section after we 
have accepted your bid, BLM will then revoke acceptance of your bid and 
keep one-fifth of your bonus bid.
    (c) If BLM rejects your bid, we will send you a notice informing you 
of our decision. At that time, we will return the one-fifth of the bonus 
bid that you sent with your bid offer.


<R04>
                      Subpart 3206--Lease Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 3206.10  What must I do for BLM to issue my lease?

    Before BLM issues you a lease, you must:
    (a) Accept all lease stipulations;
    (b) Sign a unit joinder or waiver, if applicable; and,
    (c) Not exceed the maximum limit on acreage holdings (see 43 CFR 
3206.12).


<R05>
Sec. 3206.11  What must BLM do before issuing my lease?

    BLM must:
    (a) Determine that the land is available; and
    (b) Determine that your lease development will not significantly 
impact any significant thermal feature within any of the following units 
of the National Park System:
    (1) Mount Rainier National Park;
    (2) Crater Lake National Park;
    (3) Yellowstone National Park;
    (4) John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway;
    (5) Bering Land Bridge National Preserve;
    (6) Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve;
    (7) Katmai National Park;
    (8) Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve;
    (9) Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve;
    (10) Lake Clark National Park and Preserve;
    (11) Hot Springs National Park;
    (12) Big Bend National Park (including that portion of the Rio 
Grande National Wild Scenic River within the boundaries of Big Bend 
National Park);
    (13) Lassen Volcanic National Park;
    (14) Hawaii Volcanoes National Park;
    (15) Haleakala National Park;
    (16) Lake Mead National Recreation Area; and
    (17) Any other significant thermal features within National Park 
System Units which the Secretary may add to the list of these features, 
in accordance with 30 U.S.C. 1026(a)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 3206.12  What is the maximum acreage I may hold?

    You may not directly or indirectly hold more than 51,200 acres in 
any one state. This includes any leases you acquire under sections 4(a)-
4(f) of the Act. You also may not convert mineral leases, permits, 
applications for permits, or mining claims acquired under the Act into 
geothermal leases totaling more than 10,240 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 3206.13  How does BLM compute acreage holdings?

    BLM will compute acreage holdings as follows:
    (a) If you own an undivided lease interest, your acreage holdings 
will include the total lease acreage.
    (b) If you own stock in a corporation or a beneficial interest in an 
association which holds a geothermal lease, your acreage holdings will 
include your proportionate part of the corporation's or association's 
share of the total lease acreage. This paragraph applies only if you own 
more than 10 percent of the corporate stock or beneficial interest of 
the association.

[[Page 460]]

    (c) If you own a lease interest, you will be charged with the 
proportionate share of the total lease acreage based on your share of 
the lease ownership. You will not be charged twice for the same acreage 
where you own both record title and operating rights for the lease. For 
example, if you own 50% record title interest in a 640 acre lease and 
25% operating rights, you are charged with 320 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 3206.14  How will BLM charge acreage holdings if the United States owns only a fractional interest in the geothermal resources?

    Where the United States owns only a fractional interest in the 
geothermal resources of the lands, BLM will only charge you with the 
part owned by the United States as acreage holdings. For example, if you 
own 100 percent of record title in a 100 acre lease, and the United 
States owns 50 percent of the mineral estate, you are charged with 50 
acres.


<R05>
Sec. 3206.15  Is there any acreage which is not chargeable?

    BLM does not count leased acreage included in any approved unit or 
cooperative agreement or development contract as part of your total 
acreage holdings.


<R05>
Sec. 3206.16  What will BLM do if my holdings exceed the maximum acreage limits?

    BLM will notify you in writing if your acreage holdings exceed the 
limit in 43 CFR 3206.12. You have 90 days from the date you receive the 
notice to reduce your holdings to within the limit. If you do not 
comply, BLM will cancel your leases, beginning with the lease most 
recently issued, until your holdings are within the limit.


<R05>
Sec. 3206.17  What is the primary term of my lease?

    Leases have a primary term of 10 years.


<R05>
Sec. 3206.18  When will BLM issue my lease?

    BLM issues your lease the day we sign it. Your lease goes into 
effect the first day of the next month after the issue date.


<R04>
                   Subpart 3207--Additional Lease Term


<R05>
Sec. 3207.10  When may I get an additional lease term beyond the primary term?

    (a) If you produce or use geothermal resources in commercial 
quantities during the primary term, your lease will continue in 
additional term for as long as you produce or use geothermal resources 
in commercial quantities for up to forty years beyond the primary term. 
Section 3207.11 explains how to continue your lease beyond the 
additional term.
    (b) If, before the primary or extended term ends, you have a well 
capable of producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities, BLM 
may continue your lease for up to forty years beyond the primary term. 
To continue your lease in an additional term, we must determine that you 
are diligently trying to begin production. We may ask you to describe in 
writing your efforts to begin production during the lease term, and the 
efforts you plan for future lease years. You should also describe 
negotiations for sales contracts, marketing arrangements, and electrical 
generating and transmission agreements, and any other information you 
believe shows diligent efforts.


<R05>
Sec. 3207.11  May I renew my lease at the end of its additional term?

    If BLM does not need the lands for another purpose at the end of the 
forty-year additional term, and if you are producing geothermal 
resources in commercial quantities, you will have a preferential right 
to renew the lease for an additional 40-year period under terms and 
conditions BLM determines. If your lease is located on lands 
administered by the Department of Agriculture, they must concur with the 
use of the surface and any terms and conditions before we may grant your 
renewal. If another Federal agency manages the surface, we will consult 
with them before granting your renewal.

[[Page 461]]


<R04>
             Subpart 3208--Extending the Primary Lease Term


<R05>
Sec. 3208.10  When may I extend my lease beyond the primary term?

    (a) You have four opportunities to extend your lease beyond the 
primary term: by drilling, diligent efforts, production of byproducts, 
and unit commitment.
    (1) For a drilling extension, we will extend your lease for five 
years if you:
    (i) Are drilling when the primary term ends; and
    (ii) Diligently drill to a reasonable target, based on the local 
geology and type of development you propose. BLM will determine if your 
target is adequate to extend the lease.
    (2) For a diligent efforts extension, if you have not produced 
geothermal resources in commercial quantities before the primary or 
extended term ends, or before your lease is eliminated from a unit 
agreement, BLM may still approve up to two successive five-year 
extensions for your lease. You must have made a good faith effort to 
produce. To obtain a diligent efforts extension, follow the procedures 
at 43 CFR 3208.11(a)(2).
    (3) For a byproducts extension, if your lease is in an additional 
term, and we determine that it can no longer produce commercial 
quantities, we may still extend your lease for five years. However, we 
will only do so if you are producing one or more valuable byproducts in 
commercial quantities. You should consult 43 CFR 3209.10 if you wish to 
convert your geothermal lease to a mineral lease for the byproduct.
    (4) For a unit commitment extension, if your lease is committed to a 
unit agreement and its term would expire before the unit term would, BLM 
may extend your lease to match the term of the unit. We will do this if 
you have diligently pursued unit development while your lease is 
committed to the unit.
    (b) During any extension period, if you use or produce geothermal 
resources in commercial quantities, or if you complete a well capable of 
producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities on the lease, 
BLM will place the lease into an additional term.


<R05>
Sec. 3208.11  What must I do to have my lease extended?

    (a) You must take the following steps:
    (1) For a drilling extension, notify BLM prior to the end of the 
primary term of your drilling activities so we may determine that you 
are diligently drilling beyond the end of the primary term and have met 
your well completion requirements.
    (2) For a diligent efforts extension:
    (i) Send BLM a written extension request at least 60 days before the 
primary or first extended term ends, or 60 days before your lease is 
eliminated from a unit agreement;
    (ii) Include a report showing that you have made a good faith effort 
to produce or use geothermal resources in commercial quantities given 
the current economic conditions for marketing geothermal resources; and
    (iii) Say whether you choose to pay instead of produce in commercial 
quantities under 43 CFR 3208.13 or to make significant expenditures 
under 43 CFR 3208.14 during the period of extension.
    (3) For a byproducts extension, send us a request justifying an 
extension.
    (4) For a unit commitment extension, send us a request at least 60 
days before your lease ends which shows that you have diligently pursued 
unit development.
    (b) Within 30 days after receiving your extension request, BLM will 
notify you whether we approve. BLM may request additional information 
from you.


<R05>
Sec. 3208.12  What information must I give BLM to show that I have made bona fide efforts to produce or utilize geothermal resources in commercial quantities?

    Send us a report which describes:
    (a) Your efforts to identify and define the geothermal resource on 
your lease which you are making now or which you made during the primary 
term of the lease;
    (b) The results of your efforts to identify and define the 
geothermal resource;
    (c) Other actions taken to support your efforts, such as obtaining 
permits,

[[Page 462]]

conducting environmental studies, and meeting permit requirements;
    (d) Your efforts during the primary term and ongoing efforts to 
negotiate marketing arrangements, sales contracts, drilling agreements, 
financing for electrical generation and transmission projects, or other 
related actions; and,
    (e) Current economic factors and conditions which affect your 
efforts to produce or utilize geothermal resources in commercial 
quantities on your lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3208.13  Will BLM extend my lease if I choose to pay instead of produce in commercial quantities?

    If you choose to pay instead of produce in commercial quantities 
under 43 CFR 3208.11(a)(2) and BLM approves the extension, we will 
modify the lease to require you to make an annual payment. We will 
specify the amount, which will not be less than $3.00 per acre or 
fraction of an acre of the lands under lease during an initial 
extension, or $6.00 per acre or fraction of an acre for a subsequent 
extension. The actual payment per acre is fixed for the period of the 
extension. If you request it, we will tell you the rate before you 
submit your petition for extension. You must make these payments to MMS 
at the same time you pay the lease rent. BLM may cancel your lease if 
you do not make these payments.


<R05>
Sec. 3208.14  What will BLM do if I choose to make significant expenditures?

    (a) If you choose to make significant expenditures under 43 CFR 
3208.11(a)(2), and BLM approves the lease extension, we will modify your 
lease to require you to make annual expenditures of at least $15.00 per 
acre or fraction of an acre for lands under lease during your first 
extension. You must make expenditures of $18.00 per acre or fraction of 
an acre during any subsequent extension. If you spend more than the 
minimum required in a year, you may apply the excess toward the 
significant expenditures requirement in subsequent years of the same 
extension period.
    (b) To give you credit for your significant expenditures, we must 
receive your report no later than 60 days after the end of the lease 
year in which you made the expenditures. Describe your operations by 
type, location, date(s) conducted, and amount spent on those operations. 
Include all geologic information obtained from your operations in your 
report.
    (c) After we review your report, we will notify you in writing 
whether you have met the diligent expenditure requirement. We must 
approve the type of work done and the expenditures claimed in your 
report before we can credit them toward your diligent exploration 
requirements.
    (d) We will cancel your lease if you fail to make the significant 
expenditures under a modified lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3208.15  What actions may I take which will count as significant expenditures?

    Significant expenditures only include:
    (a) Actual drilling operations on the lease;
    (b) Geochemical or geophysical surveys for exploratory or 
development wells;
    (c) Road or generating facility construction on the lease;
    (d) Architectural or engineering services procured for the design of 
generating facilities located on the lease; and
    (e) Environmental studies required by State or Federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 3208.16  During the extension, may I switch my choice to either pay instead of produce in commercial quantities or make significant expenditures?

    No, you may not make this change during an extension period. If you 
request a second extension, you may change your election for the second 
five year period when you submit your request.


<R05>
Sec. 3208.17  If I begin production, do I get a credit for payments made instead of production in commercial quantities or significant expenditures?

    No, if you begin production, you will not get a credit against 
royalties for either payments instead of production or significant 
expenditures made for that year.

[[Page 463]]


<R04>
         Subpart 3209--Conversion of Lease Producing Byproducts


<R05>
Sec. 3209.10  May I convert my geothermal lease to a mineral lease?

    You may convert your geothermal lease to a mineral lease, effective 
the first day of the month following the date BLM determines you have 
met the terms of conversion, if:
    (a) Your lease is in an extended term;
    (b) The byproducts you are producing in commercial quantities are 
leasable under the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), or under 
the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands (30 U.S.C. 351-358); and
    (c) The lease is primarily valuable for the production of just that 
mineral.


<R05>
Sec. 3209.11  May I convert my geothermal lease to a mining claim?

    If the minerals are not leasable but are locatable and would be 
considered a byproduct if geothermal steam production were to continue, 
you are entitled to locate these minerals under the mining laws. To 
acquire these rights, you must complete the mining claim location within 
90 days after the geothermal lease terminates. Also, there must have 
been no intervening location and the lands must be open to entry under 
the mining laws.


<R05>
Sec. 3209.12  May BLM include additional terms and conditions to my converted lease?

    If leases converted under either 43 CFR 3209.10 or 3209.11 affect 
lands withdrawn or acquired to aid some purpose of a Federal department 
or agency, including the Department of the Interior, BLM may include 
additional terms and conditions in your lease as prescribed by the 
appropriate agency.


<R05>
Sec. 3209.13  How do I convert my geothermal lease to a mineral lease or a mining claim?

    Just send us a request.


<R04>
               Subpart 3210--Additional Lease Information


<R05>
Sec. 3210.10  When does lease segregation occur?

    (a) Lease segregation occurs when:
    (1) A portion of a lease is committed to a unit agreement while 
other portions are not committed; or
    (2) Only a portion of a lease is located in a participating area and 
the unit contracts. The portion of the lease outside the participating 
area would be eliminated from the unit agreement and segregated as of 
the effective date of the unit contraction.
    (b) BLM will assign the original lease serial number to the portion 
within the plan or agreement. We will give the lease portion outside the 
plan or agreement a new serial number with the same lease terms as the 
original lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.11  Does a lease segregated from an agreement or plan receive any benefits from unitization of the committed portion of the original lease?

    The new segregated lease stands alone and does not receive any of 
the benefits provided to the portion committed to the unit. We will not 
give you an extension for the eliminated portion of the lease based on 
status of the lands committed to the unit, including production in 
commercial quantities or the existence of a producible well.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.12  May I consolidate leases?

    BLM may approve your consolidation of two or more adjacent leases 
that have the same ownership and same lease terms, including expiration 
dates, if the combined leases do not exceed 2,560 acres in size. We may 
consolidate leases that have different stipulations if all other lease 
terms are the same.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.13  What is the diligent exploration requirement?

    (a) During your lease's primary period, you must perform diligent 
exploration activities to yield new geologic information about the lease 
or related lands, until either:
    (1) Your approved expenditures on your lease total at least $40 per 
acre, or
    (2) BLM places your lease in an additional term.
    (b) You must begin diligent exploration by the sixth year of the 
primary term and continue until there is a well capable of production in 
commercial quantities. Some examples of activities

[[Page 464]]

that would qualify as diligent exploration are geochemical surveys, heat 
flow measurement, core drilling or drilling of test wells.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.14  How do I meet the diligent exploration requirement?

    (a) During the first five years of the primary term, you only need 
to pay your rents. If you make efforts during these first five years 
that would qualify as diligent exploration expenditures, and we approve 
them as such during those five years, we will count them toward the 
requirements of future years.
    (b) To qualify as diligent exploration expenditures in lease years 
six through ten, you must make expenditures equal to the minimum amounts 
listed in the following table. We will apply approved expenditures which 
exceed the minimum in any one year to subsequent years.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Expenditure
                         Lease year                            per acre
------------------------------------------------------------------------
6..........................................................          $4
7..........................................................           6
8..........................................................           8
9..........................................................          10
10.........................................................          12
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) To give you credit for your expenditures, we must receive your 
report no later than 60 days after the end of the lease year in which 
you made the expenditures. You must include the following information in 
your report:
    (1) The types of operations conducted;
    (2) The location of the operations;
    (3) When the operations occurred;
    (4) The amount of money spent conducting those operations; and
    (5) all geologic information obtained from your operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.15  Can I do something instead of performing diligent exploration?

    If you choose not to conduct diligent exploration, or if your total 
expenditures do not fully meet the requirement for any lease year, you 
may still meet the diligent exploration requirement for that year by 
paying an additional rent of $3 per acre or fraction of an acre. If you 
choose this option, you must send your payment to MMS before the end of 
the lease year.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.16  What happens if I do not meet the diligent exploration requirement or pay the additional rent?

    BLM will cancel your lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.17  Can someone lease or locate other minerals on the same lands as my geothermal lease?

    Yes. The United States reserves the ownership of and the right to 
extract helium, oil and hydrocarbon gas from all geothermal steam and 
associated geothermal resources. In addition, BLM allows mineral leasing 
or location on the same lands that are leased for geothermal resources, 
provided that operations under the mineral leasing or mining laws do not 
unreasonably interfere with or endanger your geothermal operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.18  May BLM readjust the terms and conditions in my lease?

    Yes, we may readjust the terms and conditions of your lease 
regarding stipulations and surface disturbance requirements. We may do 
this 10 years after you begin production from your lease, and at not 
less than 10-year intervals thereafter. If another Federal agency 
manages the lands' surface, we will ask that agency to review the 
related terms and conditions and propose any readjustments. Once BLM and 
the surface managing agency reach agreement, we will apply the 
readjustments to your lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.19  How will BLM readjust the terms and conditions in my lease?

    (a) We will give you a written proposal to adjust the terms and 
conditions of your lease. You will have 30 days after you receive the 
proposal to object in writing to the new terms or relinquish your lease. 
If you do not do this, these new terms will become part of your lease. 
If you do object in writing, we will issue a final decision on the new 
terms and conditions.
    (b) BLM will set the date that your new terms and conditions become 
effective.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.20  May BLM readjust the rental and royalty rates in my lease?

    (a) We may readjust your lease rental and royalty rates at not less 
than 20-

[[Page 465]]

year intervals beginning 35 years after we determine that your lease is 
producing in commercial quantities. We will not increase your rental and 
royalty rates by more than 50 percent of what you paid before BLM 
adjusted the rate. Also, we will not raise the royalty rate above 22.5 
percent.
    (b) BLM will notify you in writing of the proposed adjustments. You 
have 30 days after the date you receive the notice to object to the new 
rate. If we do not receive your written objection within 30 days, the 
new rate will become a part of your lease. If you do object in writing, 
we will issue a final decision on the new rental and royalty rate.
    (c) We will set the date that your new terms and conditions become 
effective.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.21  What if I appeal BLM's decision to adjust my lease terms?

    If you appeal our decision to adjust your lease terms and 
conditions, rental or royalty rate, the decision is effective during the 
appeal. If you win your appeal and we must change our decision, you will 
receive a refund or credit for any overpaid rents or royalties.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.22  Must I prevent drainage of geothermal resources from my lease?

    Yes, you must prevent the drainage of geothermal resources from your 
lease by diligently drilling and producing wells which will protect the 
Federal geothermal resource from loss caused by production from other 
properties.


<R05>
Sec. 3210.23  What will BLM do if I do not protect my lease from drainage?

    We will determine the amount of geothermal resources drained from 
your lease. MMS will bill you for a compensatory royalty based on our 
findings. This royalty will equal the amount you would have paid for 
producing those resources. All interest owners in a lease are jointly 
and severally liable for drainage protection and any compensatory 
royalties.


<R04>
                 Subpart 3211--Fees, Rent, and Royalties


<R05>
Sec. 3211.10  What are the filing fees, rent, and minimum royalties for leases?

    (a) BLM calculates rents and minimum royalties based on the amount 
of acreage covered by your lease. First, round up any partial acreage to 
the next whole acre. For example, rent on a 2,456.39 acre lease is 
calculated based on 2,457 acres. Then multiply the total number of acres 
covered by your lease by the appropriate amount set out in the chart in 
paragraph (b) of this section to determine the amount you owe.
    (b) Use the following table to determine the filing fees, rents and 
minimum royalties owed for your lease.

                    Filing Fees, Rent, and Royalties

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note the exception stated in 43 CFR 3211.16(b).


<R05>
Sec. 3211.11  When is my annual rental payment due?

    MMS must receive your annual rental payment by the anniversary date 
of each lease year. There is no grace period for rental payments. If the 
rent for your lease is not paid on time, the lease will automatically 
terminate by operation of law, unless you meet the conditions of 43 CFR 
3213.15. See the MMS regulations in 30 CFR part 218

[[Page 466]]

which explain when MMS considers a payment as received. If less than a 
full year remains on a lease, you still must pay a full year's rent by 
the anniversary date of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3211.12  How and where do I pay my rent?

    (a) Pay BLM the first year's advance rent according to the 
instructions at 43 CFR 3204.12 or 3205.16. You may use a personal or 
cashier's check or money order made payable to the Department of the 
Interior--Bureau of Land Management. You may also make payments by 
credit card or electronic funds transfer with our prior approval.
    (b) For all subsequent years make your rental payments to MMS. See 
MMS regulations at 30 CFR part 218.


<R05>
Sec. 3211.13  Is there a different rental or minimum royalty amount for a fractional interest lease?

    Yes, BLM will prorate rents and minimum royalties payable under 
leases for lands in which the United States owns only a fractional 
mineral interest. For example, if the United States owns 50% of a 640 
acre lease, you pay rent based on 320 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 3211.14  Will I always pay rent on my lease?

    You are required to pay rent only until you achieve production in 
commercial quantities. At that time you begin paying royalties instead.


<R05>
Sec. 3211.15  Must I pay rent if my lease is committed to an approved cooperative or unit plan?

    (a) Before you begin production, if your lease is committed to an 
approved cooperative or unit plan, you must pay rent in accordance with 
43 CFR 3211.10.
    (b) Once you begin production, you do not have to pay rent if the 
lands included in an approved cooperative or unit plan are within the 
participating area. These lands are subject to royalties instead, under 
43 CFR 3211.16. The only exception is for unitized lands outside the 
participating area, which remain subject to rent under 43 CFR 3211.10.


<R05>
Sec. 3211.16  What is the royalty rate for production from or attributable to my lease?

    The royalty rate for production from or attributable to your lease 
is prescribed in your lease form. The chart at 43 CFR 3211.10 shows the 
minimum royalty rates. We will determine the royalty rate to include in 
your lease form based on the following:
    (a) The royalty rate for heat or energy derived from lease 
production may range from 10 to 15 percent of the heat or energy value;
    (b) Except for minerals discussed in paragraph (c) of this section, 
the royalty rate for the value of byproducts may not exceed five 
percent:
    (1) If derived from production under the lease; and
    (2) If sold or utilized or reasonably susceptible to sale or 
utilization.
    (c) The royalty rate for minerals listed in section 1 of the Mineral 
Leasing Act will be the same as the royalty rate for those minerals 
provided under BLM regulations in this Title.
    (d) The royalty rate for commercially demineralized water produced 
on a lease may not exceed 5 percent, except that BLM will not charge a 
royalty for water used in the operations of a utilization facility.


<R05>
Sec. 3211.17  When do I owe minimum royalty?

    You owe minimum royalty when BLM determines you have a well capable 
of commercial production but you have not begun actual production. You 
also owe minimum royalty when the value of actual production is so low 
that royalty you would pay under the scheduled rate is less than $2.00 
per acre. You should make your minimum royalty payment to MMS under the 
regulations in 30 CFR part 218.

[[Page 467]]


<R04>
       Subpart 3212--Lease Suspensions and Royalty Rate Reductions


<R05>
Sec. 3212.10  What is the difference between a suspension of operations and production and a suspension of operations?

    A suspension of operations and production is a temporary relief from 
production obligations which you may request from BLM because economic 
conditions make it unjustifiable for you to continue operating. A 
suspension of operations is when we order you, on our own initiative, to 
temporarily stop production in order to protect the resource.


<R05>
Sec. 3212.11  How do I obtain a suspension of operations or operations and production on my lease?

    (a) If you are the operator, you may request in writing that BLM 
suspend your operations and production for a producing lease. Your 
request must fully describe why you need the suspension. We will 
determine if your suspension is approved.
    (b) We may act on our own and suspend your operations on any lease 
in the interest of conservation.
    (c) A suspension under this section may include leases committed to 
an approved unit agreement. Even if leases committed to the unit are 
suspended, the unit operator must still meet unit obligations.


<R05>
Sec. 3212.12  How long does a suspension of operations or operations and production last?

    (a) BLM will state in your suspension notice how long your 
suspension of operations or operations and production is effective.
    (b) During a suspension, you may ask BLM in writing to terminate 
your suspension. The suspension will terminate when you resume 
production or drilling operations. If we terminate the suspension, you 
must resume paying rents and minimum royalty. See 43 CFR 3212.14.
    (c) If we get information showing that you must resume operations to 
protect the interests of the United States, we will terminate your 
suspension and order you to resume production.


<R05>
Sec. 3212.13  How does a suspension affect my lease terms?

    If BLM approves your suspension of operations and production,
    (a) Your lease term is extended by the length of time the suspension 
is in effect.
    (b) You do not have to drill, produce geothermal resources, or pay 
rents or royalties during the suspension. We will suspend your 
obligation to pay lease rents or royalties beginning with the first day 
of the month following the date the suspension is effective. For a 
suspension of operations, we will not suspend your lease rental or 
royalty obligations.


<R05>
Sec. 3212.14  What happens when the suspension ends?

    You must resume rental or minimum royalty payments beginning on the 
first day of the lease month after BLM terminates the suspension. You 
must pay the full rental or minimum royalty amount due on or before the 
next lease anniversary date. If you do not, we will refund your balance 
and cancel the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3212.15  May BLM reduce or suspend the royalty or rental rate of my lease?

    Yes. If you apply for a waiver, suspension or reduction of your rent 
or royalty, BLM may grant your request if we determine that:
    (a) It promotes conservation;
    (b) Doing so will encourage the greatest ultimate recovery of 
resources;
    (c) It is necessary to promote development; or
    (d) You cannot successfully operate the lease under its current 
terms.


<R05>
Sec. 3212.16  What information must I submit when I request that BLM suspend, reduce or waive my royalty or rental rate?

    (a) Your request for suspension, reduction or waiver of the royalty 
or rental rate must include all information BLM needs to determine if 
the lease can be operated under its current terms. We may ask you for:
    (1) The type of reduction you seek;
    (2) The serial number of your lease;
    (3) The names of the lessee and operator;

[[Page 468]]

    (4) The location and status of wells;
    (5) A summary of monthly production from your lease; and
    (6) A detailed statement of expenses and costs.
    (b) If you are applying for a royalty reduction, suspension or 
waiver, you must also give us a list of names and amounts of royalties 
or payments out of production paid to each individual, and every effort 
you have made to reduce these payments. We will not approve a royalty 
reduction, suspension or waiver unless other royalty interest owners 
accept a similar reduction, suspension or waiver.


<R04>
 Subpart 3213--Relinquishment, Termination, Cancellation, and Expiration


<R05>
Sec. 3213.10  Who may relinquish a lease?

    The record title owner may relinquish a lease in full or in part. If 
there is more than one record title owner for a lease, all record title 
owners must sign the relinquishment.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.11  What must I do to relinquish a lease?

    Send BLM a written request that includes the serial number of each 
lease you are relinquishing. If you are relinquishing the entire lease, 
no legal description of the land is required. If you are relinquishing 
part of the lease, you must describe the lands relinquished.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.12  May BLM accept a partial relinquishment if it will reduce my lease to less than 640 acres?

    Your lease must remain at least 640 acres, or all of your leased 
lands in a section, whichever is less. Otherwise, we will not accept 
your partial relinquishment. We may only allow an exception if it will 
further development of the resource.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.13  When does my relinquishment take effect?

    If BLM determines you have submitted a complete relinquishment 
request which meets the requirements of 43 CFR 3213.11 and 3213.12, your 
relinquishment is effective the day we receive it. However, you and your 
surety must still:
    (a) Pay all rents and royalties due before relinquishment;
    (b) Plug and abandon all wells on the relinquished land;
    (c) Restore the surface and other resources; and,
    (d) Comply with the requirements of 43 CFR 3200.4.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.14  How can my lease automatically terminate?

    If you do not pay the rent on or before the anniversary date, your 
lease automatically terminates by operation of law.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.15  Will my lease automatically terminate if my rental payment is on time but for the wrong amount?

    (a) If MMS receives your rental payment on time, but it is deficient 
by a nominal amount, your lease will not automatically terminate. A 
nominal amount is not more than $100 or five percent of the total 
payment due, whichever is less. MMS will notify you if your payment is 
deficient, and will set a date by which a further payment must be made. 
If you do not send this further payment in the time allowed, we will 
terminate your lease as of the anniversary date of the lease.
    (b) If your rental payment is deficient by more than a nominal 
amount, your lease will automatically terminate on the anniversary date 
of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.16  Will BLM notify me if my lease terminates?

    Yes, we will send you a notice of the termination by certified mail, 
return receipt requested.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.17  May BLM reinstate my lease?

    Yes, if your lease was terminated for failure to pay your rents on 
time. You have 30 days from when you receive the termination notice to 
petition us for reinstatement.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.18  Who may petition to reinstate a lease?

    All record title owners must sign the petition, though any one 
record owner can submit it.

[[Page 469]]


<R05>
Sec. 3213.19  What must I do to have my lease reinstated?

    Send BLM a petition requesting reinstatement. Your petition must 
include the serial number for each lease and an explanation of why the 
delay in payment was justifiable, rather than due to a lack of 
diligence. In addition to your petition, you must also include any past 
rent owed and any rent which has accrued from the termination date.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.20  Are there reasons why BLM would not reinstate my lease?

    We will not reinstate your lease if:
    (a) You do not prove that your failure to pay rent on time was 
justifiable or was not due to your lack of diligence;
    (b) We issued a valid lease for any of the lands before you filed 
your petition for reinstatement; or
    (c) The land is no longer available for leasing.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.21  When will my lease expire?

    Your lease expires at the end of its primary term or extended term 
if you do not either begin production before the primary term ends or 
extend your lease under subpart 3208. BLM will not notify you when your 
lease expires at the end of the primary term.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.22  Will BLM notify me when my lease's extended term expires?

    No, if you have extended your lease term, we will not notify you 
when your lease expires at the end of that extended term.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.23  May BLM cancel my lease?

    (a) Yes, we may cancel your lease, after giving you 30 days notice, 
if we determine that you violated the requirements of 43 CFR 3200.4. We 
will also cancel your lease if it was issued in error.
    (b) See the following Subparts for information related to Inspection 
and Enforcement procedures:
    (1) Subpart 3254--Exploration operations;
    (2) Subpart 3266--Drilling operations; and
    (3) Subpart 3277--Utilization operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.24  When is a cancellation effective?

    (a) If BLM cancels your lease because it was issued in error, the 
cancellation is effective when you receive it.
    (b) If BLM cancels your lease because you violated the requirements 
of 43 CFR 3200.4, the cancellation takes effect 30 days from the date 
you receive notice of the violation.


<R05>
Sec. 3213.25  What can I do if BLM notifies me that my lease is being canceled due to violations of the laws, regulations or lease terms?

    (a) You can prevent us from canceling your lease following this 
notice if:
    (1) You correct the violation within 30 days; or
    (2) You show us that you cannot correct the violation during the 30-
day period but that you are making a good faith attempt to timely 
correct the violation.
    (b) You may request a hearing on the record about the violation or 
proposed lease cancellation. You have 30 days from the date you receive 
the violation notice to request a hearing. See 43 CFR parts 4 and 1840. 
We will suspend canceling your lease while your appeal is pending. If a 
hearing occurs and the administrative law judge decides you committed a 
violation, you will have 30 days from receiving the decision to correct 
the violation under paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart 3214--Personal and Surety Bonds


<R05>
Sec. 3214.10  Who must post a geothermal bond?

    The lessee or operator must post a bond with BLM before exploration, 
drilling or utilization operations begin. Before we approve a lease 
transfer or recognize a new designated operator, the lessee or operator 
must file a new bond or a rider to the existing bond, unless all 
previous operations on the land have already been reclaimed.


<R05>
Sec. 3214.11  Who must my bond cover?

    Your bond must cover all record title owners, operating rights 
owners, operators and any person who conducts operations on your lease.

[[Page 470]]


<R05>
Sec. 3214.12  What activities must my bond cover?

    Your bond must cover:
    (a) Any activities related to exploration, drilling, utilization or 
associated operations on a Federal lease;
    (b) Reclamation of the surface and other resources;
    (c) Royalty payments; and,
    (d) Compliance with the requirements of 43 CFR 3200.4.


<R05>
Sec. 3214.13  What is the minimum dollar amount required for a bond?

    The minimum bond amount differs depending on the type of activity 
you are proposing and whether your bond will cover individual, statewide 
or nationwide activities. The minimum dollar amounts and bonding options 
for each type of activity are found in the following regulations:
    (a) Exploration operations--see 43 CFR 3251.15;
    (b) Drilling operations--see 43 CFR 3261.18; and,
    (c) Utilization operations--see 43 CFR 3271.12 and 43 CFR 3273.19.


<R05>
Sec. 3214.14  May BLM increase the bond amount above the minimum?

    (a) We may increase the bond amount beyond the minimums referenced 
in 43 CFR 3214.13 when:
    (1) We determine the operator has a history of noncompliance;
    (2) We previously had to make a claim against a surety because any 
one person who is covered by the new bond failed to timely plug and 
abandon a well and reclaim the surface;
    (3) MMS has notified BLM that a person covered by the bond owes 
uncollected royalties; or
    (4) Our inspection of the property determines that the bond amount 
is too low to cover the estimated reclamation cost.
    (b) We may increase bond amounts to any level, but we will not set 
that amount higher than the total estimated costs of plugging wells, 
removing structures, and reclaiming the surface, plus any uncollected 
royalties due MMS or monies owed to BLM due to previous violations.


<R05>
Sec. 3214.15  What kind of financial guarantee will BLM accept to back my bond?

    We will not accept cash to back a bond. We will only accept:
    (a) Corporate surety bonds, provided that the surety company is 
approved by the Department of Treasury (see Department of the Treasury 
Circular No. 570 which is published in the Federal Register every year 
on or about July 1); and
    (b) Personal bonds, which are secured by a cashier's check, 
certified check, certificate of deposit, negotiable securities such as

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the lands 
transferred to you contain a well or any other surface disturbance which 
the original lessee did not reclaim, you must post a bond under this 
subpart.
    (b) If the original lessee does not transfer all interest in the 
lease to you, you may become a co-principal on the original bond, rather 
than posting a new bond.
    (c) You do not need to post an additional bond if:
    (1) You previously furnished a statewide or nationwide bond; or
    (2) The operator provided the original bond, and the operator does 
not change.

               Subpart 3215--Bond Collection After Default


<R05>
Sec. 3215.10  When may BLM collect against my bond?

    Unless you comply with the requirements listed at 43 CFR 3200.4, we 
may collect money from the bond to correct your noncompliance. This 
amount can be as large as the face amount of the bond. Some examples of 
when we will collect against your bond are when you do not:
    (a) Properly plug and abandon a well;
    (b) Reclaim the lease area;
    (c) Pay outstanding royalties; or
    (d) Pay assessed royalties to compensate for drainage.


<R05>
Sec. 3215.11  Must I replace my bond after BLM collects against it?

    Yes. If we collect against your bond, before you conduct any further 
operations you must either:
    (a) Post a new bond equal to the value of the original bond; or
    (b) Restore your existing bond to the original amount.


<R05>
Sec. 3215.12  What will BLM do if I do not restore the face amount or file a new bond?

    If we collect against your bond and you do not restore it to the 
original amount, we may shut-in any well(s) or utilization facilities 
and begin canceling all of your leases covered by that bond.

[[Page 472]]


<R05>
Sec. 3215.13  Will BLM cancel or terminate my bond?

    No, we do not cancel or terminate bonds. However, we may:
    (a) Terminate the period of liability of a surety or other bond 
provider at any time. The bond provider must give you and BLM 30 days 
notice when they terminate your bond. Once your bond is terminated, do 
not conduct any operations until you provide a new bond which meets our 
requirements. We will also release an old bond once you file a new bond 
with a rider covering existing liabilities and we accept it; or
    (b) Release your bond after a reasonable period of time, if we 
determine that you have paid all royalties, rents, penalties, and 
assessments, satisfied all permit or lease obligations and reclaimed the 
site according to your operations plan.


<R05>
Sec. 3215.14  When BLM releases my bond, does that end my responsibilities?

    No, when we release your bond, we relinquish the security but we 
continue to hold the lessee or operator responsible for noncompliance. 
Specifically, we do not waive any legal claim we may have against any 
person under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and 
Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), or other laws and 
regulations.

for performing all lease obligations accrued after the date of the 
transfer, and for plugging and abandoning wells which exist and are not 
plugged at the time of the transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 3216.13  What are my responsibilities after I transfer my interest?

    You will still be responsible for rents, royalties, compensatory 
royalties and other obligations accrued before your transfer became 
effective. You must also plug and abandon any wells drilled or existing 
on the lease while you held your interest.


<R05>
Sec. 3216.14  What filing fees and forms does a transfer require?

    With each transfer request you must send us the correct form and pay

are in the public interest. Unit agreement application procedures are 
provided in 43 CFR part 3280.


<R05>
Sec. 3217.11  What are communitization agreements?

    Communitization agreements (also called drilling agreements) help 
operators who cannot independently develop separate tracts due to 
problems with well spacing or well development programs. Lessees may ask 
BLM to approve a communitization agreement or, in some cases, we may 
require the lessees to enter into such an agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 3217.12  What does BLM need to approve my communitization agreement?

    Give us the following information:
    (a) The location of the separate tracts comprising the drilling or 
spacing unit;
    (b) How you will prorate production or royalties to each separate 
tract based on total acres involved;
    (c) The name of each tract operator; and

[[Page 493]]

    (1) If the meter measures electricity, it must have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>0.25% or better of reading;
    (2) If the meter measures steam flowing more than 100,000 lbs/hr on 
a monthly basis, it must have an accuracy of <plus-minus>2 percent or 
better of reading;
    (3) If the meter measures steam flowing less than 100,000 lbs/hr on 
a monthly basis, it must have an accuracy of <plus-minus>4 percent or 
better of reading;
    (4) If the meter measures water flowing more than 500,000 lbs/hr on 
a monthly basis, it must have an accuracy of <plus-minus>2 percent or 
better of reading;
    (5) If the meter measures water flowing 500,000 lbs/hr or less on a 
monthly basis, it must have an accuracy of <plus-minus>4 percent or 
better of reading;
    (6) If the meter measures heat content, it must have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>4 percent or better; or
    (7) If the meter measures two phase flow at any rate, we will 
determine meter accuracy requirements. You must obtain our prior written 
approval before installing and using meters for two phase flow.
    (b) Any meters that you do not use to calculate Federal royalty are 
considered production meters, which must maintain an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>5 percent or better of reading.

              Subpart 3281--Application for Unit Agreement


<R05>
Sec. 3281.1  Preliminary consideration of agreements.

    The form of unit agreement set forth in Sec. 3286.1 of this title is 
acceptable for use in unproved areas. The use of this form is not 
mandatory, but any proposed departure therefrom should be submitted with 
the application submitted under Sec. 3281.2 of this title for 
preliminary consideration and for such revision as may be deemed 
necessary. In areas proposed for unitization in which a discovery of 
geothermal resources has been made, or where a cooperative agreement is 
contemplated, the proposed agreement should be submitted with the 
application submitted under Sec. 3281.2 of this title for preliminary 
consideration and for such revision as may be deemed necessary. The 
proposed form of agreement should be submitted in triplicate and should 
be plainly marked to identify the proposed variances from the form of 
agreement set forth in Sec. 3286.1 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3281.2  Designation of area.

    An application for designation of an area as logically subject to 
development and/or operation under a unit or cooperative agreement may 
be filed, in triplicate, by any proponent of such an agreement through 
the authorized officer. Each copy of the application shall be 
accompanied by a map or diagram on a scale of not less than 1 inch to 1 
mile, outlining the area sought to be designated under this section. The 
Federal, State, and privately owned land should be indicated on said map 
by distinctive symbols or colors and Federal geothermal leases and lease 
applications should be identified by serial number. Geological 
information, including the results of geophysical surveys, and such 
other information as may tend to show that unitization is necessary and 
advisable in the public interest should be furnished in triplicate. 
Geological and geophysical information and data so furnished will not be 
available for public inspection, as provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b), without 
the consent of the proponent. The application and supporting data will 
be

[[Page 499]]

considered by the Director and the applicant will be informed of the 
decision reached. The designation of an area, pursuant to an application 
filed under this section, shall not create an exclusive right to submit 
an executed agreement for such area, nor preclude the inclusion of such 
area or any part thereof in another unit area.


<R05>
Sec. 3281.3  Parties to unit or cooperative agreement.

    The owners of any rights, title, or interest in the geothermal 
resources deposits to be developed and operated under an agreement can 
be regarded as proper parties to a proposed agreement. All such owners 
must be invited to join as parties to the agreement. If any owner fails 
or refuses to join the agreement, the proponent of the agreement should 
declare this to the authorized officer and should submit evidence of 
efforts made to obtain joinder of such owner and the reasons for 
nonjoinder.


<R05>
Sec. 3281.4  State land.

    Where State-owned land is to be included in the unit, approval of 
the agreement by appropriate State officials should be obtained prior to 
its submission to the Department for approval of the executed agreement. 
When authorized by the laws of the State in which the unitized land is 
situated, provisions may be made in the agreement accepting State law, 
to the extent that they are applicable to non-Federal unitized land.

    4.2  Unitized Leases, insofar as they cover any lands which are 
excluded from the Unit Area under any of the provisions of this Article 
IV may be maintained and continued in force and effect in accordance 
with the terms, provisions, and conditions contained in the Act, and the 
lease or leases and amendments thereto, except that operations and/or 
production under this Unit Agreement shall not serve to maintain or 
continue the excluded portion of any lease.
    4.3  All legal subdivisions of unitized lands (i.e., 40 acres by 
Governmental survey or its nearest lot or tract equivalent in instances 
of irregular surveys), no part of which is entitled to be within a 
Participating Area on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the 
initial Participating Area established under this Agreement, shall be 
eliminated automatically from this Agreement effective as of said fifth 
anniversary and such lands shall no longer be a part of the Unit Area 
and shall no longer be subject to this Agreement unless diligent 
drilling operations are in progress on an exploratory well on said fifth 
anniversary, in which event such lands shall not be eliminated from the 
Unit Area for as long as exploratory drilling operations are continued 
diligently with not more than four (4) months time elapsing between the 
completion of one exploratory well and the commencement of the next 
exploratory well.
    4.4  An exploratory well, for the purposes of this Article IV is 
defined as any well, regardless of surface location, projected for 
completion in a zone or deposit below any zone or deposit for which a 
Participating Area has been established and is in effect, or any well,

location under Unitized Lands not entitled to be within a Participating 
Area.
    4.5  In the event an exploratory well is completed during the four 
(4) months immediately preceding the fifth anniversary of the initial 
Participating Area established under this Agreement, lands not entitled 
to be within a Participating Area shall not be eliminated from this 
Agreement on said fifth anniversary, provided the drilling of another 
exploratory well is commenced under an approved Plan of Operation within 
four (4) months after the completion of said well. In such event, the 
land not entitled to be in participation shall not be eliminated from 
the Unit Area so long as exploratory drilling operations are continued 
diligently with not more than four (4) months time elapsing between the 
completion of one exploratory well and the commencement of the next 
exploratory well.
    4.6  With prior approval of the authorized officer, a period of time 
in excess of four (4) months may be allowed to elapse between the 
completion of one well and the commencement of the next well without the 
automatic elimination of nonparticipating acreage.
    4.7  Unitized lands proved productive by drilling operations which 
serve to delay automatic elimination of lands under this Article IV 
shall be incorporated into a Participating Area (or Areas) in the same 
manner as such lands would have been incorporated in such areas had such 
lands been proven productive during the year preceding said fifth 
anniversary.
    4.8  In the event nonparticipating lands are retained under this 
Agreement after the fifth anniversary of the initial Participating Area 
as a result of exploratory drilling operations, all legal subdivisions 
of unitized land (i.e., 40 acres by Government survey or its

[[Page 503]]

nearest lot or tract equivalent in instances of irregular Surveys), no 
part of which is entitled to be within a Participating Area shall be 
eliminated automatically as of the 121 day, or such later date as may be 
established by the authorized officer, following the completion of the 
last well recognized as delaying such automatic elimination beyond the 
fifth anniversary of the initial Participating Area established under 
this Agreement.

            article v--unitized land and unitized substances

    5.1  All land committed to this Agreement shall constitute land 
referred to herein as ``Unitized Land''. All geothermal resources in and

    6.1  ______________ is hereby designated as Unit Operator and by 
signature hereto as Unit Operator agrees and consents to accept the 
duties and obligations of Unit Operator for the discovery, development, 
production, distribution and utilization of Unitized Substances as 
herein provided. Whenever reference is made herein to the Unit Operator, 
such reference means the Unit Operator acting in that capacity and not 
as an owner of interest in Unitized Substances, and the term ``Working 
Interest Owner'' when used herein shall include or refer to Unit 
Operator as the owner of a Working Interest when such an interest is 
owned by it.

          article vii--resignation or removal of unit operator

    7.1  Prior to the establishment of a Participating Area, hereunder, 
Unit Operator shall have the right to resign. Such resignation shall not 
become effective so as to release Unit Operator from the duties and 
obligations of Unit Operator or terminate Unit Operators rights, as 
such, for a period of six (6) months after notice of its intention to 
resign has been served by Unit Operator on all Working Interest Owners 
and the authorized officer, nor until all wells then drilled hereunder 
are placed in a satisfactory condition for suspension or abandonment 
whichever is required by the authorized officer, unless a new Unit 
Operator shall have been selected and approved and shall have taken over 
and assumed the duties and obligations of Unit Operator prior to the 
expiration of said period.
    7.2  After the establishment of a Participating Area hereunder Unit 
Operator shall have the right to resign in the manner and subject to the 
limitations provided in 7.1 above.

as herein provided for the selection of a new Unit Operator. Such 
removal shall be effective upon notice thereof to the authorized 
officer.
    7.4  The resignation or removal of Unit Operator under this 
Agreement shall not terminate its right, title, or interest as the owner 
of a Working Interest or other interest in Unitized Substances, but upon 
the resignation or removal of Unit Operator becoming effective, such 
Unit Operator shall deliver possession of all wells, equipment, 
material, and appurtenances used in conducting the unit operations to 
the new duly qualified successor Unit Operator or, if no such new unit 
operator is elected, to the common agent appointed to represent the 
Working Interest Owners in any action taken hereunder to be used for the 
purpose of conducting operations hereunder.
    7.5  In all instances of resignation or removal, until a successor 
Unit Operator is selected and approved as hereinafter provided, the 
Working Interest Owners shall be jointly responsible for performance of 
the duties and obligations of Unit Operator, and shall not later than 30 
days before such resignation or removal becomes effective appoint a 
common agent to represent them in any action to be taken hereunder.
    7.6  The resignation of Unit Operator shall not release Unit 
Operator from any liability for any default by it hereunder occurring 
prior to the effective date of its resignation.

    8.1  If, prior to the establishment of a Participating Area 
hereunder, the Unit Operator shall resign as Operator, or shall be 
removed as provided in Article VII, a successor Unit Operator may be 
selected by vote of the owners of a majority of the Working Interests in 
Unitized Substances, based on their respective shares, on an acreage 
basis, in the Unitized Land.
    8.2  If, after the establishment of a Participating Area hereunder, 
the Unit Operator shall resign as Unit Operator, or shall be removed as 
provided in Article VII, a successor Unit Operator may be selected by 
vote of the owners of a majority of the Working Interests in Unitized 
Substances, based on their respective shares, on a participating acreage 
basis. Provided, that, if a majority but less than 60 percent of the 
Working Interest in the Participating Lands is owned by the party to 
this agreement, a concurring vote of one or more additional Working 
Interest Owners owning 10 percent or more of the Working Interest in the 
participating land shall be required to select a new Unit Operator.
    8.3  The selection of a successor Unit Operator shall not become 
effective until:

[[Page 504]]

    (a) The Unit Operator so selected shall accept in writing the 
duties, obligations and responsibilities of the Unit Operator, and
    (b) The selection shall have been approved by the authorized 
officer.
    8.4  If no successor Unit Operator is selected and qualified as 
herein provided, the Director at his election may declare this Agreement 
terminated.

     article ix--accounting provisions and unit operating agreement

    9.1  Costs and expenses incurred by Unit Operator in conducting unit 
operations hereunder shall be paid and apportioned among and borne by

to any land or to any lease or operating agreement, it being understood 
that the Unit Operator, in its capacity as Unit Operator shall exercise 
the rights of possession and use vested in the parties hereto only for 
the purposes specified in this Agreement.
    10.4  The Unit Operator shall take such measures as the authorized 
officer deems appropriate and adequate to prevent drainage of Unitized 
Substances from Unitized Land by wells on land not subject to this 
Agreement.
    10.5  The Director is hereby vested with authority to alter or 
modify from time to time, in his discretion, the rate of prospecting and 
development and the quantity and rate of production under this 
Agreement.

                      article xi--plan of operation

    11.1  Concurrently with the submission of this Agreement for 
approval, Unit Operator shall submit an acceptable initial Plan of 
Operation. Said plan shall be as complete and adequate as the authorized 
officer may determine to be necessary for timely exploration and/or 
development and to insure proper protection of the environment and 
conservation of the natural resources of the Unit Area.
    11.2  Prior to the expiration of the initial Plan of Operation, or 
any subsequent Plan of Operation, Unit Operator shall submit for 
approval of the authorized officer an acceptable subsequent Plan of 
Operation for the Unit Area which, when approved by the authorized 
officer, shall constitute the exploratory and/or development drilling 
and operating obligations of Unit Operators under this Agreement for the 
period specified therein.
    11.3  Any plan of Operation submitted hereunder shall:
    (a) Specify the number and locations of any wells to be drilled and 
the proposed order and time for such drilling, and
    (b) To the extent practicable, specify the operating practices

the terms, hereof, and thereafter continue such drilling diligently 
until the ____________ formation has been tested or until at a lesser 
depth

[[Page 505]]

unitized substances shall be discovered which can be produced in paying 
quantities (i.e., quantities sufficient to repay the costs of drilling, 
completing, and producing operations, with a reasonable profit) or the 
Unit Operator shall at any time establish to the satisfaction of the 
authorized officer that further drilling of said well would be 
unwarranted or impracticable, Provided, however, That Unit Operator 
shall not in any event be required to drill said well to a depth in 
excess of __________ feet.
    11.5  The initial Plan of Operation and/or subsequent Plans of 
Operation submitted under this article shall provide that the Unit 
Operator shall initiate a continuous drilling program providing for 
drilling of no less than one well at a time, and allowing no more than 
six (6) months time to elapse between completion of one well and the 
beginning of the next well, until a well capable of producing Unitized 
Substances in paying quantities is completed to the satisfaction of the 
authorized officer or until it is reasonably proved that the Unitized 
Land is incapable of producing Unitized Substances in paying quantities 
in the formations drilled under this Agreement.
    11.6  When warranted by unforeseen circumstances, the authorized 
officer may grant a single extension of any or all of the critical dates 
for exploratory drilling operations cited in the initial or subsequent 
Plans of Operation. No such extension shall exceed a period of four (4)

    11.7  Until there is actual production of Unitized Substances, the 
failure of Unit Operator to timely drill any of the wells provided for 
in Plans of Operation required under this Article XI or to timely submit 
an acceptable subsequent Plan of Operations, shall, after notice of 
default or notice of prospective default to Unit Operator by the 
authorized officer and after failure of Unit Operator to remedy any 
actual default within a reasonable time (as determined by the authorized 
officer), result in automatic termination of this Agreement effective as 
of the date of the default, as determined by the authorized officer.
    11.8  Separate Plans of Operations may be submitted for separate 
productive zones, subject to the approval of the authorized officer. 
Also subject to the approval of the authorized officer, Plans of 
Operation shall be modified or supplemented when necessary to meet 
changes in conditions or to protect the interest of all parties to this 
Agreement.

                    article xii--participating areas

    12.1  Prior to the commencement of production of Unitized 
Substances, the Unit Operator shall submit for approval by the 
authorized officer a schedule (or schedules) of all land then regarded 
as reasonably proved to be productive from a pool or deposit discovered 
or developed; all lands in said schedule (or schedules), on approval of 
the authorized officer, will constitute a Participating Area (or Areas) 
effective as of the date production commences or the effective date of 
this Unit Agreement, whichever is later. Said schedule (or schedules) 
shall also set forth the percentage of Unitized Substances to be 
allocated, as herein provided, to each tract in the Participating Area 
(or Areas) so established and shall govern the allocation of production 
commencing with the effective date of the Participating Area.
    12.2  A separate Participating Area shall be established for each 
separate pool or deposit of Unitized Substances or for any group thereof 
which is produced as a single pool or deposit and any two or more 
Participating Areas so established may be combined into one, on approval 
of the authorized officer. The effective date of any Participating Area 
established after the commencement of actual production of Unitized 
Substances shall be the first of the month in which is obtained the 
knowledge or information on which the establishment of said 
Participating Area is based, unless a more appropriate effective date is 
proposed by the Unit Operator and approved by the authorized officer.
    12.3  Any Participating Area (or Areas) established under 12.1 or 
12.2 above shall, subject to the approval of the authorized officer, be 
revised from time to time to include additional land then regarded as 
reasonably proved to be productive from the pool or deposit for which 
the Participating Area was established or to include lands necessary to 
unit operations, or to exclude land then regarded as reasonably proved 
not to be productive from the pool or deposit for which the 
Participating Area was established or to exclude land not necessary to 
unit operations and the schedule (or schedules) of allocation 
percentages shall be revised accordingly.
    12.4  Subject to the limitation cited in 12.1 hereof, the effective 
date of any revision of a Participating Area established under Articles 
12.1 or 12.2 shall be the first of the month in which is obtained the 
knowledge or information on which such revision is predicated, provided, 
however, that a more appropriate effective date may be used if justified 
by the Unit Operator and approved by the authorized officer.
    12.5  No land shall be excluded from a Participating Area on account 
of depletion of the Unitized Substances, except that any Participating 
Area established under the provisions of this Article XII shall 
terminate automatically whenever all operations are abandoned in the 
pool or deposit for which the Participating Area was established.

[[Page 506]]

    12.6  Nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring any 
retroactive adjustment for production obtained prior to the effective 
date of the revision of a Participating Area.

             article xiii--allocation of unitized substances

    13.1  All Unitized Substances produced from a Participating Area, 
established under this Agreement, shall be deemed to be produced equally 
on an acreage basis from the several tracts of Unitized Land within the 
Participating Area established for such production.
    13.2  For the purpose of determining any benefits accruing under 
this Agreement, each Tract of Unitized Land shall have allocated to it 
such percentage of said production as the number of acres in the Tract 
included in the Participating Area bears to the total number of acres of 
Unitized Land in said Participating Area.
    13.3  Allocation of production hereunder for purposes other than for 
settlement of the royalty obligations of the respective Working Interest 
Owners, shall be on the basis prescribed in the Unit Operating Agreement 
whether in conformity with the basis of allocation set forth above or 
otherwise.
    13.4  The Unitized Substances produced from a Participating Area 
shall be allocated as provided herein regardless of whether any wells 
are drilled on any particular part or tract of said Participating Area.

                  article xiv--relinquishment of leases

    14.1  Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal leases and 43 CFR 
3244.1, a lessee of record shall, subject to the provisions of the Unit 
Operating Agreement, have the right to relinquish any of its interests 
in leases committed hereto, in whole or in part; provided, that no 
relinquishment shall be made of interests in land within a Participating 
Area without the prior approval of the Director.
    14.2  A Working Interest Owner may exercise the right to surrender, 
when such right is vested in it by any non-Federal lease, sublease, or 
operating agreement, provided that each party who will or might acquire 
the Working Interest in such lease by such surrender or by forfeiture is 
bound by the terms of this Agreement, and further provided that no 
relinquishment shall be made of such land within a Participating Area 
without the prior written consent of the non-Federal Lessor.
    14.3  If, as the result of relinquishment, surrender, or forfeiture 
the Working Interests become vested in the fee owner or lessor of the 
Unitized Substances, such owner may:
    (1) Accept those Working Interest rights and obligations subject to 
this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement; or
    (2) Lease the portion of such land as is included in a Participating 
Area established hereunder, subject to this Agreement and the Unit 
Operating Agreement; and provide for the independent operation of any 
part of such land that is not then included within a Participating Area 
established hereunder.
    14.4  If the fee owner or lessor of the Unitized Substances does 
not, (1) accept the Working Interest rights and obligations subject to 
this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement, or (2) lease such lands 
as provided in 14.3 above within six (6) months after the relinquished, 
surrendered, or forfeited Working Interest becomes vested in said fee 
owner or lessor, the Working Interest benefits and obligations accruing 
to such land under this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement shall 
be shared by the owners of the remaining unitized Working Interests in 
accordance with their respective Working Interest ownerships, and such 
owners of Working Interests shall compensate the fee owner or lessor of 
Unitized Substances in such lands by paying sums equal to the rentals, 
minimum royalties, and royalties applicable to such lands under the 
lease or leases in effect when the Working Interests were relinquished, 
surrendered, or forfeited.
    14.5  Subject to the provisions of 14.4 above, an appropriate 
accounting and settlement shall be made for all benefits accruing to or 
payments and expenditures made or incurred on behalf of any surrendered 
or forfeited Working Interest subsequent to the date of surrender or 
forfeiture, and payment of any moneys found to be owing by such an 
accounting shall be made as between the parties within thirty (30) days.
    14.6  In the event no Unit Operating Agreement is in existence and a 
mutually acceptable agreement cannot be consummated between the proper 
parties, the authorized officer may prescribe such reasonable and 
equitable conditions of agreement as he deems warranted under the 
circumstances.
    14.7  The exercise of any right vested in a Working Interest Owner 
to reassign such Working Interest to the party from whom obtained shall 
be subject to the same conditions as set forth in this Article XIV in 
regard to the exercise of a right to surrender.

                article xv--rentals and minimum royalties

    15.1  Any unitized lease on non-Federal land containing provisions 
which would terminate such lease unless drilling operations are 
commenced upon the land covered thereby within the time therein 
specified or rentals are paid for the privilege of deferring such 
drilling operations, the rentals required thereby shall, notwithstanding 
any other provisions of this Agreement, be deemed to

[[Page 507]]

accrue as to the portion of the lease not included within a 
Participating Area and become payable during the term thereof as 
extended by this Agreement, and until the required drillings are 
commenced upon the land covered thereby.
    15.2  Rentals are payable on Federal leases on or before the 
anniversary date of each lease year; minimum royalties accrue from the 
anniversary date of each lease year and are payable at the end of the 
lease year.
    15.3  Beginning with the lease year commencing on or after 
__________ and for each lease year thereafter, rental or minimum royalty 
for lands of the United States subject to this Agreement shall be made 
on the following basis:
    (a) An advance annual rental in the amount prescribed in unitized 
Federal leases, in no event creditable against production royalties, 
shall be paid for each acre or fraction thereof which is not within a 
Participating Area.
    (b) A minimum royalty shall be charged at the beginning of each 
lease year (such minimum royalty to be due as of the last day of the 
lease year and payable within thirty (30) days thereafter) of $2 an acre 
or fraction thereof, for all Unitized Acreage within a Participating 
Area as of the beginning of the lease year. If there is production 
during the lease year the deficit, if any, between the actual royalty 
paid and the minimum royalty prescribed herein shall be paid.
    15.4  Rental or minimum royalties due on leases committed hereto 
shall be paid by Working Interest Owners responsible therefor under 
existing contracts, laws, and regulations, or by the Unit Operator.
    15.5  Settlement for royalty interest shall be made by Working 
Interest Owners responsible therefor under existing contracts, laws, and 
regulations, or by the Unit Operator, on or before the last day of each 
month for Unitized Substances produced during the preceding calendar 
month.
    15.6  Royalty due the United States shall be computed as provided in 
the operating regulations and paid in value as to all Unitized 
Substances on the basis of the amounts thereof allocated to unitized 
Federal land as provided herein at the royalty rate or rates specified 
in the respective Federal leases.
    15.7  Nothing herein contained shall operate to relieve the lessees 
of any land from their respective lease obligations for the payment of 
any rental, minimum royalty, or royalty due under their leases.

            article xvi--operations on nonparticipating land

    16.1  Any party hereto owning or controlling the Working Interest in 
any Unitized Land having thereon a regular well location may, with the 
approval of the authorized officer and at such party's sole risk, costs, 
and expense, drill a well to test any formation of deposit for which a 
Participating Area has not been established or to test any formation or 
deposit for which a Participating Area has been established if such 
location is not within said Participating Area, unless within 30 days of 
receipt of notice from said party of his intention to drill the well, 
the Unit Operator elects and commences to drill such a well in like 
manner as other wells are drilled by the Unit Operator under this 
Agreement.
    16.2  If any well drilled by a Working Interest Owner other than the 
Unit Operator proves that the land upon which said well is situated may 
properly be included in a Participating Area, such Participating Area 
shall be established or enlarged as provided in this Agreement and the 
well shall thereafter be operated by the Unit Operator in accordance 
with the terms of this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement.

        article xvii--leases and contracts conformed and extended

    17.1  The terms, conditions, and provisions of all leases, 
subleases, and other contracts relating to exploration, drilling, 
development, or utilization of geothermal resources on lands committed 
to this Agreement, are hereby expressly modified and amended only to the 
extent necessary to make the same conform to the provisions hereof, 
otherwise said leases, subleases, and contracts shall remain in full 
force and effect.
    17.2  The parties hereto consent that the Secretary shall, by his 
approval hereof, modify and amend the Federal leases committed hereto 
and the regulations in respect thereto to the extent necessary to 
conform said leases and regulations to the provisions of this Agreement.
    17.3  The development and/or operation of lands subject to this 
Agreement under the terms hereof shall be deemed full performance of any 
obligations for development and operation with respect to each and every 
separately owned tract subject to this Agreement, regardless of whether 
there is any development of any particular tract of the Unit Area.
    17.4  Drilling and/or producing operations performed hereunder upon 
any tract of Unitized Lands will be accepted and deemed to be performed 
upon and for the benefit of each and every tract of Unitized Land.
    17.5  Suspension of operations and/or production on all Unitized 
Lands pursuant to direction or consent of the Secretary or his duly 
authorized representative shall be deemed to constitute such suspension 
pursuant to such direction or consent as to each and every tract of 
Unitized Land. A suspension of operations and/or production limited to 
specified lands shall be applicable only to such lands.
    17.6  Subject to the provisions of Article XV hereof and 17.10 of 
this Article, each lease, sublease, or contract relating to the

[[Page 508]]

exploration, drilling, development, or utilization of geothermal 
resources of lands other than those of the United States committed to 
this Agreement, is hereby extended beyond any such term so provided 
therein so that it shall be continued for and during the term of this 
Agreement.
    17.7  Subject to the lease renewal and the readjustment provision of 
the Act, any Federal lease committed hereto may, as to the Unitized 
Lands, be continued for the term so provided therein, or as extended by 
law. This subsection shall not operate to extend any lease or portion 
thereof as to lands excluded from the Unit Area by the contraction 
thereof.
    17.8  Each sublease or contract relating to the operations and 
development of Unitized Substances from lands of the United States 
committed to this Agreement shall be continued in force and effect for 
and during the term of the underlying lease.
    17.9  Any Federal lease heretofore or hereafter committed to any 
such unit plan embracing lands that are in part within and in part 
outside of the area covered by any such plan shall be segregated into 
separate leases as to the lands committed and the lands not committed as 
of the effective date of unitization.
    17.10  In the absence of any specific lease provision to the 
contrary, any lease, other than a Federal lease, having only a portion 
of its land committed hereto shall be segregated as to the portion 
committed and the portion not committed, and the provisions of such 
lease shall apply separately to such segregated portions commencing as 
of the effective date hereof. In the event any such lease provides for a 
lump-sum rental payment, such payment shall be prorated between the 
portions so segregated in proportion to the acreage of the respective 
tracts.
    17.11  Upon termination of this Agreement, the leases covered hereby 
may be maintained and continued in force and effect in accordance with 
the terms, provisions, and conditions of the Act, the lease or leases, 
and amendments thereto.

                 article xviii--effective date and term

    18.1  This Agreement shall become effective upon approval by the 
Secretary or his duly authorized representative and shall terminate five 
(5) years from said effective date unless,
    (a) Such date of expiration is extended by the Director, or
    (b) Unitized Substances are produced or utilized in commercial 
quantities in which event this Agreement shall continue for so long as 
Unitized Substances are produced or utilized in commercial quantities, 
or
    (c) This Agreement is terminated prior to the end of said five (5) 
year period as heretofore provided.
    18.2  This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the owners of 
a majority of the Working Interests, on an acreage basis, with the 
approval of the authorized officer. Notice of any such approval shall be 
given by the Unit Operator to all parties hereto.

                        article xix--appearances

    19.1  Unit Operator shall, after notice to other parties affected, 
have the right to appear for and on behalf of any and all interests 
affected hereby before the Department of the Interior, and to appeal 
from decisions, orders or rulings issued under the regulations of said 
Department, or to apply for relief from any of said regulations or in 
any proceedings relative to operations before the Department of the 
Interior or any other legally constituted authority: Provided, however, 
That any interested parties shall also have the right, at its own 
expenses, to be heard in any such proceeding.

                 article xx--no waiver of certain rights

    20.1  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as a 
waiver by any party hereto of the right to assert any legal or 
constitutional right or defense pertaining to the validity or invalidity 
of any law of the State wherein lands subject to this Agreement are 
located, or of the United States, or regulations issued thereunder, in 
any way affecting such party or as a waiver by any such party of any 
right beyond his or its authority to waive.

                     article xxi--unavoidable delay

    21.1  The obligations imposed by this Agreement requiring Unit 
Operator to commence or continue drilling or to produce or utilize 
Unitized Substances from any of the land covered by this Agreement, 
shall be suspended while, but only so long as, Unit Operator, despite 
the exercise of due care and diligence, is prevented from complying with 
such obligations, in whole or in part, by strikes, Acts of God, Federal 
or other applicable law, Federal or other authorized governmental 
agencies, unavoidable accidents, uncontrollable delays in 
transportation, inability to obtain necessary materials in open market, 
or other matters beyond the reasonable control of Unit Operator, whether 
similar to matters herein enumerated or not.
    21.2  No unit obligation which is suspended under this section shall 
become due less than thirty (30) days after it has been determined that 
the suspension is no longer applicable.
    21.3  Determination of creditable ``Unavoidable Delay'' time shall 
be made by the Unit Operator subject to approval of the authorized 
officer.

                article xxii--postponement of obligations

Director, on his own

[[Page 509]]

initiative or upon appropriate justification by Unit Operator, may 
postpone any obligation established by and under this Agreement to 
commence or continue drilling or to operate on or produce Unitized 
Substances from lands covered by this Agreement when in his judgement, 
circumstances warrant such action.

                    article xxiii--nondiscrimination

    23.1  In connection with the performance of work under this 
Agreement, the Operator agrees to comply with all of the provisions of 
section 202 (1) to (7) inclusive, of Executive Order 11246 (30 FR 
12319), as amended by Executive Order 11375 (32 FR 14303), which are 
hereby incorporated by reference in this Agreement.

                       article xxiv--counterparts

    24.1  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts 
no one of which needs to be executed by all parties, or may be ratified 
or consented to by separate instruments in writing specifically 
referring hereto, and shall be binding upon all parties who have 
executed such a counterpart, ratification or consent hereto, with the 
same force and effect as if all such parties had signed the same 
document.

                     article xxv--subsequent joinder

    25.1  If the owner of any substantial interest in geothermal 
resources under a tract within the Unit Area fails or refuses to 
subscribe or consent to this Agreement, the owner of the Working 
Interest in that tract may withdraw said tract from this Agreement by 
written notice delivered to the authorized officer and the Unit Operator 
prior to the approval of this Agreement by the authorized officer.
    25.2  Any geothermal resources interests in lands within the Unit 
Area not committed hereto prior to approval of this Agreement may 
thereafter be committed by the owner or owners thereof subscribing or 
consenting to this Agreement, and, if the interest is a Working 
Interest, by the owner of such interest also subscribing to the Unit 
Operating Agreement.
    25.3  After operations are commenced hereunder, the right of 
subsequent joinder, as provided in this Article XXV, by a working 
Interest Owner is subject to such requirements or approvals, if any, 
pertaining to such joinder, as may be provided for in the Unit Operating 
Agreement. Joinder to the Unit Agreement by a Working Interest Owner, at 
any time, must be accompanied by appropriate joinder to the Unit 
Operating Agreement, if more than one committed Working Interest Owner 
is involved, in order for the interest to be regarded as committed to 
this Unit Agreement.
    25.4  After final approval hereof, joinder by a nonworking interest 
owner must be consented to in writing by the Working Interest Owner 
committed hereto and responsible for the payment of any benefits that 
may accrue hereunder in behalf of such nonworking interest. A nonworking 
interest may not be committed to this Agreement unless the corresponding 
Working Interest is committed hereto.
    25.5  Except as may otherwise herein be provided, subsequent 
joinders to this Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of the 
month following the filing with the authorized officer of duly executed 
counterparts of all or any papers necessary to establish effective 
commitment of any tract to this Agreement unless objection to such 
joinder is duly made within sixty (60) days by the authorized officer.

                article xxvi--covenants run with the land

    26.1  The covenants herein shall be construed to be covenants 
running with the land with respect to the interest of the parties hereto 
and their successors in interest until this Agreement terminates, and 
any grant, transfer, or conveyance, of interest in land or leases 
subject hereto shall be and hereby is conditioned upon the assumption of 
all privileges and obligations hereunder by the grantee, transferee, or 
other successor in interest.
    26.2  No assignment or transfer of any Working Interest or other 
interest subject hereto shall be binding upon Unit Operator until the 
first day of the calendar month after Unit Operator is furnished with 
the original, photostatic, or certified copy of the instrument of 
transfer.

                         article xxvii--notices

    27.1  All notices, demands or statements required hereunder to be 
given or rendered to the parties hereto shall be deemed fully given if 
given in writing and personally delivered to the party or sent by 
postpaid registered or certified mail, addressed to such party or 
parties at their respective addresses set forth in connection with the 
signatures hereto or to the ratification or consent hereof or to such 
other address as any such party may have furnished in writing to party 
sending the notice, demand or statement.

                      article xxviii--loss of title

    28.1  In the event title to any tract of Unitized Land shall fail 
and the true owner cannot be induced to join in this Agreement, such 
tract shall be automatically regarded as not committed hereto and there 
shall be such readjustment of future costs and benefits as may be 
required on account of the loss of such title.
    28.2  In the event of a dispute as to title as to any royalty, 
Working Interest, or other

[[Page 510]]

interests subject hereto, payment or delivery on account thereof may be 
withheld without liability for interest until the dispute is finally 
settled: Provided, That, as to Federal land or leases, no payments of 
funds due the United States shall be withheld, but such funds shall be 
deposited as directed by the authorized officer to be held as unearned 
money pending final settlement of the title dispute, and then applied as 
earned or returned in accordance with such final settlement.

                           article xxix--taxes

    29.1  The Working Interest Owners shall render and pay for their 
accounts and the accounts of the owners of nonworking interests all 
valid taxes on or measured by the Unitized Substances in and under or 
that may be produced, gathered, and sold or utilized from the land 
subject to this Agreement after the effective date hereof.
    29.2  The Working Interest Owners on each tract may charge a proper 
proportion of the taxes paid under 29.1 hereof to the owners of 
nonworking interests in said tract, and may reduce the allocated share 
of each royalty owner for taxes so paid. No taxes shall be charged to 
the United States or the State of ____________ or to any lessor who has 
a contract with his lessee which requires the lessee to pay such taxes.

                    article xxx--relation of parties

    30.1  It is expressly agreed that the relation of the parties hereto 
is that of independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement 
contained, expressed, or implied, nor any operations conducted 
hereunder, shall create or be deemed to have created a partnership or 
association between the parties hereto or any of them.

   article xxxi--special federal lease stipulations and/or conditions

    31.1  Nothing in this Agreement shall modify special lease 
stipulations and/or conditions applicable to lands of the United States. 
No modification of the conditions necessary to protect the lands or 
functions of lands under the jurisdiction of any Federal agency is 
authorized except with prior consent in writing whereby the authorizing 
official specifies the modification permitted.
    In witness whereof, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to 
be executed and have set opposite their respective names the date of

                       Collective Corporate Surety

    Know all men by these presents, That we, ________________ (Name of 
Unit Operator) signing as Principal, for and on behalf of the record 
owners of unitized substances now or hereafter covered by the unit 
agreement for this ________________ (Name of Unit) approved __________, 
(Date) ________________, (Name and address of Surety) as Surety are 
jointly and severally held and firmly bound unto the United States of 
America in the sum of ________________ (Amount of bond) Dollars, lawful 
money of the United States, for the use and benefit of and to be paid to 
the United States and any entryman or patentee of any portion of the 
unitized land, heretofore entered or patented with the reservation of 
the geothermal resources deposits to the United States, for which 
payment well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves, and each of us, 
and each of our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and 
assigns by these presents.
    The condition of the foregoing obligation is such that, whereas the 
Secretary on ____________ (Date) approved under the provisions of the 
Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, a unit agreement for the development and 
operation of the ________________ (Name of Unit and State); and
    Whereas said Principal and record owners of unitized substances, 
pursuant to said unit agreement, have entered into certain covenants and 
agreements as set forth therein, under which operations are to be 
conducted; and
    Whereas said Principal as Unit Operator has assumed the duties and 
obligations of the respective owners of unitized substances as defined 
in said unit agreement; and
    Whereas said Principal and surety agree to remain bound in the full 
amount of the bond for failure to comply with the terms of the unit 
agreement, and the payment of rentals, minimum royalties, and royalties 
due under the Federal leases committed to said unit agreement; and
    Whereas the Surety hereby waives any right of notice of and agrees 
that this bond may remain in force and effect notwithstanding:
    (a) Any additions to or change in the ownership of the unitized 
substances herein described.
    (b) Any suspension of the drilling or producing requirements or 
waiver, suspension or reduction of rental or minimum royalty payments or 
reduction of royalties pursuant to applicable laws or regulations 
thereunder; and
    Whereas said Principal and Surety agree to the payment of 
compensatory royalty under the regulations of the Interior Department in

    Whereas nothing herein contained shall preclude the United States 
from requiring an additional bond at any time when deemed necessary:
    Now, therefore, if the said Principal shall faithfully comply with 
all of the provisions of the above-identified unit agreement and with 
the terms of the leases committed thereto, then the above obligation is 
to be of no effect; otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.

significant portion of their income, if any, from such farming and 
ranching operations; and
    (3) Have met the conditions of paragraphs (gg) (1) and (2) of this 
section for a period of at least 3 years, except for persons who gave

the surface of lands in connection with a surface coal mine or surface 
operations and surface impacts incident to an underground mine, as 
defined in section 701(28) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation

is first produced on or after August 4, 1976, from a lease that has not 
been made subject to the diligence provisions of part 3480 of this title 
on the date of first production.
    (3) Controlled by or under common control with, based on the 
instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, means:
    (i) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;
    (ii) Ownership of 20 through 50 percent creates a presumption of 
control; and
    (iii) Ownership of less than 20 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol.
    (4) Entity means any person, association, or corporation, or any 
subsidiary, affiliate, or persons controlled by or under common control 
with such person, association, or corporation.
    (5) Holds and has held means the cumulative amount of time that an 
entity holds any working interest in a lease on or after August 4, 1976.

includes both record title interests and arrangements whereby an entity 
has the ability to determine when, and under what circumstances, the 
rights granted by the lease to develop coal will be exercised.
    (6) Producing means actually severing coal. A lease is also 
considered producing when:
    (i) The operator/leasee is processing or loading severed coal, or

licensee may relinquish an exploration license for all or any portion of 
the lands covered by it. A relinquishment shall be filed in the Bureau 
of Land Management State Office in which the original application was 
filed. See 43 CFR subpart 1821.
    (e) An exploration license may be cancelled by the authorized 
officer for noncompliance with its terms and conditions, the exploration 
plan, or the regulations, after the authorized officer has notified the 
licensee of the violation(s) in writing and the licensee has failed to 
correct the violation(s) within the period prescribed in the notice.
    (f) Should a licensee request a modification to the exploration 
plan, the authorized officer may approve the modification if geologic or 
other conditions warrant.
    (g) When unforeseen conditions that could result in substantial 
disturbance to the natural land surface or damage to the environment or 
improvements are encountered, or when geologic or other physical 
conditions warrant a modification in the approved exploration plan:
    (1) The authorized officer may adjust the terms and conditions of 
the exploration license, or
    (2) The authorized officer may direct adjustment in or approve 
modification of the exploration plan. If the licensee does not concur in 
the adjustment of the terms and conditions of the exploration license 
and exploration plan, he/she may, under 43 CFR part 4, appeal the 
decision modifying the license, or he/she may relinquish the exploration 
license.
    (h) Exploration licenses shall not be extended. Exploration 
operations may not be conducted after the exploration license has 
expired. The licensee may apply for a new exploration license as 
described in this section. A new exploration license may be issued 
simultaneously with the termination of the existing exploration license.

Sec. 3420.1-2  Call for coal resource and other resource information.

    (a) Prior to or as part of the initiation or update of a land use 
plan or land use analysis, a Call for Coal and Other Resource 
Information shall be made to formally solicit indications of interest 
and information on coal resource development potential and on other 
resources which may be affected by coal development for lands in the 
planning unit. Industry, State and local governments and the general 
public may submit information on lands that should be considered for 
coal leasing, including statements describing why the lands should be 
considered for leasing.
    (b) Proprietary data marked as confidential may be submitted in 
response to the Call for Coal and Other Resource Information, however, 
all such proprietary data shall be submitted to the authorized officer 
only. Data marked as confidential shall be treated in accordance with 
the laws and regulations governing the confidentiality of such 
information.
    (c) The Call for Coal and Other Resource Information may be combined 
with the notice of intent to conduct land use planning published in 
accordance with Sec. 1601.3(g) of this title or with the issue 
identification process in accordance with part 1600 of this title. If 
the agency conducting land use planning is other than the Bureau of Land 
Management, that agency may combine the Call for Coal and Other Resource 
Information with its land use planning process at the appropriate step.

Sec. 3420.1-3  Special leasing opportunities.

    (a) The Secretary shall, under the procedures established in this 
subpart, including Sec. 3420.3 of this title, reserve and offer a 
reasonable number of lease tracts through competitive lease sales open 
only to a restricted class of potential bidders. Except for the 
limitation on bidding contained in paragraph (b) of this section, all 
requirements in this subpart apply equally to special leasing 
opportunities, including the requirement that coal be leased at its fair 
market value.
    (b) Special leasing opportunities shall be provided for two classes 
of potential lessees:
    (1) Public bodies. (i) Only public bodies with a definite plan for 
producing energy for their own use or for their members or customers 
shall bid for leases designated as special leasing opportunities for 
public bodies. To qualify as a definite plan, a plan must clearly state 
the intended use of the coal and have been approved by the governing 
board of the public body submitting the plan. In the event an electric 
generating station which will produce energy for the public body is 
either jointly owned with or participated in by others, or both, the 
definite plan shall assure that the public body's proportionate part of 
the energy produced is utilized pursuant to this paragraph.
    (ii) Each public body shall submit the information specified in 
Sec. 3472.2-5(a) (1) and (2) of this title as part of its expression of 
leasing interest or upon submission of a bid if no expression of leasing 
interest is made. The information specified in Sec. 3472.2-5(a) (3) and 
(4) of this title shall be submitted within 60 days after submission of 
an expression of leasing interest or lease bid if no expression of 
leasing interest is made.
    (iii) The Secretary may designate, during the process of preparing a 
regional lease sale schedule, certain coal lease tracts for special 
leasing opportunities for public bodies only if a public body has 
submitted an expression of leasing interest under Sec. 3420.3-2, 
requesting that the procedures of this section apply.

[[Page 526]]

    (iv) Leases issued under this section to public bodies may be 
assigned only to other public bodies, or to a person who will mine the 
coal on behalf of and for the use of the public body, or to a person for 
the limited purpose of creating a security interest in favor of a lender 
who agrees to be obligated to mine the coal on behalf of the public 
body.
    (2) Small businesses. (i) When necessary to comply with the 
requirements of the Small Business Act, the Secretary shall designate a 
reasonable number of tracts for special leasing opportunities for 
businesses qualifying under 13 CFR part 121.
    (ii) Leases issued under this section may be assigned only to other 
small businesses qualifying under 13 CFR part 121.
    (c) Potential lessees qualifying for special leasing opportunities 
may participate in competitive lease sales not designated as special 
leasing opportunities and shall not be required to submit the evidence 
and information required specifically for a special leasing opportunity 
to participate.

Sec. 3420.1-4  General requirements for land use planning.

    (a) The Secretary may not hold a lease sale under this part unless 
the lands containing the coal deposits are included in a comprehensive 
land use plan or land use analysis. The land use plan or land use 
analysis will be conducted with public notice and opportunity for 
participation at the points specified in Sec. 1610.2(f) of this title. 
The sale must be compatible with, and subject to, any relevant 
stipulations, guidelines, and standards set out in that plan or 
analysis.
    (b)(1) The Bureau of Land Management shall prepare comprehensive 
land use plans and land use analyses for lands it administers in 
conformance with 43 CFR part 1600.
    (2) The Department of Agriculture or any other Federal agency with 
surface management authority over lands subject to leasing shall prepare 
comprehensive land use plans or land use analyses for lands it 
administers.
    (3) The Secretary may lease in any area where it is found either 
that there is no Federal interest in the surface or that the coal 
deposits in an area are insufficient to justify the costs of a Federal 
land use plan upon completion of a land use analysis in accordance with 
this section and 43 CFR part 1600.
    (c) In an area of Federal lands not covered by a completed 
comprehensive land use plan or scheduled for comprehensive land use 
planning, a member of the public may request the appropriate Bureau of 
Land Management State Office to prepare a land use analysis for coal 
related uses of the land as provided for in this group.
    (d) A comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis shall contain 
an estimate of the amount of coal recoverable by either surface or 
underground mining operations or both.
    (e) The major land use planning decision concerning the coal 
resource shall be the identification of areas acceptable for further 
consideration for leasing which shall be identified by the screening 
procedures listed below:
    (1) Only those areas that have development potential may be 
identified as acceptable for further consideration for leasing. The 
Bureau of Land Management shall estimate coal development potential for 
the surface management agency. Coal companies, State and local 
governments and the general public are encouraged to submit information 
to the Bureau of Land Management at any time in connection with such 
development potential determinations. Coal companies, State and local 
governments and members of the general public may also submit 
nonconfidential coal geology and economic data during the inventory 
phase of planning to the surface management agency conducting the land 
use planning. Where such information is determined to indicate 
development potential for an area, the area may be included in the land 
use planning for evaluation for coal leasing.
    (2) The Bureau of Land Management or the surface managing agency 
conducting the land use planning shall, using the unsuitability criteria 
and procedures set out in subpart 3461 of this title, review Federal 
lands to assess where there are areas unsuitable

[[Page 527]]

for all or certain stipulated methods of mining. The unsuitability 
assessment shall be consistent with any decision of the Office of 
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to designate lands unsuitable 
or to terminate a designation in response to a petition.
    (3) Multiple land use decisions shall be made which may eliminate 
additional coal deposits from further consideration for leasing to 
protect other resource values and land uses that are locally, regionally 
or nationally important or unique and that are not included in the 
unsuitability criteria discussed in paragraph (e) of this section. Such 
values and uses include, but are not limited to, those identified in 
section 522(a)(3) of the Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act of 
1977 and as defined in 30 CFR 762.5. In making these multiple use 
decisions, the Bureau of Land Management or the surface management 
agency conducting the land use planning shall place particular emphasis 
on protecting the following: Air and water quality; wetlands, riparian 
areas and sole-source aquifers; the Federal lands which, if leased, 
would adversely impact units of the National Park System, the National 
Wildlife Refuge System, the National System of Trails, and the National 
Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
    (4)(i) While preparing a comprehensive land use plan or land use 
analysis, the Bureau of Land Management shall consult with all surface 
owners who meet the criteria in paragraphs (gg) (1) and (2) of 
Sec. 3400.0-5 of this title, and whose lands overlie coal deposits, to 
determine preference for or against mining by other than underground 
mining techniques.
    (ii) For the purposes of this paragraph, any surface owner who has 
previously granted written consent to any party to mine by other than 
underground mining techniques shall be deemed to have expressed a 
preference in favor of mining. Where a significant number of surface 
owners in an area have expressed a preference against mining those 
deposits by other than underground mining techniques, that area shall be 
considered acceptable for further consideration only for development by 
underground mining techniques. In addition, the area may be considered 
acceptable for further consideration for leasing for development by 
other than underground techniques if there are no acceptable alternative 
areas available to meet the regional leasing level.
    (iii) An area eliminated from further consideration by this 
subsection may be considered acceptable for further consideration for 
leasing for mining by other than underground mining techniques if:
    (A) The number of surface owners who have expressed their preference 
against mining by other than underground techniques is reduced below a 
significant number because such surface owners have given written 
consent for such mining or have transferred ownership to unqualified 
surface owners; and
    (B) The land use plan is amended accordingly.
    (f) In its review of cumulative impacts of coal development, the 
regional coal team shall consider any threshold analysis performed 
during land-use planning as required by Sec. 1610.4-4 of this title and 
shall apply this analysis, where appropriate, to the region as a whole.

Sec. 3420.1-5  Hearing requirements.

    After public notice, the Bureau of Land Management or other surface 
management agency shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed 
comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis if it involves the 
potential for coal leasing before it is adopted if such a hearing is 
requested by any person who is or may be adversely affected by the 
adoption of the plan. A hearing conducted under part 1600 of this title 
of this chapter shall fulfill this requirement.

plan or land use analysis being prepared by the Bureau of Land 
Management, or where the Bureau of Land Management manages lands on 
which coal development may impact land units of other Federal agencies, 
the Bureau of Land Management shall consult with the other agency to 
jointly determine the acceptability for further consideration for 
leasing of the potentially impacted lands the other agency administers 
or lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management that may impact lands 
of another agency.

Sec. 3420.1-7  Consultation with states and Indian tribes.

    Before adopting a comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis 
that makes an assessment of lands acceptable for further consideration 
for leasing, the Bureau of Land Management or other surface management 
agency shall consult with the state Governor and the state agency 
charged with the responsibility for maintaining the state's 
unsuitability program (43 CFR 3461.4-1). Where a tribal government 
administers areas within or near the boundaries of a comprehensive land 
use plan or land use analysis being prepared by the Bureau of Land 
Management, the Bureau shall consult with the tribal government.

plan or land use analysis. Any lands identified as acceptable may be 
further considered for leasing under Sec. 3420.3 of this title.
    (b) Activity planning shall begin with a regional coal team meeting 
to review market analyses and land-use planning summaries. The market 
analyses and land-use planning summaries shall be avaiable at least 45 
days prior to such meeting.

Sec. 3420.2  Regional leasing levels.

    This section sets out the process to be followed in establishing 
regional leasing levels. Regional leasing levels shall be established by 
the Secretary. The Secretary shall particularly rely upon the advice and 
assistance of affected State Governors in ensuring that leasing levels 
have properly considered social, environmental and economic impacts and 
constraints.
    (a) The regional coal teams shall be the forum through which initial 
leasing level recommendations are transmitted to the Secretary. Initial 
leasing level recommendations shall be developed as follows:
    (1) The appropriate Bureau of Land Management State Director on the 
regional coal team, as designated by the regional coal team chairperson, 
shall prepare a broadly stated range of initial leasing levels for the 
region. This range of initial leasing levels must be based on 
information available to the State Director including: land use planning 
data; the results of the call for coal resource information held under 
Sec. 3420.1-2 of this subpart; the results of the call for expressions 
of leasing interest held under Sec. 3420.3-2 of this subpart; and other 
considerations. The State Director will consider comments received from 
the public in writing and at hearings, and input and advice from the 
Governors of the affected States regarding assumptions, data, and other 
factors pertinent to the region;
    (2) This initial range of leasing levels shall be made available to 
the other members of the regional coal team for review and comment. This 
review shall be designed to ensure consideration of relevant social, 
environmental and economic factors of which the Secretary should be 
aware in setting leasing levels;
    (3) Governors of affected States shall be requested by the regional 
coal team chairperson to provide comments and

[[Page 529]]

recommendations concerning the leasing levels through the Governor's 
representatives on the regional coal team. Governors may use any 
methodologies, systems or procedures available to determine their 
recommendations;
    (4) The regional coal team chairperson shall call upon the team 
members to present their findings and recommendations on the initial 
leasing levels. The chairperson shall refer the members' recommendations 
to an appropriate Bureau State Director serving on the team. The State 
Director shall: (i) Ensure the recommendations are in an appropriate 
format; (ii) add any additional information from the Bureau of Land 
Management data sources which may be available and pertinent to leasing 
level decision-making; (iii) address any questions and clarify any 
issues raised by the members' recommendations; and (iv) outline any 
additional alternative leasing levels. The regional coal team shall 
consider the State Director's review and shall transmit to the Secretary 
alternative leasing levels and a preferred leasing level presented in 
ranges of tons to be offered for lease. The team also must transmit to 
the Secretary, without change, all comments and recommendations of the 
Governor and the public.
    (5) The regional coal team transmittal to the Secretary shall be 
made through the Director, who may provide additional data and 
recommendations, but only as separate documentation.
    (b) The Secretary, upon receipt of the regional coal team 
transmittal, shall initiate consultations, in writing, with the 
Secretary of Energy, the Attorney General and affected Indian tribes. 
The Secretary shall establish leasing levels by region for the purposes 
of approximating the amount of coal to be offered through proposed lease 
sale schedules after consideration of potential policy conflicts or 
problems concerning, but not limited to:
    (1) The Department's responsibility for the management, regulation 
and conservation of natural resources; and
    (2) The capabilities of Federal lands and Federal coal resources to 
meet the proposed leasing levels, and the contributions State and 
privately owned coal lands can make.
    (c) Leasing levels shall be based on the following factors:
    (1) Advice from Governors of affected States as expressed through 
the regional coal team;
    (2) The potential economic, social and environmental effects of coal 
leasing on the region, including recommendations from affected Indian 
tribes;
    (3) Expressed industry interest in coal development in the region 
and indications of the demand for coal reserves;
    (4) Expressed interests for special opportunity sales;
    (5) Expected production from existing Federal coal leases and non-
Federal coal holdings;
    (6) The level of competition within the region and recommendations 
from the Department of Justice;
    (7) U.S. coal production goals and projections of future demand for 
Federal coal;
    (8) Consideration of national energy needs;
    (9) Comments received from the public in writing and at public 
hearings; and
    (10) Other pertinent factors.
    (d) Prior to determining a final leasing level, the Secretary shall 
consult with the Governors of affected States to obtain final comments 
and recommendations. The Secretary shall then establish a final leasing 
level for the proposed coal lease sale.
    (e) The levels shall be established for each coal production region 
where activity planning is conducted under the provisions of Sec. 3420.3 
of this subpart. The levels shall be developed separately for each 
region, but levels for 2 or more regions may be developed at the same 
time as the Secretary deems appropriate. Leasing levels may be stated in 
terms of a range of values.
    (f) The leasing levels established for any given region shall become 
the basis for the proposed action for study in the regional coal lease 
sale environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to Sec. 3420.3-4 
of this subpart. The Secretary's final decision on which coal lease 
tracts, if any, within a region to offer for sale, and the schedule for 
the offering of such tracts shall be based on

[[Page 530]]

all information at the Secretary's disposal at the time of the decision.

    (a) This section describes the process for identifying, ranking, 
analyzing, selecting, and scheduling lease tracts after land use 
planning has been completed. This process constitutes the ``activity 
planning'' aspect of the coal management program. Activity planning may 
occur where areas acceptable for further consideration for leasing have 
been identified by land use planning completed consistent with the 
provisions of Sec. 3420.1-4 of this subpart.
    (b) Split estate land otherwise acceptable for further consideration 
for leasing shall, upon verfication of a refusal to consent received 
from a qualified surface owner under Sec. 3427.2 of this title, be 
deleted from further activity planning.
    (c) Each regional coal team established under Sec. 3400.4 of this 
title shall:
    (1) Guide tract delineation and preparation of site specific 
analyses of delineated tracts;
    (2) Rank delineated tracts, select tracts that meet the leasing 
level established by the Secretary, and identify all alternative tract 
combinations to be analyzed in the regional lease sale environmental 
impact statement;
    (3) Guide the preparation of the regional lease sale environmental 
impact statement; and
    (4) Recommend a regional coal lease sale schedule to the Director.
    (d) Public notice and opportunity for participation in activity 
planning must be appropriate to the area and the people involved. The 
Bureau of Land Management will make available a calendar listing of the 
points in the planning process at which the public may participate, 
including:
    (1) The regional coal team meeting to recommend initial leasing 
levels (see Sec. 3420.2(a)(4));
    (2) The regional coal team meeting for tract ranking (see 
Sec. 3420.3-4(a));
    (3) Publication of the regional coal lease sale environmental impact 
statement (see Sec. 3420.3-4(c)); and

Sec. 3420.3-3  Preliminary tract delineation.

    (a) Tracts may be delineated in any areas acceptable for further 
consideration for leasing whether or not expressions of leasing interest 
have been received for those areas.
    (b) When public bodies have submitted expressions of leasing 
interest, tracts shall be delineated when and where technically feasible 
for public body special leasing opportunities in accordance with 
Sec. 3420.1-3 of this subpart.
    (c) In cooperation with the Small Business Administration, tracts 
may be delineated when and where technically feasible for small business 
special leasing opportunities in accordance with Sec. 3420.1-3 of this 
title.
    (d) Other tracts to be used in a lease or fee exchange (43 CFR 
subparts 3435 and 3436) may be delineated.

[[Page 531]]

    (e) A tract profile shall be formulated for each tract. The profile 
shall include:
    (1) A summary of the information used in the delineation of the 
tract, and
    (2) A site-specific environmental inventory and preliminary 
analysis.

<R05>
Sec. 3420.3-4  Regional tract ranking, selection, environmental analysis and scheduling.

    (a)(1) Upon completion of tract delineation and preparation of the 
tract profiles, the regional coal team shall rank the tracts in classes 
of high, medium or low desirability for coal leasing. Three major 
categories of consideration shall be used in tract ranking: coal 
economics; impacts on the natural environment; and socioeconomic 
impacts. The subfactors the regional coal team will consider under each 
category are those the regional coal team determines are appropriate for 
that region. The regional coal team will make its determination after 
publishing notice in the Federal Register that the public has 30 days to 
comment on the subfactors. The regional coal team will then consider any 
comments it receives in determining the subfactors. BLM will publish the 
subfactors in the regional lease sale environmental impact statement 
required by this section. Tracts may also be ranked for other coal 
management purposes, such as emergency leasing under subpart 3425 of 
this title or exchanges under subparts 3435 and 3436 of this title.
    (2) The regional coal team may modify tract boundaries being ranked, 
if appropriate, to reflect additional information.
    (3) In ranking tracts, the regional coal team shall solicit the 
recommendations of the Federal and State agencies having appropriate 
expertise, including the Geological Survey, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the Federal surface management agency, if other than the 
Bureau of Land Management.
    (4) Where Federal leasing decisions are likely to have impacts on 
lands held in trust for an Indian tribe, the regional coal team shall 
solicit the recommendations of the tribe and the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs.
    (5) A statement that descriptions of the tracts to be ranked are 
available shall be included with the notice announcing any regional coal 
team meeting at which those tracts shall be ranked. BLM will publish the 
notice no later than 45 days before the meeting. The notice will list 
potential topics for discussion. An opportunity for public comment on 
the tract rankings shall be provided during the regional coal team 
meeting.
    (b)(1) Upon completion of tract ranking, the regional coal team 
shall select at least 1 combination of tracts that approximates the 
regional leasing level. One combination of tracts within the regional 
leasing level shall be identified as the proposed action for study in 
the environmental impact statement. The team shall also select tract 
combinations representing alternative leasing levels. The team may 
identify alternative combinations of tracts within a leasing level.
    (2) The regional coal team may adjust the tract ranking and select 
tracts to reflect considerations including:
    (i) The compatibility of coal quality, coal type and market needs;
    (ii) Environmental and socioeconomic impacts;
    (iii) The compatibility of reserve size and demand distribution for 
tracts;
    (iv) Public opinion;
    (v) Avoidance of future emergency lease situations; and
    (vi) Special leasing opportunity requirements.
    (c) After tract ranking and selection, a regional lease sale 
environmental impact statement on all tract combinations selected by the 
regional coal team for the various leasing levels and all other 
reasonable alternative leasing levels shall be prepared by the Bureau of 
Land Management in accordance with the provisions of the National 
Environmental Policy Act. The statement shall consider both:
    (1) The site-specific potential environmental impacts of each tract 
being considered for lease sale; and
    (2) The intraregional cumulative environmental impacts of the 
proposed leasing action and alternatives, and

[[Page 532]]

other coal and noncoal development activities.
    (d) The results of the ranking and selection process, including the 
tract rankings, the tract selected and the list of ranking criteria used 
shall be published in the regional lease sale environmental impact 
statement required by paragraph (c) of this section. Detailed 
information on each of the tracts shall be available for inspection in 
the Bureau of Land Management State offices that have jurisdiction over 
lands within the coal production region (See 43 CFR subpart 1821). BLM 
will publish a notice in the Federal Register of the 60-day comment 
period and the public hearing on the draft environmental impact 
statement. BLM also will publish the notice at least once per week for 
two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 
of the sale.
    (e) Public hearings shall be held in the region following the 
release of the draft regional lease sale environmental impact statement 
to announce and discuss the results of the ranking and selection process 
and the potential impacts, including proposed mitigation measures.
    (f) When the comment period on the draft environmental impact 
statement closes, the regional coal team will analyze the comments and 
make any appropriate revisions in the tract ranking and selection. The 
final regional lease sale environmental impact statement will reflect 
such revisions and will include all comments received.
    (g) When BLM completes and releases the final regional lease sale 
environmental impact statement, the regional coal team will meet and 
recommend specific tracts for lease sale and a lease sale schedule. The 
regional coal team will provide notice in the Federal Register of the 
date and location at least 45 days before its meeting. The chairperson 
shall submit the recommendations to the Director. Any disagreement as to 
the recommendation among the team shall be documented and submitted by 
the chairperson along with the team recommendation. The Director shall 
submit the final regional environmental impact statement to the 
Secretary for his/her decision, together with the recommendation of the 
team and any recommendations the Director may wish to make.
    (h) The tract ranking, selection and scheduling process and the 
regional lease sale environmental impact statement shall be revised or 
repeated as needed. The Secretary may, in consultation with the 
Governor(s) of the affected State(s) and surface management agencies, 
initiate or postpone the process to respond to considerations such as 
major land use planning updates, new tract delineations or increases or 
decreases in the leasing levels.

Sec. 3420.4-2  Consultation with surface management agencies.

    (a) The Secretary, for any proposed lease tract containing lands the 
surface of which is under the jurisdiction of any agency other than the 
Department, shall request that the agency: (1) Consent, if it has not 
already done so, to the issuance of the lease (43 CFR 3400.3-1), and (2) 
if it consents, prescribe the terms and conditions the Secretary will 
impose in any lease which the head of the agency requires for the use 
and protection of the nonmineral interests in those lands.
    (b) The Secretary may prescribe additional terms and conditions that 
are consistent with the terms proposed by the surface management agency 
to protect the interest of the United States and to safeguard the public

Sec. 3420.4-3  Consultation with Governors.

    (a) The Secretary shall consult the Governor of the state in which 
any tract proposed for sale is located. The Secretary shall give the 
Governor 30 days to comment before adopting a regional lease sale 
schedule or, for lease applications, before publishing a notice of sale 
for any tract within the State.
    (b) When a tract proposed for lease sale within the boundaries of a 
National Forest would, if leased, be mined by surface mining methods, 
the Governor of the state in which the land to be leased is located 
shall be so notified by the Secretary. If the Governor fails to object 
to the lease sale proposal in 60 days, the Secretary may publish a 
notice of sale, including that tract. If, within the 60 day period, the 
Governor, in writing, objects to the lease sale proposal, the Secretary 
may not publish a notice of sale for that tract. Publication of the 
notice of sale shall be held in abeyance for 6 months from the date that 
the Governor objects. The Governor may, during this six-month period, 
submit a written statement of reasons why the tract should not be 
proposed for lease sale, and the Secretary shall, on the basis of this 
statement, reconsider the lease sale proposal.
    (c) Before determining whether to conduct a lease sale, the 
Secretary shall seek the recommendation of the Governor of the State(s) 
in which the lands proposed to be offered for lease are located as to 
whether or not to lease such lands and what alternative actions are 
available and what special conditions could be added to the proposed 
lease(s) to mitigate impacts. The Secretary shall accept the 
recommendations of the Governor(s) if he determines that they provide 
for a reasonable balance between the national interest and the State's 
interests. The Secretary shall communicate to the Governor(s) in writing 
and publish in the Federal Register the reasons for his determination to 
accept or reject such Governor's recommendations.

form or in a format approved by the Attorney General information 
relating to the bidder's coal holdings to the authorized officer for 
transmittal to the Attorney General. Upon receipt of the information, 
the authorized officer shall notify the Attorney General of the proposed 
lease issuance, the name of the successful bidder and terms of the 
proposed lease sale and shall transmit the bidder's statement on coal 
holdings. A description of the information required by the Attorney 
General and the form or format for submission of the information may be 
obtained from the authorized officer.
    (b) Where a successful bidder has previously submitted the currently 
required information, a reference to the date of submission and to the 
serial number of the record in which it is filed, together with a 
statement of any and all changes in holdings since the date of the 
previous submission, shall be accepted.
    (c) The authorized officer shall not issue a lease until 30 days 
after the Attorney General receives the notice and statement of the 
successful bidder's coal holdings, or the Attorney General notifies the 
Director that lease issuance would not create or maintain a situation 
inconsistent with the antitrust laws, whichever comes first. The 
Attorney General shall inform the successful bidders and simultaneously, 
the authorized officer, if the successful bidder's statement of coal 
holdings is incomplete or inadequate, and shall specify what information 
is required for the Attorney General to complete his review. The 30 day 
period shall stop running on the date of such notification and not 
resume running until the Attorney General receives the supplemental 
information.
    (d) The authorized officer shall not issue the lease to the 
successful bidder, if, during the 30 day period, the Attorney General 
notifies the Director that the lease issuance would create or maintain a 
situation inconsistent with antitrust law, except after complying with 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (e) If the Attorney General notifies the Director that a lease 
should not be issued, the authorized officer may:
    (1) Reject all bids or many notify the Attorney General in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section that issuance of the 
proposed lease to the next qualified high bidder is under consideration; 
or
    (2) Issue the lease if, after a public hearing is conducted on the 
record in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, the 
authorized officer determines that:
    (i) Issuance of the lease is necessary to carry out the purposes of 
the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976;
    (ii) Issuance of the lease is consistent with the public interest; 
and
    (iii) There are no reasonable alternatives to the issuance of the 
lease consistent with the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976, 
the anti-trust laws, and the public interest.
    (f) If the Attorney General does not reply in writing to the 
notification in paragraph (a) of this section within 30 days, the 
authorized officer may issue a lease without waiting for the advice of 
the Attorney General.
    (g) Information submitted to the authorized officer to comply with 
this section shall be treated as confidential and proprietary data if 
marked ``confidential'' by the reporting company. Confidential 
information shall be submitted to the authorized officer in a

[[Page 537]]

sealed envelope and shall be transmitted in that form to the Attorney 
General.

and the Attorney General has not objected to lease issuance or the 
procedures in Sec. 3422.3-4(e)(2) of this title have been completed, the 
authorized officer shall send 4 copies of the lease form to the

these forms and shall: pay the balance of the bonus bid, if required; 
pay the first year's rental; pay the proportionate share of the cost of 
publishing the notice of sale; and file a lease bond. Upon receipt of 
the above, the authorized officer shall execute the lease.

provisions of Sec. 3472.2-4 of this title shall apply.
    (c) At least half of the acreage offered for competitive lease in 
any 1 year shall be offered on a deferred bonus payment basis. In a 
deferred bonus payment, the lessee shall pay the bonus in 5 equal 
installments; the first installment shall be submitted with the bid. The 
balance shall be paid in equal annual installments due and payable on 
the next 4 anniversary dates of the lease. If a lease is relinquished or 
otherwise cancelled or terminated, the unpaid remainder of the bid shall 
be immediately payable to the United States.
    (d) If the successful bidder fails to comply with any requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section or of Sec. 3422.3-4 of this title, the 
deposit on the successful bid shall be forfeited to the United States.
    (e) If the lease cannot be awarded for reasons determined by the 
authorized officer to be beyond the control of the successful bidder, 
the deposit submitted with the bid shall be refunded.

    (i) The Federal coal is needed within 3 years (A) to maintain an 
existing mining operation at its current average annual level of 
production on the date of application or (B) to supply coal for 
contracts signed prior to July 19, 1979, as substantiated by a complete 
copy of the supply or delivery contract, or both; or
    (ii) If the coal deposits are not leased, they would be bypassed in 
the reasonably foreseeable future, and if leased, some portion of the 
tract applied for would be used within 3 years; and
    (2) That the need for the coal deposits shall have resulted from 
circumstances that were either beyond the control of the applicant or 
could not have been reasonably foreseen and planned for in time to allow 
for consideration of leasing the tract under the provisions of 
Sec. 3420.3 of this title.
    (b) The extent of any lease issued under this section shall not 
exceed 8 years of recoverable reserves at the rate of production under

                   Subpart 3427--Split Estate Leasing


<R05>
Sec. 3427.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to set out the protection that shall 
be afforded qualified surface owners of split estate lands (43 CFR 
3400.0-5) and the requirements for submission of evidence of written 
surface owner consent from qualified surface owners of split estate 
lands.

[47 FR 33142, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3427.0-3  Authority.

    (a) These regulations are issued under the authority of the statutes 
cited in Sec. 3400.0-3 of this title.
    (b) These regulations primarily implement section 714 of the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1304), as 
construed in Solicitor's Opinion M-36909, 86 I.D. 28 (1979).


<R05>
Sec. 3427.0-7  Scope.

    The surface owner consent provisions of the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act do not apply:
    (a) To preference right lease applications; and
    (b) If the split estate coal is to be mined by underground mining 
techniques (43 CFR 3500.0-5).


<R05>
Sec. 3427.1  Deposits subject to consent.

    On split estate lands (43 CFR 3400.0-5(kk)) where the surface is 
owned by a qualified surface owner, coal deposits that will be mined by 
other than underground mining techniques shall not be included in a 
lease sale without evidence of written consent from the qualified 
surface owner (43 CFR 3400.0-5(gg)) allowing entry and commencement of 
surface mining operations.

[47 FR 33142, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3427.2  Procedures.

    (a)(1) Each written consent or evidence of written consent shall be 
filed with the appropriate Bureau of Land Management State office (43 
CFR subpart 1821). For lands offered for lease sale pursuant to subpart 
3420 of this title, consents or written evidence thereof shall be filed 
on or before a date prior to the lease sale specified in a notice 
published in the Federal Register. For lands offered for lease sale 
pursuant to subpart 3425 of this title, consents or written evidence 
thereof shall be filed prior to the posting of the lease sale notice.
    (2) Statement of refusal to consent shall be filed with the 
appropriate Bureau of Land Management State Office, but such statement 
shall be accepted for filing only during activity planning.
    (b) Written consent, evidence of written consent, or statement of 
refusal to consent may be filed by any private person or persons with a 
potential interest in the lease sale of split estate lands.

[[Page 541]]

    (c) Such filing shall, at a minimum, contain the present legal 
address of the qualified surface owner, and the name, ownership, 
interest, if any, and legal address of the party making the filing, and 
if it is a written consent or evidence thereof, a copy of the written 
consent or evidence thereof.
    (d) The authorized officer shall verify that the written consent or 
evidence of such consent meets all of the following requirements, and 
that the statement of refusal to consent meets the requirements of 
paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section:
    (1) The right to enter and commence mining is transferable to 
whoever makes the successful bid in a lease sale for a tract which 
includes the lands to which the consent applies. A written consent shall 
be considered transferable only if it provides that after the lease sale 
for the tract to which the consent applies:
    (i) The successful bidder shall assume all rights and obligations of 
the holder of the consent, including the obligation to make all payments 
to the grantor of the consent and to reimburse the holder of the consent 
for all money previously paid to the grantor under the consent contract; 
and
    (ii) Neither the holder nor the grantor of the consent has any right 
under the consent contract to prevent the successful bidder from 
assuming the rights and obligations of the holder of the consent by 
imposing additional costs or conditions or otherwise;
    (2) The named surface owner is a qualified surface owner as defined 
in Sec. 3400.0-5(gg) of this title; and
    (3) The title for all split estate lands described in the filing is 
held by the named qualified surface owners.
    (e) Upon receipt of a filing from anyone other than the named 
qualified surface owner, the authorized officer shall contact the named 
qualified surface owner and request his confirmation in writing that the 
filed, written consent or evidence thereof to enter and commence mining 
has been granted, and that the filing fully discloses all of the terms 
of the written consent, or that the refusal to consent is accurate.
    (f) The applicable conditions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section shall be met prior to the lease sale for lands to which the 
consents apply.
    (g) The authorized officer shall in all cases notify the person or 
persons filing the written consent, evidence of written consent, or 
statement of refusal to consent of the results of the review of the 
filing, including any request for additional information needed to 
satisfy the requirements of this subpart in cases where insufficient 
information was supplied with the original filing.
    (h) The purchase price of any applicable written consent from a 
qualified surface owner submitted and verified prior to posting of the 
notice of lease sale shall be included with the description of the 
tract(s) in the notice of lease sale, and the other terms of the consent 
shall be included in the detailed statement of the sale for the 
tract(s). Any consent filed after posting of the notice of lease sale 
shall be placed in the official file for the lease tract(s) to which the 
consent applies and shall be available for inspection by the public in 
the appropriate Bureau of Land Management State office (43 CFR subpart 
1821).
    (i) Any statement of refusal to consent shall be treated as 
controlling until the activity planning cycle that includes the area 
covered by the refusal to consent is repeated or the surface estate is 
sold. When an activity planning cycle is initiated, the qualified 
surface owner shall be notified that his/her prior statement of refusal 
has expired and shall be given the opportunity to submit another 
statement.
    (j) If the surface owner fails to provide evidence of qualifications 
in response to surface owner consultation or to a written request for 
such evidence, and if the authorized officer is unable to independently 
determine whether or not the surface owner is qualified, the authorized 
officer shall presume that the surface owner is unqualified. The 
authorized officer shall notify the surface owner in writing of this 
determination and shall provide the surface owner an opportunity to 
appeal the determination.
    (k) Any surface owner determined to be unqualified by decision of 
the field official of the surface management

[[Page 542]]

agency shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of such decision in 
which he/she may appeal the decision to the appropriate State Director 
of the Bureau of Land Management. The surface owner shall have the right 
to appeal the State Director's decision to the Director, Bureau of Land 
Management, within 30 days of receipt of that decision. Both appeals 
under this paragraph shall be in writing. As an exception to the 
provisions of Sec. 3000.4 of this title, the decision of the Director 
shall be the final administrative action of the Department of the 
Interior.

<R05>
Sec. 3427.3  Validation of information.

    Any person submitting a written consent shall include with his 
filing a statement that the evidence submitted, to the best of his 
knowledge, represents a true, accurate, and complete statement of 
information regarding the consent for the area described.


<R05>
Sec. 3427.4  Pre-existing consents.

    An otherwise valid written consent given by a qualified surface 
owner prior to August 3, 1977, shall not be required to meet the 
transferability of Sec. 3427.2(d)(1) of this title.

[47 FR 33142, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3427.5  Unqualified surface owners.

    (a) Lease tracts involving surface owners who are not qualified (see 
Sec. 3400.0-5(gg)) shall be leased subject to the protections afforded 
the surface owner by the statute(s) under which the surface was patented 
and the coal reserved to the United States. No consent from an 
unqualified surface owner is required under this subpart before the 
authorized officer may issue a lease for such a tract (see section 9 of 
the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (43 U.S.C. 249); the Act of March 3, 
1909 (30 U.S.C. 81); section 3 of the Act of June 22, 1910 (30 U.S.C. 
85); and section 5 of the Act of June 21, 1949 (30 U.S.C. 54)).
    (b) The provisions of Secs. 3427.1 through 3427.4 of this title are 
inapplicable to any lease tract on which a consent has been given by an 
unqualified surface owner. The high bidder at the sale of such a tract 
is not required to submit any evidence of written consent before the 
authorized officer may issue the lease unless the statute establishing 
the relative rights of the United States (and its lessees) and the 
surface owner so requires.

                  Subpart 3430--Preference Right Leases


<R05>
Sec. 3430.0-1  Purpose.

    These regulations set forth procedures for processing noncompetitive 
(preference right) coal lease applications on Federal lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3430.0-3  Authority.

    (a) These regulations are issued under the authority of the statutes 
cited in Sec. 3400.0-3 of this title.
    (b) These regulations primarily implement section 2(b) of the 
Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 201(b)).

[44 FR 42628, July 19, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 33143, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3430.0-7  Scope.

    Section 4 of the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976, 
amending 30 U.S.C. 201(b), repealed the Secretary's authority to issue 
or extend a coal prospecting permit on Federal lands. Therefore, these 
regulations apply only to preference right lease applications based on 
prospecting permits issued prior to August 4, 1976. The surface owner 
consent provisions of section 714 of the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1304) do not apply to preference 
right lease applications.

<R05>
Sec. 3430.1  Preference right leases.


<R05>
Sec. 3430.1-1  Showing required for entitlement to a lease.

    An applicant for a preference right lease shall be entitled to a 
noncompetitive coal lease if the applicant can demonstrate that he 
discovered commercial quantities of coal on the prospecting permit lands 
within the term of the prospecting permit, all other requirements having 
been met.


<R05>
Sec. 3430.1-2  Commercial quantities defined.

    For the purpose of Sec. 3430.1-1 of this title, commercial 
quantities is defined as follows:
    (a) The coal deposit discovered under the prospecting permit shall 
be of such character and quantity that a prudent person would be 
justified in further expenditure of his labor and means with a 
reasonable prospect of success in developing a valuable mine.
    (b) The applicant shall present sufficient evidence to show that 
there is a reasonable expectation that revenues from the sale of the 
coal shall exceed the cost of developing the mine and extracting, 
removing, transporting, and marketing the coal. The costs of development 
shall include the estimated cost of exercising environmental protection 
measures and suitably reclaiming the lands and complying with all 
applicable Federal and state laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 3430.2  Application for lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3430.2-1  Initial showing.

    All preference right coal lease applications shall have contained or 
shall have been supplemented by the timely submission of:

[[Page 544]]

    (a) Information on the quantity and quality of the coal resources 
discovered within the boundaries of the prospecting permit area, 
including an average proximate analysis, sulfur content and BTU content 
of the coal, and all supporting geological and geophysical data used to 
develop the required information.
    (1) Coal quantity shall be indicated by structural maps of the tops 
of all beds to be mined, isopachous maps of beds to be mined and 
interburden; and, for beds to be mined by surface mining methods, 
isopachous maps of the overburden. These maps shall show the location of 
test holes and outcrops. An estimate of the measured and indicated 
reserves for each bed to be mined shall be included.
    (2) Coal quality data shall include, at a minimum, an average 
proximate analysis, sulfur content, and BTU content of the coal in each 
bed to be mined. Also, all supporting geological and geophysical data 
used to develop the required information shall be submitted.
    (b) Topographic maps as available from state or Federal sources 
showing physical features, drainage patterns, roads and vehicle trails, 
utility systems, and water sources. The location of proposed development 
and mining operations facilities shall be identified on the maps. These 
maps shall include the approximate locations and extent of tailings and 
overburden storage areas; location and size of pit areas; and the 
location of water sources or other resources that may be used in the 
proposed operation and facilities incidental to that use.
    (c) A narrative statement that includes:
    (1) The anticipated scope of operations, the schedule of operations, 
and the types of equipment to be used;
    (2) The mining method to be used and an estimate of the expected 
mining sequence and production rate; and
    (3) The relationship, if any, between operations planned on the land 
applied for and existing or planned operations and facilities on 
adjacent lands.
    (d) The authorized officer may request from the applicant, or the 
applicant may submit, any other information necessary to conduct an 
environmental analysis of the proposed mining operation, formulate 
mitigating measures and lease terms and determine commercial quantities.

<R05>
Sec. 3430.3-1  Land use planning.

    (a) As a matter of policy, the Department shall complete the 
processing of all preference right lease applications.
    (b) Preference right lease applications shall be processed in the 
cycle of on-going comprehensive land use plans unless the authorized 
officer determines that the processing of the application, in the cycle 
of on-going comprehensive land use plans, will not be completed by 
December 1, 1984.
    (c) (1) Each applicant may file a request with the authorized 
officer:
    (i) For an estimate of when the application shall be processed in 
the cycle of on-going comprehensive land use plans; and
    (ii) To have the applicant's application processed in advance of the 
period specified in the authorized officer's estimate.
    (2) The request shall include a statement of how the applicant will 
benefit from having the application processed more quickly than 
otherwise scheduled, and shall specify how the pendency of the 
application affects the applicant's production, marketing or use of coal

Sec. 3430.3-2  Environmental analysis.

    (a) After the applicant has completed the initial showing required 
under Sec. 3430.2 of this title, the authorized officer shall conduct an 
environmental analysis of the proposed preference right lease area and 
prepare an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement on 
the application.
    (b) The environmental analysis may be conducted in conjunction with 
and included as part of the environmental impact statement required for 
coal activity planning under Sec. 3420.3-4 of this title.
    (c) Except for the coal preference right lease applications analyzed 
in the San Juan Regional Coal Environmental Impact Statement (March 
1984), the Savery Coal EIS (July 1983), and the Final Decision Record 
and Environmental Assessment of Coal PRLAs (Beans Spring, Table, and 
Black Butte Creek Projects) (September 1982), or covered by serial 
numbers C-0127832, C-0123475, C-0126669, C-8424, C-8425, W-234111, C-
0127834, U-1362, NM-3099, F-014996, F-029746, and F-033619, the 
authorized officer shall prepare environmental impact statements for all 
preference right lease applications for coal for which he/she proposes 
to issue a lease, in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The authorized officer shall prepare adequate environmental 
impact statements and other National Environmental Policy Act 
documentation, prior to the determination that commercial quantities of 
coal have been discovered on the lands subject to a preference right 
lease application, in order to assure, inter alia, that the full cost of 
environmental impact mitigation, including site-specific lease 
stipulations, is included in the commercial quantities determination for 
that preference right lease application.
    (2) The authorized officer shall prepare and evaluate alternatives 
that will explore various means to eliminate or mitigate the adverse 
impacts of the proposed action. The impact analysis shall address each 
numbered subject area set forth in Sec. 3430.4-4 of this title, except 
that the impact analysis need not specifically address the subject areas 
of Mine Planning or of Bonding. At a minimum, each environmental impact 
statement shall include:
    (i) A ``no action'' alternative that examines the impacts of the 
projected development without the issuance of leases for the preference 
right lease applications;
    (ii) An alternative setting forth the applicant's proposed action. 
This alternative shall examine the applicant's proposal, based on 
information submitted in the applicant's initial showing and standard 
lease stipulations;
    (iii) An alternative setting forth the authorized officer's own 
proposed action. This alternative shall examine:
    (A) The impacts of mining on those areas encompassed by the 
applicant's proposal that are found suitable for further consideration 
for mining after the unsuitability review provided for by subpart 3461 
of this title; and
    (B) The impacts of mining subject to appropriate special 
stipulations designed to mitigate or eliminate impacts for which 
standard lease stipulations may be inadequate. With respect to 
mitigation of significant adverse impacts, alternative lease 
stipulations shall be developed and preferred lease stipulations shall 
be identified and justified. The authorized officer shall state a 
preference between standard lease stipulations and special stipulations 
(performance standards or design criteria).
    (iv) An exchange alternative, examining any reasonable alternative 
for exchange that the Secretary would consider were the applicant to 
show commercial quantities, and, in cases where, if the lands were to be 
leased, there is a finding that the development of the coal resources is 
not in the public interest.
    (v) An alternative exploring the options of withdrawal and just 
compensation and examining the possibility of

[[Page 546]]

Secretarial withdrawal of lands covered by a preference right lease 
application (assuming commercial quantities will be shown) while the 
Secretary seeks congressional authorization for purchase or condemnation 
of the applicant's property, lease or other rights.
    (3) The authorized officer shall prepare a cumulative impact 
analysis in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.7 and 1508.25 that examines the 
impacts of the proposed action and the alternatives when added to other 
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of 
what agency (Federal or nonfederal) or person undertakes such other 
actions.
    (i) The cumulative impact analysis shall include an analysis of the 
combined impacts of the proposed preference right leasing with the 
mining of currently leased coal and other reasonably foreseeable future 
coal development, as well as other preference right leasing in the area 
under examination.
    (ii) The cumulative impact analysis shall also examine the impacts 
of the proposed preference right leasing in conjunction with impacts 
from non-coal activities, such as mining for other minerals, other 
projects requiring substantial quantities of water, and other sources of 
air pollution.
    (4) When information is inadequate to estimate impacts reasonably, 
the authorized officer shall comply with the provisions of 40 CFR 
1502.22(b).
    (5) Each environmental impact statement shall be prepared in 
accordance with the Council of Environmental Quality's National 
Environmental Policy Act regulations, 40 CFR part 1500.

limited to, the cost of developing the mine, removing the coal, 
processing the coal to make it salable, transporting the coal, paying 
applicable royalties and taxes, and complying with applicable laws and 
regulations, the proposed lease terms, and special stipulations; and
    (3) If the applicant intends to mine the deposit in the lands 
covered by a preference right lease application as part of a logical 
mining unit, the applicant shall include the estimated costs and revenue 
of the combined mining venture.
    (e) The applicant may withdraw any lands from the application and 
delete

[[Page 547]]

them from the final showing if the applicant is no longer interested in 
leasing such lands or if such lands would be subject to special 
conditions or protective stipulations and the cost of mining the lands 
subject to these conditions or protective stipulations would adversely 
affect the commercial quantities determination.
    (f) The applicant may delete any area subject to special conditions 
or protective stipulations, because it has been assessed to be 
unsuitable or otherwise, and the costs of mining subject to the 
conditions or protective stipulations, from the final showing required 
by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (g) All data submitted by the preference right lease applicant that 
is labeled as privileged or confidential shall be treated in accordance 
with the provisions of part 2 of this title.

Subpart 3436--Coal Lease and Coal Land Exchanges: Alluvial Valley Floors

    Source: 47 FR 33145, July 30, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to establish criteria and procedures 
for the exchange of coal leases and for the exchange of fee held coal 
for unleased federally-owned coal in cases where surface coal mining 
operations on the lands that are covered by an existing coal lease or 
that are fee held would interrupt, discontinue or preclude farming on 
alluvial valley floors west of the 100th Meridian, west longitude, or 
materially damage the quantity or quality of water in surface or 
underground systems that supply those alluvial valley floors.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.0-2  Objective.

    (a) The objective of this subpart is to provide relief to persons 
holding leases for Federal coal deposits or fee title to coal deposits 
which underlie or are near alluvial valley floors and which cannot be 
mined through surface mining operations under section 510(b)(5) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, through the exchange of 
lands, or interests therein, pursuant to the authority granted by the 
statutory provision.
    (b) The Secretary shall exercise the authority to dispose of Federal 
coal deposits by lease to meet this objective when he/she determines 
that the exchange would serve the public interest. In determining 
whether such an exchange will serve the public interest, the Secretary 
will consider a wide variety of factors, including better Federal land 
management and the needs of State and local people, including needs for 
lands for the economy, community expansion, recreation areas, food, 
fiber, minerals and fish and wildlife. Unless consideration of the above 
factors would show otherwise, it will be assumed that an exchange will 
serve the public interest if substantial financial and legal commitments 
have been made toward development of the offered coal resource.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.0-3  Authority.

    (a) These regulations are issued under the authority of the statutes 
cited in Sec. 3400.0-3 of this title.
    (b) These regulations primarily implement section 510(b)(5) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 
1260(b)(5)).


<R05>
Sec. 3436.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term substantial financial and legal 
commitments is a relative one, and the determination whether such 
commitments have been made, so as to qualify a person for an exchange 
under this subpart, will be made on a case-by-case basis. In making this 
determination, the Secretary will consider the level of expenditures 
made prior to January 1, 1977, that are related to development of the 
coal resource which is offered in exchange, taken together with the 
damages for which the person would be liable as a

[[Page 556]]

result of any legal commitments made prior to January 1, 1977, in 
connection with development of said coal resource, and the Secretary 
will compare that level of expenditure to the estimated total cost of 
developing the coal resource to the point of establishing a producing 
surface coal mining operation.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.1  Coal lease exchanges.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.1-1  Qualified lease proponents.

    (a) Coal lease exchanges under this program shall be available only 
to persons who:
    (1) Hold a Federal coal lease or preference right lease application 
covering lands that include or are near an alluvial valley floor located 
west of the 100th Meridian, west longitude, where surface coal mining 
operations are prohibited by section 510(b)(5) of the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act because such operations would interrupt 
farming or materially damage the quantity and quality of the water in 
surface or underground water systems that would supply the alluvial 
valley floor;
    (2) Have made substantial financial and legal commitments prior to 
January 1, 1977, in connection with the lease or preference right lease 
application; and
    (3) Are not entitled to continue any existing surface coal mining 
operations pursuant to the first proviso of section 510(b)(5) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.
    (b) Persons seeking an exchange bear the burden of establishing that 
they are qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The 
Secretary shall accept a determination made pursuant to 30 CFR 785.19(c) 
as conclusive evidence of the existence of an alluvial valley floor.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.1-2  Federal coal deposits subject to lease by exchange.

    The lease offered by the Secretary in exchange for existing coal 
leases shall be for Federal coal deposits determined to be acceptable 
for further consideration for coal leasing pursuant to Sec. 3420.1-5 or 
Sec. 3420.2-3 of this title.
    (a) Any person meeting the requirements of Sec. 3436.1-1(a) of this 
title may apply for a lease exchange. No special form of application is 
required.
    (b) The Secretary shall evaluate each exchange request to determine 
whether the proponent is qualified and whether the exchange serves the 
public interest. The exchange shall be processed in accordance with the 
procedures in subpart 3435 of this title for other lease and lease 
interest exchanges.
    (c) After the Secretary and the exchange proponent have agreed to 
terms pursuant to Sec. 3435.3-3 of this title, the Secretary may elect 
to consider the exchange proposal in conjunction with the activity 
planning process for the coal production region in which the lands 
proposed to be leased are located pursuant to Sec. 3420.3 of this title. 
If the Secretary elects to process the exchange proposal in this manner, 
the tracts identified for use in the lease exchange shall be:
    (1) Delineated for analysis pursuant to Sec. 3420.3-3 of this title;
    (2) Ranked as having high desirability pursuant to Sec. 3420.3-4(a) 
of this title; and
    (3) Selected for inclusion for analysis purposes in alternative 
proposed lease sale schedules pursuant to Sec. 3420.3-4(c) of this 
title. Such tracts shall then be the subject of environmental analysis, 
public comment and consultation pursuant to Secs. 3420.3 and 3420.4 of 
this title.
    (d) If the Secretary elects to process the exchange proposal 
independently of the activity planning process, the Secretary shall 
consider the environmental and resource information acquired during the 
land use planning process and found in the most recent regional 
environmental impact statement completed under the Federal coal 
management program. An environmental assessment or environmental impact 
statement shall be prepared on the proposed exchange prior to the public 
hearings and consultation required by Secs. 3435.3-5 through 3435.3-7 of 
this title.
    (e) In determining under Sec. 3435.3-4 of this title the estimated 
value of the lease or preference right lease application to be 
relinquished, the Secretary shall proceed as though there were no 
prohibitions on surface mining operations on the lands covered by the

[[Page 557]]

lease or preference right lease application.
    (f) The exchange proponent shall bear all administrative costs of 
the exchange, including the cost of establishing the value of each lease 
involved in the exchange, if the exchange is completed.

<R05>
Sec. 3436.2  Fee coal exchanges.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.2-1  Qualified exchange proponents.

    (a) Fee coal exchanges under this program shall only be available to 
persons who:
    (1) Own coal west of the 100th Meridan, west longitude, underlying 
or near an alluvial valley floor where surface coal mining operations 
are prohibited by section 510(b)(5) of the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act because such operations would interrupt farming or 
materially damage the quantity and quality of the water in surface or 
underground water systems that would supply the alluvial valley floor; 
and
    (2) Are not entitled to continue any existing surface coal mining 
operation pursuant to the first proviso to section 510(b)(5) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.
    (b) Exchange proponents bear the burden of establishing their 
qualifications pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The Secretary 
shall accept a determination made pursuant to 30 CFR 785.19(c) as 
conclusive evidence of the existence of an alluvial valley floor.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.2-2  Federal coal deposits subject to disposal by exchange.

    The coal deposits offered in exchange by the Secretary shall be 
determined to be acceptable for further consideration for coal leasing 
pursuant to Sec. 3420.1 of this title and shall be in the same State as 
the coal deposit offered in exchange by the proponent.


<R05>
Sec. 3436.2-3  Exchange procedures.

    (a) Any person meeting the requirements of Sec. 3436.2-1(a) of this 
title may apply for an exchange. No special form of application is 
required. Any exchange proposal should be directed to the District 
Manager for the Bureau of Land Management district in which the Federal 
coal deposits are located.
    (b) The Secretary shall evaluate each exchange request to determine 
whether the proponent is qualified.
    (c) After the authorized officer and the owner of the coal deposit 
underlying an alluvial valley floor identify Federal coal deposits that 
are suitable for consideration for disposition through exchange, the 
exchange shall be processed in accordance with part 2200 of this title, 
except as provided in this section.
    (d) The Secretary may consolidate the environmental analysis for the 
proposed exchange with the regional environmental impact statement 
prepared on alternative leasing schedules for the coal production region 
in which the Federal coal deposits are located pursuant to Sec. 3420.3-4 
of this title. If the environmental analysis is not so consolidated, the 
Secretary shall consider environmental and other resource information 
obtained during the land use planning process or at other stages of the 
coal management program in preparing an appropriate environmental 
analysis or environmental impact statement on the proposed exchange.
    (e) Exchanges shall be made on an equal value basis, provided that 
values of the lands exchanged may be equalized by the payment of money 
to the grantor or the Secretary so long as the payment does not exceed 
25 percent of the total value of the lands or interests transferred out 
of Federal ownership. In determining the value of the coal deposit 
underlying or near an alluvial valley floor, the Secretary shall proceed 
as though there were no prohibition on surface coal mining operations on 
the property.

<R04>
       Subpart 3451--Continuation of Leases: Readjustment of Terms


<R05>
Sec. 3451.1  Readjustment of lease terms.

    (a) (1) All leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, shall be subject 
to readjustment at the end of the current 20-year period and at the end 
of each 10-year period thereafter. All leases issued after August 4, 
1976, shall be subject to readjustment at the end of the first 20-year 
period and, if the lease is extended, each 10-year period thereafter.
    (2) Any lease subject to readjustment which contains a royalty rate 
less than the minimum royalty prescribed in Sec. 3473.3-2 of this title 
shall be readjusted to conform to the minimum prescribed in that 
section.
    (b) If the lease became subject to readjustment of terms and 
conditions before August 4, 1976, but the authorized officer prior to 
that date neither readjusted the terms and conditions nor informed the 
lessee whether or not a readjustment would be made, the terms and 
conditions of that lease shall not be readjusted retroactively to 
conform to the requirements of the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act 
of 1976.
    (c)(1) The authorized officer shall, prior to the expiration of the 
current or initial 20-year period or any succeeding 10-year period 
thereafter, notify the lessee of any lease which becomes subject to 
readjustment after June 1, 1980, whether any readjustment of terms and 
conditions will be made prior to the expiration of the initial 20-year 
period or any succeeding 10-year period thereafter. On such a lease the 
failure to so notify the lessee shall mean that the United States is 
waiving its right to readjust the lease for the readjustment period in 
question.
    (2) In any notification that a lease will be readjusted under this 
subsection, the authorized officer will prescribe when the decision 
transmitting the readjusted lease terms will be sent to the lessee. The 
time for transmitting the information will be as soon as possible after 
the notice that the lease shall be readjusted, but will not be longer 
than 2 years after such notice. Failure to send the decision 
transmitting the readjusted lease terms in the specified period shall 
constitute a waiver of the right to readjust, unless

[[Page 560]]

the delay is caused by events beyond the control of the Department.
    (d) In the notification that the lease will be readjusted, the 
authorized officer may require the lessee to furnish information 
specified in Sec. 3422.3-4 of this title for review by the Attorney 
General as required by section 27(1) of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 
as amended. If the authorized officer requests the information 
specified, no lease readjustment shall be effective until 30 days after 
the authorized officer has transmitted the required information to the 
Attorney General. The lease shall be subject to cancellation if the 
lessee fails to furnish the required information within the time 
allowed.
    (e) The Governor of the affected State will be sent a copy of the 
readjusted lease terms.

[44 FR 42635, July 19, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 33146, July 30, 1982;

<R05>
Sec. 3451.2  Notification of readjusted lease terms.

    (a) If the notification that the lease will be readjusted did not 
contain the readjusted lease terms, the authorized officer will, within 
the time specified in the notice that the lease shall be readjusted, 
notify the lessee by decision of the readjusted lease terms.
    (b) The decision transmitting the readjusted lease terms and 
conditions to the lessee(s) of record shall constitute the final action 
of the Bureau of Land Management on all the provisions contained in a 
readjusted lease and will be provided to the lessee(s) of record prior 
to the anniversary date. The effective date of the readjusted lease 
shall not be affected by the filing of any appeal of, or a civil suit 
regarding, any of the readjusted terms and conditions.
    (c) The readjusted lease terms and conditions shall become effective 
on the anniversary date;
    (d) The lessee may appeal the decision of the authorized officer in 
accordance with the procedure set out in 43 CFR part 4; and
    (e) Regardless of whether an appeal is filed by the lessee(s), all 
of the readjusted lease terms and conditions, including, but not limited 
to, the reporting and payment of rental and royalty, shall be effective 
on the anniversary date.

<R05>
Sec. 3452.1  Relinquishment.


<R05>
Sec. 3452.1-1  General.

    The lessee may surrender the entire lease, a legal subdivision 
thereof, an aliquot part thereof (not less than 10 acres) or any bed of 
the coal deposit therein. A partial relinquishment shall describe 
clearly the surrendered parcel or coal deposits and give the exact 
acreage relinquished. If the authorized officer accepts the 
relinquishment of any coal deposits in a lease, the coal reserves shall 
be adjusted in accordance with part 3480 of this title.

[47 FR 33147, July 30, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 8627, Mar. 4, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 3452.1-2  Where filed.

    A relinquishment shall be filed in triplicate by the lessee in the 
Bureau of Land Management State Office having jurisdiction over the 
lands involved (43 CFR subpart 1821).


<R05>
Sec. 3452.1-3  Acceptance.

    The effective date of the lease relinquishment shall, upon approval 
by an authorized officer, be the date on which the lessee filed the 
lease relinquishment. No relinquishment shall be approved until the 
authorized officer determines that the relinquishment will not impair 
the public interest, that the accrued rentals and royalties have been 
paid and that all the obligations of the lessee under the regulations 
and terms of the lease have been met.

[47 FR 33147, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3452.2  Cancellation.


<R05>
Sec. 3452.2-1  Cause for cancellation.

    (a) The authorized officer, after compliance with Sec. 3452.2-2 of 
this title, may take the appropriate steps to institute proceedings in a 
court of competent jurisdiction for the cancellation of the lease if the 
lessee: (1) Fails to comply with the provisions of the Mineral

[[Page 561]]

Leasing Act of 1920, as amended; (2) fails to comply with any applicable 
general regulations; or (3) defaults in the performance of any of the 
terms, covenants, and stipulations of the lease.
    (b) Any lease issued before August 4, 1976, on which the lessee does 
not meet the diligent development requirements or any lease whenever 
issued on which the lessee does not meet the continued operation 
requirements shall be subject to cancellation in whole or in part. In 
deciding whether to initiate lease cancellation proceedings under this 
subsection, the Secretary shall not consider adverse circumstances which 
arise out of (1) normally foreseeable costs of compliance with 
requirements for environmental protection; (2) commonly experienced 
delays in delivery of supplies or equipment; or (3) inability to obtain 
sufficient sales.

[44 FR 42635, July 19, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 33147, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3452.2-2  Cancellation procedure.

    The lessee shall be given notice of any default, breach or cause of 
forefeiture and be afforded 30 days to correct the default, to request 
an extension of time in which to correct the default, or to submit 
evidence showing why the lease should not be cancelled. The Governor of 
the affected State(s) shall be given reasonable notice of action taken 
by the Department of the Interior to initiate cancellation of the lease.

<R05>
Sec. 3452.3  Termination.

    (a) Any lease issued or readjusted after August 4, 1976, shall be 
terminated if the lessee does not meet the diligent development 
requirements.
    (b) Should a lease be relinquished, cancelled or terminated for any 
reason, all deferred bonus payments shall be immediately payable and all 
rentals and royalties, including advance royalties, already paid or due, 
shall be forfeited to the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 3453.1  Qualifications.

    (a) Leases may be transferred in whole or in part to any person, 
association or corporation qualified under subpart 3472 of this title to 
hold such leases, except as provided by Sec. 3420.1-4(b)(1)(iv) and

Sec. 3453.2  Requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 3453.2-1  Application.

    Applications for approval of any transfer of a lease, preference 
right lease application or exploration license or any interest in a 
lease or license, whether by direct assignment, working agreement, 
transfer of royalty interest, sublease, or otherwise, shall be filed 
within 90 days from final execution.

[44 FR 42635, July 19, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 33147, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3453.2-2  Forms and statements.

    (a) Transfers of any record title interest shall be filed in 
triplicate and shall be accompanied by a request for approval from the 
transferee.
    (b) No specific form need be used for requests for approval of 
transfers. The request for approval shall contain evidence of the 
transferee's qualifications, including a statement of Federal coal lease 
acreage holdings. This evidence shall consist of the same showing of 
qualifications required of a lease applicant by subpart 3472 of this 
title. A single signed copy of the qualifications statement is 
sufficient.
    (c) A separate instrument of transfer shall be filed for each lease 
when transfers involve record titles. When transfers to the same person, 
association, or corporation involving more than one lease are filed at 
the same time, one request for approval and one showing as

[[Page 562]]

to the qualifications of the transferee shall be sufficient.
    (d) A single signed copy of all other instruments of transfer is 
sufficient, except that collateral assignments and other security or 
mortgage documents shall not be accepted for filing.
    (e) Any transfer of a record title interest or assignment of 
operating rights shall be accompanied by the transferee's submission of 
the information specified in Sec. 3422.3-4 of this title, including the 
holdings of any affiliate(s) (including joint ventures) of the 
transferees, or a statement incorporating a prior submission of the

application serial number of the submission, and containing any and all 
changes in holdings since the date of the prior submission.
    (f) Any document of transfer which does not contain a description of 
all consideration or value paid or promised for the transfer shall be 
accompanied by a separate statement of all consideration or value, 
whether cash, property, future payments or any other type of 
consideration, paid or promised for the transfer.
    (g) Information submitted to comply with paragraphs (e) and (f) of 
this section may be labeled as proprietary data and shall be treated in 
accordance with the laws and regulations governing the confidentiality 
of such information.

Sec. 3453.2-4  Bonds.

    (a) If a bond is required, it shall be furnished before a lease, 
preference right lease application or exploration license may be 
approved for transfer. If the original lease, preference right lease 
application or exploration license required the maintenance of a bond, 
the transferee shall submit either a written consent from the surety to 
the substitution of the transferee as principal or a new bond with the 
transferee as principal. Transfers of any part of the leased or licensed 
lands shall be described by legal subdivisions. Before any transfer of 
part of a lease or license is approved, the transferee shall submit: (1) 
A written statement from the surety that it agrees to the transfer and 
that it agrees to remain bound as to the interest retained by the lessee 
or licensee; and (2) a new bond with the tranferee as principal covering 
the portion transferred.
    (b) The transferor and the surety shall continue to be responsible 
for the performance of any obligation under the lease, preference right 
lease application or exploration license until the effective date of the 
approval of the transfer. If the transfer is not approved, the 
obligation to the United States shall continue as though no such 
transfer had been filed for approval. After the effective date of 
approval, the transferee, including any sublessee, applicant or 
licensee, and the transferee's surety shall be responsible for all 
lease, application or license obligations, notwithstanding any terms of 
the transfer to the contrary.

<R05>
Sec. 3453.2-5  Effect of partial assignment.

    A transfer of full record-title to only part of the lands, or any 
bed of the coal deposits therein, shall segregate the transferred and 
retained portions into separate and distinct leases or licenses, with 
the retained portion keeping the original serial number. The newly 
segregated lease or license shall be assigned a new serial number and 
shall contain the same terms and conditions as the original lease or 
license.

Sec. 3461.0-3  Authority.

    (a) These regulations are issued under the authority of the statutes 
listed in Sec. 3400.0-3 of this title.
    (b) These regulations primarily implement:
    (1) The general unsuitability criteria in section 522(a) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1272(a));
    (2) The Federal lands review in section 522(b) of the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1272(b)); and
    (3) The prohibitions against mining certain lands in section 522(e) 
of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 
1272(e)).


<R05>
Sec. 3461.0-6  Policy.

    The Department shall carry out the review of Federal lands under 
section 522(b) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 
(30 U.S.C. 1272(b)) principally through land use planning assessments by 
the surface management agency regarding the unsuitability of Federal 
lands for all or certain stipulated methods of coal mining.


<R05>
Sec. 3461.0-7  Scope.

    Each criterion in Sec. 3461.1 of this title uses the phrase ``shall 
be considered unsuitable'' as shorthand for ``shall be considered 
unsuitable for all or certain stipulated methods of coal mining 
involving surface coal mining operations, as defined in Sec. 3400.0-
5(mm) of this title.

<R05>
Sec. 3461.1  Underground mining exemption from criteria.

    (a) Federal lands with coal deposits that would be mined by 
underground mining methods shall not be assessed as unsuitable where 
there would be no surface coal mining operations, as defined in 
Sec. 3400.0-5 of this title, on any lease, if issued.
    (b) Where underground mining will include surface operations and 
surface impacts on Federal lands to which a criterion applies, the lands 
shall be assessed as unsuitable unless the surface management agency 
finds that a relevant exception or exemption applies.

Sec. 3461.2  Unsuitability assessment procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 3461.2-1  Assessment and land use planning.

    (a)(1) Each of the unsuitability criteria shall be applied to all 
coal lands with development potential identified in the comprehensive 
land use plan or land use analysis. For areas where 1 or more 
unsuitability conditions are found and for which the authorized officer 
of the surface management agency could otherwise regard coal mining as a 
likely use, the exceptions and exemptions for each criterion may be 
applied.
    (2) Public comments on the application of the unsuitability criteria 
shall be solicited by a notice published in the Federal Register. This 
call for comments may be part of the call for public comments on the 
draft land-use plan or land-use analysis. This notice shall announce the 
availability of maps and other information describing the results of the 
application and the application process used.
    (3) The authorized officer of the surface management agency shall 
describe in the comprehensive land use plan or land use analysis the 
results of the application of each unsuitability criterion, exception 
and exemption. The

[[Page 565]]

authorized officer of the surface management agency shall state in the 
plan or analysis those areas which could be leased only subject to 
conditions or stipulations to conform to the application of the criteria 
or exceptions. Such areas may ultimately be leased provided that these 
conditions or stipulations are contained in the lease.
    (b)(1) The authorized officer shall make his/her assessment on the 
best available data that can be obtained given the time and resources 
available to prepare the plan. The comprehensive land use plan or land 
use analysis shall include an indication of the adequacy and reliability 
of the data involved. Where either a criterion or exception (when under 
paragraph (a) of this section the authorized officer decides that 
application of an exception is appropriate) cannot be applied during the 
land use planning process because of inadequate or unreliable data, the 
plan or analysis shall discuss the reasons therefor and disclose when 
the data needed to make an assessment with reasonable certainty would be 
generated. It the case of Criterion 19, application shall be made before 
approval of the mining permit. In the case of other deferred criteria, 
application shall be made prior to finalizing the environmental analysis 
for the area being studied for coal leasing. The authorized officer 
shall make every effort within the time and resources available to 
collect adequate and reliable data which would permit the application of 
Criterion 19 in the land use or activity planning process. When those 
data are obtained, the authorized officer shall make public his/her 
assessment on the application of the criterion or, if appropriate, the 
exception and the reasons therefor and allow opportunity for public 
comment on the adequacy of the application as required by paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (2) No lease tract shall be analyzed in a final regional lease sale 
environmental impact statement prepared under Sec. 3420.4-5 of this 
title without significant data material to the application to the tract 
of each criterion described in Sec. 3461.1 of this title, except, where 
necessary, criterion 19. If the data are lacking for the application of 
a criterion or exception to only a portion of the tract, and if the 
authorized officer determines that it is likely that stipulations in the 
lease or permit to conduct surface coal mining operations could avoid 
any problems which may result from subsequent application of the 
criterion or exception, such tract may be included and analyzed in the 
regional lease sale environmental impact statement.
    (c) Any unsuitability assessments which result either from a 
designation or a termination of a designation of Federal lands as 
unsuitable by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, 
or from changes warranted by additional data acquired in the activity 
planning process, may be made without formally revising or amending the 
comprehensive land use plan or analysis.

any National Forest if the Secretary finds no significant recreational, 
timber, economic or other values which may be incompatible with the 
lease; and (A) surface operations and impacts are incident to an 
underground coal mine, or (B) where the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines, with respect to lands which do not have significant forest 
cover within those National Forests west of the 100th Meridian, that 
surface mining may be in compliance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-
Yield Act of 1960, the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976 and 
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (ii) A lease may be issued within the Custer National Forest with 
the consent of the Department of Agriculture as long as no surface coal 
mining operations are permitted.
    (3) Exemptions. The application of this criterion to lands within 
the listed land systems and categories is subject to valid existing 
rights, and does not apply to surface coal mining operations existing on 
August 3, 1977.
    (b)(1) Criterion Number 2. Federal lands that are within rights-of-
way or easements or within surface leases for residential, commercial, 
industrial, or other public purposes, on federally owned surface shall 
be considered unsuitable.
    (2) Exceptions. A lease may be issued, and mining operations 
approved, in such areas if the surface management agency determines 
that:
    (i) All or certain types of coal development (e.g., underground 
mining) will not interfere with the purpose of the right-of-way or 
easement; or
    (ii) The right-of-way or easement was granted for mining purposes; 
or
    (iii) The right-of-way or easement was issued for a purpose for 
which it is not being used; or

[[Page 567]]

    (iv) The parties involved in the right-of-way or easement agree, in 
writing, to leasing; or

study areas shall be considered unsuitable while under review by the 
Administration and the Congress for possible wilderness designation. For 
any Federal land which is to be leased or mined prior to completion of 
the wilderness inventory by the surface management agency, the 
environmental assessment or impact statement on the lease sale or mine 
plan shall consider whether the land possesses the characteristics of a 
wilderness study area. If the finding is affirmative, the land shall be 
considered unsuitable, unless issuance of noncompetitive coal leases and 
mining on leases is authorized under the Wilderness Act and the Federal 
Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.

        Subpart 3471--Coal Management Provisions and Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 3471.1  Land description requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 3471.1-1  Land description and coal deposit in application.

    (a) Any application for a lease, lease modification, or license to 
mine shall include a complete and accurate description of the lands for 
which the lease, lease modification, or license to mine is desired.
    (b) If the land has been surveyed under the public land rectangular 
survey system, each application shall describe the land by legal 
subdivision (section, township, and range), or aliquot part thereof (but 
not less than 10 acres).
    (c) Where protraction diagrams have been approved and the effective 
date has been published in the Federal Register, the application for 
land shown on such protraction diagrams and filed on or after the 
effective date shall contain a description of the land according to the 
section, township, and range shown on the approved protraction diagrams.
    (d)(1) If the land has not been surveyed on the ground and is not 
shown on the records as covered by protraction diagrams, the application 
shall describe the land by metes and bounds, giving courses and 
distances between the successive angle points on the boundary of the 
tract, in cardinal directions except where the boundaries of the land 
are in irregular form, and connected by courses and distances to an 
official corner of the public land surveys. In Alaska, the description 
of unsurveyed land shall be connected by courses and distances to either 
an official corner of the public land surveys or to a triangulation 
station established by an agency of the United States such as the 
Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
or the International Boundary Commission, if the record position is 
available to the general public.
    (2)(i) If the land is acquired land in a non-public land state which 
has not been surveyed under the rectangular system of public land 
surveys, the land shall be described as in the deed or other document by 
which the United States acquired title to the lands or minerals.
    (ii) If the land constitutes less than the entire tract acquired by 
the United States, it shall be described by courses and distances 
between successive angle points on its boundary tying by course and 
distance into an identifiable point listed in the description in the 
deed or other document by which the United States acquired title to the 
land.
    (iii) If the description in the deed or other document by which the 
United States acquired title to the land does not include the courses 
and distance between the successive angle points on the boundary of the 
desired tract, the description in the application shall be expanded to 
include such courses and distances.
    (iv) The application shall be accompanied by a map on which the land 
is clearly marked showing its location with respect to the 
administrative unit or project of which it is a part. It is not 
necessary to submit a map if the land has been surveyed under the 
rectangular system of public land surveys, and the land description can 
be conformed to that system.
    (v) If an acquisition tract number has been assigned by the 
acquiring agency to the tract, a description by tract number will be 
accepted.
    (vi) Any accreted land not described in the deed to the United 
States shall be described by metes and bounds, giving courses and 
distances between the successive angle points on the boundary of the 
tract, and connected by courses and distances to an angle point on the 
perimeter of the acquired tract to which the accretions belong.


<R05>
Sec. 3471.1-2  Land description in lease.

    (a) All unsurveyed lands in a public land survey system state shall 
have a cadastral survey performed at Federal

[[Page 574]]

Government expense before a lease or license to mine may be issued, 
except for areas covered by a skeleton survey, i.e. Utah and Alaska, and 
the lease when issued shall be described by legal subdivision (section, 
township, and range), or aliquot part thereof (but no less than 10 
acres).
    (b) If the land is acquired land in a non-public land state, the 
land in the lease shall be described in the same manner provided for 
lease applications under Sec. 3471.1-1(d)(2) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3471.2  Effect of land transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 3471.2-1  Disposal of land with a reservation of minerals.

    (a) Where the lands included in a lease or license to mine have been 
or may be disposed of with reservation of the coal deposits, a lessee or 
the holder of a license to mine must comply fully with the law under 
which the reservation was made. See, among other laws, the Acts of March 
3, 1909 (34 Stat. 844; 30 U.S.C. 81); June 22, 1910 (35 Stat. 583; 30 
U.S.C. 83-85); December 29, 1916, as amended (39 Stat. 862; 43 U.S.C. 
291-301); June 17, 1949 (63 Stat. 200); June 21, 1949 (63 Stat. 214; 30 
U.S.C. 54); March 8, 1922 (42 Stat. 415; 48 U.S.C. 376-377); and October 
21, 1976 (90 Stat. 2759; 43 U.S.C. 1719).
    (b) Any sale or conveyance of acquired lands by the agency having 
jurisdiction shall be subject to any lease or license to mine previously 
issued under the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands.
    (c) Leases on acquired lands outstanding on August 7, 1947, and 
covering lands subject to the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands may 
be exchanged for new leases to be issued under that Act.
    (d) When: (1) The coal is to be mined by other than underground 
mining techniques, (2) the surface of the land is owned by a qualified 
surface owner, and (3) the lease is issued after August 3, 1977, the 
lessee shall comply with the terms of the written consent of the 
qualified surface owner not inconsistent with Federal and state mined 
land reclamation laws and regulations.

[44 FR 42643, July 19, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 33149, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3471.2-2  Effect of conveyance to state or local entity.

    (a) If the United States has conveyed the title to, or otherwise 
transferred control of the land surface containing the coal deposits to 
(1) any state or political subdivision, agency, or its instrumentality, 
(2) a college, any other educational corporation, or association, or (3) 
to a charitable or religious corporation or association, the transferee 
shall be notified by certified mail of the application for the license 
to mine or lease, or the scheduling of a lease sale. The transferee 
shall be given a reasonable period of time within which to suggest any 
stipulations necessary for the protection of existing surface 
improvements or uses to be included in the license or lease and state 
the supporting facts, or to file any objections to its issuance and 
state the supporting facts.
    (b) Opposition by the state or local entity is not a bar to issuance 
of the license to mine or lease for the reserved minerals in the lands. 
(See, however, Sec. 3461.1(b).) In each case, the final determination on 
whether to issue the license to mine or lease is based on the best 
interests of the public.

[44 FR 42643, July 19, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 33149, July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3471.3  Cancellation or forfeiture.


<R05>
Sec. 3471.3-1  Protection of bona fide purchaser.

    (a) The Secretary's right to cancel or forfeit a lease for any 
violation shall not adversely affect the title or interest of a bona 
fide purchaser of any lease or any interest therein. A bona fide 
purchaser must be a person, association, or corporation qualified to 
hold such lease or interest, even though the holdings of the party or 
parties from which the lease or interest therein was acquired or their 
predecessor(s) in title (including the original lessee of the United 
States), may have been cancelled or forfeited for any such violation.
    (b) Any party to any proceedings with respect to a violation of any 
provision of the mineral leasing laws may be dismissed promptly as a 
party by showing that he/she holds and acquired

[[Page 575]]

his/her interest as a bona fide purchaser without having violated any 
provisions of the mineral leasing laws.
    (c) If a party waives his or her rights under the lease, or if such 
rights are suspended by order of the Secretary pending a decision, 
rental payments and time counted against the term of the lease shall be 
suspended as of the first day of the month following the filing of the 
waiver or the Secretary's suspension until the first day of the month 
following the final decision in the proceeding or the revocation of the 
waiver or suspension.

July 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3471.3-2  Sale of underlying interests.

    If, in any proceeding to cancel or forfeit a lease or any interest 
therein acquired in violation of any of the provisions of the mineral 
leasing laws, the lease or interest therein is cancelled or forfeited, 
and if there are valid options to acquire the lease or an interest 
therein that are not subject to cancellation, forfeiture, or compulsory 
disposition, this lease or interest therein shall be sold to the highest 
responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding, in a manner similar 
to that provided for in the offering of leases by competitive bidding, 
subject to all outstanding valid interests and options. If less than the 
whole interest in the lease or interest therein is cancelled or 
forfeited, the partial interest shall be sold in the same way. If no 
satisfactory offer is obtained as a result of the competitive offering 
of a whole or partial interest, it may be sold by other methods that the 
authorized officer finds appropriate. However, the terms shall not be 
less favorable to the Government than those of the best competitive bid 
received.

<R05>
Sec. 3471.4  Future interest, acquired lands.

    An application to lease lands in which the United States has a 
future interest filed more than 2 years prior to the date of the vesting 
in the United States of the interest in the coal shall be rejected. Any 
application for a future interest lease outstanding at the time of the 
vesting in the United States of the present possessory interest in the 
coal shall not lapse, but shall continue to be treated under subpart 
3425 of this title. (See 43 CFR 3472.1-2(g).)

             Subpart 3472--Lease Qualification Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 3472.1  Qualifications.


<R05>
Sec. 3472.1-1  Qualified applicants and bidders.

    A lease may be issued only to (a) citizens of the United States; (b) 
associations of citizens organized under the laws of the United States 
or of any state thereof, which are authorized to hold such interests by 
the statute under which they are organized and by the instrument 
establishing their association; (c) corporations organized under the 
laws of the United States or of any state thereof, including a company 
or corporation operating a common carrier railroad; and (d) public 
bodies, including municipalities.

[44 FR 42643, July 19, 1979. Redesignated at 44 FR 56340, Oct. 1, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 3472.1-2  Special leasing qualifications.

    (a) Each applicant or bidder for a lease shall furnish a signed 
statement showing that, with the area applied or bid for, the applicant 
or bidder's interests in leases and lease applications, held directly or 
indirectly, do not exceed in the aggregate the acreage limitation in 
Sec. 3472.1-3 of this title.
    (b) A lease shall not be issued to a minor but may be issued to a 
legal guardian or trustee on behalf of a minor.
    (c) Every company or corporation operating a common carrier railroad 
shall make a statement that it needs the coal for which it seeks a lease 
solely for its own railroad use; that it operates main or branch lines 
in the state in which the lands involved are located; that the aggregate 
acreage in the leases and applications in which it

[[Page 576]]

holds an interest, directly or indirectly, does not exceed 10,240 acres; 
and that it does not hold more than one lease for each 200 miles of its 
railroad lines served or to be served from such coal deposits. This last 
requirement excludes spurs or switches, branch lines built to connect 
the leased coal with the railroad, and parts of the railroad operated 
mainly by power not produced by steam.
    (d) Aliens may not acquire or hold any direct or indirect interest 
in leases, except that they may own or control stock in corporations 
holding leases if the laws of their country do not deny similar or like 
privileges to citizens of the United States. If any appreciable 
percentage of stock of a corporation is held by aliens who are citizens 
of a country denying similar or like privileges to United States 
citizens, that corporation's application or bid for a lease shall be 
rejected, and that corporation's lease shall be subject to cancellation.
    (e)(1)(i) On or after December 31, 1986, no lease shall be issued 
and no existing lease shall be transferred to any entity that holds and 
has held for 10 years any lease from which the entity is not producing 
the coal in commercial quantities, except as authorized under the 
advance royalty or suspension provisions of part 3480 of this chapter, 
or paragraph (e) (4), (5), or (6) of this section.
    (ii) An entity seeking to obtain a working interest in a lease, or 
approval of a transfer under subpart 3453 of this title, shall qualify 
both on the date of determination of lessee qualifications and on the 
date the lease is issued or transfer approved.
    (iii) Once a lease has been issued to a qualified entity or transfer 
approved for a lease under subpart 3453 of this title, disqualification 
at a later date shall not result in surrender of that lease, or recision 
of the approved transfer, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section.
    (2)(i) Any entity seeking to obtain a lease or approval of a 
transfer of a lease pursuant to 43 CFR Group 3400 of this title shall 
certify, in writing, that the entity is in compliance with the Act and 
the requirements of this subpart. The entity's self-certification 
statement shall include:
    (A) A statement that the entity is qualified to be issued a lease or 
to have a transfer approved in accordance with the presumption of 
control or the presumption of noncontrol requirements at Sec. 3400.0-
5(rr) of this title, and in accordance with the producing requirements 
at paragraph (e)(6) of this section;
    (B) Justification rebutting the presumption of control requirements 
at Sec. 3400.0-5(rr) of this title, if the entity's instruments of 
ownership of the voting securities of another entity or of its voting 
securities by another entity are 20 through 50 percent. The authorized 
officer, based on the written self-certification statement and other 
relevant information, shall determine whether the entity has rebutted 
the presumption of control.
    (ii) If a lease is issued, or a transfer approved under subpart 3453 
of this title, to an entity based upon an improper, written self-
certification of compliance, the authorized officer shall 
administratively cancel the lease, or rescind the approved transfer, 
after complying with Sec. 3452.2-2 of this title.
    (3) The authorized officer may require an entity holding or seeking 
to hold an interest in a lease, to furnish, at any time, further 
evidence of compliance with the special leasing qualifications of this 
subpart.
    (4)(i) An entity, seeking to qualify for lease issuance, or transfer 
approval under subpart 3453 of this title, shall not be disqualified 
under the provisions of this subpart if it has one of the following 
actions pending before the authorized officer for any lease that would 
otherwise disqualify it under this subpart:
    (A) Request for lease relinquishment; or
    (B) Application for arm's-length lease assignment; or
    (C) Application for approval of a logical mining unit that the 
authorized officer determines would be producing on its effective date.
    (ii) Once a lease has been issued, or transfer approved, to an 
entity that qualifies under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, an 
adverse decision by the

[[Page 577]]

authorized officer on the pending action, or the withdrawal of the 
pending action by the applicant, shall result in termination of the 
lease or recision of the transfer approval. Such decision of the 
authorized officer shall be effective, regardless of appeal of that 
decision. The possibility of lease termination shall be included as a 
special stipulation in every lease issued to an entity that qualifies 
under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (iii) The entity shall not qualify for lease issuance or transfer 
under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section during the pendency of an 
appeal before the Office of Hearings and Appeals from an adverse 
decision by the authorized officer on any of the actions described in 
paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iv)(A) Where an entity, qualified under this section, had an 
approved transfer of a lease under subpart 3453 of this title, the 
transferor retained a right-of-first-refusal, and the entity wishes to 
relinquish such lease if such lease would otherwise disqualify the 
entity under this subpart, the entity may file the relinquishment under 
subpart 3452 of this title. However, the entity shall:
    (1) Submit sufficient documentation for the authorized officer to 
determine that, in fact, such a right-of-first-refusal exists and 
prevents approval or disapproval by the authorized officer of the 
pending relinquishment;
    (2) Submit with the request for approval of the relinquishment a 
statement that action by the authorized officer on the pending 
relinquishment be conditioned on the execution, or lack thereof, of the 
assignment under the right-of-first-refusal, as well as on the approval 
or disapproval of the assignment, if executed, under subpart 3453 of 
this title;
    (3) Submit an application for arm's-length lease assignment signed 
by the entity as well as proof that it has been submitted to the 
transferor that retained the right-of-first-refusal (e.g., copy of 
certified mail delivery); and
    (4) Submit the name(s) and address(es) of the transferor(s) that 
retained the right-of-first-refusal.
    (B) If the authorized officer determines, based on the information 
supplied under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, that the right-
of-first-refusal prevents action on the pending relinquishment, the 
authorized officer will send, via certified mail, return receipt 
requested, a request for additional information to the transferor that 
retained the right-of-first-refusal. The request shall state that the 
transferor that retained the right-of-first-refusal shall comply with 
subpart 3453 of this title within 30 days of receipt. If the transferor 
that retained the right-of-first-refusal does not comply within the 30-
day time frame, the authorized officer will:
    (1) Disapprove the pending assignment and so notify the entity and 
the transferor that retained the right-of-first-refusal; and
    (2) Process the request for relinquishment under subpart 3452 of 
this title.
    (C) If the authorized officer determines, pursuant to the 
information submitted under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, 
that the right-of-first-refusal does not prevent action on the request 
for relinquishment, the authorized officer will:
    (1) Disapprove the pending assignment and so notify the entity and 
the transferor that retained the right-of-first-refusal; and
    (2) Process the request for relinquishment under subpart 3452 of 
this title.
    (5) Leases that have been mined out (i.e., all recoverable reserves 
have been exhausted), as determined by the authorized officer, may be 
held for such purposes as reclamation without disqualification of the 
entity under the provisions of this subpart.
    (6)(i) The authorized officer shall determine the date of first 
production for the purposes of establishing the beginning of the 
bracket, if applicable.
    (ii) An entity shall not be disqualified under the provisions of 
this subpart if each lease that the entity holds is:
    (A) Producing and is within its bracket;
    (B) Producing and has produced commercial quantities during the 
bracket.
    (C) Producing and has achieved production in commercial quantities 
(an entity holding such a lease is disqualified under section 2(a)(2)(A) 
of the Act from the end of the bracket until production in commercial 
quantities is

[[Page 578]]

achieved), for leases which fail to produce commercial quantities within 
the bracket;
    (D) Producing, or currently in compliance with the continued 
operation requirements of part 3480 of this chapter, for leases that 
began their first production of coal--
    (1) On or after August 4, 1976; and
    (2) After becoming subject to the diligence provisions of part 3480 
of this chapter;
    (E) Contained in an approved logical mining unit that is:
    (1) Producing or currently in compliance with the LMU continued 
operation requirements or part 3480 of this chapter; and
    (2) In compliance with the logical mining unit stipulations of 
approval under Sec. 3487.1(e) and (f) of this chapter; or
    (F) Relieved of a producing obligation pursuant to paragraph (e) 
(1), (4), or (5) of this section.
    (f) In order to qualify for a lease on acquired lands set apart for 
military and naval purposes, a governmental entity shall show that it 
produces electrical energy for sale to the public and that it is located 
in the state where the lands subject to the application or bid are 
located.
    (g) Any applicant for a lease for lands in which the United States 
has a future interest shall submit documentation that he or she holds, 
in fee or by lease, the present interest in the coal deposit subject to 
the application.

Sec. 3472.1-3  Acreage limitations.

    (a)(1) No person, association, or corporation, or any subsidiary, 
affiliate, or person controlled by or under common control with such 
person, association, or corporation shall take, hold, own, or control at 
one time Federal coal leases, lease or lease modification applications, 
or bids on more than 46,080 acres in any one state and in no case on 
more than 100,000 acres in the United States.
    (2) No person, association, or corporation holding, owning, or 
controlling leases, lease or lease modification applications or bids 
(individually or through any subsidiary, affiliate, or person under 
common control) on more than 100,000 acres in the United States on 
August 4, 1976, shall be required to relinquish any lease or lease 
application held on that date. However, it shall not be permitted to 
hold any additional interests in any further leases or lease 
applications until such time as its holdings, ownership, or control of 
leases or applications has been reduced below 100,000 acres within the 
United States.
    (b)(1) In computing acreage held, owned or controlled, the 
accountable acreage of a party holding, owning or controlling an 
undivided interest in a lease shall be the party's proportionate part of 
the total lease acreage. Any subsidiary, affiliate or person controlled 
by or under common control with any corporation, person or association 
holding, owning or controlling a Federal coal lease shall be charged 
with lease acreage to the same extent as such corporation, person or 
association. The accountable acreage of a party holding, owning or 
controlling an interest in a corporation or association shall be that 
party's proportionate part of the acreage held, owned or controlled by 
such corporation or association. However, no party shall be charged with 
its pro rata share of any acreage held, owned or controlled by any 
corporation or association unless that party is the beneficial owner of

<R05>


    Note  1: The information collection requirements contained in 43 CFR 
part 3480 which require the filing of forms have been approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3507. The Coal 
Production and Royalty Report form in 30 CFR 211.62(d)(1), U.S. 
Geological Survey Form 9-373A, has been approved by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 
3507 and assigned clearance number 1028-0001.
    The information is being collected for Federal royalty accounting 
purposes. The information will be used to permit accounting and auditing 
of royalties submitted by the operators/lessees of Federal coal leases. 
The obligation to respond is mandatory for all operators/lessees of 
Federal coal leases. For nonproducing Federal leases, the report is 
required on an annual basis. For producing Federal leases, the report is 
required monthly or quarterly as specified in the Federal lease.
    The information collection requirements contained at Secs. 3481.1, 
3481.2, 3482.2, 3482.3, 3483.3, 3483.4, 3485.1, 3485.2, 3486.3 and 
3487.1 of this title have been approved by OMB under

[[Page 585]]

44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1028-0042. The information 
may be collected from some operators/lessees to either provide data so 
that proposed operations may be approved or to enable the monitoring of 
compliance with approvals already granted. The information will be used 
to grant approval to begin or alter operations or to allow operations to 
continue. The obligation to respond is required to obtain the benefit 
under the Federal lease.
    Note  2: There are many leases and agreements currently in effect, 
and which will remain in effect, involving Federal coal leases which 
specifically refer to the United States Geological Survey, USGS, 
Minerals Management Service, MMS, or Conservation Division. These leases 
and agreements also often specifically refer to various officers such as 
Supervisor, Conservation Manager, Deputy Conservation Manager, Minerals 
Manager and Deputy Minerals Manager. In addition, many leases and 
agreements specifically refer to 30 CFR part 211 or specific sections 
thereof. Those references shall now be read to refer to 43 CFR part 3480 
or to the appropriate redesignated section thereof.

   Subpart 3480--Coal Exploration and Mining Operations Rules: General


<R05>
Sec. 3480.0-1  Purpose.

    The purposes of the rules of this part are to ensure orderly and 
efficient development, mining, preparation, and handling operations for 
Federal coal; ensure production practices that prevent wasting or loss 
of coal or other resources; avoid unnecessary damage to coal-bearing or 
mineral-bearing formations; ensure MER of Federal coal; ensure that 
operations meet requirements for diligent development and

[[Page 586]]

continued operation; ensure resource recovery and protection plans are 
submitted and approved in compliance with MLA; ensure effective and 
reasonable regulation of surface and underground coal mining operations; 
require an accurate record and accounting of all coal produced; ensure 
efficient, environmentally sound exploration and mining operations; and 
eliminate duplication of efforts by the Minerals Management Service 
(MMS), OSM, and the States in the Federal coal program.


<R05>
Sec. 3480.0-4  Scope.

    The rules of this part shall govern operations for the exploration, 
development, and production of Federal coal under Federal coal leases, 
licenses, and permits, regardless of surface ownership, pursuant to the 
Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (MLA), and in 
conjunction with the rules at 43 CFR Group 3400 and 30 CFR Chapter VII. 
Included are provisions relating to resource recovery and protection, 
royalties, diligent development, continued operation, maximum economic 
recovery (MER), and logical mining units (LMU's). Except as otherwise 
provided in 25 CFR Chapter I or Indian lands leases, these rules do not 
apply to operations on Indian lands. The provisions in these rules 
relating to advance royalty, diligent development, continued operation, 
MER, and LMU's shall not apply to Indian lands, leases and permits. The 
rules governing exploration licenses for unleased Federal coal are 
codified at 43 CFR part 3410. Until final rulemaking is promulgated and 
implemented by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 
(OSM) regarding the initial Federal lands Programs, the initial Federal 
lands Program rules codified at 30 CFR part 211 (1981) shall remain in 
effect.

3481.4  Temporary interruption in coal severance.


<R05>
3481.4-1  Can I temporarily interrupt coal severance and still be qualified as producing?

    Yes, a temporary interruption in coal severance allows you (the 
lessee/operator) to halt the extraction of coal for a limited period of 
time without jeopardizing your qualifications under section (2)(a)(2)(A) 
of MLA to receive additional leases. During the period of a temporary 
interruption in coal severance, BLM still considers you lease or LMU to 
be producing so as not to preclude you from receiving a new or 
transferred lease.

[62 FR 44370, Aug. 20, 1997]


<R05>
3481.4-2  What are some examples of circumstances that qualify for a temporary interruption of coal severance?

    (a) Movement, failure, or repair of major equipment, such as 
draglines or longwalls; overburden removal; adverse weather; employee 
absences;

[[Page 593]]

    (b) Inability to sever coal due to orders issued by governmental 
authorities for cessation or relocation of the coal severance 
operations; and
    (c) Inability to sell or distribute coal severed from the lease or 
LMU out of or away from the lease or LMU.

[62 FR 44370, Aug. 20, 1997]


<R05>
3481.4-3  Does a temporary interruption in coal severance affect the diligence requirements applicable to my lease or LMU?

    No, a temporary interruption in coal severance covered by 
Secs. 3481.4-1 to 3481.4-4 does not change the diligence requirements of 
subpart 3483 applicable to your lease or LMU.

[62 FR 44370, Aug. 20, 1997]


<R05>
3481.4-4  What is the aggregate amount of time I can temporarily interrupt coal severance and have BLM consider my lease or LMU producing?

    (a) If you (the lessee/operator) want BLM to consider your lease or 
LMU to be producing, the aggregate of all temporary interruptions in 
coal severance from your lease or LMU must not exceed 1 year in the 5-
consecutive-year period immediately preceding the date of BLM's 
determination of lessee qualifications under Sec. 3472.1-2 of this 
chapter.
    (b) BLM will not count toward the aggregate interruption limit 
described in paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Any interruption in coal severance that is 14 days or less in 
duration;
    (2) Any suspension granted under Sec. 3483.3 of this part; and
    (3) Any BLM-approved suspension of the requirements of Sec. 3472.1-
2(e)(1) of this part for reasons of strikes, the elements, or casualties 
not attributable to the operator/lessee before diligent development is 
achieved.

a description of the method to be used to determine those amounts, and 
the proposed use of the coal removed.
    (vii) A description of the measures to be used during exploration 
for Federal coal to comply with the performance standards for 
exploration (Sec. 3484.1(a) of this title) and applicable requirements 
of 30 CFR 815.15 or an approved State program.
    (viii) A map at a scale of 1:24,000 or larger showing the areas of 
land to be affected by the proposed exploration and reclamation. The map 
shall show existing roads, occupied dwellings, and pipelines; proposed 
location of trenches, roads, and other access routes and structures to 
be constructed; applicable Federal lease and license boundaries; the 
location of land excavations to be conducted; coal exploratory holes to 
be drilled or altered; earth- or debris-disposal areas; existing bodies 
of surface water; and topographic and drainage features.
    (ix) The name and address of the owner of record of the surface 
land, if other than the United States. If the surface is owned by a 
person other than the applicant or if the Federal coal is leased to a 
person other than the applicant, a description of the basis upon which 
the applicant claims the right to enter that land for the purpose of 
conducting exploration and reclamation.
    (x) Such other data as may be required by the authorized officer.
    (b) Resource recovery and protection plans. Before conducting any 
Federal coal development or mining operations on Federal leases or 
licenses, the operator/lessee shall submit and obtain approval of a 
resource recovery and protection plan, unless a current resource 
recovery and protection plan has been approved prior to August 30, 1982. 
If the resource recovery and protection plan is submitted solely to meet 
the MLA 3-year submittal requirement, the resource recovery and 
protection plan shall be submitted to the authorized officer. Upon 
receipt of a resource recovery and protection plan, the authorized 
officer will review such plan for completeness and for compliance with 
MLA. Prior to commencement of any coal development or mining operations 
on a Federal lease or license, a permit application package containing, 
among other documents, a resource recovery and protection plan and a 
permit application shall be submitted to the regulatory authority. On 
any Federal lease issued after August 4, 1976, MLA requires that a 
resource recovery and protection plan shall be submitted no later than 3 
years after the effective date of the Federal lease. On any Federal 
lease issued prior to August 4, 1976, MLA requires that a resource 
recovery and protection plan shall be submitted no later than 3 years 
after the effective date of the first lease readjustment after August 4, 
1976, or the effective date of the operator/lessee's election provided 
for at Sec. 3483.1(b)(1) of this title, unless a current resource 
recovery and protection plan has been approved. Any resource recovery 
and protection plan submitted but not approved as of August 30, 1982, 
shall be revised to comply with these rules. A resource recovery and 
protection plan for an LMU shall be submitted to the authorized officer 
as provided in Sec. 3487.1(e)(1) of this title.

[[Page 595]]

    (c) The authorized officer may contact directly operators/lessees 
regarding MLA requirements. The resource recovery and protection plan 
shall contain all the requirements pursuant to MLA for the life-of-the-
mine and, unless previously submitted in an LMU application or as 
directed by the authorized officer, shall include all of the following:
    (1) Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of persons responsible 
for operations to be conducted under the approved plan to whom notices 
and orders are to be delivered; names and addresses of operators/
lessees; Federal lease serial numbers; Federal license serial numbers, 
if appropriate; and names and addresses of surface and subsurface coal 
or other mineral owners of record, if other than the United States.

in a permit application package under SMCRA. The resource recovery and 
protection plan may cross-reference, as appropriate, a permit 
application submitted under SMCRA to fulfill this requirement.
    (6) Any required data which are clearly duplicated in other 
submittals to the regulatory authority or Mine Safety and Health 
Administration may be used to fulfill the requirements of the above 
paragraphs provided that the cross-reference is clearly stated. A copy 
of the relevant portion of such submittals must be included in the 
resource recovery and protection plan.
    (7) Explanation of how MER of the Federal coal will be achieved for 
the Federal coal leases included in the resource recovery and protection 
plan. If a coal bed, or portion thereof, is not to be mined or is to be 
rendered unminable by the operation, the operator/lessee shall submit 
appropriate justification to the authorized officer for approval.

<R05>
Sec. 3482.2  Action on plans.

    (a)(1) Exploration plans. The authorized officer after evaluating a 
proposed exploration plan and all comments received thereon, and after 
consultation with the responsible officer of the surface managing 
agency, and with the regulatory authority when exploration is to be 
conducted within an approved permit area prior to commencement of mining 
operations, shall promptly approve or disapprove in writing an 
exploration plan. In approving an exploration plan, the authorized 
officer shall determine that the exploration plan complies with the 
rules of this part, applicable requirements of 30 CFR 815.15 or an 
approved State program, and any Federal lease or license terms and/or 
conditions. Reclamation must be accomplished as set forth in the 
exploration plan. The authorized officer may impose additional 
conditions to conform to the rules of this part. In disapproving an 
exploration plan, the authorized officer shall state what modifications, 
if any, are necessary to achieve such conformity. No exploration plan 
shall be approved unless the bond, executed pursuant to the provisions 
of 43 CFR part 3474 or 43 CFR part 3410, has been determined by the 
responsible officer of the surface managing agency to be adequate. When 
the land involved in the exploration plan is under the surface 
management jurisdiction of an agency other than DOI, that other agency 
must concur with the approval terms of the exploration plan.
    (2) Resource recovery and protection plans. No resource recovery and 
protection plan or modification thereto shall be approved which is not 
in conformance with the rules of this part, any Federal lease or license 
terms and/or conditions, and is not found to achieve MER of the Federal 
coal within an LMU or Federal lease issued or readjusted after August 4, 
1976. The determination of MER shall be made by the authorized officer 
based on review of the resource recovery and protection plan. No 
resource recovery and protection plan shall be approved prior to the 
filing of a complete permit application package and unless the Federal 
lease bond, executed pursuant to the provisions of 43 CFR part 3474 has 
been determined by the authorized officer to be adequate.
    (3) Recoverable coal reserves estimates. For all Federal coal leases 
issued or readjusted after August 4, 1976, the recoverable coal reserves 
or LMU recoverable coal reserves shall be those estimated by the 
authorized officer as of the date of approval of the resource recovery 
and protection plan, or the date of approval of any existing mining plan 
as defined at 30 CFR 740.5 (1981). If an operator/lessee credits 
production toward diligent development in accordance with Sec. 3483.5 of 
this title, such credits shall be included in the recoverable coal 
reserves or LMU recoverable coal reserves estimates. The estimate of 
recoverable coal reserves or LMU recoverable coal reserves may only be 
revised as new information becomes available. Estimates of recoverable 
coal reserves or LMU recoverable coal

[[Page 597]]

reserves shall not be reduced due to any production after the original 
estimate made by the authorized officer.
    (b) Changes in plans by authorized officer. (1) Approved exploration 
plans may be required to be revised or supplemented at any time by the 
authorized officer, after consultation with the operator/lessee and the 
responsible officer of the surface managing agency as necessary, to 
adjust to changed conditions, to correct oversights, or to reflect 
changes in legal requirements.
    (2) The authorized officer, pursuant to MLA, may require approved 
resource recovery and protection plans to be revised or supplemented 
reasonably for modifications, after consultation with the operator/
lessee and the regulatory authority as necessary, to adjust to changed 
conditions, to correct oversights, or to reflect changes in legal 
requirements. Such revisions shall be made in writing, as appropriate, 
and the authorized officer shall submit a copy to the regulatory 
authority.
    (c) Changes in plans by operator/lessee. (1) The operator/lessee may 
propose modifications to an approved exploration plan and shall submit a 
written statement of the proposed change and its justification to the 
authorized officer. The authorized officer shall promptly approve or 
disapprove in writing any such modifications, after consultation with 
the responsible officer of the managing agency and the regulatory 
authority as necessary, or specify conditions under which they would be 
acceptable.
    (2) The operator/lessee may propose modifications to an approved 
resource recovery and protection plan for any requirements under MLA, 
and shall submit a written statement of the proposed change and its 
justification to the authorized officer. The authorized officer shall 
promptly approve or disapprove in writing any such modifications, after 
consultation with the regulatory authority as necessary, or specify 
conditions under which they would be acceptable. Upon approval of 
modifications, the authorized officer shall submit a copy to the 
regulatory authority.

<R05>
Sec. 3482.3  Mining operations maps.

    (a) General requirements. Upon commencement of mining operations, 
the operator/lessee shall maintain accurate and up-to-date maps of the 
mine, drawn to scales acceptable to the authorized officer. Before a 
mine or section of a mine is abandoned, closed, or made inaccessible, a 
survey of the mine or section shall be made by the operator/lessee and 
recorded on such maps. All excavations in each separate coal bed shall 
be shown in such a manner that the production of coal for any royalty 
reporting period can be accurately ascertained. Additionally, the maps 
shall show the name of the mine; name of the operator/lessee; Federal 
lease or license serial number(s); permit number; Federal lease and 
permit boundary lines; surface buildings; dip of the coal bed(s); true 
north; map scale; map explanation; location, diameter, and depth of 
auger holes; improvements; topography, including subsidence resulting 
from mining; geologic conditions as determined from outcrops, drill 
holes, exploration, or mining; any unusual geologic or other occurrences 
such as dikes, faults, splits, unusual water occurrences, or other 
conditions that may influence MER; and other information that the 
authorized officer may request. Copies of such maps shall be properly 
posted to date and furnished, in duplicate, to the authorized officer 
annually, or at such other times as the authorized officer requests. 
Copies of any maps, normally submitted to the regulatory authority, Mine 
Safety and Health Administration, or other State or Federal Agencies, 
that show all of the specific data required by this paragraph or 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be acceptable in 
fulfilling these requirements.
    (b) Underground mine maps. Underground mine maps, in addition to the 
general requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, shall show all 
mine workings; the date of extension of the

[[Page 598]]

mine workings; an illustrative coal section at the face of each working 
unit; location of all surface mine fans; ventilation stoppings, doors, 
overcasts, undercasts, permanent seals, and regulators; direction of the 
ventilating current in the various parts of the mine at the time of 
making the latest surveys; sealed areas; known bodies of standing water 
in other mine workings, either in, above, or below the active workings 
of the mine; areas affected by squeezes; elevations of surface and 
underground levels of all shafts, slopes, or drifts, and elevation of 
the floor, bottom of the mine workings, or mine survey stations in the 
roof at regular intervals in main entries, panels, or sections; and sump 
areas. Any maps submitted to the regulatory authority to be used to 
monitor subsidence shall also be submitted to the authorized officer.
    (c) Surface mine maps. Surface mine maps, in addition to the general 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, shall include the date of 
extension of the mine workings and a detailed stratigraphic section at 
intervals specified in the approved resource recovery and protection 
plan. Such maps shall show areas from which coal has been removed; the 
highwall; fenders; uncovered, but unmined, coal beds; and elevation of 
the top of the coal beds.
    (d) Vertical projections and cross sections of mine workings. When 
required by the authorized officer, vertical projections and cross 
sections shall accompany plan views.
    (e) Accuracy of maps. The accuracy of maps furnished shall meet 
standards acceptable to the authorized officer and shall be certified by 
a professional engineer, professional land surveyor, or other such 
professionally qualified person.
    (f) Liability of operator/lessee for expense of survey. If the 
operator/lessee fails to furnish a required or requested map within a 
reasonable time, the authorized officer, if necessary, shall employ a 
professionally qualified person to make the required survey and map, the 
cost of which shall be charged to, and promptly paid by, the operator/
lessee.
    (g) Incorrect maps. If any map submitted by an operator/lessee is 
believed to be incorrect, and the operator/lessee cannot verify the map 
or supply a corrected map, the authorized officer may employ a 
professionally qualified person to make a survey and any necessary maps. 
If the survey shows the maps submitted by the operator/lessee to be 
substantially incorrect, in whole or in part, the cost of making the 
survey and preparing the maps shall be charged to, and promptly paid by, 
the operator/lessee.

<R05>
Sec. 3483.2  Termination or cancellation for failure to meet diligent development and maintain continued operation.

    (a) Any Federal coal lease or LMU which has not achieved diligent 
development shall be terminated by DOI.
    (b) After an LMU has been terminated under the provision of 
paragraph (a) of this section, any Federal coal lease included in that 
LMU shall then be subject to the diligent development and continued 
operation requirements that would have been imposed on that Federal 
lease by the rules of this part, as if the Federal lease had not been 
included in the LMU.
    (c) Any Federal coal lease on which continued operation is not 
maintained shall be subject to cancellation.
    (d) The DOI may cancel any Federal coal lease or LMU which fails to 
meet the requirement for submission of a resource recovery and 
protection plan.


<R05>
Sec. 3483.3  Suspension of continued operation or operations and production.

    (a) Applications for suspensions of continued operation must be 
filed in triplicate in the office of the authorized officer. The 
authorized officer, if he or she determines an application to be in the 
public interest, may approve the application or terminate suspensions 
that have been or may be granted.
    (1) The authorized officer must suspend the requirement for 
continued operation by the period of time he or she determines that 
strikes, the elements, or casualties not attributable to the operator/
lessee have interrupted operations under the Federal coal lease or LMU.
    (2) The authorized officer may suspend the requirement for continued 
operation upon the payment of advance royalty in accordance with 
Sec. 3481.0-6 of this title for any operation. The authorized officer, 
upon notifying the operator/lessee 6 months in advance, may cease to 
accept advance royalty in lieu of the requirement for continued 
operation.
    (b) In the interest of conservation, the authorized officer is 
authorized to act on applications for suspension of operations and 
production filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, direct 
suspension of operations and production, and terminate such suspensions 
which have been or may be granted. Applications by an operator/lessee 
for relief from any operations and production requirements of a Federal 
lease shall contain justification for the suspension and shall be filed 
in triplicate in the office of the authorized officer.
    (1) A suspension in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section 
shall take effect as of the time specified by the authorized officer. 
Any such suspension of a Federal coal lease or LMU approved by the 
authorized officer also suspends all other terms and conditions of the 
Federal coal lease or LMU, for the entire period of such a suspension. 
Rental and royalty payments will be suspended during the period of such 
suspension of all operations and production, beginning with the first 
day of the Federal lease month on which the suspension of operations and 
production becomes effective. Rental and royalty payments shall resume 
on the first day of the Federal lease month in which operations or 
production is resumed. Where rentals are creditable against royalties 
and have been paid in advance, proper credit shall be allowed

[[Page 600]]

on the next rental or royalty on producing Federal leases due under the 
Federal lease.
    (2) The minimum annual production requirements shall be 
proportionately reduced for that portion of a Federal lease year for 
which suspension of operations and production is directed or granted by 
the authorized officer, in the interest of conservation of recoverable 
coal reserves and other resources, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (3) The term, including the diligent development period, of any 
Federal lease shall be extended by adding to it any period of suspension 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, of operations and 
production.
    (4) A suspension in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section 
does not suspend the permit and the operator/lessee's reclamation 
obligation under the permit.

Sec. 3483.4  Payment of advance royalty in lieu of continued operation.

    (a) Advance royalty may only be accepted in lieu of continued 
operation upon application to and approval by the authorized officer.
    (b) However, any request by an operator/lessee for suspension of the 
continued operation requirement and payment of advance royalty in lieu 
thereof shall be made no later than 30 days after the beginning of the 
continued operation year. If an operator/lessee requests authorization 
to pay advance royalty in lieu of continued operation later than 30 days 
after the beginning of any continued operation year, the authorized 
officer may condition acceptance of advance royalty on the payment of a 
late payment charge on the amount of the advance royalty due. The late 
payment charge will be calculated in accordance with 30 CFR 218.20.
    (c) For advance royalty purposes, the value of the Federal coal will 
be calculated in accordance with Sec. 3485.2 of this title and this 
section. When advance royalty is accepted in lieu of continued 
operation, it shall be paid in an amount equivalent to the production 
royalty that would be owed on the production of 1 percent of the 
recoverable coal reserves or the Federal LMU recoverable coal reserves. 
The advance royalty rate for an LMU shall be deemed to be 8 percent 
where the Federal LMU recoverable coal reserves contained in the LMU 
would be recovered by only underground mining operations and 12\1/2\ 
percent where the Federal LMU recoverable coal reserves contained in the 
LMU would be recovered only by other mining operations. For LMU's that 
contain Federal LMU recoverable coal reserves that would be recovered by 
a combination of underground and other mining methods, the advance 
royalty rate shall be deemed to be 12\1/2\ percent. The unit value of 
the recoverable coal reserves for determining the advance royalty 
payment for a Federal lease or LMU shall be:
    (1) The unit value for production royalty purposes of coal produced 
and sold under the Federal coal lease or LMU during the immediately 
preceding production royalty payment period; or
    (2) Computed at the average unit price at which coal from other 
Federal leases in the same region was sold during such period, if no 
coal was produced and sold under the Federal coal lease or LMU during 
the immediately preceding royalty payment period, or if the authorized 
officer finds that there is an insufficient number of such sales to 
determine such value equitably; or
    (3) Determined by the authorized officer, if there were no sales of 
Federal coal from such region during such period or if the authorized 
officer finds that there is an insufficient number of such sales to 
determine such value equitably.
    (d) The aggregate number of years during the period of any Federal 
coal lease or LMU for which advance royalty may be accepted in lieu of 
the requirement of continued operation shall not exceed 10. For Federal 
leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, advance royalty shall not be 
accepted in lieu of continued operation for more than a total of 10 
years following the first lease readjustment after August 4, 1976. Any 
continued operation year in which any advance royalty is paid shall be 
deemed a

[[Page 601]]

year in which advance royalty is accepted in lieu of continued operation 
for the purposes of this paragraph. However, if an operator/lessee meets 
the requirement for continued operation in any continued operation year 
in which the operator/lessee has paid advance royalty, such year shall 
not be considered when calculating the maximum number of years for which 
advance royalty may be accepted for the Federal lease or LMU. The number 
of years for which advance royalty has been paid under any Federal coal 
lease prior to its inclusion in an LMU shall not be considered when 
calculating the maximum number of years for which advance royalty may be 
accepted for the LMU.
    (e) The dollar amount of any production royalty for a Federal coal 
lease or LMU owed for any continued operation year during or subsequent 
to the continued operation year in which advance royalty is paid, shall 
be reduced (but not below zero) by the dollar amount of any advance 
royalty paid under that Federal lease or LMU to the extent that such 
advance royalty has not been used to reduce production royalty for a 
prior year.
    (f) No advance royalty paid during the initial 20-year term of a 
Federal coal lease or LMU shall be used to reduce a production royalty 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section after the 20th year of the 
Federal coal lease or LMU. For purposes of this paragraph, the initial 
20-year term of a Federal lease shall commence on the effective date of 
the Federal lease for all Federal leases issued after August 4, 1976; on 
the effective date of the first lease readjustment after August 4, 1976, 
for all Federal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976; and on the 
effective date of LMU approval for all LMU's. Any advance royalty paid 
on a Federal lease prior to its inclusion in an LMU shall be credited to 
the LMU and shall be considered to have been paid on the date of LMU 
approval for the purposes of this paragraph, provided that the Federal 
lease has been included in an LMU within the initial 20-year term of the 
Federal lease as determined in this paragraph and to the extent that the 
advance royalty has not already been credited against production royalty 
on the Federal lease.
    (g) If an operator/lessee fails to make an approved advance royalty 
payment in any continued operation year, the authorized officer shall 
inform the operator/lessee in writing that the operator/lessee is in 
violation of the continued operation requirement. If the operator/lessee 
then fails to comply with 30 CFR 218.200, the Federal lease or LMU shall 
be subject to cancellation pursuant to Sec. 3483.2 of this title.

Sec. 3483.5  Crediting of production toward diligent development.

    (a) For Federal coal leases issued after August 4, 1976, all 
production after the effective date of the Federal lease shall be 
credited toward diligent development.
    (b) For Federal coal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, all 
production after the effective date of the first lease readjustment 
after August 4, 1976, shall be credited toward diligent development.
    (c) For Federal coal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, that 
have not been readjusted after August 4, 1976, if the operator/lessee 
has elected under Sec. 3483.1 of this title to be subject to the 
diligent development and continued operation requirements of the rules 
of this part, all production after the effective date of the operator/
lessee's election shall be applied toward diligent development.
    (d) For Federal coal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, that 
have not been readjusted after August 4, 1976, if the operator/lessee 
has elected under Sec. 3483.1 of this title to be subject to the 
diligent development and continued operation requirements of the rules 
of this part, all production after August 4, 1976, that occurred prior 
to the effective date of the operator/lessee's election shall be applied 
toward diligent development if the operator/lessee so requests.
    (e) For Federal coal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, that 
have been readjusted after August 4, 1976, all production after August 
4, 1976, that occurred prior to the effective date of the

[[Page 602]]

first lease readjustment after August 4, 1976, shall be applied toward 
diligent development if the operator/lessee so requests. Such a request 
shall comply with the election application provisions at 
Sec. 3483.1(b)(1) of this title. Any production after such readjustment 
shall be applied toward diligent development pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (f) For Federal coal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, that are 
governed by the Federal lease clauses which describe the minimum 
production requirements until the first lease readjustment after August 
4, 1976, no production prior to the effective date of that first Federal 
lease readjustment shall be applied toward diligent development.
    (g) For LMU's, any production credited under the rules of this part 
to a Federal lease prior to its inclusion in the LMU shall be applied 
toward diligent development for the LMU.


<R05>
Sec. 3483.6  Special logical mining unit rules.

    (a) Production anywhere within the LMU, of either Federal or non-
Federal recoverable coal reserves or a combination thereof, shall be 
applied toward satisfaction of the requirements of the rules of this 
part for achievement of diligent development and continued operation for 
the LMU.
    (b) The dates for submission of a resource recovery and protection 
plan and achievement of diligent development shall not be changed by any 
enlargement or diminution of the LMU.


<R04>
                   Subpart 3484--Performance Standards


<R05>
Sec. 3484.1  Performance standards for exploration and surface and underground mining.

    The following performance standards shall apply to exploration, 
development, production, resource recovery and protection, MER, and 
preparation and handling of coal under Federal leases and licenses, and 
LMU's.
    (a) Performance standards for exploration. (1) The operator/lessee 
shall comply with the standards of the rules of this part and with all 
applicable requirements of the surface management agency, 30 CFR 815.15, 
or an approved State program.
    (2) The operator/lessee, if required by the authorized officer, 
shall set and cement casing in the hole and install suitable blowout 
prevention equipment when drilling on lands valuable or prospectively 
valuable for oil, gas, or geothermal resources.
    (3) All exploration drill holes must be capped with at least 5 feet 
of cement and plugged with a permanent plugging material that is 
unaffected by water and hydrocarbon gases and will prevent the migration 
of gases and water in the drill hole under normal hole pressures. For 
exploration holes drilled deeper than stripping limits, the operator/
lessee, using cement or other suitable plugging material approved by the 
authorized officer, shall plug the hole through the thickness of the 
coal bed(s) or mineral deposit(s) and through aquifers for a distance of 
at least 50 feet above and below the coal bed(s) or mineral deposit(s) 
and aquifers, or to the bottom of the drill hole. A lesser cap or plug 
may be approved by the authorized officer. Exploration activities shall 
be managed to prevent water pollution and mixing of ground and surface 
waters and ensure the safety of people, livestock, and wildlife.
    (4) The operator/lessee shall retain for 1 year, unless a shorter 
time period is authorized by the authorized officer, all drill and 
geophysical logs and shall make such logs available for inspection or 
analysis by the authorized officer, if requested. The authorized 
officer, at his discretion, may require the operator/lessee to retain 
representative samples of drill cores for 1 year. Confidentiality of 
such information will be accorded pursuant to the provisions at 
Sec. 3481.3 of this title.
    (5) The operator/lessee may utilize exploration drill holes as 
surveillance wells for the purpose of monitoring the effects of 
subsequent operations on the quantity, quality, or pressure of ground 
water or mine gases only with the written approval of the authorized 
officer, in consultation with the regulatory authority. The operator/
lessee may convert exploration drill holes to water wells only after 
approval of the operator/lessee's written request by the

[[Page 603]]

authorized officer and the surface owner or authorized officer, in 
consultation with the regulatory authority. All such approvals shall be 
accompanied by a corresponding transfer of responsibility for any 
liability including eventual plugging, reclamation, and abandonment. 
Nothing in this paragraph shall supersede or affect the applicability of 
any State law requirements for such a transfer, conversion, or 
utilization as a supply for domestic consumption.
    (b) General performance standards for surface and underground 
mining--(1) Maximum economic recovery (MER). Upon approval of a resource 
recovery and protection plan for an LMU, or for a Federal lease issued 
or readjusted after August 4, 1976, the operator/lessee shall conduct 
operations to achieve MER of the Federal coal. To determine that MER of 
the Federal coal will be achieved, the authorized officer shall consider 
the information submitted by the operator/lessee under Sec. 3482.1(c) 
and/or Sec. 3487.1(c) of this title. The authorized officer may request 
additional information from the operator/lessee to aid in the MER 
determination. The operator/lessee shall consider coal preparation 
operations to avoid the wasting of coal and to encourage the achievement 
of MER. Federal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, that have not yet 
been readjusted after August 4, 1976, shall comply with MLA regarding 
conservation of the recoverable coal reserves and other resources.
    (2) Diligent development, continued operation, advance royalty, and 
3-year resource recovery and protection plan submission requirements are 
addressed at Secs. 3483.1 through 3483.6 of this title.
    (3) Unexpected wells. The operator/lessee shall notify the 
authorized officer promptly if operations encounter unexpected wells or 
drill holes which could adversely affect the recovery of coal during 
mining operations, and shall take no further action that would disturb 
such wells or drill holes without the approval of the authorized 
officer.
    (4) Resource recovery and protection. The operator/lessee shall 
conduct efficient operations to recover the recoverable coal reserves; 
prevent wasting and conserve the recoverable coal reserves and other 
resources; prevent damage or degradation to coal-bearing or mineral-
bearing formations; and ensure that other resources are protected upon 
abandonment.
    (5) Release of lease bond. Subsequent to permanent abandonment of 
mining operations, the authorized officer will determine if the 
operator/lessee has met obligations required under the Federal lease for 
resource recovery and protection, and will determine if the operator/
lessee has met the Federal lease requirements pertaining to rentals and 
royalties. The authorized officer will make appropriate recommendations 
to the authorized officer for reduction or termination of the Federal 
lease bond.
    (c) Performance standards for underground mines--(1) Underground 
resource recovery. Underground mining operations shall be conducted so 
as to prevent wasting of coal and to conserve recoverable coal reserves 
consistent with the protection and use of other resources. No entry, 
room, or panel workings in which the pillars have not been completely 
mined within safe limits shall be permanently abandoned or rendered 
inaccessible, except with the prior written approval of the authorized 
officer.
    (2) Subsidence. The operator/lessee shall adopt mining methods which 
ensure proper recovery of recoverable coal reserves under MLA, as 
determined by the authorized officer. Operators/lessees of underground 
coal mines shall adopt measures consistent with known technology in 
order to prevent or, where the mining method used requires subsidence, 
control subsidence, maximize mine stability, and maintain the value and 
use of surface lands consistent with 30 CFR 784.20 and 817.121, 817.122, 
817.124, and 817.126, or applicable requirements of an approved State 
program. Where pillars are not removed and controlled subsidence is not 
part of the resource recovery and protection plan, pillars of adequate 
dimensions shall be left for surface stability, giving due consideration 
to the thickness and strength of the coal beds and the strata above and 
immediately below the coal beds.
    (3) Top coal. Top coal may be left in underground mines only upon 
approval

[[Page 604]]

by the authorized officer. The determination of mining height in thick 
coal beds will take into consideration safety factors, available 
equipment, overall coal bed thickness, and MER. The bottom coal left, if 
determined by the authorized officer to be of a minable thickness, 
should be maintained at a uniform thickness to allow recovery in the 
future as new technology is developed and economics allow.
    (4) Multiple coal bed mining. (i) In general, the recoverable coal 
reserves in the upper coal beds shall be mined before the lower coal 
beds; simultaneous workings in each upper coal bed shall be kept in 
advance of the workings in each lower coal bed. The authorized officer 
may authorize mining of any lower coal beds before mining the upper coal 
bed(s) only after a technical justification, submitted to the authorized 
officer by the operator/lessee, shows that recovery of all coal bed(s) 
will not be adversely affected.
    (ii) In areas subject to multiple coal bed mining, the protective 
barrier pillars for all main and secondary development entries, main 
haulageways, primary aircourses, bleeder entries, and manways in each 
coal bed shall be superimposed regardless of vertical separation or rock 
competency; however, modifications and exceptions to, or variations 
from, this requirement may be approved in advance by the authorized 
officer.
    (5) The authorized officer shall approve the conditions under which 
an underground mine, or portions thereof, will be temporarily abandoned, 
pursuant to the rules of this part.
    (6) Barrier pillars left for support. (i) The operator/lessee shall 
not, without prior consent of the authorized officer, mine any 
recoverable coal reserves or drive any underground workings within 50 
feet of any of the outside boundary lines of the federally leased or 
licensed land, or within such greater distance of said boundary lines as 
the authorized officer may prescribe with consideration for State or 
Federal environmental or safety laws. The operator/lessee may be 
required to pay for unauthorized mining of barrier pillars. The 
authorized officer may require that payment shall be up to, and include, 
the full value of the recoverable coal reserves mined from the pillars. 
The drilling of any lateral holes within 50 feet of any outside boundary 
shall be done in consultation with the authorized officer.
    (ii) If the coal in adjoining premises has been worked out, an 
agreement shall be made with the coal owner prior to the mining of the 
coal remaining in the Federal barrier pillars which otherwise may be 
lost. If the water level beyond the pillar is below the operator/
lessee's adjacent operations, and all the safety factors have been 
considered, the operator/lessee, on the written order of the authorized 
officer, shall mine out and remove all available Federal recoverable 
coal reserves in such barrier if it can be mined without undue hardship 
to the operator/lessee; with due consideration for safety; and pursuant 
to existing mining, reclamation, and environmental laws and rules. 
Either the operator/lessee or the authorized officer may initiate the 
proposal to mine coal in a barrier pillar.
    (7) The abandonment of a mining area shall require the approval of 
the authorized officer.
    (d) Performance standards for surface mines. (1) Pit widths for each 
coal bed shall be engineered and designed so as to eliminate or minimize 
the amount of coal fender to be left as a permanent pillar on the spoil 
side of the pit.
    (2) The amount of bottom or rider coal beds wasted in each pit will 
be minimized consistent with individual mine economics and the coal 
quality standards that must be maintained by the operation.
    (3) The abandonment of a mining area shall require the approval of 
the authorized officer.
    (4) If a coal bed exposed by surface mining or an accumulation of 
slack coal or combustible waste becomes ignited, the operator/lessee 
shall immediately take all necessary steps to extinguish the fire and 
protect the remaining coal.
    (5) The authorized officer shall approve the conditions under which 
a surface mine, or portions thereof, will be temporarily abandoned, 
pursuant to the rules of this part.
    (6) Barrier or boundary coal. The operator/lessee shall be 
encouraged by the authorized officer, in the interest of

[[Page 605]]

conservation of recoverable coal reserves and other resources, to mine 
coal up to the Federal lease or license boundary line; provided that, 
the mining is in compliance with existing State and Federal mining, 
environmental and reclamation laws and rules, the mining does not 
conflict with existing surface rights, and the mining is carried out 
without undue hardship to the operator/lessee and with due consideration 
for safety.
    (e) Performance standards for auger mines. (1) If auger mining is 
proposed, the authorized officer shall take into account the percentage 
of recovery, which in general shall exceed 30 percent, and the probable 
effect on recovering the remaining adjacent recoverable coal reserves by 
underground mining. If underground mining from the highwall or outcrop 
is contemplated in the foreseeable future, auger mining may not be 
approved if underground mining would ensure greater recovery of the 
unmined recoverable coal reserves. Where auger mining is authorized, the 
authorized officer will require a sufficient number and size of pillars 
at regular intervals along the highwall or outcrop to ensure access to 
the unmined recoverable coal reserves.
    (2) A plan for recovery of recoverable coal reserves by auger 
methods shall be designed to achieve MER.
    (3) Auger mining must comply with the rules of this part, and 30 CFR 
Chapter VII or applicable requirements of an approved State program.

<R05>
Sec. 3484.2  Completion of operations and permanent abandonment.

    (a) Before permanent abandonment of exploration operations, all 
openings and excavations shall be closed, backfilled, or otherwise 
permanently dealt with in accordance with sound engineering practices 
and according to the approved exploration plan. Drill holes, trenches, 
and other excavations for exploration shall be abandoned in such a 
manner as to protect the surface and not endanger any present or future 
underground operation, or any deposit of coal, oil, gas, mineral 
resources, or ground water. Areas disturbed by exploration operations 
will be graded, drained, and revegetated.
    (b) Upon permanent abandonment of mining operations, the authorized 
officer will require that the unmined recoverable coal reserves and 
other resources be adequately protected. Upon completion of abandonment, 
the authorized officer will inform the responsible office of the surface 
managing agency and regulatory authority as to whether the abandonment 
has been completed in compliance with the rules of this part.

              Subpart 3485--Reports, Royalties and Records


<R05>
Sec. 3485.1  Reports.

    (a) Exploration reports. The operator/lessee shall file with the 
authorized officer the information required in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Such filing shall be within 30 days after the end of each 
calendar year and promptly upon completion or suspension of exploration 
operations, unless otherwise provided in the exploration license or 
Federal lease, and at such other times as the authorized officer may 
request.
    (b) Exploration report content. The exploration report shall contain 
the following information:
    (1) Location(s) and serial number(s) of the federally leased or 
licensed lands.
    (2) Nature of exploration operations.
    (3) Number of holes drilled and/or other work performed during the 
year or report period.
    (4) Total footage drilled during the year or other period as 
determined by the authorized officer.
    (5) Map showing all holes drilled, other excavations, and the coal 
outcrop lines.
    (6) Analyses of coal and other pertinent tests obtained from 
exploration operations during the year.
    (7) Copies of all in-hole mechanical or geophysical stratigraphic 
surveys or logs, such as electric logs, gamma ray-neutron logs, sonic 
logs, or any other logs. The records shall include a log of all strata 
penetrated and conditions encountered such as water, quicksand, gas, or 
any unusual conditions.
    (8) Status of reclamation of the disturbed areas.

[[Page 606]]

    (9) A statement on availability and location of all drill hole logs 
and representative drill cores retained by the operator/lessee pursuant 
to Sec. 3484.1(a) of this title.
    (10) Any other information requested by the authorized officer.
    (c) Any coal reserve base, minable reserve base or recoverable coal 
reserves estimates generated from an exploration license shall be 
submitted to the authorized officer within 1 year after completion of 
drilling operations.
    (d) Production reports and payments. (1) Operators/lessees shall 
report on USGS Form 9-373A, within 30 days after expiration of the 
period covered by the report, all coal mined, the basis for computing 
Federal royalty and any other form requirements, and shall make all 
payments due. Acceptance of the report and payment shall not be 
construed as an accord and satisfaction on the operator/lessee's Federal 
royalty obligation.
    (2) Licensees shall report all coal mined on a semiannual basis on 
the report form provided.
    (3) Non-Federal LMU production shall be reported in accordance with 
Sec. 3487.1(h)(1) of this title.
    (e) Penalty. If an operator/lessee knowingly records or reports less 
than the true weight or value of coal mined, the authorized officer 
shall impose a penalty equal to either double the amount of Federal 
royalty due on the shortage or the full value, as determined in 
Sec. 3485.2 of this title, of the shortage. If, after notice, an 
operator/lessee or licensee maintains false records or files false 
reports, the authorized officer may recommend to the responsible officer 
of the surface managing agency that action be initiated to cancel the 
Federal lease or license, in addition to the imposition of any 
penalties.
    (f) Confidentiality. Confidentiality of any information required 
under this section shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 3487.1(h)(1) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3485.2  Royalties.

    (a) Provisions for the payment of advance royalty in lieu of 
continued operation are contained at Sec. 3483.4 of this title.
    (b) An overriding royalty interest, production payment, or similar 
interest that exceeds 50 percent of royalty first payable to the United 
States under the Federal lease, or when added to any other overriding 
royalty interest exceeds that percentage, except those created in order 
to finance a mine, shall not be created by a Federal lease transfer or 
surface owner consent. However, when an interest in the Federal lease or 
operating agreement is transferred, the transferor may retain an 
overriding royalty in excess of the above limitation if he shows that he 
has made substantial investments for improvements directly related to 
exploration, development, and mining on the land covered by the transfer 
that would justify a higher payment.
    (c)(1) The authorized officer may waive, suspend, or reduce the 
rental on a Federal lease, or reduce the Federal royalty, but not 
advance royalty, on a Federal lease or portion thereof. The authorized 
officer shall take such action for the purpose of encouraging the 
greatest ultimate recovery of Federal coal, and in the interest of 
conservation of Federal coal and other resources, whenever in his 
judgment it is necessary to promote development, or if he finds that the 
Federal lease cannot be successfully operated under its terms. In no 
case shall the authorized officer reduce to zero any royalty on a 
producing Federal lease.
    (2) An application for any of the above benefits shall be filed in 
triplicate in the office of the authorized officer. The application 
shall contain the serial number of the Federal lease, the Bureau of Land 
Management State Office, the name and address of the record title holder 
and any operator/lessee, and the description of the lands in the manner 
provided by 43 CFR 3471.1.
    (i) Each application shall include the name and location of the 
mine; a map showing the extent of the existing, proposed or adjoining 
mining operations; a tabulated statement of the Federal coal mined, if 
any, and subject to Federal royalty for the existing or adjoining 
operation covering a period of not less than 12 months before the date 
of filing of the application; and existing Federal rental and royalty 
rates on

[[Page 607]]

Federal leases covered by the application.
    (ii) Each application shall contain a detailed statement of expenses 
and costs of operating the entire mine, the income from the sale of 
coal, and all facts indicating whether the mine can be successfully 
operated under the Federal rental and royalty provisions fixed in the 
Federal lease or why the reduction is necessary to promote development. 
Where the application is for a reduction in Federal royalty, full 
information shall be furnished as to whether royalties or payments out 
of production are paid to parties other than the United States, the 
amounts so paid, and efforts made to reduce them, if any. If the Federal 
lease included in the application is not part of nor adjoining an 
operating mine, these detailed financial data may be obtained from 
another operating mine which is in close proximity and for which the 
authorized officer has deemed to have similar operating characteristics.
    (iii) The applicant shall also file a copy of agreements, between 
the operator/lessee and the holders of any royalty interests or 
production payments other than those created in order to finance a mine, 
to a reduction of all other royalties from the Federal lease so that the 
total royalties and production payments owed the holders of these 
interests will not be in excess of one-half of the Federal royalties, 
should the Federal royalty reduction be granted.
    (3) If the applicant does not meet the criteria of the rules of this 
part, the authorized officer shall reject such application or request 
more data from the operator/lessee.
    (4) If the applicant meets the criteria of the rules of this part, 
the authorized officer shall act on the application.
    (d) If a Federal coal lease that provides for a cents-per-ton

<R05>
Sec. 3486.3  Enforcement.

    (a) If the authorized officer determines that an operator/lessee has 
failed to comply with the rules of this part, the terms and conditions 
of the Federal lease or license, the requirements of approved 
exploration or resource recovery and protection plans, or orders of the 
authorized officer, and such noncompliance does not threaten immediate 
and serious damage to the mine, the deposit being mined, valuable ore-
bearing mineral deposits or other resources, or affect the royalty 
provisions of the rules of this part, the authorized officer shall serve 
a notice of noncompliance upon the operator/lessee by delivery in person 
to him or his agent, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, 
addressed to the operator/lessee at his last known address. Failure of 
the operator/lessee to take action in accordance with the notice of 
noncompliance within the time limits specified by the authorized officer 
shall be grounds for cessation of operations upon notice by the 
authorized officer. The authorized officer may also recommend to the 
authorized officer the initiation of action for cancellation of the 
Federal lease or license and forfeiture of any Federal lease bonds.
    (b) The notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect(s) the 
operator/lessee has failed to comply with the rules of this part, the 
terms and conditions of the Federal lease or license, the requirements 
of approved exploration or resource recovery and protection plans, or 
orders of the authorized officer, and shall specify the action that must 
be taken to correct such noncompliance and the time limits within which 
such action must be taken.
    (c) If, in the judgment of the authorized officer, an operator/
lessee is conducting activities which fail to comply with the rules of 
this part, the terms and conditions of the Federal lease or license, the 
requirements of approved exploration or resource recovery and protection 
plans, or orders of the authorized officer, and/or which threaten 
immediate and serious damage to the mine, the deposit being mined, 
valuable ore-bearing mineral deposits, or, regarding exploration, the 
environment, the authorized officer shall order the immediate cessation 
of such activities without prior notice of noncompliance.
    (d) A written report shall be submitted by the operator/lessee to 
the authorized officer when such noncompliance has been corrected. Upon 
concurrence by the authorized officer that the conditions which 
warranted the issuance of a notice or order of noncompliance have been 
corrected, the authorized officer shall so notify the operator/lessee in 
writing.
    (e) The authorized officer shall enforce requirements of SMCRA only 
if he finds a violation, condition, or practice that he determines to be 
an emergency situation for which an authorized representative of the 
Secretary is required to act pursuant to 30 CFR 843.11 and 843.12.

                    Subpart 3487--Logical Mining Unit


<R05>
Sec. 3487.1  Logical mining units.

    (a) An LMU shall become effective only upon approval of the 
authorized officer. The effective date for an LMU may be established by 
the authorized officer between the date that the authorized officer 
receives an application for LMU approval and the date the authorized 
officer approves the LMU. The effective date of the LMU approval shall 
be determined by the authorized officer in consultation with the LMU 
applicant. An LMU may be enlarged by the addition of other Federal coal 
leases or with interests in non-Federal coal deposits, or both, in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. An LMU may be diminished 
by creation of other separate Federal leases or LMU's in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) The authorized officer may direct, or an operator/lessee may 
initiate, the establishment of an LMU containing only Federal coal 
leases issued after August 4, 1976. The authorized officer may direct, 
or an operator/lessee may initiate, the establishment of an LMU 
containing Federal coal leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, provided 
that the operators/lessees consent to making all such Federal leases 
within the LMU subject to the uniform requirements for submittal of a 
resource recovery and protection plan, LMU recoverable coal reserves 
exhaustion, diligent development, continued operation, MER, advance 
royalty, and royalty reporting periods (but not royalty rates) made 
applicable by the LMU stipulations and the rules of this part. Any 
Federal lease included in an LMU shall have its terms amended as 
necessary so that its terms and conditions are consistent with the 
stipulations required for the approval of the LMU pursuant to paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (c) Contents of an LMU application. An operator/lessee must submit 
five copies of an LMU application to the authorized officer if the 
operator/lessee is applying on his own initiative to combine lands into 
an LMU, or if directed to establish an LMU by the authorized officer in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Such application shall 
include the following:
    (1) Name and address of the designated operator/lessee of the LMU.
    (2) Federal lease serial numbers and description of the land and all 
coal beds considered to be of minable thickness within the boundary of 
the LMU. Identification of those coal beds proposed to be excluded from 
any Federal lease which would be a part of the LMU.
    (3) Documents and related information supporting a finding of 
effective control of the lands to be included in the LMU.
    (4) Sufficient data to enable the authorized officer to determine 
that MER of the Federal recoverable coal reserves will be achieved by 
establishment of the LMU. If a coal bed, or portion thereof, is proposed 
not to be mined or to be rendered unminable by the operation, the 
operator/lessee shall submit appropriate justification to the authorized 
officer for approval.
    (5) Any other information required by the authorized officer.
    (6) If any confidential information is included in the submittal and 
is identified as such by the operator/lessee, it shall be treated in 
accordance with Sec. 3481.3 of this title.
    (d) Consultation. (1) Prior to approval, the authorized officer 
shall consult with the operator/lessee about any Federal recoverable 
coal reserves within the LMU that the operator/lessee does not intend to 
mine and any Federal recoverable coal reserves that the operator/lessee 
intends to relinquish. The authorized officer shall also consult with 
the operator/lessee about Federal lease revisions to make the time 
periods for resource recovery and protection plan submittals, the 40-
year LMU recoverable coal reserves exhaustion requirement, and diligent 
development, continued operation, advance royalty and Federal rental and 
royalty collection requirements applicable to each producing Federal 
lease consistent with the LMU stipulations.

[[Page 610]]

    (2) The public participation procedures of Sec. 3481.2 of this title 
shall be completed prior to approval of an LMU.
    (e) Stipulations. Prior to the approval of an LMU, the authorized 
officer shall notify the operator/lessee and responsible officer of the 
surface managing agency of stipulations required for the approval of the 
proposed LMU. The LMU stipulations shall provide for:
    (1) The submittal, within 3 years from the effective date of LMU 
approval, of a resource recovery and protection plan that contains the 
information required by Sec. 3482.1(c) of this title for all Federal and 
non-Federal lands within the LMU.
    (2) A schedule for the achievement of diligent development and 
continued operation for the LMU. The schedule shall reflect the date for 
achieving diligent development and maintaining continued operation of 
the individual Federal leases included in the LMU, consistent with the 
rules of this part. An operator/lessee may request to pay advance 
royalty in lieu of continued operation in accordance with Sec. 3482.1(c) 
of this title.
    (3) Uniform reporting periods for Federal rental and royalty on 
Federal leases.
    (4) The revision, if necessary, of terms and conditions of the 
individual Federal leases included in the LMU. The terms and conditions 
of the Federal leases, except for Federal royalty rates, shall be 
amended so that they are consistent with the stipulations of the LMU.
    (5) Estimates of the Federal LMU recoverable coal reserves, and non-
Federal LMU recoverable coal reserves, using data acquired by generally 
acceptable exploration methods.
    (6) Beginning the 40-year period in which the reserves of the entire 
LMU must be mined, on one of the following dates--
    (i) The effective date of the LMU, if any portion of the LMU is 
producing on that date;
    (ii) The date of approval of the resource recovery and protection 
plan for the LMU if no portion of the LMU is producing on the effective 
date of the LMU; or
    (iii) The date coal is first produced from any portion of the LMU, 
if the LMU begins production after the effective date of the LMU but 
prior to approval of the resource recovery and protection plan for the 
LMU.
    (7) Any other condition that the authorized officer determines to be 
necessary for the efficient and orderly operation of the LMU.
    (f) The authorized officer may approve an LMU if it meets the 
following criteria:
    (1) The LMU fully meets the LMU definition.
    (2) The LMU application demonstrates that mining operations on the 
LMU, which may consist of a series of excavations, will:
    (i) Achieve maximum economic recovery of Federal recoverable coal 
reserves within the LMU. In determining whether the proposed LMU meets 
this requirement, BLM, as appropriate, will consider:
    (A) The amount of coal reserves recoverable from the proposed LMU 
compared to the amount recoverable if each lease were developed 
individually; and
    (B) Any other factors BLM finds relevant to this requirement;
    (ii) Facilitate development of the coal reserves in an efficient, 
economical, and orderly manner. In determining whether the proposed LMU 
meets this requirement, BLM, as appropriate, will consider:
    (A) The potential for independent development of each lease proposed 
to be included in the LMU;
    (B) The potential for inclusion of the leases in question in another 
LMU;
    (C) The availability and utilization of transportation and access 
facilities for development of the LMU as a whole compared to development 
of each lease separately;
    (D) The mining sequence for the LMU as a whole compared to 
development of each lease separately; and
    (E) Any other factors BLM finds relevant to this requirement; and
    (iii) Provide due regard to conservation of coal reserves and other 
resources. In determining whether the proposed LMU meets this 
requirement, BLM, as appropriate, will consider:
    (A) The effects of developing and operating the LMU as a unit; and

[[Page 611]]

    (B) Any other factors BLM finds relevant to this requirement.
    (3) All single Federal leases that are included in more than one LMU 
shall be segregated into two or more Federal leases. If only a portion 
of a Federal lease is included in an LMU, the remaining land shall be 
segregated into another Federal lease. The authorized officer will 
consult with the authorized officer about the segregation of such 
Federal leases. The operator/lessee may apply to relinquish any such 
portion of a Federal lease under 43 CFR 3452.1.
    (4) The operator/lessee has agreed to the LMU stipulations required 
by the authorized officer for approval of the LMU.
    (5) The LMU does not exceed 25,000 acres, including both Federal and 
non-Federal lands.
    (6) A lease that has not produced commercial quantities of coal 
during the first 8 years of its diligent development period can be 
included in an LMU only if at the time the LMU application is submitted:
    (i) A portion of the LMU under consideration is included in a SMCRA 
permit approved under 30 U.S.C. 1256; or
    (ii) A portion of the LMU under consideration is included in an 
administratively complete application for a SMCRA permit.
    (g) The authorized officer will state in writing the reasons for the 
decision on an LMU application.
    (h) Modification of an LMU. (1) The boundaries of an LMU may be 
modified either upon application by the operator/lessee and approval of 
the authorized officer after consultation with the responsible officer 
of the surface managing agency, or by direction of the authorized 
officer after consultation with the authorized officer. In accordance 
with Sec. 3482.2(a)(3) of this title, the authorized officer may adjust 
only the estimate of LMU recoverable coal reserves pursuant to 
departmental actions or orders that modify the LMU boundaries, or upon 
approval of an operator/lessee application.
    (2) Upon application by the operator/lessee, an LMU may be enlarged 
by the addition of other Federal coal leases or with interests in non-
Federal coal deposits, or both. The LMU boundaries may also be enlarged 
as the result of the enlargement of a Federal lease in the LMU, pursuant 
to 43 CFR part 3432. An LMU may be diminished by creation of other 
separate Federal leases or LMU's or by the relinquishment of a Federal 
lease or portion thereof, pursuant to 43 CFR part 3452.
    (3) In considering an application for the modification of an LMU, 
the authorized officer shall consider modifying the LMU stipulations, 
including the production requirement for commercial quantities.
    (4) The authorized officer will not extend the 40-year period in 
which the reserves of the entire LMU must be mined, as specified at 
paragraph (e)(6) of this section, because of the enlargement of an LMU 
or because of the modification of a resource recovery and protection 
plan.
    (i) Administration of LMU operations. An LMU shall be administered 
in accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) Where production from non-Federal lands in the LMU is the basis, 
in whole or in part, for satisfaction of the requirements for diligent 
development or continued operation, the operator/lessee shall provide a 
certified report of such production, as determined by the authorized 
officer. The certified report shall include a map showing the area mined 
and the amount of coal mined.
    (2) Diligent development, continued operation and advance royalty. 
Operators/lessees must comply with the diligent development, continued 
operation, and advance royalty requirements contained at Secs. 3483.1 
through 3483.6 of this title.
    (3) Operators/lessees must comply with the LMU stipulations.

    (a) This part applies to minerals other than oil, gas, coal and oil 
shale, leased under the mineral leasing acts, and to hardrock minerals 
leasable under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, on any unclaimed, 
undeveloped area of available public domain or acquired lands where 
leasing of these specific minerals is allowed by law. Special areas 
identified in part 3580 of this title and asphalt on certain lands in 
Oklahoma also are leased under this part. Check part 3580 to identify 
any special provisions that apply to those special areas.
    (b) This part does not apply to Indian lands or minerals except

<R05>
Sec. 3501.5  What terms do I need to know to understand this part?

    You need to know the following terms, which are used frequently in 
this part:
    Acquired lands means lands or interests in lands, including mineral 
estates, which the United States obtained through purchase, gift, or 
condemnation. It includes all lands BLM administers for hardrock mineral 
leasing other than public domain lands.
    Chiefly valuable, for the purposes of this part, means the land is 
more valuable for the development of sodium, sulphur or potassium than 
for any non-mineral use of the land.
    Hardrock minerals include base metals, precious metals, industrial 
minerals, and precious or semi-precious gemstones. Hardrock minerals do 
not include coal, oil shale, phosphate, sodium, potassium, or gilsonite 
deposits. Also, hardrock minerals do not include commodities the 
government sells such as common varieties of sand, gravel, stone, pumice 
or cinder. The term hardrock minerals as used here includes mineral 
deposits that are found in sedimentary and other rocks.
    Leasable minerals, for purposes of this part, means the chlorides, 
sulfates, carbonates, borates, silicates or nitrates of potassium or 
sodium and related products; sulphur on public lands in the States of 
Louisiana and New Mexico and on all acquired lands; phosphate, including 
associated and related minerals; asphalt in certain lands in Oklahoma; 
and gilsonite (including all vein-type solid hydrocarbons).
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service.
    Permit means prospecting permit, unless otherwise specified.

[[Page 618]]

    Valuable deposit, for the purposes of this part, means an occurrence 
of minerals of such character that a person of ordinary prudence would 
be justified in the further expenditure of his or her labor and means, 
with a reasonable prospect of success in developing a profitable mine.


<R05>
Sec. 3501.10  What types of mineral use authorizations can I get under these rules?

    BLM issues the mineral use authorizations listed below to qualified 
individuals. Some authorizations are not available for certain 
commodities. See the subparts referenced in each subsection for more 
information.
    (a) ``Prospecting permits'' let you explore for leasable mineral 
deposits on lands where BLM has determined that prospecting is needed to 
determine the existence of a valuable deposit. See subpart 3505 of this 
part.
    (b) ``Exploration licenses'' let you explore in areas with known 
deposits of a leasable mineral to obtain data. With an exploration 
license, you do not get any preference or other right to a lease. See 
subpart 3506 of this part.
    (c) ``Preference right leases'' are issued to holders of prospecting 
permits who, during the term of the permit, demonstrate the discovery of 
a valuable deposit of the leasable mineral for which BLM issued the 
permit. There are other requirements. The requirements for mine plans 
are in subpart 3592 of part 3590 of this chapter. See subpart 3507 of 
this part.
    (d) ``Competitive leases'' are issued by competitive bidding for 
known deposits of a leasable mineral. See subpart 3508 of this part.
    (e) ``Fringe acreage leases'' are issued noncompetitively for known 
deposits of leasable minerals on Federal lands adjacent to existing 
deposits, when the Federal deposits can be mined only as part of an 
adjacent operation. See subpart 3510 of this part.
    (f) ``Lease modifications'' add acreage containing known deposits of 
a leasable mineral to an adjacent Federal lease of the same mineral, 
provided the deposits can be mined only as part of the larger mining 
operation. See subpart 3510 of this part.
    (g) ``Use permits'' are available to holders of phosphate and sodium 
leases so that they may use the surface of unappropriated and unentered 
public lands for the proper extraction, treatment, or removal of the 
phosphate or sodium deposits. See subpart 3516 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3501.16  Does my permit or lease grant me an exclusive right to develop the lands covered by the permit or lease?

    No. Your permit or lease gives you an exclusive right to the 
mineral, but not to the lands. BLM may allow other uses or disposal of 
the lands, including leasing of other minerals, if those uses or 
disposals will not unreasonably interfere with your operation. If BLM 
issues other permits or leases covering the lands contained within your 
permit or lease, they will contain suitable stipulations for 
simultaneous operation based on consideration of safety, environmental 
protection, conservation, ultimate recovery of the resource, and other 
factors. You must also make all reasonable efforts to avoid interference 
with other authorized uses. In cases where the date of the lease is used 
to determine priority for development and a lease is renewed, BLM will 
use the effective date of the original lease to determine priority for 
development.


<R05>
Sec. 3501.17  Are there any general planning or environmental considerations that affect issuance of my permit or lease?

    (a) BLM will not issue you a permit or lease unless it conforms with 
the decisions, terms and conditions of an applicable comprehensive land 
use plan.
    (b) BLM or the surface management agency will comply with any 
applicable environmental requirements before issuing you a permit or 
lease. This may result in conditions on your permit or lease.
    (c) BLM will issue permits and leases consistent with any 
unsuitability designation under part 1600 of this title.

[[Page 619]]


<R05>
Sec. 3501.20  If BLM approves my application for a use authorization under this part, when does it become effective?

    Your lease, permit, or other use authorization is effective the 
first day of the month after BLM signs it, unless you request in writing 
and BLM agrees to make it effective the first day of the month in which 
it is approved. This applies to all leases, licenses, permits, transfers 
and assignments in this part, unless a specific regulation provides 
otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 3501.30  May I appeal BLM's decisions under this part?

    Any party adversely affected by a BLM decision under this part may 
appeal the decision under parts 4 and 1840 of this title.

Sec. 3502.10  Who may hold permits and leases?

    You may hold an interest in permits or leases under this part only 
if you meet the requirements of 30 U.S.C. 184. You must be:

trustee is qualified to hold a permit or lease; or
    (f) any other person authorized to hold a lease under 30 U.S.C. 184.


<R05>
Sec. 3502.13  May foreign citizens hold permits or leases?

    No. However, foreign citizens may hold stock in United States 
corporations that hold leases or permits if the laws, customs, or 
regulations of their country do not deny similar privileges to citizens 
or corporations of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 3502.15  Are there any additional restrictions on holding leases or interests in leases?

    Yes. If you are a member of Congress or an employee of the 
Department of the Interior, except as provided in part 20 of this title, 
you may not acquire or hold any Federal lease, or lease interest. 
(Officer, agent or employee of the Department-see part 20 of this title; 
Member of Congress-see R.S. 3741; 41 U.S.C. 22; 18 U.S.C. 431-433). 
Also, BLM may not issue any lease or permit which causes a conflict of 
interest. See 5 CFR part 2635.


<R05>
Sec. 3502.20  Will BLM issue a lease to me if I am not complying with the diligence requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act?

    BLM will not issue you a lease or renew your lease, or approve a 
transfer of any lease or interest in a lease for you unless you are 
complying with section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 
201(2)(A)) for any of your existing leases that are subject to that 
provision. For Federal coal leases, BLM will determine compliance under 
Sec. 3472.1-2(e) of this title. If BLM issues you a lease when you are 
in violation of section 2(a)2(A), BLM must void your lease under 
Sec. 3514.30(b).

[[Page 623]]

                    Available Areas Managed by Others


<R05>
3503.20  What if another Federal agency manages the lands I am interested in?

    (a) Public domain lands. BLM will issue a permit or lease for public 
domain lands where the surface is administered by another Federal agency 
only after consulting with the surface management agency. Some laws 
applicable to public domain lands require us to obtain the consent of 
the surface management agency before we issue a lease or permit.
    (b) Acquired lands. For all lands not subject to paragraph (a) of 
this section where the surface is managed by another Federal agency, we 
must have written consent from the surface management agency before we 
issue permits or leases. The surface management agency may request 
further information about surface disturbance and reclamation before 
granting its consent.
    (c) Appeal. If a surface management agency refuses to consent or 
imposes conditions on your permit or lease, you may appeal its decision 
under that agency's appeal provisions. If you notify BLM within 30 days 
after receiving BLM's decision denying or conditioning your permit or 
lease that you have appealed the surface management agency's decision, 
we will suspend the time for filing an appeal under 43 CFR parts 4 and 
1840 until the surface management agency's decision is final and not 
subject to further administrative or judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.21  What happens if the surface of the land I am interested in belongs to a non-Federal political subdivision or charitable organization?

    (a) BLM will notify the entity who owns the surface of the lands 
included within your permit or lease application if that entity is:
    (1) Any State or political subdivision, agency or instrumentality 
thereof;
    (2) A college or any other educational corporation or association; 
or
    (3) A charitable or religious corporation or association.
    (b) The entity who owns the surface of the lands in your application 
will have up to 90 days to suggest any lease stipulations to protect 
existing surface improvements or uses, or to object to the permit or 
lease. BLM will then decide whether to issue the permit or lease and 
which, if any, stipulations identified by the surface owner to include, 
based on how the interests of the United States would best be served.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.25  When may BLM issue permits and leases for Federal minerals underlying private surface?

    (a) The regulations in this part apply where the United States 
disposed of certain lands and those disposals reserved to the United 
States the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the minerals under 
applicable leasing laws and regulations.
    (b) If the Federal Government acquires minerals through a deed, BLM 
will follow any special covenants in the deed relating to leasing or 
permitting.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.28  Does BLM incorporate any special requirements to protect the lands and resources?

    BLM will specify permit or lease stipulations to adequately use and 
protect the lands and their resources. This may include stipulations 
which are required by the surface managing agency, or which are 
recommended by the surface managing agency or non-federal surface owner 
and accepted by BLM. (See also part 3580 of this chapter.)

                            Land Descriptions


<R05>
Sec. 3503.30  How should I describe surveyed lands or lands shown on protraction or amended protraction diagrams in states which are part of the Public Land 
          Survey System?

    Describe the lands by legal subdivision, section, township, and 
range.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.31  How should I describe lands in states which are part of the Public Land Survey System but have not been surveyed and are not shown on a 
          protraction or amended protraction diagram?

    Describe such lands by metes and bounds in accordance with BLM 
standard survey practices for the public lands. Connect your description 
by courses and distances between successive angle points to an official 
corner of the public land survey system or, for

[[Page 624]]

accreted lands, to an angle point that connects to a point on an 
official corner of the public land survey system to which the accretions 
belong.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.32  How should I describe acquired lands?

    You may describe acquired lands by metes and bounds, or you may also 
use the description shown on the deed or other document that conveyed 
title to the United States. If you are applying for less than the entire 
tract acquired by the United States, describe the land using courses and 
distances tied to a point on the boundary of the requested tract. Where 
the acquiring agency assigned a tract number to the identical tract you 
wish to permit or lease, you may describe those lands by the tract 
number and include a map which clearly shows the lands with respect to 
the administrative unit or the project of which they are a part. In 
States outside of the public land survey system, you should describe the 
lands by tract number, and include a map.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.33  Will BLM issue me a lease for unsurveyed lands?

    No. All leased areas must be officially surveyed to BLM standards. 
If you are applying for a permit or lease on unsurveyed or protracted 
lands, you must pay for the survey. If BLM intends to issue a lease by 
competitive bidding, we will pay for surveying the lands.

                             Acreage Amounts


<R05>
Sec. 3503.36  Are there any size or shape limitations on the lands I can apply for?

    Generally, a quarter-quarter section, a lot or a protraction block 
is the smallest subdivision for which you may apply. The lands must be 
in reasonably compact form.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.37  Is there a limit to the acreage of lands I can hold under permits and leases?

    Yes. The limits are summarized in the following table:

<R05>
Sec. 3503.38  How does BLM compute my acreage holdings?

    (a) The maximum acreage in any one state refers to the acres you 
hold under a permit or lease on either public domain lands or acquired 
lands. Acquired lands and public domain lands are counted separately, so 
you may hold up to the maximum acreage of each at the same time. For 
example, one person could hold 20,000 acres under phosphate leases for 
public domain lands and 20,000 acres under phosphate leases for acquired 
lands at the same time.
    (b) If your permit or lease is for fractional interest lands, BLM 
will charge your acreage holdings for a share which is proportionate to 
the United States' ownership interest. For example, if the United States 
holds a 25% interest in 200 acres, you will be charged with 50 acres 
(200  x  .25).
    (c) BLM will not charge any acreage in a future interest lease 
against your acreage limitations until the date the permit or lease 
takes effect.
    (d) If you own stock in a corporation or a beneficial interest in an 
association which holds a lease or permit, your acreage will include 
your proportionate part of the corporation's or association's share of 
the totallease or permit acreage. This only applies if you own more than 
10 percent of the corporate stock or beneficial interest of the 
association.

                           Filing Applications


<R05>
Sec. 3503.40  Where do I file my permit or lease application and other necessary documents?

    File your application in the State Office which manages the lands 
for which you are applying, unless we have designated a different State 
Office. For purposes of this part, a document is filed when it is 
received in the proper office.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.41  Will BLM disclose information I submit under these regulations?

    All Federal and Indian data and information submitted to the BLM are 
subject to part 2 of this title. Part 2 includes the regulations of the 
Department of the Interior covering public disclosure of data and 
information contained in Department of the Interior records. BLM may 
make certain mineral information not protected from disclosure under 
part 2 of this title may be made available for inspection without a 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.42  When I submit confidential, proprietary information, how can I help ensure it is not available to the public?

    When you submit data and information that you believe to be exempt 
from disclosure by part 2 of this title, you must clearly mark each page 
that you believe contains confidential information. BLM will keep all 
data and information confidential to the extent allowed by Sec. 2.13(c) 
of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.43  How long will information I give BLM remain confidential or proprietary?

    The FOIA does not provide an express period of time for which 
information may be exempt from disclosure to the public. We will review 
each situation individually and in accordance with guidance provided by 
part 2 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.44  How will BLM treat Indian information submitted under the Indian Mineral Development Act?

    Under the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 (IMDA) (25 U.S.C. 
2101 et seq.), the Department of the Interior will hold as privileged 
proprietary information of the affected Indian or Indian tribe--
    (a) All findings forming the basis of the Secretary's intent to 
approve or disapprove any Minerals Agreement under IMDA; and
    (b) All projections, studies, data, or other information concerning 
a Minerals Agreement under IMDA, regardless of the date received, 
related to--
    (1) The terms, conditions, or financial return to the Indian 
parties;
    (2) The extent, nature, value, or disposition of the Indian mineral 
resources; or
    (3) The production, products, or proceeds thereof.

[[Page 626]]


<R05>
Sec. 3503.45  How will BLM administer information concerning other Indian minerals?

    For information concerning Indian minerals not covered by 
Sec. 3503.44 of this part, BLM will withhold such records as may be 
withheld under an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 
U.S.C. 552) when it receives a request for information related to tribal 
or Indian minerals held in trust or subject to restrictions on 
alienation.


<R05>
Sec. 3503.46  When will BLM consult with Indian mineral owners when information concerning their minerals is the subject of a FOIA request?

    BLM will notify the Indian mineral owner(s) identified in the 
records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the BIA, and give 
them a reasonable period of time to state objections to disclosure, 
using the standards and procedures of Sec. 2.15(d) of this title, before 
making a decision about the applicability of FOIA exemption 4 to 
protect:
    (a) information obtained from a person outside the United States 
Government; when
    (b) following consultation with a submitter under Sec. 2.15(d) of 
this title, BLM determines that the submitter does not have an interest 
in withholding the records that can be protected under FOIA; but
    (c) BLM has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may 
result in commercial or financial injury to the Indian mineral owner(s), 
but is uncertain that such is the case.

Sec. 3504.11  What forms of payment will BLM and MMS accept?

    Make your payments to BLM in cash, postal money order, negotiable 
instrument in U.S. currency, or such other method as BLM may authorize. 
See MMS regulations at 30 CFR part 218 for their payment requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.12  What payments do I send to BLM and what payments do I send to MMS?

    (a) Filing fees and rentals. (1) Include a non-refundable filing fee 
of $25 with each application you submit to BLM. Preference right lease 
applications and exploration license applications do not require a fee.
    (2) Pay all filing fees, all first-year rentals, and all bonus bids 
for leases to the BLM State office which manages the lands you are 
interested in. Make your instruments payable to the Department of the 
Interior-Bureau of Land Management.
    (3) Pay all second-year and subsequent rentals and all other 
payments for leases to the Minerals Management Service. See 30 CFR part

payments under leases in their minimum production period to the MMS.

                                 Rentals


<R05>
Sec. 3504.15  How does BLM determine my rent?

    We set your rent by multiplying the number of acres in your lease or 
permit by the rental rates shown below. The rates differ for different 
commodities and some rates increase over time. You must pay rent each 
year. We round up any fractional acreage to the next highest acre. If 
you do not know the exact acreage, compute the total acreage by assuming 
each of the smallest subdivisions is 40 acres. The minimum rental is $20 
per permit or lease for all commodities. Pay the minimum rental or the 
per-acre rental, whichever is greater.
    (a) Annual rental rates for prospecting permits for all commodities 
are $.50 per acre or fraction of an acre.
    (b) Annual rental rates for leases for each commodity are shown in 
the table below. The rate shown is for each acre or fraction of an acre 
in the lease.

<R05>
Sec. 3504.16  When is my rental due after the first year of the lease?

    (a) For prospecting permits, pay your rental in advance each year 
before the anniversary date of the permit.
    (b) For sodium, potassium or asphalt leases, pay your rental in 
advance before January 1 of each year.
    (c) For phosphate leases pay your rental in advance on or before the 
anniversary date of the lease.
    (d) For other mineral leases not covered in paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section, pay the rental in advance each year before the anniversary 
of the effective date of the lease.
    (e) MMS will credit your lease rental for any year against the first 
production royalties or minimum royalties (see Sec. 3504.25 of this 
part) as the royalties accrue under the lease during that year.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.17  What happens if I do not pay my rental on time?

    (a) If you do not pay your rental on time for a prospecting permit, 
your permit will automatically terminate.
    (b) If you do not pay your rental for a lease on time, BLM will 
notify you that unless you pay within 30 days from receipt of the 
notification, BLM will take action to cancel your lease.

                                Royalties


<R05>
Sec. 3504.20  What are the requirements for paying royalties on production?

    You must pay royalties on any production from your lease in 
accordance with the terms specified in the lease. See Sec. 3504.21 of 
this part for minimum royalty rates. Your royalty rate will be a 
percentage of the quantity or gross value of the output of the produced 
commodity. Apply the royalty rate to the value of the production 
determined under MMS regulations in Title 30. For asphalt, the minimum 
royalty is calculated on a cents-per-ton basis. You may not pay your 
royalty in quantity without BLM's prior approval.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.21  What are the minimum royalty rates?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Commodity                       Minimum royalty rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Phosphate................  5% of gross value of the output of
                                phosphates or phosphate rock and
                                associated or related minerals.
(b) Sodium...................  2% of the quantity or gross value of the
                                output of sodium compounds and related
                                products at the point of shipment to
                                market.
(c) Potassium................  2% of the quantity or gross value of the
                                output of potassium compounds and
                                related products at the point of
                                shipment to market.
(d) Sulphur..................  5% of the quantity or gross value of the
                                output of sulphur at the point of
                                shipment to market.
(e) Gilsonite................  No minimum royalty rate.
(f) Hardrock Minerals........  No minimum royalty rate.
(g) Asphalt..................  25 cents per ton (2,000 pounds) of
                                marketable production.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 3504.22  How will I know what the royalty rate is on my lease production?

    BLM determines the rate for each lease before we offer it. If BLM 
offered the lease competitively, the rates are in the notice of lease 
sale. If you applied for a noncompetitive lease, BLM will send you a 
royalty rate schedule for your concurrence and signature before we issue 
you the lease. BLM attaches royalty rates to, and makes them a part of, 
all leases.

[[Page 628]]


<R05>
Sec. 3504.25  Do I have to produce a certain amount per year?

    (a) If your mineral lease was issued, renewed or readjusted any time 
after April 22, 1986, you must either produce a minimum amount or pay a 
minimum royalty in lieu of production each lease year. This requirement 
begins in the sixth lease year or the first full year of a renewed or 
readjusted lease, whichever comes first. The minimum royalty payment is 
$3 per acre or fraction of an acre. For phosphate, sulphur, gilsonite 
and hardrock leases, pay the minimum royalty in advance before the lease 
anniversary date. For sodium, potassium and asphalt leases the minimum 
royalty is due in advance before January 1 of each year.
    (b) MMS will credit any lease rental payment (see Sec. 3504.16(d) of 
this part) against the minimum royalty payment amount due under 
paragraph (a) of this section. MMS then will credit your minimum royalty 
as specified under paragraph (a) to your production royalties for that 
year only. For example, if you pay $1,000 in rental and you owe $3,000 
in minimum royalties, you will pay a total of $3,000 for both. If during 
the lease year you accrue $10,000 in production royalties, MMS will 
credit $3,000 against that amount.
    (c) Hardrock mineral leases or development or operating agreements 
subject to escalating rentals are exempt from minimum production and 
minimum royalty requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.26  May I create overriding royalties on my Federal lease?

    Yes, but:
    (a) BLM may order you to suspend or reduce your overriding royalties 
to as low as one percent if we determine your overriding royalty could:
    (1) Cause you to abandon your lease prematurely; or
    (2) Prevent mining of marginally economic or low-grade deposits.
    (b) Where more than one overriding royalty interest is involved, BLM 
will apply any suspension or reduction to these interests in the manner 
agreed upon by the interest holders. If there is no agreement, we will 
order suspensions and reductions starting with the most recent interest 
and continuing in reverse order of the dates the overriding interests 
were created.
    (c) If you apply for a royalty rate reduction under subpart 3513, of 
this part, we may request that you reduce your overriding royalties.

                                 Bonding


<R05>
Sec. 3504.50  Do I have to file a bond to receive a permit or lease?

    Yes, unless paragraph (b) of this section applies.
    (a) BLM will set permit and lease bond amounts for each lease or 
permit. We will consider the cost of complying with all permit and lease 
terms, including royalty and reclamation requirements, when setting bond 
amounts. The minimum bond amount for prospecting permits is $1000. The 
minimum bond amount for leases is $5000.
    (b) BLM may enter into agreements with states to provide for your 
state reclamation bond to satisfy our reclamation bonding requirements. 
We may need additional information from you to determine whether your 
state bond will cover all of our reclamation requirements. If you have 
filed a current bond with a state where we have an agreement, and we 
determine that your state bond will satisfy all BLM reclamation bonding 
requirements, you will only need to file evidence of that state bond 
with BLM. We will require an additional bond from you if we determine 
your state bond does not cover all of our bonding requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.51  How do I file my bond?

    File one copy of your bond in the BLM State office where you applied 
for a permit or lease. You must use an approved BLM form. You must sign 
the form if you are the principal of a personal bond. For surety bonds, 
both you and an acceptable surety must sign the form.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.55  What types of bonds are acceptable?

    You may file either a personal bond or a surety bond.
    (a) Personal bonds may be in the form of:
    (1) Cashier's check;
    (2) Certified check; or

[[Page 629]]

    (3) Negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds equal in value to your bond 
amount. If you submit Treasury bonds, you must give the Secretary full 
authority to sell the securities if you default on your permit or lease 
obligations.
    (b) Surety bonds must be issued by qualified surety companies 
approved by the Department of the Treasury. You can get a list of 
qualified sureties at any BLM State Office.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.56  If I have more than one permit or lease, may I combine bond coverage?

    Yes. Instead of filing separate bonds for each permit or lease, you 
may file a bond to cover all permits and leases for a specific mineral 
in any one state, or nationwide. We will establish the amount of the 
bond; however, the minimums are:
    (a) $25,000 for statewide bonds. File these bonds in the BLM State 
Office for the state where your leases are located.
    (b) $75,000 for nationwide bonds. File these bonds in any BLM State 
Office.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.60  Under what circumstances might BLM elect to change the amount of my bond?

    We may increase or decrease your bond amount when we determine that 
a change in coverage is appropriate, but we will not decrease your bond 
amount below the minimum.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.65  What happens to my bond if I do not meet my permit or lease obligations?

    BLM will demand payment from your bond to cover any obligations on 
which you default. Your bond will be reduced accordingly. If the surety 
makes a payment, we will reduce the face amount of the surety bond and 
the surety's liability by the amount of the payment.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.66  Must I restore my bond to the full amount if payment has been made from my bond?

    Yes. After any default, BLM will notify you of the amount you must 
pay to restore your bond. We will give you no more than six months to 
post a new bond or increase the existing bond to its pre-default level. 
You may elect to file separate or substitute bonds for each permit or 
lease. If you do not replace your bond, BLM may take action to cancel 
the leases or permits covered by the bond.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.70  When will BLM terminate the period of liability of my bond?

    BLM may terminate the period of liability for any bond only when you 
have filed an acceptable replacement bond or when you have met all your 
permit or lease terms and conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 3504.71  When will BLM release my bond?

    (a) BLM will release your bond when we have determined, after the 
passage of a reasonable period of time, that you have done the 
following:
    (1) Paid all royalties, rentals, penalties, and assessments;
    (2) Satisfied all permit or lease obligations;
    (3) Reclaimed the site; and
    (4) Taken effective measures to ensure that the mineral prospecting 
or development activities will not adversely affect surface or 
subsurface resources.
    (b) If you assign your lease or permit, BLM will release your bond 
after we determine that you met the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (a)(2) of this section. Also, your assignee must provide an 
acceptable bond or other surety.


<R04>
                    Subpart 3505--Prospecting Permits


<R05>
Sec. 3505.10  What is a prospecting permit?

    (a) A prospecting permit gives you the exclusive right to prospect 
on and explore lands available for leasing under this part to determine 
if a valuable deposit exists of:
    (1) Phosphate;
    (2) Sodium;
    (3) Potassium;
    (4) Sulphur;
    (5) Gilsonite; or
    (6) A hardrock mineral.
    (b) Prospecting permits are not available for asphalt.
    (c) You may remove only material needed to demonstrate the existence 
of a valuable mineral deposit.

[[Page 630]]


<R05>
Sec. 3505.11  Do I need a prospecting permit to collect mineral specimens for non-commercial purposes?

    No. You may collect mineral specimens for hobby, recreation, 
scientific, research or similar purposes without a prospecting permit. 
However, the surface management agency may require a use permit. BLM's 
regulations for collecting mineral specimens are at part 8365 of this 
title.

                    Applying for Prospecting Permits


<R05>
Sec. 3505.12  How do I obtain a prospecting permit?

    Deliver three copies of the BLM application form to the BLM office 
with jurisdiction over the lands you are interested in. Include the 
filing fee and first year's rental with your application. See subpart 
3504 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.13  What must my application include?

    Your application must be legible and dated. It must contain your or 
your agent's original signature. It must also include:
    (a) Your name and address;
    (b) A statement of your qualifications and holdings (see subpart 
3502 of this part);
    (c) A complete and accurate land description (see subpart 3503 of 
this part);
    (d) Three copies of any maps needed to accompany the description; 
and
    (e) The name of all the commodities for which you are applying.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.15  Is there an acreage limit for my application?

    The acreage in your application must not exceed the maximum allowed 
for the permit. See Sec. 3503.37 of this part for the acreage limits 
applicable for the different minerals. BLM will not issue a permit if it 
causes you to exceed the limits shown in the table in that section.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.25  How does BLM prioritize applications for prospecting permits?

    BLM will prioritize applications based on the time of filing. If 
more than one application is filed at the same time for the same 
commodity on the same lands, we will hold a public drawing in accordance 
with subpart 1821 of this title to determine priority.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.30  May I amend or change my application after I file it?

    Yes. However, if your amendment adds lands, we will assign priority 
to those added lands from the date you filed the amended application. 
You must send the rental for the added lands with your amended 
application. You do not need to submit additional filing fees.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.31  May I withdraw my application after I file it?

    Yes. Just send us a written request. If you withdraw your 
application in whole or in part before BLM signs the permit, we will 
refund the corresponding proportionate share of your rental payment. BLM 
will retain the filing fee.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.40  After submitting my application, do I need to submit anything else?

    Yes. After we initially review your permit application, but before 
we issue the prospecting permit, we will require you to submit three 
copies of an exploration plan under Sec. 3505.45 of this part. You must 
also submit a bond. See 43 CFR part 3504, especially 43 CFR 3504.50, for 
information on bonds.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.45  What is an exploration plan?

    An exploration plan shows how you intend to determine the existence 
and workability of a valuable deposit. Your exploration plan must 
include as much of the following information as possible:
    (a) The names, addresses and telephone numbers of persons 
responsible for operations under your plan and to whom BLM will deliver 
notices and orders;
    (b) A brief description of the environment your plan may affect. 
Focus on the affected geologic, water and other physical factors, and 
the distribution and abundance of vegetation and habitat of fish and 
wildlife, particularly threatened and endangered species. Include maps 
with your descriptions, and discuss the present land use in and adjacent 
to the area;
    (c) A narrative description showing:

[[Page 631]]

    (1) The method of exploration and types of equipment you will use;
    (2) The measures you will take to prevent or control fire, soil 
erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, pollution of air, damage 
to fish and wildlife or their habitat, damage to other natural 
resources, and hazards to public health and safety, including specific 
actions necessary to meet all applicable laws and regulations;
    (3) The method for plugging drill holes; and
    (4) The measures you will take to reclaim the land, including:
    (i) A reclamation schedule;
    (ii) The method of grading, backfilling, soil stabilization, 
compacting and contouring;
    (iii) The method of soil preparation and fertilizer application;
    (iv) The type and mixture of shrubs, trees, grasses, forbs or other 
vegetation you will plant; and
    (v) The method of planting, including approximate quantity and 
spacing;
    (d) The estimated timetable for each phase of the work and for final 
completion of the program;
    (e) Suitable topographic maps or aerial photographs showing existing 
bodies of surface water, topographic, cultural and drainage features, 
and the proposed location of drill holes, trenches and roads; and
    (f) Any other data which BLM may require.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.50  How will I know if BLM has approved or rejected my application?

    BLM will review your application to determine compliance with land 
use plans, environmental requirements, unsuitability criteria and 
whether the lands are within a known leasing area. BLM's decision 
whether to approve your application is at BLM's complete discretion. If 
we approve your application, we will issue your permit. If we reject 
your application, we will mail you a written decision. This notice will:
    (a) Detail the reasons why we rejected your application;
    (b) Identify any items you will need to correct in your application; 
and
    (c) Tell you how you may appeal an adverse decision.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.51  May I file a revised application if BLM rejects my original application?

    Yes. If you file a revised application for the same lands within 30 
days after you receive our rejection, we will apply the non-refundable 
filing fee and rental payment from your original application to the new 
application. To obtain this benefit, you must show the serial number of 
the original application on your new application. We will establish 
priority for the permit as of the date the revised application is filed. 
If you do not file a revised application within 30 days of rejection, we 
will refund only your rental payment.

                 Prospecting Permit Terms and Conditions


<R05>
Sec. 3505.55  What are my obligations to BLM under an approved prospecting permit?

    You must:
    (a) Pay your annual rental in a timely fashion. See Secs. 3504.15 
and 3504.16 of this part;
    (b) Comply with all permit terms and stipulations the surface 
management agency attached to the permit;
    (c) Conduct only those exploration activities approved as part of 
your existing exploration plan; and
    (d) Discontinue activities following expiration of the initial term 
unless and until BLM extends your permit.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.60  How long is my prospecting permit in effect?

    Your prospecting permit will be effective for an initial term of 2 
years.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.61  May BLM extend the term of my prospecting permit?

    We may extend prospecting permits for phosphate and hardrock 
minerals for up to an additional 4 years, and for potassium and 
gilsonite for up to an additional 2 years. We cannot extend sodium and 
sulphur prospecting permits.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.62  Under what conditions will BLM extend my prospecting permit?

    You must prove that:
    (a) You explored with reasonable diligence and were unable to 
determine

[[Page 632]]

the existence and workability of a valuable deposit covered by the 
permit. Reasonable diligence means that, in BLM's opinion, you drilled a 
sufficient number of holes or performed other comparable prospecting to 
explore the permit area within the time allowed; or
    (b) Your failure to perform diligent prospecting activities was due 
to conditions beyond your control.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.64  How do I apply for an extension?

    There is no application form. Just send us a written request with 
the information in Sec. 3505.65 of this part at least 90 days before 
your permit expires. Include your $25 nonrefundable filing fee and the 
first year's rental, in accordance with Secs. 3504.15 and 3504.16 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.65  What information must I include in my extension request?

    Your request must:
    (a) Show that you have met the conditions for extension in 
Sec. 3505.62;
    (b) Describe your previous diligent prospecting activities on the 
permit; and
    (c) Show how much additional time you need to complete prospecting 
work.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.66  If approved, when is my extension effective?

    Your permit extension will become effective on the date we approve 
it, or on the expiration date of the original permit, if this date is 
later.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.70  May I relinquish my prospecting permit?

    Yes. You may relinquish the entire prospecting permit or any legal 
subdivision of it. A partial relinquishment must clearly describe the 
exact acreage you want to relinquish. BLM will not accept a 
relinquishment if you are not in compliance with the requirements of 
your permit. Once we accept the request, your relinquishment is 
effective as of the date you filed it with BLM. We will then note the 
relinquishment on the land status records. We may then open the lands to 
any new applications. If you relinquish part or all of your permit, you 
lose any right to any preference right lease to the lands covered by the 
relinquishment.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.75  What happens if I fail to pay the rental?

    Your prospecting permit will automatically terminate if you do not 
pay the rental before the anniversary date of the permit. We will note 
your permit termination on the official status records.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.80  What happens when my permit expires?

    Your permit will expire at the end of its initial or extended term, 
as applicable, without notice. BLM may open the lands to new 
applications 60 days after your permit expires. However, if you timely 
filed for an extension under Sec. 3505.64 of this part, the 60 day 
period would begin to run on the date BLM denies your extension request. 
If you timely filed for a preference right lease under Sec. 3507.15 of 
this part, the 60 day period only would begin to run on the date BLM 
denies your lease application.


<R05>
Sec. 3505.85  May BLM cancel my prospecting permit for reasons other than failure to pay rental?

    Yes.
    (a) We may cancel your permit if you do not comply with the Mineral 
Leasing Act, any of the other acts applicable to your specific permit, 
these regulations, or any of the permit terms or stipulations. We will 
give you 30 days notice, within which you must correct your default. If 
your default continues, BLM may cancel your permit.
    (b) If we waive one cause for cancellation, we may still cancel your 
permit for another cause, or for the same cause occurring at another 
time. Unless you file an appeal, we will note your permit cancellation 
on the land status records. BLM may use your bond to reclaim the land or 
correct other deficiencies if we cancel your permit.

Sec. 3506.20  After my license is issued, may I modify my license or exploration plan?

    BLM may approve modifications of your exploration plan upon your 
request. We may also permit you to remove lands from your exploration 
license at any time. However, once we issue your exploration license, 
you may not add lands to the area of your exploration license.


<R05>
Sec. 3506.25  Once I have a license, what are my responsibilities?

    You must share with BLM all data you obtain during exploration. We 
will

[[Page 634]]

consider the data confidential and will not make the data public until 
either:
    (a) The areas involved are leased; or
    (b) BLM determines that it must release the data in response to a 
FOIA request.


<R04>
            Subpart 3507--Preference Right Lease Applications


<R05>
Sec. 3507.11  What must I do to obtain a preference right lease?

    To obtain a preference right lease, you must have a prospecting 
permit for the area you want to lease and meet the following conditions 
and any other conditions established in this subpart:
    (a) All leasable minerals except asphalt. You must demonstrate that 
you have discovered a valuable deposit within the period covered by your 
prospecting permit. However, paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section 
provide some limitations.
    (b) Sodium, potassium, and sulphur. In addition to the requirements 
of paragraph (a) of this section, BLM must determine that the lands are 
chiefly valuable for the subject minerals.
    (c) Asphalt. You may not obtain a preference right lease for 
asphalt. However, you may obtain a competitive lease or a fringe acreage 
lease under subpart 3508 or 3510 of this part.
    (d) Permits issued under the authority of Reorganization Plan No. 3 
of 1946. Prospecting permits for minerals BLM administers under the 
authority of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946 do not entitle you to a 
preference right lease. We may grant you a noncompetitive lease if you 
discover a valuable deposit during the permit term.


<R05>
Sec. 3507.15  How do I apply for a preference right lease?

    No specific form is required. Submit three copies of your 
application within 60 days after the date your prospecting permit 
expires or the date BLM denies your request for a permit extension filed 
under Sec. 3505.64 of this part, whichever is later.


<R05>
Sec. 3507.16  Is there a fee or payment required with my application?

    Yes. You must submit the first year's rent with your application. 
Determine the first year's rent from the provisions in Sec. 3504.15 of 
this part. There is no filing fee.

[65 FR 11476, Mar. 3, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 3507.17  What information must my preference right lease application include?

    Your application must contain:
    (a) A statement of your qualifications and holdings as specified in 
subpart 3503 of this chapter;
    (b) Three maps showing:
    (1) Utility systems;
    (2) The location of any proposed development or mining operations 
and incidental facilities;
    (3) The approximate locations and the extent of the areas you will 
use for pits, overburden and tailings; and
    (4) The location of water sources or other resources which you may 
use in the proposed operations or incidental facilities;
    (c) A narrative statement addressing:
    (1) The anticipated scope, method and schedule of development 
operations, including the type of equipment you will use;
    (2) The method of mining anticipated, including the best available 
estimate of the mining sequence and production rate; and
    (3) The relationship, if any, between the planned mining operations 
and existing or planned mining operations and facilities on adjacent 
Federal or non-Federal lands;
    (d) Financial information which will enable us to determine if you 
have found a valuable deposit. Include at least an estimate of projected 
mining and processing costs, saleable products and markets, and 
projected selling prices;
    (e) A complete and accurate description of the lands as found in 
your prospecting permit, if your application is for less than the lands 
covered by your prospecting permit; and
    (f) Other data, as we may require.


<R05>
Sec. 3507.18  What do I need to submit to show that I have found a valuable deposit?

    To show you have found a valuable deposit, send us the information 
listed in Sec. 3593.1 of this part. You must have collected the data 
during the term of

[[Page 635]]

the prospecting permit, but you may refer to prior geologic work. BLM 
may request supplemental data from you to determine the following:
    (a) The extent and character of the deposit;
    (b) The anticipated mining and processing methods and costs;
    (c) Anticipated location, kind and extent of necessary surface 
disturbance;
    (d) The measures you will take to reclaim that disturbance;
    (e) An estimate of the profitability of mineral development; and
    (f) Whether there is a reasonable prospect of success in developing 
a profitable mine.


<R05>
Sec. 3507.19  Under what circumstances will BLM reject my application?

    (a) BLM will reject your application for a preference right lease 
if:
    (1) You did not discover a valuable deposit of mineral(s) covered by 
the prospecting permit;
    (2) You did not submit requested information in a timely manner;
    (3) You did not otherwise comply with the requirements of this 
subpart; or
    (4) In the case of sodium, potassium and sulphur, if BLM determines 
that the lands are not chiefly valuable for the mineral commodity 
specified in the permit.
    (b) If you applied for a lease for minerals BLM administers under 
the authority of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, BLM may also reject 
your application if we determine that mining is not the preferred use of 
the lands in the application. In making this determination, we will 
consider:
    (1) The land use plan;
    (2) Unsuitability criteria under subpart 1610 of this title;
    (3) Any environmental impacts; and
    (4) The purposes of the statute under which the lands were acquired.
    (c) We will also reject your application if the surface managing 
agency does not consent to the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3507.20  May I appeal BLM's rejection of my preference right lease?

    Yes. You have a right to appeal under the procedures in parts 4 and 
1840 of this title.


<R04>
              Subpart 3508--Competitive Lease Applications


<R05>
Sec. 3508.11  What lands are available for competitive leasing?

    BLM may issue a competitive lease on unleased lands where we know 
that a valuable mineral deposit exists. In such areas, before issuing a 
lease we may issue you an exploration license, but not a prospecting 
permit. However, BLM may offer competitive leases for lands where no 
prospecting or exploratory work is needed to determine the existence or 
workability of a valuable mineral deposit. In addition, we may offer 
competitive leases for asphalt on any lands available for asphalt 
leasing, whether or not we know that a valuable mineral deposit exists.


<R05>
Sec. 3508.12  How do I get a competitive lease?

    (a) Notify BLM of areas in which you are interested. We may also 
designate certain lands for competitive leasing.
    (b) After determining that the lands are available for leasing, we 
will publish a notice of lease sale containing all significant 
information (see Sec. 3508.14 of this part).
    (c) We will award a competitive lease through sale to the qualified 
bidder who offers the highest acceptable bonus bid. In the event of a 
tie, BLM will determine a fair method for choosing the successful bid.


<R05>
Sec. 3508.14  How will BLM publish the notice of lease sale?

    (a) Once we determine which lands are available for leasing, we will 
publish a notice of lease sale at least once a week for three 
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 
where the lands are situated. We will also post the notice of lease sale 
for 30 days in the public room of the BLM office which administers the 
lands.
    (b) The notice will include:
    (1) The time and place of sale;
    (2) The bidding method, including opening and closing dates for 
bidding;
    (3) A description of the tract BLM is offering;
    (4) A description of the mineral deposit BLM is offering;

[[Page 636]]

    (5) The minimum bid we will consider; and
    (6) Information on where you can get a copy of the proposed lease 
and a detailed statement of the lease sale terms and conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 3508.15  What information will the detailed statement of the lease sale terms and conditions include?

    (a) The proposed lease terms and conditions, including the rental, 
royalty rates, bond amount, and any special stipulations for the 
particular tract;
    (b) An explanation of how you may submit your bid;
    (c) Notification that you must accompany your bid with your 
qualifications statement (see subpart 3502 of this part) and a deposit 
of one-fifth of your bid amount;
    (d) Notification that if you are the successful bidder, you must pay 
your proportionate share of the total publication cost for the sale 
notice before we will issue the lease. Your share is based on the number 
of tracts you bid on successfully, divided by the total number of tracts 
offered for sale;
    (e) A warning concerning 18 U.S.C. 1860 which provides criminal 
penalties for manipulating the bidding process;
    (f) A statement that the Secretary reserves the right to reject any 
and all bids, and to offer the lease to the next qualified bidder, if 
the successful bidder does not get the lease for any reason; and
    (g) Any other information we deem appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 3508.20  How will BLM conduct the sale and handle bids?

    We will open and announce all bids at the time and date specified in 
the notice of lease sale, but we will not accept or reject bids at that 
time. We must receive your bid by the deadline in the sale notice or we 
will not consider it. You may withdraw or modify your bid before the 
time specified in the notice of sale.


<R05>
Sec. 3508.21  What happens if I am the successful bidder?

    (a) If you are the highest qualified bidder and we determine that 
your bid meets or exceeds fair market value, we will send you copies of 
the lease on the form attached to the detailed statement. Within the 
time we specify you must:
    (1) Sign and return the lease form;
    (2) Pay the balance of the bonus bid;
    (3) Pay the first year's rental;
    (4) Pay the publication costs; and
    (5) Furnish the required lease bond.
    (b) See Sec. 3504.12 of this part for payment procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 3508.22  What happens if BLM rejects my bid?

    (a) If your bid is the high bid and we reject it because you did not 
sign the lease form and pay the balance of the bonus bid, or otherwise 
comply with this subpart, you forfeit to the United States your deposit 
of one-fifth of the bonus bid amount.
    (b) If we must reject your high bid for reasons beyond your control, 
we will return your bid deposit.
    (c) If we reject your bid because it is not the high bid, we will 
return your bid deposit.


<R04>
     Subpart 3509--Fractional and Future Interest Lease Applications


<R05>
Sec. 3509.10  What are future interest leases?

    BLM issues noncompetitive future interest leases to persons who hold 
present mineral interests that will revert to the Federal Government at 
some future date. Future interest leases allow the present interest 
holders to continue using their present mineral right once the Federal 
Government acquires it.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.11  Under what conditions will BLM issue a future interest lease to me?

    When it is in the public interest, we will issue you a future 
interest lease for lands where you either have an existing mining 
operation or have established that a valuable deposit exists.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.12  Who may apply for a future interest lease?

    You may apply for a future interest lease only if you have a present 
interest in the minerals. You must hold more than 50 per cent of either 
the fee

[[Page 637]]

interest, a lease interest or an operating rights interest. You must 
also meet the qualification requirements set forth in subpart 3502 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.15  Do I have to pay for a future interest lease?

    You must pay fair market value for the mineral deposit when title 
vests in the United States. You also will be required to pay royalty on 
your production.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.16  How do I apply for a future interest lease?

    No specific form is required. Include a $25 filing fee with the 
application. Submit the application to the BLM office with jurisdiction 
over the lands. You must file at least one year before the mineral 
interest vests with the United States or BLM will deny your application.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.17  What information must I include in my application for a future interest lease?

    Your application must include the same information we require when 
you apply for a present interest Federal lease. See subpart 3508 of this 
part. In addition, you must include the following:
    (a) A land description;
    (b) Your certification that you meet the qualifications requirements 
(see subpart 3502 of this part);
    (c) Evidence of your title or the extent of your rights to the 
present interest in the mineral deposits. Submit either a certified 
abstract of title or a title certificate, or the instrument establishing 
your rights; and
    (d) The names of the other owners, if any, of the mineral interests. 
If you own the operating rights to the mineral by means of a contract 
with the mineral owner, you also need to submit three copies of the 
mineral contract or lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.18  What will BLM do after it receives my application for a future interest lease?

    (a) After BLM receives your application for a future interest lease, 
we will notify all other interest owners that they have 90 days to file 
applications for the same mineral interest.
    (b) If any other interest owners timely apply, we will hold a 
competitive lease sale among the qualified applicants. BLM will 
establish standards for the competitive sale similar to those under 
subpart 3508 of this part, and provide notice to all of the qualified 
applicants.
    (c) If no other qualified owners timely apply, BLM may issue a 
future interest lease to you. BLM will establish the amount of the bonus 
bid you must pay through appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.20  When does my future interest lease take effect?

    Your future interest lease will be effective on the date the 
minerals vest in the United States, as stated in the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.25  For what reasons will BLM reject my application for a future interest lease?

    We will reject your application:
    (a) If you do not meet the qualifications in Sec. 3509.15 of this 
part;
    (b) If you filed your application less than one year before the 
minerals vest in the United States; or
    (c) We determine that issuing the lease is not in the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.30  May I withdraw my application for a future interest lease?

    Yes. You must file the withdrawal with BLM before the lease is 
signed. BLM will retain the application fee.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.40  What are fractional interest prospecting permits and leases?

    They are prospecting permits and leases for parcels where the United 
States holds less than 100 per cent of the mineral interest of the 
parcel. Fractional interest leases allow development of the shared 
mineral interests.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.41  For what lands may BLM issue fractional interest prospecting permits and leases?

    We issue them for lands where the United States owns less than 100 
per cent of the mineral interest and where we have determined it is in 
the public interest to grant the permit or lease. We will only grant 
fractional interest permits or leases with the consent of

[[Page 638]]

the surface managing agency. If we believe a mineral deposit exists but 
do not know, we may issue a noncompetitive fractional interest lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.45  Who may apply for a fractional interest prospecting permit or lease?

    Only persons who have an interest in the non-Federal share of the 
same minerals may apply for a fractional interest lease of the minerals. 
Applicants must also meet the qualification standards in subpart 3502 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.46  How do I apply for a fractional interest prospecting permit or lease?

    No specific form is required. Include a $25 filing fee with the 
application. Submit the application to the BLM office with jurisdiction 
over the lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.47  What information must I include in my application for a fractional interest prospecting permit or lease?

    Your application must include all the same information we require 
when you apply for a regular competitive Federal lease. See subpart 3508 
of this part. In addition, you must include the following:
    (a) A land description;
    (b) Your certification that you meet the qualifications requirements 
(see subpart 3502 of this part);
    (c) Evidence of your title or the extent of your rights in the 
mineral deposits. Submit either a certified abstract of title, a title 
certificate or the instrument establishing your rights; and
    (d) The names of the other owners, if any, of the mineral interests. 
If you own the operating rights to the mineral by means of a contract 
with the mineral owner, you also need to submit three copies of the 
mineral contract or lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.48  What will BLM do after it receives my application for a fractional interest lease?

    (a) After BLM receives your application for a fractional interest 
lease, we will notify all other interest owners that they have 90 days 
to file applications for the same mineral interest.
    (b) If any other interest owners timely apply, we will hold a 
competitive lease sale among the qualified applicants. BLM will 
establish standards for the competitive sale similar to those under 
subpart 3508 of this part, and provide notice to all of the applicants.
    (c) If no other qualified owners timely apply, BLM may issue a 
fractional interest lease to you. BLM will establish the amount of the 
bonus bid you must pay through appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.49  What terms and conditions apply to my fractional interest prospecting permit or lease?

    BLM will apply the commodity-specific terms and conditions found in 
this part to fractional interest prospecting permits and leases.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.50  Under what conditions would BLM reject my application for a fractional interest prospecting permit or lease?

    BLM will reject your fractional interest application if:
    (a) You do not meet the qualifications in Sec. 3509.45 of this part;
    (b) You would have an interest in the total Federal and non-Federal 
mineral estate of less than 50% once the fractional interest prospecting 
permit or lease is issued, unless we determine it would be in the best 
interests of the government to issue the permit or lease; or
    (c) We determine that it is not in the public interest to grant the 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3509.51  May I withdraw my application for a fractional interest prospecting permit or lease?

    Yes, if you file the withdrawal before the lease is signed. BLM will 
retain the application fee.


<R04>
 Subpart 3510--Noncompetitive Leasing: Fringe Acreage Leases and Lease 
                              Modifications


<R05>
Sec. 3510.11  If I already have a Federal lease, or the mineral rights on adjacent private lands, may I lease adjoining Federal lands that contain the same 
          deposits without competitive bidding?

    Yes. If the adjoining Federal lands are available for leasing, you 
may lease

[[Page 639]]

them noncompetitively, even if they are known to contain a deposit of 
the mineral you are interested in leasing. We will either issue a new 
lease for these lands (fringe acreage) or add the lands to your existing 
Federal lease (modification).


<R05>
Sec. 3510.12  What must I do to obtain a lease modification or fringe acreage lease?

    (a) File three copies of your application with the BLM office that 
administers the lands. No specific application form is required.
    (b) Include a non-refundable filing fee of $25, and an advance 
rental payment in accordance with the rental rate for the mineral 
commodity you are seeking. If you want to modify an existing lease, BLM 
will base the rental payment on the rate in effect for the lease being 
modified.
    (c) Your application must:
    (1) Show the serial number of the lease if the lands adjoin an 
existing Federal lease;
    (2) Contain a complete and accurate description of the lands 
desired;
    (3) Show that the mineral deposit specified in your application 
extends from your adjoining lease or from private lands you own or 
control; and
    (4) Include proof that you own or control the mineral deposit in the 
adjoining lands if they are not under a Federal lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3510.15  What will BLM do with my application?

    We will issue or modify a lease under this subpart only if we 
determine that:
    (a) The lands are contiguous to your existing Federal lease or to 
non-Federal lands you own or control;
    (b) The new fringe lease does not exceed the maximum size allowed in 
a lease, as specified in Sec. 3503.37 of this part;
    (c) The acreage of the modified lease, including additional lands, 
is not in excess of the maximum size allowed for a lease, as specified 
in Sec. 3503.37 of this part;
    (d) The mineral deposit is not in an area of competitive interest to 
holders of other active mining units in the area;
    (e) The lands for which you applied lack sufficient reserves of the 
mineral resource to warrant independent development;
    (f) Leasing the lands will conserve natural resources and will 
provide for economical and efficient recovery as part of a mining unit; 
and
    (g) You meet the qualification requirements for holding a lease 
described in subpart 3502 of this title and the new or modified lease 
will not cause you to exceed the acreage limitations described in 
Sec. 3503.37 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3510.20  Do I have to pay a fee to modify my existing lease or obtain a fringe acreage lease?

    Yes. Before BLM issues a new fringe acreage lease or modifies your 
existing lease, you must pay a bonus in an amount we will determine 
based on an appraisal or other appropriate means. The bonus cannot be 
less than $1 per acre or fraction of an acre.


<R05>
Sec. 3510.21  What terms and conditions apply to fringe acreage leases and lease modifications?

    Your fringe acreage lease is a new Federal lease. Therefore, we may 
impose terms and conditions different from those in your original 
Federal lease. A modified lease will be subject to the same terms and 
conditions as in the original Federal lease.


<R04>
                Subpart 3511--Lease Terms and Conditions


<R05>
Sec. 3511.10  Do certain leases allow me to mine other commodities as well?

    Yes. Sodium leases authorize you to mine potassium compounds as 
related products, and potassium leases authorize mining associated 
sodium compounds and related products. A phosphate lease allows you to 
use deposits of silica, limestone or other rock on the lease for use in 
the processing or refining of phosphate, phosphate rock, and associated 
minerals mined from the leased lands. You must pay royalty on these 
materials as specified in your lease.

[[Page 640]]


<R05>
Sec. 3511.11  If I am mining calcium chloride, may I obtain a noncompetitive mineral lease to produce the commingled sodium chloride?

    Yes. If you are producing calcium chloride in paying quantities from 
an existing mine which you control, you may apply to BLM for a 
noncompetitive lease to produce the commingled sodium chloride. You must 
already have authorization, under part 3800 of this chapter, for the 
locatable minerals. You must also meet the other requirements of this 
part for the commingled leasable minerals.


<R05>
Sec. 3511.12  Are there standard terms and conditions which apply to all leases?

    Yes. BLM will issue your lease on a standard form which will contain 
several terms and conditions. We will add your rental rate, royalty 
obligations and any special stipulations to this lease form.


<R05>
Sec. 3511.15  How long will my lease be in effect?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 3511.25  What is meant by lease readjustment and lease renewal?

    (a) If your lease is issued subject to readjustment, BLM will notify 
you of the readjusted terms before the end of each 20-year period. If we 
do not timely notify you of readjusted terms, those leases continue for 
another 20-year period under the same terms and conditions.
    (b) If you have a lease that requires renewal, we will issue the 
lease for an initial term as specified in Sec. 3510.15 of this part. You 
must apply for a renewal of the lease at least 90 days before the 
initial term ends in order to extend the lease for an additional term. 
If you do not renew the lease, it expires and the lands become available 
for re-leasing. BLM may change some of your lease terms when we renew a 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3511.26  What if I object to the terms and conditions BLM proposes for a readjusted lease?

    (a) You have 60 days after receiving the proposed readjusted terms 
to object. If we do not receive your objection within 60 days, the 
proposed readjusted terms will be in effect. If you file an objection, 
BLM will issue a decision in response. If you disagree with the 
decision, you may appeal under parts 4 and 1840 of this title.
    (b) The readjusted lease terms and conditions will be effective 
pending the outcome of any appeal, unless BLM provides otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 3511.27  How do I renew my lease?

    File an application at least 90 days before the lease term expires. 
No specific form is required. Send us three copies of your application 
together with a non-refundable $25 filing fee and an advance rental 
payment of $1 per acre or fraction of an acre.

[[Page 641]]


<R05>
Sec. 3511.30  If I appeal BLM's proposed new terms, must I continue paying royalties or rentals while my appeal is pending?

    Yes. Continue to pay royalties and rentals at the original rate. 
Your obligation to pay any increased readjusted royalties, minimum 
royalties and rentals will be suspended while your appeal is considered. 
However, any increased charges accrue beginning with the effective date 
of the readjustment or renewal, while final action on your appeal is 
pending. If the increased charges are sustained on appeal, you must pay 
the accrued balance, plus interest at the rate MMS specifies for late 
payment in 30 CFR part 218.


<R04>
                 Subpart 3512--Assignments and Subleases

                          How to Assign Leases

Sec. 3512.11  Once BLM issues me a permit or lease, may I assign or sublease it?

    You may assign or sublease your permit or lease in whole or in part 
to any person, association, or corporation qualified to hold a permit or 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3512.12  Is there a fee for requesting an assignment or sublease?

    When you submit your instrument for assignment of record title or 
operating rights, or for transfer of overriding royalties, you must pay 
a non-refundable filing fee of $25. BLM will not accept any instrument 
without the filing fee.


<R05>
Sec. 3512.13  How do I assign my permit or lease?

    (a) Within 90 days of final execution of the assignment, you must 
submit three copies of your instrument for assignment of each permit or 
lease. The instrument must contain:

disapproval.


<R05>
Sec. 3512.17  How do I transfer the operating rights in my permit or lease?

    (a) You must file one copy of the agreement to transfer operating 
rights within 90 days from the date of final execution of the agreement.
    (b) The transferee must also file a signed and dated request for 
approval, a statement of qualifications (see subpart 3502 of this part) 
and a $25 fee.
    (c) We will notify you with a decision indicating approval or 
disapproval.

                  Special Circumstances and Obligations


<R05>
Sec. 3512.18  Will BLM approve my assignment or sublease if I have outstanding liabilities?

    Before we will approve your assignment of a permit or lease, your 
account must be in good standing. We will also approve the assignment if 
the assignee and his or her surety provides written acceptance of your 
outstanding liabilities under the permit or lease. In addition, the 
assignee must either furnish a new bond equivalent to your existing bond 
or obtain consent of the surety on

[[Page 642]]

your bond to substitute the assignee as the principal.


<R05>
Sec. 3512.19  Must I notify BLM if I intend to transfer an overriding royalty to another party?

    Yes. Although we do not approve these transfers, you must file all 
overriding royalty interest transfers with the BLM within 90 days from 
the date of execution. Include the transferees's statement of 
qualifications required in subpart 3502 of this part and the $25 filing 
fee.

                Effect of Assignments on Your Obligations


<R05>
Sec. 3512.25  If I assign my permit or lease, when do my obligations under the permit or lease end?

    You and your surety remain responsible for the performance of all 
obligations under the permit or lease until the date we approve the 
assignment. You will continue to be responsible for obligations that 
accrued prior to the date of our approval of the assignment, whether or 
not they were identified at the time of the transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 3512.30  What are the responsibilities of a sublessor and a sublessee?

    After BLM's approval of a sublease becomes effective, the sublessor 
and sublessee are jointly and severably liable for performance of all 
obligations under the permit or lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3512.33  Does an assignment or sublease alter the permit or lease terms?

    No, it does not alter permit or lease terms.


<R04>
  Subpart 3513--Waiver, Suspension or Reduction of Rental and Minimum 
                                Royalties

                      Rental and Royalty Reductions


<R05>
Sec. 3513.11  May BLM relieve me of the lease requirements of rental, minimum royalty, or production royalty while continuing to hold the lease?

    Yes. BLM has a process which may allow you temporary relief from 
these lease requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.12  What criteria does BLM consider in approving a waiver, suspension, or reduction in rental or minimum royalty, or a reduction in the royalty rate?

    We will consider if approval:
    (a) Is in the interest of conservation;
    (b) Will encourage the greatest ultimate recovery of the resource; 
and
    (c) Is necessary either to promote development of the mineral 
resources or because you cannot successfully operate the lease under 
existing terms.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.15  How do I apply for reduction of rental, royalties or minimum production?

    You must send us two copies of your application with the following 
information for all leases involved:
    (a) The serial numbers;
    (b) The name of the record title holder(s);
    (c) The name of the operator and operating rights owners if 
different from the record title holder(s);
    (d) A description of the lands by legal subdivision;
    (e) A map showing the serial number and location of each mine or 
excavation and the extent of the mining operations;
    (f) A tabulated statement of the leasable minerals mined for each 
month covering at least the last twelve months before you filed your 
application, and the average production mined per day for each month;
    (g) If you are applying for relief from the minimum production 
requirement, complete information as to why you did not attain the 
minimum production;
    (h) A detailed statement of expenses and costs of operating the 
entire lease, and the income from the sale of any leased products;
    (i) All facts showing why you cannot successfully operate the mines 
under the royalty or rental fixed in the lease and other lease terms;
    (j) For reductions in royalty, full information as to whether you 
pay royalties or payments out of production to anyone other than the 
United States, the amounts paid and efforts you have made to reduce 
them;

[[Page 643]]

    (k) Documents demonstrating that the total amount of overriding 
royalties paid for the lease will not exceed one-half the proposed 
reduced royalties due the United States; and
    (l) Any other information BLM needs to determine whether the request 
satisfies the standards in Sec. 3513.12 of this part.

     Suspension of Operations and Production (Conservation Concerns)


<R05>
Sec. 3513.20  What is a suspension of operations and production (conservation concerns)?

    A suspension of operations and production (conservation concerns) is 
a BLM action where BLM orders or allows you to suspend operations in the 
interest of conservation of natural resources.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.21  What is the effect of a suspension of operations and production (conservation concerns)?

    BLM will extend your lease term by any periods of suspension of 
operations and production (conservation concerns). We will reduce the 
minimum annual production requirements of your lease proportionately for 
that time during a lease year in which a suspension of operations and 
production is effective. You do not have to pay rental and minimum 
annual production royalties starting with the first day of the next 
lease month after the suspension becomes effective. However, if the 
suspension is effective on the first day of the lease month, you may 
stop paying rentals and royalties that same day.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.22  How do I apply for a suspension of operations and production (conservation concerns)?

    Send us two copies of an application that explains why it is in the 
interest of conservation to suspend your operations and production.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.23  May BLM order a suspension of operations and production (conservation concerns)?

    Yes, BLM may order a suspension of operations and production.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.25  When will my suspension of operations and production (conservation concerns) take effect?

    Your suspension takes effect on the date BLM specifies.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.26  When and how does my suspension of operations and production (conservation concerns) expire or terminate?

    Your suspension ends on the expiration date that BLM specifies in 
the decision or order approving the suspension, or on the first day of 
the lease month in which you resume operations or production, whichever 
occurs first. All lease terms and obligations resume on this date. MMS 
will allow credit towards future rentals or royalties due, if you paid 
rent for the period of suspension of operations and production.

              Suspension of Operations (Economic Concerns)


<R05>
Sec. 3513.30  What is a suspension of operations (economic concerns)?

    A suspension of operations (economic concerns) is an action by which 
BLM may approve your request to suspend operations on your lease when 
marketing conditions are such that you cannot operate your leases except 
at a loss. BLM may not order a suspension of operations (economic 
concerns) unless you request it.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.31  What is the effect of a suspension of operations (economic concerns)?

    This suspension does not affect the term of the lease or the annual 
rental payment. BLM will reduce the minimum annual production 
requirements of your lease in proportion to that part of the lease year 
for which a suspension of operations is effective.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.32  How do I apply for a suspension of operations (economic concerns)?

    Send us two copies of your application which shows why your lease 
cannot be operated except at a loss.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.33  When will my suspension of operations (economic concerns) take effect?

    Your suspension will be effective on the date BLM specifies. You do 
not

[[Page 644]]

have to pay royalty on minimum annual production beginning on the first 
day of the next lease month after the suspension becomes effective. If 
the effective date is the first of the month, you may stop paying 
royalty on minimum annual production on that day.


<R05>
Sec. 3513.34  When and how does my suspension of operations (economic concerns) expire or terminate?

    The suspension of operations (economic concerns) ends on the 
expirations date that BLM specifies in the decision approving the 
suspension, or on the first day of the lease month in which you resume 
operations, whichever occurs first. Your obligation for minimum annual 
production resumes at this time.


<R04>
          Subpart 3514--Lease Relinquishments and Cancellations

                        Relinquishing Your Lease


<R05>
Sec. 3514.11  May I relinquish my lease or any part of my lease?

    If you can show, to BLM's satisfaction, that the public interest 
will not be impaired, you may relinquish your entire lease or any legal 
subdivision of it. Notify us in writing that you intend to relinquish 
all or part of your lease. Include your original signature and date. If 
we approve your relinquishment, you are required to pay all accrued 
rentals and royalties, and to perform any reclamation of the leased 
lands that BLM may require. In some cases, BLM may require you to 
preserve any mines, productive works or permanent improvements on the 
leased lands in accordance with the terms of your lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.12  What additional information should I include in a request for partial relinquishment?

    Any partial relinquishment must also clearly describe the lands you 
are relinquishing and give the exact area involved.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.15  Where do I file my relinquishment?

    File the relinquishment in the BLM office that issued the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.20  When is my relinquishment effective?

    When BLM approves your relinquishment, it will be effective as of 
the date you filed it.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.21  When will BLM approve my relinquishment?

    We will accept your relinquishment when you have met all terms and 
conditions of the lease, including reclamation obligations.

            Cancellations, Forfeitures, and Other Situations


<R05>
Sec. 3514.25  When does my lease expire?

    (a) Sodium, sulphur, asphalt, and hardrock mineral leases expire at 
the end of the lease term. If you file a timely application for lease 
renewal under Sec. 3511.27 of this part, your lease expires on the 
expiration date or the date BLM rejected your application, whichever is 
later.
    (b) Potassium, phosphate and gilsonite leases continue for so long 
as you comply with the lease terms and conditions which are subject to 
periodic readjustment.
    (c) For more information, see Sec. 3511.15 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.30  May BLM cancel my lease?

    (a) Yes. BLM may institute appropriate proceedings in a court of 
competent jurisdiction to cancel your lease if:
    (1) You do not comply with the provisions of the Mineral Leasing 
Act, other relevant statutes, or regulations applicable to your lease; 
or
    (2) You default on any of the lease terms, covenants or stipulations 
and continue to fail or default for 30 days after BLM notifies you in 
writing of your default.
    (b) BLM may cancel your lease administratively if we issued it in 
violation of any law or regulation. In such a case, we may consider 
issuing an amended lease, if appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.31  May BLM waive cancellation or forfeiture?

    Yes, but our waiver of any particular cause of forfeiture will not 
prevent us from canceling and forfeiting the lease

[[Page 645]]

for any other cause or for the same cause occurring at any other time.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.32  Will BLM give me an opportunity to remedy a violation of the lease terms?

    (a) If you own or control, directly or indirectly, an interest in a 
lease in violation of any of the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act, 
other relevant statutes, the lease terms or the regulations in this 
part, we will give you 30 days to remedy the violation or to show cause 
why we should not ask the Attorney General to institute court 
proceedings to:
    (1) Cancel the lease;
    (2) Forfeit your interest; or
    (3) Compel disposal of the interest so owned or controlled.
    (b) BLM will not give you 30 days if there is no legal remedy to the 
violation.


<R05>
Sec. 3514.40  What if I am a bona fide purchaser and my lease is subject to cancellation?

    (a) If you are a bona fide purchaser, BLM will not cancel your lease 
or your interest in a lease based on your predecessor's actions. 
However, you must be sure that the lease is in compliance with the terms 
and conditions required by BLM.
    (b) BLM will promptly take action to dismiss any party who shows 
they are a bona fide purchaser from any legal proceedings to cancel the 
lease.

                  Subpart 3515--Mineral Lease Exchanges

                       Lease Exchange Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 3515.10  May I exchange my lease or lease right for another mineral lease or lease right?

    Yes. BLM may determine that operations on your lease or lands for 
which you have a preference right to a lease are not in the public 
interest. If you or BLM identify other lands for exchange, you may 
relinquish your current lease or preference right in exchange for a 
mineral lease of other lands of equal value.


<R05>
Sec. 3515.12  What regulatory provisions apply if I want to exchange a lease or lease right?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
subpart and the relevant provisions of part 2200 of this title apply to 
mineral lease exchanges.
    (b) Exchanges involving the issuance of coal leases, coal lease 
bidding rights or coal lease modifications are subject to the 
regulations in subpart 3435 of this chapter rather than to the 
regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3515.15  May BLM initiate an exchange?

    Yes. When we do:
    (a) We will notify you that we are prepared to consider exchange of 
a mineral lease if you relinquish your existing leasing rights.
    (b) We may exchange all or any part of the lands under your 
preference right lease application(s) or lease(s).


<R05>
Sec. 3515.16  What standards does BLM use to assess the public interest of an exchange?

    BLM must find that the exchange is in the public interest under the 
following criteria:
    (a) The benefits of production from your existing lease or 
preference right to a lease would not outweigh the adverse effects on, 
or threat of damage or destruction to:
    (1) Agricultural production potential;
    (2) Scenic values;
    (3) Biological values including threatened or endangered species 
habitat;
    (4) Geologic values;
    (5) Archeological, historic or other cultural values;
    (6) Other public interest values such as recreational use;
    (7) Residential or urban areas;
    (8) Potential inclusion in the wilderness or wild and scenic rivers 
systems; or
    (9) Other public uses, including public highways, airports, and 
rights-of-way from lease operations.
    (b) The lands proposed for exchange must be free from hazardous 
waste as defined under the authorities of the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 
U.S.C. 6901) and

[[Page 646]]

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
(42 U.S.C. 9601).


<R05>
Sec. 3515.18  Will I be notified when BLM is considering initiating an exchange that will affect my lease?

    Yes. The notice you receive will:
    (a) State why we believe an exchange would be in the public 
interest;
    (b) Ask whether you are willing to negotiate for an exchange;
    (c) Contain a description of the lands for which we would offer 
exchange terms; and
    (d) Ask you to describe the lands on which you would accept a lease 
in exchange for your present holdings.

                        Types of Lease Exchanges


<R05>
Sec. 3515.20  May I exchange preference rights?

    Yes. To have a preference right that can be exchanged, you must have 
timely submitted a preference right lease application. If you have 
demonstrated a right to a lease, BLM may, in lieu of issuing the 
preference right lease, negotiate for the selection of appropriate lands 
to exchange and establish lease terms for those lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3515.21  What types of lands can be exchanged?

    The lands to be leased in exchange for your existing rights must be:
    (a) Subject to leasing under the authorities of this part; and
    (b) Acceptable to both you and BLM as a lease tract containing a 
deposit of leasable or hardrock minerals of equal value to your existing 
rights.


<R05>
Sec. 3515.22  What if the lands to be exchanged are not of equal value?

    If the lands are not equal in value, either party may equalize the 
value by paying money to the party receiving the property of lesser 
value. Such payments may not exceed 25 percent of the total value of the 
land or interest transferred out of Federal ownership. The parties may 
mutually agree to waive the monetary payment, if the Secretary 
determines that:
    (a) A waiver will expedite the exchange;
    (b) The public interest will be better served by the waiver than by 
the payment; and
    (c) The amount to be waived is no more than 3 percent of the value 
of the lands being transferred out of Federal ownership, or $15,000, 
whichever is less.

                        Lease Exchange Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 3515.23  May BLM require me to submit additional information?

    Yes. You must be willing to provide geologic and economic data we 
need to determine the fair market value of your preference right or 
lease to be relinquished.


<R05>
Sec. 3515.25  Is BLM required to publish notice or hold a hearing?

    Yes. After you and BLM agree on the lands for exchange, we will 
publish a notice of the proposed exchange in the Federal Register and in 
a newspaper(s) in the county(s) where the lands involved are located. 
The notice will include:
    (a) The time and place of a public hearing(s);
    (b) Our preliminary findings that the exchange is in the public 
interest; and
    (c) A request for public comments on the merits of the proposed 
exchange.


<R05>
Sec. 3515.26  When will BLM make a decision on the exchange?

    After the public hearing and consideration of public comments, we 
will determine whether issuance of the exchange lease is in the public 
interest. If it is, we will then process the exchange. If not, we will 
cancel the exchange.


<R05>
Sec. 3515.27  Will BLM attach any special provisions to the exchange lease?

    Yes, the lease terms will contain a statement that you quitclaim and 
relinquish any right or interest in your preference right lease 
application or lease exchanged.


<R04>
                        Subpart 3516--Use Permits


<R05>
Sec. 3516.10  What are use permits?

    Use permits allow you to use the surface of lands not included 
within your permit or lease to help you develop the mineral deposits. 
You may only get a

[[Page 647]]

use permit during the life of your permit or lease, and only for 
unentered, unappropriated, BLM-administered land. Use permits are not 
prospecting permits.


<R05>
Sec. 3516.11  What kinds of permits or leases allow use permits?

    Use permits are issued only in support of phosphate and sodium 
permits and leases. For phosphate permits and leases, BLM may issue you 
a use permit to use up to 80 acres. For sodium leases, use permits are 
limited to no more than 40 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 3516.12  What activities may I conduct under a use permit?

    Phosphate use permits authorize you to conduct activities to 
properly extract, treat, or remove the mineral deposits. Sodium use 
permits authorize you to occupy camp sites, develop refining works and 
use the surface for other purposes connected with, and necessary to, the 
proper development and use of the deposits.


<R05>
Sec. 3516.15  How do I apply for a use permit?

    You must file three copies of your application in the BLM office 
administering the lands you are interested in. There is no specific form 
required. Include a nonrefundable $25 filing fee and the first year's 
rental. Calculate the rental in accordance with Sec. 3504.15 of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 3516.16  What must I include with my application?

    You must agree to pay the annual charge identified in the permit, 
and provide the following information:
    (a) Specific reasons why you need the additional lands;
    (b) A description of the lands applied for;
    (c) Any information demonstrating that the lands are suitable and 
appropriate for your needs; and
    (d) Evidence that the lands are unoccupied and unappropriated.


<R05>
Sec. 3516.20  Is there an annual fee or charge for use of the lands?

    Yes. You must pay the annual $1 per acre rental, or $20, whichever 
is greater, on or before the anniversary date of the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 3516.30  What happens if I fail to pay the annual rental on my use permit?

    Your use permit will terminate automatically if you fail to pay the 
required rental within 30 days after we serve you with a written notice 
of the rental requirement.


<R04>
  Subpart 3517--Hardrock Mineral Development Contracts; Processing and 
                          Milling Arrangements


<R05>
Sec. 3517.10  What are development contracts and processing and milling arrangements?

    Development contracts and processing and milling arrangements 
involving hardrock minerals are agreements between one or more lessees 
and one or more other persons to justify large scale operations for the 
discovery, development, production, or transportation of ores.


<R05>
Sec. 3517.11  Are permits and leases covered by approved agreements exempt from the acreage limitations?

    Hardrock mineral permits and leases committed to development 
contracts or processing or milling arrangements approved by BLM are 
exempt from state and nationwide acreage limitations. We will not count 
them toward your maximum acreage holdings. However, individual hardrock 
mineral leases committed to a development contract or lease may not 
exceed 2560 acres in size.


<R05>
Sec. 3517.15  How do I apply for approval of one of these agreements?

    No specific form is required. Submit three copies of your 
application to the BLM office with jurisdiction over some or all of the 
lands in which you are interested. Include the following information:
    (a) Copies of the contract or other agreement affecting the Federal 
hardrock mineral leases or permits, or both;
    (b) A statement showing the nature and reason for your request;

[[Page 648]]

    (c) A statement showing all the interests held in the area of the 
agreement by the designated contractor; and
    (d) The proposed or agreed upon plan of operation for development of 
the leased lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3517.16  How does BLM process my application?

    (a) We will consider whether the agreement will conserve natural 
resources and is in the public interest.
    (b) Once the agreement is signed by all the parties, we may approve 
it.

<R04>
          Subpart 3599--Late Payment or Underpayment of Charges


<R05>
Sec. 3599.1  Late payment or underpayment charges.

    (a) The failure to make timely or proper payments of any monies due 
pursuant to leases, permits, and contracts subject to these regulations 
will result in the collection by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) 
of the amount past due plus a late payment charge. Exceptions to this 
late payment charge may be granted when estimated payments have already 
been made timely and otherwise in accordance with instructions provided 
by MMS to the payor. However, late payment charges assessed with respect 
to any Indian lease, permit, or contract shall be collected and paid to 
the Indian or tribe to which the overdue amount is owed.
    (b) Late payment charges are assessed on any late payment or 
underpayment from the date that the payment was due until the date on 
which the payment is received in the appropriate MMS accounting office. 
Payments received after 4 p.m. local time on the date due will be 
acknowledged as received on the following workday.
    (c) Late payment charges are calculated on the basis of a percentage 
assessment rate. In the absence of a specific lease, permit, license, or 
contract provision prescribing a different rate, this percentage 
assessment rate is prescribed by the Department of the Treasury as the 
``Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate.''
    (d) This rate is available in the Treasury Fiscal Requirements 
Manual Bulletins that are published prior to the first day of each 
calendar quarter for application to overdue payments or underpayments in 
that new calendar quarter. The rate is also published in the Notices 
section of the Federal Register and indexed under ``Fiscal Service/
Notices/Funds Rate; Treasury Current Value.''
    (e) Late payment charges apply to all underpayments and payments 
received after the date due. These charges include rentals; production, 
minimum, or advance royalties; assessments for liquidated damages; 
administrative fees and payments by purchaser of royalty taken-in-kind 
or any other payments, fees, or assessments that a lessee/operator/
permittee/payor/or purchaser of royalty taken-in-kind is required to pay 
by a specified date. The failure to pay past due amounts, including late 
payment charges, will result in the initiation of other enforcement 
proceedings.

                          Subpart 3600--General


<R05>
Sec. 3600.0-1  Purpose.

    The regulations in this part establish procedures for the 
exploration, development and disposal of mineral material resources as 
well as the protection of the environment of the public lands under 
permit or contract for sale or free use.


<R05>
Sec. 3600.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The Act of July 31, 1947, as amended (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
provides:
    (1) Authority for the disposal of mineral materials including, but 
not limited to, petrified wood and common varieties of sand, stone, 
gravel, pumice, pumicite, cinders and clay, in the public lands of the 
United States, and from lands on which the mineral rights have been 
reserved to the United States, if the disposal of these materials (i) is 
not otherwise expressly authorized by law, including, but not limited to 
the Act of June 28, 1934, as amended (43 U.S.C. 315 et seq.) and the 
United States mining laws, (ii) is not expressly prohibited by the laws 
of the United States, and (iii) would not be detrimental to the public 
interest.
    (2) That where the lands have been withdrawn in aid of a function of 
a Federal department or agency other than the Department of the 
Interior, or of a State, or other local governmental subdivision or 
agency, the Secretary of the Interior may make disposals under the 
regulations in this part only with the consent of such Federal 
department or agency or of such State or local governmental unit;
    (3) That disposal of mineral materials under the Materials Act may 
not be made from any lands in any national park or national monument or 
from any Indian lands or lands set aside or held for the use or benefit 
of Indians including lands over which jurisdiction has been transferred 
to the Department of the Interior by Executive order for the use of 
Indians.
    (4) Authority for the Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion 
to permit the free use of mineral materials by any Federal or State 
government agency, unit or subdivision, including municipalities, or any 
nonprofit association or corporation. The Materials Act does not permit 
these materials to be used for commercial or industrial purposes, resale 
or barter.
    (b) Section 302 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976 (43 U.S.C. 1732) directs the Secretary:
    (1) To manage public lands under the principles of multiple use and 
sustained yield in accordance with the land use plans developed under 
the Act (see subpart 1601 of this title).
    (2) To regulate, through easements, permits, leases, licenses, 
published rules or other instruments deemed appropriate, the use, 
occupancy and development of public lands.
    (3) To prevent unnecessary and undue degradation of the public 
lands.
    (c) Section 2 of the Act of September 28, 1962 (76 Stat. 652) 
requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide by regulation that 
limited quantities of petrified wood may be removed without charges from 
public lands which he shall specify. Section 2 of the above Act applies 
to the same public lands as the Act of July 31, 1947, as amended (30 
U.S.C. 601, 602). Specifically excluded are lands in any national park, 
or national monument, or any Indian lands.
    (d) Section 304(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1975 (43 U.S.C. 1734) and the Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 
1952 (31 U.S.C. 483a) provide authorities for the

[[Page 667]]

collection of fees and the reimbursement of costs by the government.


<R05>
Sec. 3600.0-4  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Bureau of Land Management to permit the 
disposal of mineral material resources under the Bureau's jurisdiction 
at fair market value while ensuring that adequate measures are taken to 
protect the environment and minimize damage to public health and safety 
during the authorized exploration for and the removal of such minerals. 
No mineral material shall be disposed of if the Secretary determines 
that the aggregate damage to public lands and resources would exceed the 
benefits to be derived from the proposed sale or free use.


<R05>
Sec. 3600.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this group, the term:
    (a) Bureau means Bureau of Land Management, Department of the 
Interior.
    (b) Director means the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.
    (c) Permittee means any person, corporation, partnership and 
association, Federal, or State agency, unit, or subdivision, including 
municipalities, and non-profit organization or corporation or other 
entity that has been issued a contract or a free-use permit for the 
removal of mineral materials from the public lands.
    (d) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management who has been delegated the authority to perform the duties 
described in this part.
    (e) Mineral material includes, but is not limited to, common 
varieties of sand, stone, gravel, pumice, pumicite, cinders, clay and 
other mineral materials and petrified wood.
    (f) Public lands means any lands and interest in lands owned by the 
United States and administered by the Secretary of the Interior through 
the Bureau of Land Management without regard to how the United States 
acquired ownership, except lands held for the benefit of Indians, 
Aleuts, and Eskimos.
    (g) Community pit means a site from which nonexclusive disposals of 
mineral materials can be made. The establishment of a community pit, 
when noted on the appropriate Bureau of Land Management records or 
posted on the ground, constitutes a superior right to remove material as 
against any subsequent claim or entry of the lands.
    (h) Common use area means a generally broad geographic area from 
which nonexclusive disposals of mineral materials can be made, with only 
negligible surface disturbance. The establishment of a common use area 
does not create a superior right to remove material as against any 
subsequent claim or entry of the lands.
    (i) Performance bond means a bond to ensure compliance with the 
terms of the contract and reclamation of the site as required by the 
authorized officer.
    (j) Act means the Material Act of July 31, 1947, as amended, (30 
U.S.C. 601, et seq.).
    (k) Unnecessary or undue degradation means surface disturbance 
greater than what would normally result when an activity is being 
accomplished by a prudent operator in usual, customary, and proficient 
operations of similar character and taking into consideration the 
effects of operations on other resources and land uses, including those 
resources and uses outside the area of operations. Unnecessary and undue 
degradation may involve failure to initiate and complete reasonable 
mitigation measures, including reclamation of disturbed area; creation 
of a nuisance; or failure to comply with applicable environmental 
protection statutes and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 3600.0-8  Public availability of information.

    (a) All data and information concerning Federal and Indian minerals 
submitted under this part 3600 and parts 3610 and 3620 of this chapter 
are subject to part 2 of this title. Part 2 of this title includes the 
regulations of the Department of the Interior covering the public 
disclosure of data and information contained in Department of the 
Interior records. Certain mineral information not protected from public 
disclosure under part 2 of this title may be made available for 
inspection without a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) 
request.

[[Page 668]]

    (b) When you submit data and information under this part 3600 and 
parts 3610 and 3620 of this chapter that you believe to be exempt from 
disclosure to the public, you must clearly mark each page that you 
believe includes confidential information. BLM will keep all data and 
information confidential to the extent allowed by Sec. 2.13(c) of this 
title.
    33. Section 3602.2 is amended by removing the last two sentences of 
paragraph (a), and adding a sentence in their place to read as follows:

    (b) The designation of a community pit site constitutes a superior 
right to remove the material as against any subsequent claim or entry of 
the lands.
    (c) The designation of a common use area does not establish a 
superior right to remove the material as against any subsequent claim or 
entry of the land; however, a person authorized by permit or sale to 
remove mineral materials from a common use area has a superior right to 
remove the material as against any subsequent claim or entry on the 
lands.
    (d) Sales from community pit sites or common use areas shall be made 
at fair market value. No mining or reclamation plan shall be required,

applied to the purchase price at the time the contract is signed by the 
authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 3610.3-5  Contracts.

    (a) The authorized officer may require the person making the high 
bid to furnish information that is necessary to determine his ability to 
fulfill the obligations of the contract. The contract shall be awarded 
by the authorized officer to the person making the highest bid, unless 
he is unwilling to accept the terms of the contract or unless all bids 
are rejected.
    (b) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract, the person making 
the successful bid shall sign and return the contract, together with any 
required performance bond and mining and reclamation plan when 
applicable. The authorized officer may extend this period an additional 
30 days upon written request of the applicant, within the first 30-day 
period. If the person making the successful bid fails to comply within

[[Page 674]]

the first 30-day period, or an approved 30-day extension, the successful 
bidder shall forfeit the bid deposit as liquidated damages. The 
authorized officer may offer and award the contract for the amount of 
the high bid to the person making the next highest bid who is qualified 
and willing to accept the contract, upon the redeposit of the amount 
required under Sec. 3610.3-4(a).
    (c) The authorized officer shall make all sales on contract forms 
approved by the Director. The authorized officer may include in the

Sec. 3710.0-3  Authority.

    The Act of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367, 30 U.S.C. sec. 601), was 
enacted ``to amend the Act of July 31, 1947 (61 Stat. 681) and the 
mining laws to provide for multiple use of the surface of the same 
tracts of the public lands, and for other purposes.'' The regulations in 
this part are intended to implement only sections 3 to 7, inclusive, of 
said Act hereinafter more fully identified. The word ``Act'' when used 
in this subpart refers to the Act of July 23, 1955. Sections 1 and 2 
thereof relate specifically to the Materials Act of July 31, 1947.

                     Subpart 3711--Common Varieties


<R05>
Sec. 3711.1  Provisions of act.

    (a) The Act in section 3 provides: A deposit of common varieties of 
sand, stone, gravel, pumice, pumicite or cinders shall not be deemed a 
valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws of the 
United States so as to give effective validity to any mining claim 
hereafter located under such mining laws: Provided, however, That 
nothing herein shall affect the validity of any mining location based 
upon discovery of some other mineral occurring in or in association with 
such a deposit. ``Common varieties'' as used in this act does not 
include deposits of such materials which are valuable because the 
deposit has some property giving it distinct and special value and does 
not include so-called ``block pumice'' which occurs in nature in pieces 
having one dimension of two inches or more.
    (b) ``Common varieties'' includes deposits which, although they may 
have value for use in trade, manufacture, the sciences, or in the 
mechanical or ornamental arts, do not possess a distinct, special 
economic value for such use over and above the normal uses of the 
general run of such deposits. Mineral materials which occur commonly 
shall not be deemed to be ``common varieties'' if a particular deposit 
has distinct and special properties making it commercially valuable for 
use in a manufacturing, industrial, or processing operation. In the 
determination of commercial value, such factors may be considered as 
quality and quantity of the deposit, geographical location, proximity to 
market or point of utilization, accessibility to transportation, 
requirements for reasonable reserves consistent with usual industry 
practices to serve existing or proposed manufacturing, industrial, or 
processing facilities, and feasible methods for mining and removal of 
the material. Limestone suitable for use in the production of cement, 
metallurgical or chemical grade limestone, gypsum, and the like are not 
``common varieties.'' This subsection does not relieve a claimant from 
any requirements of the mining laws.

<R05>
Sec. 3712.1  Restriction on use of unpatented mining claims.

    (a) The Act in section 4 provides:

    Any mining claim hereafter located under the mining laws of the 
United States shall not be used, prior to issuance of patent therefor, 
for any purposes other than prospecting, mining or processing operations 
and uses reasonably incident thereto.
    Rights under any mining claim hereafter located under the mining 
laws of the United States shall be subject, prior to issuance of patent 
therefor, to the right of the United States to manage and dispose of the 
vegetative surface resources thereof and to manage other surface 
resources thereof (except mineral deposits subject to location under the 
mining laws of the United States). Any such mining claim shall also be 
subject, prior to

[[Page 678]]

issuance of patent therefor, to the right of the United States, its 
permittees, and licensees, to use so much of the surface thereof as may 
be necessary for such purposes or for access to adjacent land: Provided, 
however, That any use of the surface of any such mining claim by the 
United States, its permittees or licensees, shall be such as not to 
endanger or materially interfere with prospecting, mining or processing 
operations or uses reasonably incident thereto: Provided, further, That 
if at any time the locator requires more timber for his mining 
operations than is available to him from the claim after disposition of 
timber therefrom by the United States, subsequent to the location of the 
claim, he shall be entitled, free of charge, to be supplied with timber 
for such requirements from the nearest timber administered by the 
disposing agency which is ready for harvesting under the rules and 
regulations of that agency and which is substantially equivalent in kind 
and quantity to the timber estimated by the disposing agency to have 
been disposed of from the claim: Provided, further, That nothing in this 
act shall be construed as affecting or intended to affect or in any way 
interfere with or modify the laws of the States which lie wholly or in 
part westward of the ninety-eighth meridian relating to the ownership, 
control, appropriation, use, and distribution of ground or surface 
waters within any unpatented mining claim.
    Except to the extent required for the mining claimant's prospecting, 
mining or processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto, or 
for the construction of buildings or structures in connection therewith, 
or to provide clearance for such operations or uses, or to the extent 
authorized by the United States, no claimant of any mining claim 
hereafter located under the mining laws of the United States shall, 
prior to issuance of patent therefor, sever, remove, or use any 
vegetative or other surface resources thereof which are subject to 
management or disposition by the United States under the preceding 
subsection (b). Any severance or removal of timber which is permitted 
under the exceptions of the preceding sentence, other than severance or 
removal to provide clearance, shall be in accordance with sound 
principles of forest management.

    (b) The locator of an unpatented mining claim subject to the Act is 
limited in his use of the claim to those uses specified in the act, 
namely prospecting, mining, or processing operations and uses reasonably 
incident thereto. He is forbidden to use it for any other purpose such, 
for example, as for filling stations, curio shops, cafes, tourist, or 
fishing and hunting camps. Except as such interference may result from 
uses permitted under the act, the locator of an unpatented mining claim 
subject to the act may not interfere with the right of the United States 
to manage the vegetative and other surface resources of the land, or use 
it so as to block access to or egress from adjacent public land, or use 
Federal timber for purposes other than those permitted under the act, or 
block access to water needed in grazing use of the national forests or 
other public lands, or block access to recreational areas, or prevent 
agents of the Federal Government from crossing the locator's claim in 
order to reach adjacent land for purposes of managing wild-game habitat 
or improving fishing streams so as to thwart the public harvest and 
proper management of fish and game resources on the public lands 
generally, both on located and on adjacent lands.
    (c) Mining claims located prior to the date of the act will be 
subject to the Act where determination has been made pursuant to section 
5 of the Act, that the locator's surface rights are limited as provided 
in section 4 of the Act, or where the owners have waived and 
relinquished all rights under section 6 of the Act, which are contrary 
to or in conflict with the limitations and restrictions specified as to 
hereafter located unpatented mining claims in section 4 of the Act. See 
Sec. 3714.3 as to effect on existing rights.
    (d) On mining claims subject to the provisions of the Act, timber 
may be used by the claimants only for the purposes permitted under the 
Act, and, except where timber is removed to provide clearance for 
operations or uses permitted under the Act, such timber must be cut in 
accordance with sound principles of forest management. When timber on a 
mining claim is disposed of by the Government subsequent to the location 
of the claim, free use of timber by the mining claimant of like kind and 
quantity from the nearest timber administered by the disposing agency is 
provided for, but only when and to the extent that is required for their 
mining operations and only in kind and quantity substantially equivalent 
to the timber removed from the claim by the Government. Any such timber 
may be cut and removed only under the rules and regulations of the

[[Page 679]]

administering agency. Regulations governing applications and issuance of 
permits for the use of such timber on public lands administered by the 
Bureau of Land Management are contained in part 5510 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.2  Publication of notice.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.2-1  Request for publication of notice to mining claimant.

    (a) The Act in the first paragraph of section 5(a) provides as 
follows:

    The head of a Federal department or agency which has the 
responsibility for administering surface resources of any lands 
belonging to the United States may file as to such lands in the office 
of the Secretary of the Interior, or in such office as the Secretary of 
the Interior may designate, a request for publication of notice to 
mining claimants, for determination of surface rights, which request 
shall contain a description of the lands covered thereby, showing the 
section or sections of the public land surveys which embrace the lands 
covered by such request, or if such lands are unsurveyed, either the 
section or sections which would probably embrace such lands when the 
public land surveys are extended to such lands or a tie by courses and 
distances to an approved United States mineral monument.
    The ``request for publication of notice to mining claimants'' 
authorized to be filed by the above-quoted portion of the act can be 
filed by the Federal department or agency which has the responsibility 
for administering surface resources of the lands to which the requested 
notice would relate. It must describe the land covered by the request by 
section, township, range, and meridian or, if the land is unsurveyed, 
either the section or sections which would probably embrace such lands 
when the public land surveys are extended to such lands, or by a metes 
and bounds description of such area with a tie to a United States 
mineral monument.

    (b) A request for publication of notice under this subsection shall 
be filed with the proper office of the Bureau of Land Management. No 
request for publication may include lands in more than one district.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.2-2  Evidence necessary to support a request for publication.

    (a) The second and third paragraphs of section 5(a) of the Act 
provide in detail for the filing by the head of a Federal department or 
agency of certain evidence in support of the request for publication of 
the notice referred to in Sec. 3712.2-1 as follows:

    The filing of such request for publication shall be accompanied by 
an affidavit or affidavits of a person or persons over twenty-one years 
of age setting forth that the affiant or affiants have examined the 
lands involved in a reasonable effort to ascertain whether any person or 
persons were in actual possession of or engaged in the working of such 
lands or any part thereof, and, if no person or persons were found to be 
in actual possession of or engaged in the working of said lands or any 
part thereof, on the date of such examination, setting forth such fact, 
or, if any person or persons were so found to be in actual possession or 
engaged in such working on the date of such examination, setting forth 
the name and address of each such person, unless affiant shall have been 
unable through reasonable inquiry to obtain information as to the name 
and address of any such person, in which event the affidavit shall set 
forth fully the nature and results of such inquiry.
    The filing of such request for publication shall also be accompanied 
by the certificate of a title or abstract company, or of a title 
abstractor, or of an attorney, based upon such company's abstractor's or 
attorney's examination of those instruments which are shown by the tract 
indexes in the county office of record as affecting the lands described 
in said request, setting forth the name of any person disclosed by said 
instruments to have an interest in said lands under any unpatented 
mining claim heretofore located, together with the address of such 
person if such address is disclosed by such instruments of record. 
``Tract indexes'' as used herein shall mean those indexes, if any, as to 
surveyed lands identifying instruments as affecting a particular legal 
subdivision of the public land surveys, and as to unsurveyed lands 
identifying instruments as affecting a particular probable legal 
subdivision according to a projected extension of the public land 
surveys.

    (b) This part of the Act requires the filing of an affidavit which 
may be made by any person or persons over twenty-one years of age who 
have examined the lands. It must show whether any person or persons were 
``in actual possession of or engaged in the working of such lands (the 
lands described in the request for publication of notice) or any part 
thereof'' and, if they were, the name and address of each such person 
must be given if it can be learned by reasonable inquiry and if it 
cannot be so learned, the affidavit must show in detail what inquiry

[[Page 680]]

or inquiries were made to obtain each such name and address. No 
definition of the terms ``in actual possession'' or ``engaged in the 
working of said lands'' will be attempted here, but the affidavits 
should recite what evidences of occupancy or workings were found. The 
request for publication must also be accompanied by a certificate 
executed as provided in the third paragraph of section 5(a) and 
containing the information required by that paragraph to be furnished. 
If there are no tract indexes, as defined in the Act, in the county 
office of record affecting the lands described in the request for 
publication, a certificate executed as provided in the said third 
paragraph of section 5(a) to that effect must be furnished.

Sec. 3712.2-3  Contents of published notice.

    Section 5(a) of the Act specifies in detail what the published 
notice shall contain, as follows:

    Such notice shall describe the lands covered by such request, as 
provided heretofore, and shall notify whomever it may concern that if 
any person claiming or asserting under, or by virtue of, any unpatented 
mining claim heretofore located, rights as to such lands or any part 
thereof, shall fail to file in the office where such request for 
publication was filed (which office shall be specified in such notice) 
and within one hundred and fifty days from the date of the first 
publication of such notice (which date shall be specified in such 
notice), a verified statement which shall set forth, as to such 
unpatented mining claim--
    (1) The date of location;
    (2) The book and page of recordation of the notice or certificate of 
location;
    (3) The section or sections of the public land surveys which embrace 
such mining claims; or if such lands are unsurveyed, either the section 
or sections which would probably embrace such mining claim when the 
public land surveys are extended to such lands or a tie by courses and 
distances to an approved United States mineral monument;
    (4) Whether such claimant is a locator or purchaser under such 
location; and
    (5) The name and address of such claimant and names and addresses so 
far as known to the claimant of any other person or persons claiming any 
interest or interests in or under such unpatented mining claim: such 
failure shall be conclusively deemed (i) to constitute a waiver and 
relinquishment by such mining claimant of any right, title or interest 
under such mining claim contrary to or in conflict with the limitations 
or restrictions specified in section 4 of this Act as to hereafter 
located unpatented mining claims, and (ii) to constitute a consent by 
such mining claimant that such mining claim, prior to issuance of patent 
therefor, shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions specified 
in section 4 of this Act as to hereafter located unpatented mining 
claims, and (iii) to preclude thereafter, prior to issuance of patent, 
any assertion by such mining claimant of any right or title to or 
interest in or under such mining claim contrary to or in conflict with 
the limitations or restrictions specified in section 4 of this Act as to 
hereafter located unpatented mining claims.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.2-4  Publication.

    If the request for publication and the accompanying papers conform 
to the requirements of the Act, the Authorized officer or the Director, 
as may be appropriate, at the expense of the requesting department or 
agency, shall cause notice to mining claimants to be published in a 
newspaper having general circulation in the county in which the lands 
involved are situated. If the notice is published in a daily newspaper 
it shall be published in the Wednesday issue for nine consecutive weeks, 
if in a weekly paper, in nine consecutive issues, or if in a semi-weekly 
or tri-weekly paper, in the issue of the same day of each week for nine 
consecutive weeks.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.2-5  Proof of publication.

    After the period of newspaper publication has expired, the 
department or agency requesting the publication shall obtain from the 
office of the newspaper or publication a sworn statement that the notice 
was published at the time and in accordance with the requirements under 
the regulations of this part, and shall file such sworn statement in the 
office where the Request for Publication was filed.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.2-6  Service of notice.

    The last paragraph of section 5(a) of the Act provides with respect 
to service of the notice by personal delivery or by registered mail, as 
follows:

    Within fifteen days after the date of first publication of such 
notice, the department or agency requesting such publication (1)

[[Page 681]]

shall cause a copy of such notice to be personally delivered to or to be 
mailed by registered mail addressed to each person in possession or 
engaged in the working of the land whose name and address is shown by an 
affidavit filed as aforesaid, and to each person who may have filed, as 
to any lands described in said notice, a request for notices, as 
provided in subsection (d) of this section 5, and shall cause a copy of 
such notice to be mailed by registered mail to each person whose name 
and address is set forth in the title or abstract company's or title 
abstractor's or attorney's certificate filed as aforesaid, as having an 
interest in the lands described in said notice under any unpatented 
mining claim heretofore located, such notice to be directed to such 
person's address as set forth in such certificate; and (2) shall file in 
the office where said request for publication was filed an affidavit 
showing that copies have been so delivered or mailed.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.2-7  Service of copies; failure to comply.

    If the department or agency requesting publication under these 
regulations shall fail to comply with the requirements of section 5(a) 
of the Act as to the personal delivery or mailing of a copy of the 
published notice to any person, the publication of such notice shall be 
deemed wholly ineffectual as to that person or as to the rights asserted 
by that person and the failure of that person to file a verified 
statement, as provided in such notice shall in no manner affect, 
diminish, prejudice or bar any rights of that person.


<R05>
Sec. 3712.3  Failure of claimant to file verified statement.

    If any claimant under any unpatented mining claim located prior to 
July 23, 1955, which embraces any of the lands described in any notice 
published in accordance with the regulations in this part shall fail to 
file a verified statement, as specified in such published notice (See 
Sec. 3712.2-4), within one hundred and fifty days from the date of the 
first publication of such notice, such failure shall be conclusively 
deemed except as otherwise provided in Sec. 3712.2-7.
    (a) To constitute a waiver and relinquishment by such mining 
claimant of any right, title or interest under such mining claim 
contrary to or in conflict with the limitations or restrictions 
specified in section 4 of the Act as to unpatented mining claims located 
after its enactment.
    (b) To constitute a consent by such mining claimant that such mining 
claim, prior to issuance of patent therefor, be subject to the 
limitations and restrictions specified in section 4 of the Act as to 
unpatented mining claims located after its enactment.
    (c) To preclude thereafter prior to the issuance of patent any 
assertion by such mining claimant of any right or title to or interest 
in or under such mining claim contrary to or in conflict with the 
limitations or restrictions specified in section 4 of the Act as to 
unpatented mining claims located after its enactment.

Sec. 3713.2  Hearing: Time and place.

    If any verified statement shall be filed by a mining claimant then 
the administrative law judge or the Director, as may be appropriate, 
shall fix a time and place for a hearing to determine the validity and 
effectiveness of any right or title to or interest in or under such 
mining claim which the mining claimant may assert contrary to or in 
conflict with the limitations or restrictions specified in section 4 of 
the Act as to unpatented mining claims located after its enactment. The 
administrative law judge shall notify the department or agency and all 
mining claimants entitled to notice as the result of the filing of such 
verified statement of the time and place of such hearing at least 30 
days in advance thereof. The notice of hearing shall contain a statement 
specifying the issues upon which

[[Page 682]]

evidence will be submitted at the hearing. Such hearing shall be held in 
the county where the lands in question, or parts thereof, are located 
unless the mining claimant agrees otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 3713.3  Stipulation between parties.

    Where verified statements are filed asserting rights to an aggregate 
of more than twenty mining claims, any single hearing shall be limited 
to a maximum of twenty mining claims unless the parties affected shall 
otherwise stipulate and as many separate hearings shall be set as shall 
be necessary to comply with section 5(c) of the Act. If at any time 
prior to a hearing the department or agency requesting publication of 
notice and any person filing a verified statement pursuant to such 
notice shall so stipulate, then to the extent so stipulated, but only to 
such extent, no hearing shall be held with respect to rights asserted 
under that verified statement, and to the extent defined by the 
stipulation the rights asserted under that verified statement shall be 
deemed to be unaffected by the notice published pursuant to that 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 3713.4  Effect of decision affirming a mining claimant's rights.

    (a) If the final decision rendered in any hearing held pursuant to 
section 5 of the Act shall affirm the validity and effectiveness of any 
mining claimant's right or interest under a mining claim asserted in 
accordance with the provisions of that section, then no subsequent 
proceedings under section 5 of the act shall have any force or effect 
upon the so-affirmed right or interest of such mining claimant under 
such mining claim.
    (b) If it is finally determined as the result of such a hearing that 
the claimant has no right or title to or interest in or under his mining 
claim which he may assert contrary to or in conflict with the 
limitations and restrictions specified in section 4 of the act, then 
those limitations and restrictions shall apply with respect to such 
mining claim.

Sec. 3714.1  Recording by mining claimant of request for copy of notice.

    Section 5(d) of the Act provides as follows:

    Any person claiming any right under or by virtue of any unpatented 
mining claim heretofore located and desiring to receive a copy of any 
notice to mining claimants which may be published as above provided in 
subsection (a) of this section 5, and which may affect lands embraced in 
such mining claim, may cause to be filed for record in the county office 
of record where the notice of certificate of location of such mining 
claim shall have been recorded, a duly acknowledged request for a copy 
of any such notice. Such request for copies shall set forth the name and 
address of the person requesting copies, and shall also set forth, as to 
each heretofore located unpatented mining claim under which such person 
asserts rights--
    (1) The date of location;
    (2) The book and page of the recordation of the notice or 
certificate of location; and
    (3) The section or sections of the public land surveys which embrace 
such mining claim; or if such lands are unsurveyed, either the section 
or sections which would probably embrace such mining claim when the 
public land surveys are extended to such lands or a tie by courses and 
distances to an approved United States mineral monument. Other than in 
respect to the requirements of subsection (a) of this section 5 as to 
personal delivery or mailing of copies of notices and in respect to the 
provisions of subsection (e) of this section 5, no such request for 
copies of published notices and no statement or allegation in such 
request and no recordation thereof shall affect title to any mining 
claim or to any land or be deemed to constitute constructive notice to 
any person that the person requesting copies has, or claims, any right, 
title, or interest in or under any mining claim referred to in such 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 3714.2  Waiver of rights by mining claimants.

    Section 6 of the Act provides as follows:

    The owner or owners of any unpatented mining claim heretofore 
located may waive and relinquish all rights thereunder which are 
contrary to or in conflict with the limitations or restrictions 
specified in section 4 of this Act as to hereafter located

[[Page 683]]

unpatented mining claims. The execution and acknowledgement of such a 
waiver and relinquishment by such owner or owners and the recordation 
thereof in the office where the notice or certificate of location of 
such mining claim is of record shall render such mining claim thereafter 
and prior to issuance of patent subject to the limitations and 
restrictions in section 4 of this Act in all respects as if said mining 
claim had been located after enactment of this act, but no such waiver 
or relinquishment shall be deemed in any manner to constitute any 
concession as to the date of priority of rights under said mining claim 
or as to the validity thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 3714.3  Protection of existing rights; exclusion of reservation in patents.

    The Act in section 7 provides as follows:

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed in any manner to limit or 
restrict or to authorize the limitation or restriction of any existing 
rights of any claimant under any valid mining claim heretofore located, 
except as such rights may be limited or restricted as a result of a 
proceeding pursuant to section 5 of this Act, or as a result of a waiver 
and relinquishment pursuant to section 6 of this Act; and nothing in 
this act shall be construed in any manner to authorize inclusion in any 
patent hereafter issued under the mining laws of the United States for 
any mining claim heretofore or hereafter located, of any reservation, 
limitation, or restriction not otherwise authorized by law, or to limit 
or repeal any existing authority to include any reservation, limitation, 
or restriction in any such patent, or to limit or restrict any use of 
the lands covered by any patented or unpatented mining claim by the 
United States, its lessees, permittees, and licensees which is otherwise 
authorized by law.


This section makes it clear that all of the rights of mining claimants 
existing on the date of the Act are preserved and will continue unless: 
(a) Claimant fails, subject, however, to the provisions of Sec. 3712.2-
7, to file a verified statement in response to a published notice as 
provided in section 5(b) of the Act and Sec. 3712.2-9; (b) it is 
determined as a result of a hearing pursuant to section 5(c) that such 
rights asserted in a verified statement are not valid and effective; (c) 
the claimant waives and relinquishes his rights pursuant to section 6. 
It also preserves to all mining claimants the right to a patent 
unrestricted by anything in the Act and provides that no limitation, 
reservation or restriction may be inserted in any mineral patent unless 
authorized by law, but it also makes it clear that all laws in force on 
the date of its enactment which provide for any such reservation, 
limitation, or restriction in such patents and all authority of law then 
existing for the use of lands embraced in unpatented mining claims by 
the United States, its lessees, permittees, and licensees continue in 
full force and effect.

<R05>
Sec. 3715.0-1  What are the purpose and the scope of this subpart?

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to manage the use and 
occupancy of the public lands for the development of locatable mineral 
deposits by limiting such use or occupancy to that which is reasonably 
incident. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will prevent abuse of the 
public lands while recognizing valid rights and uses under the Mining 
Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.) and related laws governing the public 
lands, regardless of when those rights were created. BLM will take 
appropriate action to eliminate invalid uses, including unauthorized 
residential occupancy of the public lands.
    (b) Scope. This subpart applies to public lands BLM administers. 
They do not apply to state or private lands in which the mineral estate 
has been reserved to the United States. They do not apply to Federal 
lands administered by other Federal agencies, even though those lands 
may be subject to the operation of the mining laws.
    (c) This subpart does not impair the right of any person to engage 
in recreational activities or any other authorized activity on public 
lands BLM administers.

(c), 1733 (a) and (g).


<R05>
Sec. 3715.0-5  How are certain terms in this subpart defined?

    As used in this subpart the term:
    Mining laws means all laws that apply to mining of locatable 
minerals on public lands and which make public lands available for 
development of locatable minerals. This includes, but is not limited to, 
the general authorities relating to mining of locatable minerals or to 
the public lands on which this subpart is based and case law which 
interprets those authorities.
    Mining operations means all functions, work, facilities, and 
activities reasonably incident to mining or processing of mineral 
deposits. It includes building roads and other means of access to a 
mining claim or millsite on public lands.
    Occupancy means full or part-time residence on the public lands. It 
also means activities that involve residence; the construction, 
presence, or maintenance of temporary or permanent structures that may 
be used for such purposes; or the use of a watchman or caretaker for the 
purpose of monitoring activities. Residence or structures include, but 
are not limited to, barriers to access, fences, tents, motor homes, 
trailers, cabins, houses, buildings, and storage of equipment or 
supplies.
    Permanent structure means a structure fixed to the ground by any of 
the various types of foundations, slabs, piers, poles, or other means 
allowed by building codes. The term also includes a structure placed on 
the ground that lacks foundations, slabs, piers, or poles, and that can 
only be moved through disassembly into its component parts or by 
techniques commonly used in house moving. The term does not apply to 
tents or lean-tos.
    Public lands means lands open to the operation of the mining laws 
which BLM administers, including lands covered by unpatented mining 
claims or millsites.
    Prospecting or exploration means the search for mineral deposits by 
geological, geophysical, geochemical, or other techniques. It also 
includes, but is not limited to, sampling, drilling, or developing 
surface or underground workings to evaluate the type, extent, quantity, 
or quality of mineral values present.
    Reasonably incident means the statutory standard ``prospecting, 
mining, or processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto'' 
(30 U.S.C. 612). It is a shortened version of the statutory standard. It 
includes those actions or expenditures of labor and resources by a 
person of ordinary prudence to prospect, explore, define, develop, mine, 
or beneficiate a valuable mineral deposit, using methods, structures, 
and equipment appropriate to the geological terrain, mineral deposit, 
and stage of development and reasonably related activities.
    Substantially regular work means work on, or that substantially and 
directly benefits, a mineral property, including nearby properties under 
your control. The work must be associated with the search for and 
development of mineral deposits or the processing of ores. It includes 
active and continuing exploration, mining, and beneficiation or 
processing of ores. It may also include assembly or maintenance of 
equipment, work on physical improvements, and procurement of supplies, 
incidental to activities meeting the conditions of Secs. 3715.2 and 
3715.2-1. It may also include off-site trips associated with these 
activities. The term also includes a seasonal, but recurring, work 
program.
    Unnecessary or undue degradation, as applied to unauthorized uses, 
means those activities that are not reasonably incident and are not 
authorized under any other applicable law or regulation. As applied to 
authorized uses, the term is used as defined in 43 CFR 3802.0-5 and 
3809.0-5.

of 1995 and assigned clearance number 1004-0169. BLM collects the 
information so that it may manage use and occupancy of public lands 
under the mining laws by prohibiting unauthorized uses and occupancies. 
A response to BLM is mandatory and required to obtain the benefit of 
occupying the public lands for reasonably incident activities.
    (b) BLM estimates the public reporting burden for this information 
to average two hours per response, including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other 
aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for 
reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer

                                          allows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 3715.2  What activities do I have to be engaged in to allow me to occupy the public lands?

    In order to occupy the public lands under the mining laws for more 
than 14 calendar days in any 90-day period within a 25-mile radius of 
the initially occupied site, you must be engaged in certain activities. 
Those activities that are the reason for your occupancy must:
    (a) Be reasonably incident;
    (b) Constitute substantially regular work;
    (c) Be reasonably calculated to lead to the extraction and 
beneficiation of minerals;
    (d) Involve observable on-the-ground activity that BLM may verify 
under Sec. 3715.7; and
    (e) Use appropriate equipment that is presently operable, subject to 
the need for reasonable assembly, maintenance, repair or fabrication of 
replacement parts.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.2-1  What additional characteristic(s) must my occupancy have?

    In addition to the requirements specified in Sec. 3715.2, your 
occupancy must involve one or more of the following:
    (a) Protecting exposed, concentrated or otherwise accessible 
valuable minerals from theft or loss;
    (b) Protecting from theft or loss appropriate, operable equipment 
which is regularly used, is not readily portable, and cannot be 
protected by means other than occupancy;

[[Page 686]]

    (c) Protecting the public from appropriate, operable equipment which 
is regularly used, is not readily portable, and if left unattended, 
creates a hazard to public safety;
    (d) Protecting the public from surface uses, workings, or 
improvements which, if left unattended, create a hazard to public 
safety; or
    (e) Being located in an area so isolated or lacking in physical 
access as to require the mining claimant, operator, or workers to remain 
on site in order to work a full shift of a usual and customary length. A 
full shift is ordinarily 8 hours and does not include travel time to the 
site from a community or area in which housing may be obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.2-2  How do I justify occupancy by a caretaker or watchman?

    If you assert the need for a watchman or caretaker to occupy the 
public lands to protect valuable or hazardous property, equipment, or 
workings, you must show that the need for the occupancy is both 
reasonably incident and continual. You must show that a watchman or 
caretaker is required to be present either whenever the operation is not 
active or whenever you or your workers are not present on the site.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.2-3  Under what circumstances will BLM allow me to temporarily occupy a site for more than 14 days?

    BLM may allow temporary occupancy at a single site to extend beyond 
the 14-day period described in Sec. 3715.1 if you need to secure the 
site beyond 14 days through the use of a watchman as allowed by 
Sec. 3715.2-2, and you have begun consultation with BLM under 
Sec. 3715.3. If BLM decides not to concur in the occupancy, the 
temporary occupancy must stop.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.3  Must I consult with BLM before occupancy?

    Before beginning occupancy, you must consult with BLM about the 
requirements of this subpart. See Table 2 in this section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 3715.3-1  At what point may I begin occupancy?

    You must not begin occupancy until--
    (a) You have complied with either 43 CFR part 3800, subpart 3802 or 
3809 and this subpart, and BLM has completed its review and made the 
required determinations under the applicable subparts, and
    (b) You have obtained all federal, state and local mining, 
reclamation, and waste disposal permits, approvals,

[[Page 687]]

or other authorizations for the particular use or occupancy as required 
under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.3-2  What information must I provide to BLM about my proposed occupancy?

    You must give BLM a detailed map that identifies the site and the 
placement of the items specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section, and a written description of the proposed occupancy that 
describes in detail:
    (a) How the proposed occupancy is reasonably incident;
    (b) How the proposed occupancy meets the conditions specified in 
Sec. 3715.2 and Sec. 3715.2-1;
    (c) Where you will place temporary or permanent structures for 
occupancy;
    (d) The location of and reason you need enclosures, fences, gates, 
and signs intended to exclude the general public;
    (e) The location of reasonable public passage or access routes 
through or around the area to adjacent public lands; and
    (f) The estimated period of use of the structures, enclosures, 
fences, gates, and signs, as well as the schedule for removal and 
reclamation when operations end.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.3-3  How does BLM process the information I submit about my proposed occupancy?

    BLM will review all proposed occupancies and all proposed 
enclosures, fences, gates, or signs intended to exclude the general 
public to determine if your proposed occupancy or use will conform to 
the provisions of Secs. 3715.2, 3715.2-1 and 3715.5. BLM will complete 
its review of a proposed occupancy not involving a plan of operations 
within 30 business days of receipt of the materials, unless it concludes 
that the determination cannot be made until:
    (a) 30 business days after it prepares necessary environmental 
documents, and
    (b) 30 business days after it has complied with section 106 of the 
National Historic Preservation Act, Section 7 of the Endangered Species 
Act, and/or other applicable statutes, if applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.3-4  How will BLM notify me of the outcome of its review process?

    At the conclusion of the review, BLM will make a written 
determination of concurrence or non-concurrence, and will send it to 
you. For operations conducted under a plan of operations, BLM will 
include this written determination in the decision that approves, 
modifies, or rejects the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.3-5  What will BLM's notification include?

    (a) BLM will include in each determination of concurrence a 
statement requiring you to continue to comply with Secs. 3715.2, 3715.2-
1 and 3715.5.
    (b) BLM will specify in each determination of non-concurrence how 
the proposed occupancy fails to meet the conditions of Sec. 3715.2, 
Sec. 3715.2-1 or Sec. 3715.5, and will provide you an opportunity to 
modify the proposed occupancy or appeal the determination under 
Sec. 3715.9.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.3-6  May I begin occupancy if I have not received concurrence from BLM?

    If you have not received concurrence from BLM, you must not begin 
occupancy even though you have submitted, or plan to submit, an amended 
occupancy proposal or an appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.4  What if I have an existing use or occupancy?

    (a) By August 18, 1997, all existing uses and occupancies must meet 
the applicable requirements of this subpart. If not, BLM will either 
issue you a notice of noncompliance or order any existing use or 
occupancy failing to meet the requirements of this subpart to suspend or 
cease under Sec. 3715.7-1. BLM will also order you to reclaim the land 
under 43 CFR part 3800, subpart 3802 or 3809 to BLM's satisfaction 
within a specified, reasonable time, unless otherwise expressly 
authorized.
    (b) If you are occupying the public lands under the mining laws on 
August 15, 1996, you may continue your occupancy for one year after that 
date, without being subject to the procedures this subpart imposes, if:
    (1) You notify BLM by October 15, 1996 of the existence of the 
occupancy using a format specified by BLM; and

[[Page 688]]

    (2) BLM has no pending trespass action against you concerning your 
occupancy.
    (c) The one-year grace period provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section will not apply if at any time BLM determines that your use or 
occupancy is not reasonably incident and the continued presence of the 
use or occupancy is a threat to health, safety or the environment. In 
this situation, BLM will order an immediate temporary suspension of 
activities under Sec. 3715.7-1(a).
    (d) If you have no existing occupancies, but are engaged in uses of 
the public lands under the mining law, you are subject to the standards 
in Sec. 3715.5. BLM will determine if your existing uses comply with 
those standards during normal inspection visits to the area and during 
BLM review of notices and plans of operations filed under 43 CFR part 
3800.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.4-1  What happens after I give BLM written notification of my existing occupancy?

    (a) BLM will visit your site during the normal course of inspection 
to obtain the information described in Sec. 3715.3-2. After the visit, 
BLM will make a determination of concurrence or non-concurrence.
    (b) You must provide the information described in Sec. 3715.3-2 to 
BLM. You may provide it either in writing or verbally during a site 
visit by BLM field staff.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.4-2  What if I do not notify BLM of my existing occupancy?

    If you do not provide the written notice required in Sec. 3715.4, 
you will be subject to the enforcement actions of Sec. 3715.7-1, the 
civil remedies of Sec. 3715.7-2, and the criminal penalties of 
Sec. 3715.8.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.4-3  What if BLM does not concur in my existing use or occupancy?

    If BLM determines that all or any part of your existing use or 
occupancy is not reasonably incident:
    (a) BLM may order a suspension or cessation of all or part of the 
use or occupancy under Sec. 3715.7-1;
    (b) BLM may order the land to be reclaimed to its satisfaction and 
specify a reasonable time for completion of reclamation under 43 CFR 
part 3800; and
    (c) BLM may order you to apply within 30 days after the date of 
notice from BLM for appropriate authorization under the regulations in 
43 CFR Group 2900.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.4-4  What if there is a dispute over the fee simple title to the lands on which my existing occupancy is located?

    BLM may defer a determination of concurrence or non-concurrence with 
your occupancy until the underlying fee simple title to the land has 
been finally determined by the Department of the Interior. During this 
time, your existing occupancy may continue, subject to Sec. 3715.5(a).


<R05>
Sec. 3715.5  What standards apply to my use or occupancy?

    (a) Your use or occupancy must be reasonably incident. In all uses 
and occupancies, you must prevent or avoid ``unnecessary or undue 
degradation'' of the public lands and resources.
    (b) Your uses must conform to all applicable federal and state 
environmental standards and you must have obtained all required permits 
before beginning, as required under 43 CFR part 3800. This means getting 
permits and authorizations and meeting standards required by state and 
federal law, including, but not limited to, the Clean Water Act (33 
U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), as 
required under 43 CFR part 3800.
    (c) Your occupancies must conform to all applicable federal and 
state environmental standards and you must have obtained all required 
permits before beginning, as required under this subpart and 43 CFR part 
3800. This means getting permits and authorizations and meeting 
standards required by state and federal law, including, but not limited 
to, the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 
U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), as required under this subpart and 43 CFR part 
3800.

[[Page 689]]

    (d) If your prospecting or exploration activities involve only 
surface activities, you must not place permanent structures on the 
public lands. Any temporary structures you place on the public lands 
during prospecting or exploration will be allowed only for the duration 
of the activities, unless BLM expressly and in writing allows them to 
remain longer. If your prospecting or exploration activities involve 
subsurface activities, you may place permanent structures on the public 
lands, if BLM concurs.
    (e) All permanent and temporary structures you place on the public 
lands must conform with the applicable state or local building, fire, 
and electrical codes, and occupational safety and health and mine safety 
standards. If state or local codes require, you must obtain a 
certificate of occupancy or its equivalent before you begin use or 
occupancy involving permanent structures. If state or local law 
requires, you must also acquire appropriate sewerage and sanitation 
permits before the occupancy or use of a permanent structure placed on 
the public lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.5-1  What standards apply to ending my use or occupancy?

    Unless BLM expressly allows them in writing to remain on the public 
lands, you must remove all permanent structures, temporary structures, 
material, equipment, or other personal property placed on the public 
lands during authorized use or occupancy under this subpart. You have 90 
days after your operations end to remove these items. If BLM concurs in 
writing, this provision will not apply to seasonal operations that are 
temporarily suspended for less than one year and expected to continue 
during the next operating season or to operations that are suspended for 
no longer than one year due to market or labor conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.5-2  What happens to property I leave behind?

    Any property you leave on the public lands beyond the 90-day period 
described in Sec. 3715.5-1 becomes property of the United States and is 
subject to removal and disposition at BLM's discretion consistent with 
applicable laws and regulations. You are liable for the costs BLM incurs 
in removing and disposing of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.6  What things does BLM prohibit under this subpart?

    Except where other applicable laws or regulations allow, BLM 
prohibits the following:
    (a) Placing, constructing, maintaining or using residences or 
structures for occupancy not meeting:
    (1) The conditions of occupancy under Secs. 3715.2 or 3715.2-1; or
    (2) Any of the standards of occupancy under Sec. 3715.5;
    (b) Beginning occupancy before the filing, review, and approval or 
modification of a plan of operation as required under 43 CFR part 3800, 
subparts 3802 or 3809;
    (c) Beginning occupancy before consultation with BLM as required by 
Sec. 3715.3 for activities that do not require a plan of operations 
under 43 CFR part 3800, subpart 3802 or that are defined as casual use 
or notice activities under 43 CFR part 3800, subpart 3809;
    (d) Beginning occupancy without receiving a determination of 
concurrence because the proposed occupancy or fencing will not conform 
to the provisions of Sec. 3715.2, Sec. 3715.2-1 or Sec. 3715.5;
    (e) Not complying with any order issued under this subpart within 
the time frames the order provides;
    (f) Preventing or obstructing free passage or transit over or 
through the public lands by force, threats, or intimidation; provided, 
however, that reasonable security and safety measures in accordance with 
this subpart are allowed;
    (g) Placing, constructing, or maintaining enclosures, gates, or 
fences, or signs intended to exclude the general public, without BLM's 
concurrence;
    (h) Causing a fire or safety hazard or creating a public nuisance;
    (i) Not complying with the notification and other requirements under 
Sec. 3715.4 relating to an existing occupancy; and
    (j) Conducting activities on the public lands that are not 
reasonably incident, including, but not limited to: non-mining related 
habitation, cultivation, animal maintenance or pasturage, and 
development of small trade or

[[Page 690]]

manufacturing concerns; storage, treatment, processing, or disposal of 
non-mineral, hazardous or toxic materials or waste that are generated 
elsewhere and brought onto the public lands; recycling or reprocessing 
of manufactured material such as scrap electronic parts, appliances, 
photographic film, and chemicals; searching for buried treasure, 
treasure trove or archaeological specimens; operating hobby and curio 
shops; cafes; tourist stands; and hunting and fishing camps.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.7  How will BLM inspect my use or occupancy and enforce this subpart?

    (a) BLM field staff is authorized to physically inspect all 
structures, equipment, workings, and uses located on the public lands. 
The inspection may include verification of the nature of your use and 
occupancy to ensure that your use or occupancy is, or continues to be, 
reasonably incident and in compliance with Secs. 3715.2, 3715.2-1, 
3715.4-1 and 3715.5.
    (b) BLM will not inspect the inside of structures used solely for 
residential purposes, unless an occupant or a court of competent 
jurisdiction gives permission.


<R05>
Sec. 3715.7-1  What types of enforcement action can BLM take if I do not meet the requirements of this subpart?

    BLM has four types of orders that it can issue depending on the 
circumstances:
    (a) Immediate suspension. (1) BLM may order an immediate, temporary 
suspension of all or any part of your use or occupancy if:
    (i) All or part of your use or occupancy is not reasonably incident 
or is not in compliance with Secs. 3715.2, 3715.2-1, 3715.3-1(b), 3715.5 
or 3715.5-1, and
    (ii) an immediate, temporary suspension is necessary to protect 
health, safety or the environment.
    (2) BLM will presume that health, safety or the environment are at 
risk and will order your use or occupancy to be immediately and 
temporarily suspended if:
    (i) You are conducting an occupancy under a determination of 
concurrence under this section; and
    (ii) You fail at any time to meet any of the standards in 
Sec. 3715.3-1(b) or Sec. 3715.5(b), (c), or (e).
    (3) The suspension order will describe--
    (i) How you are failing or have failed to comply with the 
requirements of this subpart; and
    (ii) The actions, in addition to suspension of the use or occupancy, 
that you must take to correct the noncompliance and the time by which 
you must suspend the use or occupancy. It will also describe the time, 
not to exceed 30 days, within which you must complete corrective action.
    (4) The suspension order will not be stayed by an appeal.
    (b) Cessation order. (1) BLM may order a temporary or permanent 
cessation of all or any part of your use or occupancy if:
    (i) All or any part of your use or occupancy is not reasonably 
incident but does not endanger health, safety or the environment, to the 
extent it is not reasonably incident;
    (ii) You fail to timely comply with a notice of noncompliance issued 
under paragraph (c) of this section;
    (iii) You fail to timely comply with an order issued under paragraph 
(d) of this section; or
    (iv) You fail to take corrective action during a temporary 
suspension ordered under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) The cessation order will describe--
    (i) The ways in which your use or occupancy is not reasonably 
incident; is in violation of a notice of noncompliance issued under 
paragraph (c) of this section; or is in violation of an order issued 
under paragraphs (a) or (d) of this section, as appropriate;
    (ii) The actions, in addition to cessation of the use or occupancy, 
that you must take to correct the noncompliance;
    (iii) The time by which you must cease the use or occupancy, not to 
exceed 30 days from the date the Interior Board of Land Appeals affirms 
BLM's order; and
    (iv) The length of the cessation.
    (c) Notice of noncompliance. (1) If your use or occupancy is not in 
compliance with any requirements of this subpart, and BLM has not 
invoked paragraph (a)

[[Page 691]]

of this section, BLM will issue an order that describes--
    (i) How you are failing or have failed to comply with the 
requirements of this subpart;
    (ii) The actions that you must take to correct the noncompliance and 
the time, not to exceed 30 days, within which you must start corrective 
action; and
    (iii) The time within which you must complete corrective action.
    (2) If you do not start and complete corrective action within the 
time allowed, BLM may order an immediate suspension under paragraph (a) 
of this section, if necessary, or cessation of the use or occupancy 
under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Other. If you are conducting an activity that is not reasonably 
incident but may be authorized under 43 CFR Group 2900 or 8300, or, as 
to sites in Alaska, 43 CFR part 2560, BLM may order you to apply within 
30 days from the date you receive the order for authorization under the 
listed regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 3734.1  Owner of claim to file notice of location and assessment work.

    (a) The owner of any unpatented mining claim, mill site, or tunnel 
site located on land described in Sec. 3730.0-1 (a) and (b), shall file 
all notices or certificates of location, amended notices or 
certificates, and transfers of interest, with the proper State Office of 
the Bureau of Land Management pursuant to Secs. 3833.1, 3833.3, 3833.4, 
and 3833.5 of this title, and pay the applicable maintenance, location, 
and service fees required by subpart 3833 of this title. The notice,

to indicate that it is being filed pursuant to the Act of August 11, 
1955, the Act of April 8, 1948, or both, as required by Sec. 3833.5(c). 
Failure to so mark the location certificate will delay the procedures to 
authorize mining under subpart 3736.
    (b) Neither section 4 nor any other provision of the Act validates 
any mining location made prior to the act, which is invalid because made 
on lands after they were withdrawn or reserved for power purposes and 
before a favorable determination by the Federal Power Commission under 
section 24 of the Federal Power Act of June 10, 1920 (41 Stat. 1063; 
1075), as amended (16 U.S.C. 792; 818) and the opening or restoration of 
the lands to location. Section 4 applies to unpatented locations for 
lands referred to in Sec. 3730.0-3(a) only if:
    (1) The location was made on or after August 11, 1955, or
    (2) The location was made prior to August 11, 1955, and prior to the 
withdrawal or reservation of the lands for power purposes, or
    (3) The location was made prior to August 11, 1955, on lands 
restored to location from a powersite reserve or withdrawal subject to 
section 24 of the Federal Power Act.
    (c) The owner of any unpatented mining claim, mill site, or tunnel 
site located on land described in Sec. 3730.0-1 shall perform and record 
annual assessment work if he or she qualifies as a small miner under 
Sec. 3833.0-5(u) of this title or pay an annual maintenance fee of $100 
per unpatented mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site in lieu of the 
annual assessment work or notice of intention to hold, pursuant to 
subpart 3833 of this title.

located prior to the date of withdrawal or reservation: Provided, That 
nothing in this act shall be construed to limit or restrict the rights 
of the owner or owners of any mining claim who are diligently working to 
make a discovery of valuable minerals at the time any future withdrawal 
or reservation for power development is made.

    (b) Although the Act does not limit or restrict the rights of owners 
of locations to which section 5 refers, such owners shall comply with 
section 4 by making the filings required either by paragraph (c) or (d) 
of Sec. 3734.1 whichever is applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 3736.1  Placer locator to conduct no mining operations for 60 days.

    (a) The Act in section 2(b) provides in part as follows:


[[Page 695]]


    The locator of a placer claim under this Act, however, shall conduct 
no mining operations for a period of sixty days after the filing of a 
notice of location pursuant to section 4 of this Act. If the Secretary 
of the Interior, within sixty days from the filing of the notice of 
location, notifies the locator by registered mail of the Secretary's 
intention to hold a public hearing to determine whether placer mining 
operations would substantially interfere with other uses of the land 
included within the placer claim, mining operations on that claim shall 
be further suspended until the Secretary has held the hearing and has 
issued an appropriate order. The order issued by the Secretary of the 
Interior shall provide for one of the following: (1) a complete 
prohibition of placer mining; (2) a permission to engage in placer 
mining upon the condition that the locator shall, following placer 
operations, restore the surface of the claim to the condition in which 
it was immediately prior to those operations; or (3) a general 
permission to engage in placer mining. No order by the Secretary with 
respect to such operations shall be valid unless a certified copy is 
filed in the same State or county office in which the locator's notice 
of location has been filed, in compliance with the United States mining 
laws.

    (b) Upon receipt of a notice of location of a placer claim filed in 
accordance with Sec. 3734.1 for land subject to location under the act, 
a determination will be made by the authorized officer of the Bureau of 
Land Management as to whether placer mining operations on the land may 
substantially interfere with other uses thereof. If it is determined 
that placer operations may substantially interfere with other uses, a 
notice of intention to hold a hearing will be sent to each of the 
locators by registered or certified mail within 60 days from date of 
filing of the location notice.

[35 FR 9737, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 3736.2  Hearing; notice of protest.

    (a) If a hearing is to be held, notice of the hearing will be 
delivered personally or by registered mail or certified mail to the 
locator of the placer claim. The notice will indicate the time and place 
of hearing. The procedures with respect to service of notice of hearing 
and conduct thereof shall follow the provisions of appeals and contests 
of the Department of the Interior (part 1850 of this title) in effect at 
the time the hearing is held. No publication of the notice will be 
required but a copy thereof shall be posted in the proper office of the 
Bureau of Land Management for a period of not less than 30 days prior to 
the date set for the hearing. The manager shall give such publicity to 
the hearing as may be done without expense to the Government.
    (b) Any party, other than a Federal agency, desiring to appear and 
testify at a hearing in protest to placer mining operations must file a 
written notice of protest in the proper office wherein the notice of 
hearing is posted. Such notice, accompanied by a $10 filing fee, must 
contain the party's name and address and a statement showing the nature 
of the party's interest in the use of the lands embraced within the 
mining claim. Each notice of protest must be filed within the period of 
time specified in the notice of hearing. The authorized officer shall 
forward a copy of each such notice that is filed to the mining locator 
prior to the hearing.
    (c) Following the hearing, the administrative law judge will render 
a decision, subject to the right of appeal by any person admitted as a 
party to the hearing in accordance with the provisions of appeals and 
contests of the Department of the Interior (part 1850 of this title). 
Each decision by an administrative lay judge, or upon appeal, shall 
provide for the issuance of an appropriate order as provided in section 
2(b) of the Act; but no such order shall issue until the decision, upon 
which it is based, becomes final. A certified copy of any order issued 
shall be filed in the same State or county office in which the location 
notice has been filed. Any such order permitting mining operations shall 
be filed at the expense of the mining locator.

otherwise contained on the public lands as described in section 2 shall 
be used only for the purposes specified in section 2 and no facility or 
activity shall be erected or conducted thereon for other purposes.


[[Page 696]]


    (b) Under this section, a mining claim or millsite may not be used

securities equal at their par value to the amount of the penal sum of 
the bond, together with power-of-attorney to the Secretary of the 
Interior or his delegate.

Sec. 3741.1  Validation of certain mining claims.

    The Act in section 1(a) provides as follows:

    That (a) subject to the conditions and provisions of this Act and to 
any valid intervening rights acquired under the laws of the United 
States, any mining claim located under the mining laws of the United 
States subsequent to July 31, 1939, and prior to February 10, 1954, on 
lands of the United States, which at the time of location were--
    (1) Included in a permit or lease issued under the mineral leasing 
laws; or
    (2) Covered by an application or offer for a permit or lease which 
had been filed under the mineral leasing laws; or
    (3) Known to be valuable for minerals subject to disposition under

thereafter, had not been so included or covered or known: Provided, 
however, That, in order to be entitled to the benefits of this act, the 
owner of any such mining claim located prior to January 1, 1953, must 
have posted and filed for record, within the time allowed by the 
provisions of the Act of August 12, 1953 (67 Stat. 539) [not later than

benefits thereof: And provided further, That, in order to obtain the 
benefits of this act, the owner of any such mining claim located 
subsequent to December 31, 1952, and prior to February 10, 1954, not 
later than one hundred and twenty days after the date of enactment of 
this act, must post on such claim in the manner required for posting 
notice of location of mining claims and file for record in the office 
where the notice or certificate of location of such claim is of record 
an amended notice of location for such claim, stating that such notice 
is filed pursuant to the provisions of this act, and for the purpose of 
obtaining the benefits thereof and, within said one hundred and twenty 
day period, if such owner shall have filed a uranium lease application 
as to the tract covered by such mining claim, must file with the Atomic 
Energy Commission a withdrawal of such uranium lease application or, if 
a uranium lease shall have issued pursuant thereto, a release of such 
lease, and must record a notice of the filing of such withdrawal or 
release in the county office wherein such notice or certificate of 
location shall have been filed for record.


<R05>
Sec. 3741.2  Preference mining locations.

    The Act in section 3(a) and (b) provides as follows:

    (a) Subject to the conditions and provisions of this Act and to any 
valid prior rights acquired under the laws of the United States, the 
owner of any pending uranium lease application or of any uranium lease 
shall have, for a period of one hundred and twenty days after the date 
of enactment of this act, as limited in subsection (b) of this section 
3, the right to locate mining claims upon the lands covered by said 
application or lease.
    (b) Any rights under any such mining claim so hereafter located 
pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section 3 shall be 
subject to any rights of the owner of any mining claim which was located 
prior to February 10, 1954, and which was valid at the date of the 
enactment of this Act or which may acquire validity under the provisions 
of this Act. As to any lands covered by a uranium lease and also by a 
pending uranium lease application, the right of mining location under 
this section 3, as between the owner of said lease and the owner of said 
application, shall be deemed as to such conflict area to be vested in 
the owner of said lease. As to any lands embraced in more than one such 
pending uranium lease application, such right of mining location, as 
between the owners of such conflicting applications, shall be deemed to 
be vested in the owner of the prior application. Priority of such an 
application shall be determined by the time of posting on a tract then 
available for such leasing of a notice of lease application in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of the Atomic Energy Commission's Domestic 
Uranium Program Circular 7 (10 CFR 60.7(c)) provided there shall have 
been timely compliance with the other provisions of said paragraph (c) 
or, if there shall not have been such timely compliance, then by the 
time of the filing of the uranium lease application with the Atomic 
Energy Commission. Any rights under any mining claim located under the 
provisions of this section 3 shall terminate at the expiration of thirty 
days after the filing for record of the notice or certificate of 
location of such mining claim unless, within said 30-day period, the 
owner of the uranium lease application or uranium lease upon which the 
location of such mining claim was

[[Page 698]]

predicated shall have filed with the Atomic Energy Commission a 
withdrawal of said application or a release of said lease and shall have 
recorded a notice of the filing of such withdrawal or release in the 
county office wherein such notice or certificate of location shall be of 
record.


<R05>
Sec. 3741.3  Additional evidence required with application for patent.

    All questions between mining claimants asserting conflicting rights 
of possession under mining claims, must be adjudicated in the courts. 
Any applicant for mineral patent, who claims benefits under sections 1 
or 3 of this Act, or the Act of August 12, 1953, supra, in addition to 
matters required in Group 3800 of this chapter, must file with his 
Application for Patent a certified copy of each instrument required to 
have been recorded as to his mining claim in order to entitle it to such 
benefits unless an Abstract of Title or Certificate of Title filed with 
the Application for Patent shall set forth said instruments in full. If 
a mining claim was located on or after the date of this Act a statement 
must be filed showing that on the date of location the lands affected 
were not covered by a uranium lease or an application for a uranium 
lease. The applicant must also file a copy of the notice required to be 
posted on the claim and state in his application that such notice was 
duly posted in accordance with the requirements of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 3741.4  Reservation to United States of Leasing Act minerals.

    Section 4 of the Act provides that:

    Every mining claim or millsite--
    (1) Heretofore located under the mining laws of the United States 
which shall be entitled to benefits under the first three sections of 
this Act; or
    (2) Located under the mining laws of the United States after the 
effective date of passage of this Act, shall be subject, prior to 
issuance of a patent therefor, to a reservation to the United States of 
all Leasing Act minerals and of the right (as limited in section 6 
hereof) of the United States, its lessees, permittees, and licensees to 
enter upon the land covered by such mining claim or millsite and to 
prospect for, drill for, mine, treat, store, transport, and remove 
Leasing Act minerals and to use so much of the surface and subsurface of 
such mining claim or millsite as may be necessary for such purposes, and 
whenever reasonably necessary, for the purpose of prospecting for, 
drilling for, mining, treating, storing, transporting, and removing 
Leasing Act minerals on and from other lands; and any patent issued for 
any such mining claim or millsite shall contain such reservation as to, 
but only as to, such lands covered thereby which at the time of the 
issuance of such patent were--
    (a) Included in a permit or lease issued under the mineral leasing 
laws; or
    (b) Covered by an application or offer for a permit or lease filed 
under the mineral leasing laws; or
    (c) Known to be valuable for minerals subject to disposition under 
the mineral leasing laws.


<R05>
Sec. 3741.5  Mining claims and millsites located on Leasing Act lands after August 13, 1954.

    Since enactment of the Act on August 13, 1954, and subject to its 
conditions and provisions, including the reservation of Leasing Act 
minerals to the United States as provided in section 4, mining claims 
and millsites may be located under the mining laws of the United States 
on lands of the United States which at the time of location are--
    (a) Included in a permit or lease issued under the mineral leasing 
laws; or
    (b) Covered by an application or offer for a permit or lease filed 
under the mineral leasing laws; or
    (c) Known to be valuable for minerals subject to disposition under 
the mineral leasing laws: This is inclusive of lands in petroleum 
reserves, except Naval petroleum reserves;

to the same extent in all respects as if such lands were not so included 
or covered or known.


<R05>
Sec. 3741.6  Acquisition of Leasing Act minerals in lands covered by mining claims and millsites.

    The Leasing Act minerals in lands covered by mining claims and 
millsites located after the date of the Act or validated pursuant to the 
Act may be acquired under the mineral leasing laws, upon appropriate 
application therefor being filed prior to the issuance of patent to such 
mining claims or millsites, or after the issuance of patent, if the 
patent contains a reservation of Leasing Act minerals to the United 
States as provided in section 4 of the Act.

                 Subpart 3742--Procedures Under the Act

    Source: 35 FR 9739, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3742.1  Procedure to determine claims to Leasing Act minerals under unpatented mining locations.

    Section 7 of the Act provides a procedure whereby a Leasing Act 
applicant, offeror, permittee or lessee may have determined the 
existence and validity of claims to Leasing Act minerals asserted under 
unpatented mining locations made prior to August 13, 1954, affecting 
lands embraced within such application, offer, permit or lease. This 
procedure is described in the succeeding regulations, and involves the 
prior recording of notice of such application, offer, permit or lease 
and the filing of a request for publication of notice of the same.


<R05>
Sec. 3742.2  Recordation of notice of application, offer, permit or lease.

    Not less than 90 days prior to the filing of such request for 
publication, there must have been filed for record in the county office 
of record for each county in which lands covered thereby are situated, a 
notice of the filing of the application or offer, or of the issuance of 
the permit or lease, upon which said request for publication is based. 
Such notice must set forth the date of the filing of such application or 
offer or of the issuance of such permit or lease, the name and address 
of the applicant, offeror, permittee or lessee, and the description of 
the lands covered by such application, offer, permit or lease, showing 
the section or sections of the public land surveys which embrace such 
lands, or, if such lands are unsurveyed, either the section or sections 
which would probably embrace such lands when the public land surveys are 
extended to such lands, or a tie by courses and distances to an approved 
United States mineral monument.


<R05>
Sec. 3742.3  Publication of notice.


<R05>
Sec. 3742.3-1  Request for publication of notice of Leasing Act filing; supporting instruments.

    (a) Having complied with the requirement of Sec. 3742.2 the 
applicant, offeror, permittee or lessee may file a Request for 
Publication of notice of such party's application, offer, permit or 
lease. Such request for publication shall be filed in the proper office. 
No Request for Publication, or publication, may include lands in more 
than one District.
    (b) The filing of a Request for Publication must be accompanied by 
the following:
    (1) A certified copy of the Notice of Application, offer, permit or 
lease setting forth the date of recordation thereof. The date of 
recordation shall be presumed to have been the date when the notice was 
filed for record unless the certified copy of the notice shows otherwise 
or is accompanied by an affidavit of the person filing the request for 
publication showing that the notice was filed for record on a date prior 
to the date of recordation.
    (2) An affidavit or affidavits of a person or persons over 21 years 
of age, setting forth that the affiant or affiants have examined the 
lands involved in a reasonable effort to ascertain whether any person or 
persons were in actual possession of or engaged in the working of the 
lands covered by such request or any part thereof. If no person or 
persons were found to be in actual possession of or engaged in the 
working of said lands or any part thereof, on the date of such 
examination, such affidavit or affidavits shall set forth such fact. If 
any person or persons were so found to be in actual possession or 
engaged in such working on the date of such examination, such affidavit 
or affidavits shall set forth the name and address of each such person 
unless the affiant shall have been unable, through reasonable inquiry, 
to obtain information as to the name and address of such person; in 
which event, the affidavit or affidavits shall set forth fully the 
nature and the results of such inquiry.

[[Page 700]]

    (3) The certificate of a title or abstract company, or of a title 
abstractor, or of an attorney, based upon such company's, abstractor's 
or attorney's examination of the instruments affecting the lands 
involved, of record in the public records of the county in which said 
lands are situated as shown by the indices of the public records in the 
county office of record for said county, setting forth the name of any 
person disclosed by said instruments to have an interest in said lands 
under any unpatented mining claim located prior to enactment of the Act 
on August 13, 1954, together with the address of such person if 
disclosed by such instruments of record.
    (4) A nonrefundable $10 remittance to cover service charge.


<R05>
Sec. 3742.3-2  Contents of published notice.

    The notice to be published as required by the preceding section, 
shall describe the lands covered by the application, offer, permit or 
lease in the same manner as is required under Sec. 3742.2 Such published 
notice shall notify whomever it may concern, that if any person claiming 
or asserting under, or by virtue of, any unpatented mining claim located 
prior to enactment of the Act of August 13, 1954, any right or interest 
in Leasing Act minerals as to such lands or any part thereof, shall fail 
to file in the office where such Request for Publication was filed 
(which office shall be specified in such notice), and within 150 days 
from the date of the first publication of such notice (which date shall 
be specified in such notice), a verified statement which shall set 
forth, as to such unpatented mining claim:
    (a) The date of location;
    (b) The book and page of recordation of the notice or certificate of 
location;
    (c) The section or sections of the public land surveys which embrace 
such mining claim; or if such lands are unsurveyed, either the section 
or sections which would probably embrace such mining claim when the 
public land surveys are extended to such lands or a tie by courses and 
distances to an approved United States mineral monument;
    (d) Whether such claimant is a locator or purchaser under such 
location; and
    (e) The name and address of such claimant and names and addresses so 
far as known to the claimant of any other person or persons claiming any 
interest or interests in or under such unpatented mining claim; such 
failure shall be conclusively deemed (1) to constitute a waiver and 
relinquishment by such mining claimant of any and all right, title, and 
interest under such mining claim as to, but only as to, Leasing Act 
minerals, and (2) to constitute a consent by such mining claimant that 
such mining claim and any patent issued therefor, shall be subject to 
the reservation of Leasing Act minerals specified in section 4 of the 
Act, and (3) to preclude thereafter any assertion by such mining 
claimant of any right or title to or interest in any Leasing Act mineral 
by reason of such mining claim.


<R05>
Sec. 3742.3-3  Publication.

    (a) Upon receipt of a Request for Publication and accompanying 
instruments, if all is found regular, the Authorized officer, or the

of the publisher to hold such requesting person alone responsible for 
charges of publication), shall cause notice of the application, offer, 
permit or lease to be published in a newspaper, to be designated by the 
Authorized officer, or the Director, as may be appropriate, having 
general circulation in the county in which the lands involved are 
situated.
    (b) If such notice is published in a daily paper, it shall be

Sec. 3742.3-6  Service of copies; failure to comply.

    If any applicant, offeror, permittee or lessee requesting 
publication of notice under these regulations shall fail to comply with 
the requirements of section 7(a) of the Act as to personal delivery or 
mailing of a copy of the published notice to any person, the publication 
of such notice shall be deemed wholly ineffectual as to that person or 
as to the rights asserted by that person and the failure of that person 
to file a verified statement, as provided in such notice shall in no 
manner affect, diminish, prejudice or bar any rights of that person.


<R05>
Sec. 3742.4  Failure of mining claimant to file verified statement.

    If any claimant under any unpatented mining claim located prior to 
enactment of the Act on August 13, 1954, which embraces any of the lands 
described in any notice published in accordance with the regulations in 
this part shall fail to file a verified statement, as specified in such 
published notice within one hundred and fifty days from the date of the 
first publication of such notice, such failure shall be conclusively 
deemed, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 3742.3-6.
    (a) To constitute a waiver and relinquishment by such mining 
claimant of any and all right, title, and interest under such mining 
claim as to, but only as to, Leasing Act minerals, and
    (b) To constitute a consent by such mining claimant that such mining 
claim and any patent issued therefor, shall be subject to the 
reservation of Leasing Act minerals specified in section 4 of the Act, 
and
    (c) To preclude thereafter any assertion by such mining claimant of 
any right or title to or interest in any Leasing Act minerals by reason 
of such mining claim.

<R05>
Sec. 3743.2  Hearing: Time and place.

    If any verified statement shall be filed by a mining claimant then 
the authorized officer of the proper office, or the Director, as may be 
appropriate, shall fix a time and place for a hearing to determine the 
validity and effectiveness of the mining claimant's asserted right or 
interest in Leasing Act minerals. Such place of hearing shall be in the 
county where the lands in question, or part thereof, are located, unless 
the mining claimant agrees otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 3743.3  Stipulation between parties.

    If at any time prior to a hearing the person requesting publication 
of notice and any person filing a verified statement pursuant to such 
notice shall so stipulate, then to the extent so stipulated, but only to

    If, pursuant to a hearing held as provided in the regulations of 
this part, the final decision rendered in the matter shall affirm the 
validity and effectiveness of any mining claimant's right or interest 
under a mining claim as to Leasing Act minerals, then no subsequent 
proceedings under section 7 of the Act and the regulations of this part 
shall have any force or effect upon the so-affirmed right or interest of 
such mining claimant under such mining claim.


<R04>
               Subpart 3746--Fissionable Source Materials


<R05>
Sec. 3746.1  Mining locations for fissionable source materials.

    (a) In view of the amendment of section 5(b)(7) of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1946 by section 10(c) of the Act of August 13, 1954 (68 Stat. 
708), and of the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 
921), it is clear that after enactment of said Act of August 13, 1954, 
valid mining locations under the mining laws of the United States may be 
based upon a discovery of a mineral deposit which is a fissionable 
source material.
    (b) As to mining locations made prior to the enactment of said Act 
of August 13, 1954, section 10(d) of the act provides:

    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, and 
particularly sec. 5(b)(7) thereof, prior to its amendment hereby, or the 
provisions of the Act of August 12, 1953 (67 Stat. 539), and 
particularly sec. 3 thereof, any mining claim, heretofore located under 
the mining laws of the United States for or based upon a discovery of a 
mineral deposit which is a fissionable source material and which, except 
for the possible contrary construction of said Atomic Energy Act, would 
have been locatable under such mining laws, shall, insofar as adversely 
affected by such possible contrary construction, be valid and effective, 
in all respects to the same extent as if said mineral deposit were a 
locatable mineral deposit other than a fissionable source material.

     Subpart 3802--Exploration and Mining, Wilderness Review Program


<R05>
Sec. 3802.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to establish procedures to prevent 
impairment of the suitability of lands under wilderness review for 
inclusion in the wilderness system and to prevent unnecessary or undue 
degradation by activities authorized by the U.S. Mining Laws and provide 
for environmental protection of the public lands and resources.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.0-2  Objectives.

    The objectives of this subpart are to:
    (a) Allow mining claim location, prospecting, and mining operations 
in lands under wilderness review pursuant to the U.S Mining Laws, but 
only in a manner that will not impair the suitability of an area for 
inclusion in the wilderness system unless otherwise permitted by law; 
and
    (b) Assure management programs that reflect consistency between the 
U.S. Mining Laws, and other appropriate statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.0-3  Authority.

    These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 302 and 
603 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 
1732, 1733, and 1782).


<R05>
Sec. 3802.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Reclamation, which shall be commenced, conducted and completed 
as soon after disturbance as feasible without undue physical 
interference with mining operations, means:
    (1) Reshaping of the lands disturbed and affected by mining 
operations to the approximate original contour or to an appropriate 
contour considering the surrounding topography as determined by the 
authorized officer;

[[Page 704]]

    (2) Restoring such reshaped lands by replacement of topsoil; and
    (3) Revegetating the lands by using species previously occurring in 
the area to provide a vegetative cover at least to the point where 
natural succession is occuring.
    (b) Environment means surface and subsurface resources both tangible 
and intangible, including air, water, mineral, scenic, cultural, 
paleontological, vegetative, soil, wildlife, fish and wilderness values.
    (c) Wilderness Study Area means a roadless area of 5,000 acres or 
more or roadless islands which have been found through the Bureau of 
Land Management wilderness inventory process to have wilderness 
characteristics (thus having the potential of being included in the 
National Wilderness Preservation System), and which will be subjected to 
intensive analysis through the Bureau's planning system, and through 
public review to determine wilderness suitability, and is not yet the 
subject of a Congressional decision regarding its designation as 
wilderness.
    (d) Impairment of suitability for inclusion in the Wilderness System 
means taking actions that cause impacts, that cannot be reclaimed to the 
point of being substantially unnoticeable in the area as a whole by the 
time the Secretary is scheduled to make a recommendation to the 
President on the suitability of a wilderness study area for inclusion in 
the National Wilderness Preservation System or have degraded wilderness 
values so far, compared with the area's values for other purposes, as to 
significantly constrain the Secretary's recommendation with respect to 
the area's suitability for preservation as wilderness.
    (e) Mining claim means any unpatented mining claim, millsite, or 
tunnel site authorized by the U.S. mining laws.
    (f) Mining operations means all functions, work, facilities, and 
activities in connection with the prospecting, development, extraction, 
and processing of mineral deposits and all uses reasonably incident 
thereto including the construction and maintenance of means of access to 
and across lands subject to these regulations, whether the operations 
take place on or off the claim.
    (g) Operator means a person conducting or proposing to conduct 
mining operations.
    (h) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management to whom has been delegated the authority to perform the 
duties described in this subpart.
    (i) Wilderness inventory means an evaluation conducted under BLM 
wilderness inventory procedures which results in a written description 
and map showing those lands that meet the wilderness criteria 
established under section 603(a) of the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act.
    (j) Manner and degree means that existing operations will be defined 
geographically by the area of active development and the logical 
adjacent (not necessarily contiguous) continuation of the existing 
activity, and not necessarily by the boundary of a particular, claim or 
lease, and in some cases a change in the kind of activity if the impacts 
from the continuation and change of activity are not of a significantly 
different kind than the existing impacts. However, the significant 
measure for these activities is still the impact they are having on the 
wilderness potential of an area. It is the actual use of the area, and 
not the existence of an entitlement for use, which is the controlling 
factor. In other words, an existing activity, even if impairing, may 
continue to be expanded in an area or progress to the next stage of 
development so long as the additional impacts are not significantly 
different from those caused by the existing activity. In determining the 
manner and degree of existing operations, a rule of reason will be 
employed.
    (k) Valid existing right means a valid discovery had been made on a 
mining claim on October 21, 1976, and continues to be valid at the time 
of exercise.
    (l) Undue and unnecessary degradation means impacts greater than 
those that would normally be expected from an activity being 
accomplished in compliance with current standards and regulations and 
based on sound practices, including use of the best reasonably available 
technology.

[[Page 705]]

    (m) Substantially unnoticeable means something that either is so 
insignificant as to be only a very minor feature of the overall area or 
is not distinctly recognizable by the average visitor as being manmade 
or man-caused because of age, weathering or biological change.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.0-6  Policy.

    Under the 1872 Mining Law (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), a person has a 
statutory right consistent with other laws and Departmental regulations, 
to go upon the open (unappropriated and unreserved) public lands for the 
purpose of mineral prospecting, exploration, development, and 
extraction. The Federal Land Policy and management Act requires the 
Secretary to regulate mining operations in lands under wilderness review 
to prevent impairment of the suitability of these areas for inclusion in 
the wilderness system. However, mining operations occurring in the same 
manner and degree that were being conducted on October 21, 1976, may 
continue, even if they are determined to be impairing. Mining activities 
not exceeding manner and degree shall be regulated only to prevent undue 
and unnecessary degradation of public lands.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.0-7  Scope.

    (a) These regulations apply to mining operations conducted under the 
United States mining laws, as they affect the resources and environment 
or wilderness suitability of lands under wilderness review.
    (b) These regulations apply to means of access across public land 
for the purpose of conducting operations under the U.S. mining laws.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1  Plan of operations.

    An approved plan shall include appropriate environmental protection 
and reclamation measures selected by the authorized officer that shall 
be carried out by the operator. An operator may prepare and submit with 
a plan measures for the reclamation of the affected area.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1-1  When required.

    An approved plan of operations is required for operations within 
lands under wilderness review prior to commencing:
    (a) Any mining operations which involve construction of means of 
access, including bridges, landing areas for aircraft, or improving or 
maintaining such access facilities in a way that alters the alignment, 
width, gradient size, or character of such facilities;
    (b) Any mining operations which destroy trees 2 or more inches in 
diameter at the base;
    (c) Mining operations using tracked vehicles or mechanized earth 
moving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes;
    (d) Any operations using motorized vehicles over other than open use 
areas and trails as defined in subpart 6292 of this title, off-road 
vehicles, unless the use of a motorized vehicle can be covered by a 
temporory use permit issued under subpart 8372 of this title;
    (e) The construction or placing of any mobile, portable or fixed 
structure on public land for more than 30 days;
    (f) On mining operations requiring the use of explosives; or
    (g) Any operation which may cause changes in a water course.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1-2  When not required.

    A plan of operations under this subpart is not required for--
    (a) Searching for and occasionally removing mineral samples or 
specimens;
    (b) Operating motorized vehicles over open use areas and trails as 
defined in 43 CFR part 8340 so long as the vehicles conform to the 
operating regulations and vehicle standards contained in that subpart;
    (c) Maintaining or making minor improvements of existing access 
routes, bridges, landing areas for aircraft, or other facilities for 
access where such improvements or maintenance shall not alter the 
alignment, width, gradient, size or character of such facilities; or
    (d) Making geological, radiometric, geochemical, geophysical or 
other tests and measurements using instruments, devices, or drilling 
equipment which are transported without using mechanized earth moving 
equipment or tracked vehicles.

[[Page 706]]


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1-3  Operations existing on October 21, 1976.

    A plan of operations shall not be required for operations that were 
being conducted on October 21, 1976, unless the operation is undergoing 
changes that exceed the manner and degree of operations on October 21, 
1976. However, if the authorized officer determines that operations in 
the same manner and degree are causing undue or unnecessary degradation 
of lands and resources or adverse environmental effects, an approved 
plan containing protective measures may be required. Any changes planned 
in an existing operation that would result in operations exceeding the 
present manner and degree shall be delayed until the plan is processed 
under provisions of Sec. 3802.1-5 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1-4  Contents of plan of operations.

    (a) A plan of operations shall be filed in the District Office of 
the Bureau of Land Management in which the claim is located.
    (b) No special form is required to file a plan of operations.
    (c) The plan of operations shall include--
    (1) The name and mailing address of both the person for whom the 
operation will be conducted, and the person who will be in charge of the 
operation and should be contacted concerning the reclamation or other 
aspects of the operation (any change in the mailing address shall be 
reported promptly to the authorized officer);
    (2) A map, preferably a topographic map, or sketch showing present 
road, bridge or aircraft landing area locations, proposed road, bridge 
or aircraft landing area locations, and size of areas where surface 
resources will be disturbed;
    (3) Information sufficient to describe either the entire operation 
proposed or reasonably foreseeable operations and how they would be 
conducted, including the nature and location of proposed structures and 
facilities;
    (4) The type and condition of existing and proposed means of access 
or aircraft landing areas, the means of transportation used or to be 
used, and the estimated period during which the proposed activity will 
take place;
    (5) If and when applicable, the serial number assigned to the mining 
claim, mill or tunnel site filed pursuant to subpart 3833 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1-5  Plan approval.

    (a) The authorized officer shall promptly aknowledge the receipt of 
a plan of operations and within 30 days of receipt of the plan act on 
the plan of operations to determine its acceptability.
    (b) The authorized officer shall review the plan of operations to 
determine if the operations are impairing the suitability of the area 
for preservation as wilderness. Pending approval of the plan of 
operations, mining operations may continue in a manner that minimizes 
environmental impacts as prescribed in Sec. 3802.3 of this title. After 
completing the review of the plan of operations, the authorized officer 
shall give the operator written notice that:
    (1) The plan is approved subject to measures that will prevent the 
impairment of the suitability of the area for preservation as wilderness 
as determined by the authorized officer;
    (2) Plans covering operations on a claim with a valid existing right 
are approved subject to measures that will prevent undue and unnecessary 
degradation of the area; or
    (3) The anticipated impacts of the mining operations are such that 
all or part of further operations will impair the suitability of the 
area for preservation as wilderness, the plan is disapproved and 
continuance of such operations is not allowed.
    (c) Upon receipt of a plan of operations for mining activities 
commencing after the effective date of these regulations, the authorized 
officer may notify the operator, in writing, that:
    (1) In an area of lands under wilderness review where an inventory 
has not been completed, an operator may agree to operate under a plan of 
operations that includes terms and conditions that would be applicable 
in a wilderness study area. Without an agreement to this effect, no 
action may be taken on the plan until a wilderness inventory is 
completed;

[[Page 707]]

    (2) The area has been inventoried and a final decision has been 
issued and become effective that the area does not contain wilderness 
characteristics, and that the mining operations are no longer subject to 
these regulations; or
    (3) The anticipated impacts are such that all or part of the 
proposed mining operations will impair the suitability of the area for 
preservation as wilderness, and therefore, the proposed mining operation 
cannot be allowed.
    (d) In addition to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the 
following general plan approval procedures may also apply. The 
authorized officer may notify the operator, in writing, that:
    (1) The plan of operations is unacceptable and the reasons 
therefore;
    (2) Modification of the plan of operations is necessary to meet the 
requirements of these regulations;
    (3) The plan of operations is being reviewed, but that more time, 
not to exceed an additional 60 days, is necessary to complete such 
review, setting forth the reasons why additional time is needed except 
in those instances where it is determined that an Environmental Impact 
Statement, compliance with section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act (NHPA) or section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is 
needed. Periods during which the area of operations is inaccessible for 
inspection due to climatic conditions, fire hazards or other physical 
conditions or legal impediments, shall not be included when counting the 
60 calendar day period; or
    (4) The proposed operations do not require a plan of operations.
    (e) If the authorized officer does not notify the operator of any 
action on the plan of operations within the 30-day period, or the 60-day 
extension, or notify the operator of the need for an Environmental 
Impact Statement or compliance with section 106 of NHPA or section 7 of 
the Endangered Species Act, operations under the plan may begin. The 
option to begin operations under this section does not constitute 
approval of a plan of operations. However, if the authorized officer at 
a later date finds that operations under the plan are impairing 
wilderness suitability, the authorized officer shall notify the operator 
that the operations are not in compliance with these regulations and 
what changes are needed, and shall require the operator to submit a 
modified plan of operations, within a time specified in the notice. If 
the operator is notified of the need for an Environmental Impact 
Statement, the plan of operations shall not be approved before 30 days 
after a final statement is prepared and filed with the Environmental 
Protection Agency. If the is operator notified of the need for 
compliance with section 106 of the NHPA or section 7 of the Endangered 
Species Act, the plan of operations shall not be approved until the 
compliance responsibilities of the Bureau of Land Management are 
satisfied.
    (f) If cultural resource properties listed on or eligible for 
listing on the National Register of Historic Places are within the area 
of operations, no operations which would affect those resources shall be 
approved until compliance with section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act is accomplished. The operator is not required to do or 
to pay for an inventory. The responsibility and cost of the cultural 
resource mitigation, except as provided in Sec. 3802.3-2(f) of this 
title, included in an approved plan of operation shall be the 
operator's.
    (g) Pending final approval of the plan of operations, the authorized 
officer may approve any operations that may be necessary for timely 
compliance with requirements of Federal and State laws. Such operations 
shall be conducted so as to prevent impairment of wilderness suitability 
and to minimize environmental impacts as prescribed by the authorized 
officer in accordance with the standards contained in Sec. 3802.3 of 
this title.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1-6  Modification of plan.

    (a) If the development of a plan for an entire operation is not 
possible, the operator shall file an initial plan setting forth this 
proposed operation to the degree reasonably foreseeable at that time. 
Thereafter, the operator shall file a supplemental plan or plans prior 
to undertaking any operations not covered by the initial plan.
    (b) At any time during operations under an approved plan of 
operations,

[[Page 708]]

the authorized officer or the operator may initiate a modification of 
the plan detailing any necessary changes that were unforeseen at the 
time of filing of the plan of operations. If the operator does not 
furnish a proposed modification within a time considered reasonable by 
the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to the 
State Director that the operator be required to submit a proposed 
modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer 
shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the supporting facts 
and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon such recommendation, 
except in the case of a modification under Sec. 3802.1-5(e) of this 
title, the State Director shall determine (1) whether all reasonable 
measures were taken by the authorized officer to predict the 
environmental impacts of the proposed operations; (2) whether the 
disturbance is or may become of such significance as to require 
modification of the plan of operations in order to meet the requirement 
for environmental protection specified in Sec. 3802.3-2 of this title, 
and (3) whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. 
Lacking such a determination by the State Director, an operator is not 
required to submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of 
operations. Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan 
of operations until a modified plan is approved, unless the State 
Director determines that the operations are causing impairment or 
unnecessary or undue degradation to surface resources. He shall advise 
the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage and the 
operator shall immediately take all necessary steps to implement 
measures recommended by the State Director.
    (c) A supplemental plan of operations or a modification of an 
approved plan of operations shall be approved by the authorized officer 
in the same manner as the initial plan of operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.1-7  Existing operations.

    (a) Persons conducting mining operations on the effective date of 
these regulations, who would be required to submit a plan of operations 
under Sec. 3802.1-1 of this title, may continue operations but shall, 
within 60 days after the effective date of these regulations, submit a 
plan of operations. Upon a showing of good cause, the authorized officer 
shall grant an extension of time to submit a plan of operations not to 
exceed an additional 180 days.
    (b) Operations may continue according to the submitted plan of 
operations during its review unless the operator is notified otherwise 
by the authorized officer.
    (c) Upon approval of a plan of operations, mining operations shall 
be conducted in accordance with the approved plan.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.2  Bond requirements.

    (a) Any operator who conducts mining operations under an approved 
plan of operations shall, if required to do so by the authorized 
officer, furnish a bond in an amount determined by the authorized 
officer. The authorized officer may determine not to require a bond 
where mining operations would cause nominal environmental damage, or the 
operator has an excellent past record for reclamation. In determining 
the amount of the bond, the authorized officer shall consider the 
estimated cost of stabilizing and reclaiming all areas disturbed by the 
operations consistent with Sec. 3802.3-2(h) of this title.
    (b) In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit and maintain in a 
Federal depository account of the United States Treasury, as directed by 
the authorized officer, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar 
amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having 
a face and market value at the time of deposit of not less than the 
required dollar amount of the bond.
    (c) In place of the individual bond on each separate operation, a 
blanket bond covering hardrock mining operations may be furnished, at 
the option of the operator, if the terms and conditions as determined by 
the authorized officer are sufficient to comply with these regulations.
    (d) In the event that an approved plan of operations is modified in 
accordance with Sec. 3802.1-5 of this title, the authorized officer 
shall review the initial bond for adequacy and, if necessary, shall 
require that the amount

[[Page 709]]

of bond be adjusted to conform to the plan of operations, as modified.
    (e) When a mining claim is patented, except for the California 
Desert Conservation Area, the authorized officer shall release the 
operator from that portion of the performance bond and plan of 
operations which applies to operations within the boundaries of the 
patented land. The authorized officer shall release the operator from 
the remainder of the performance bond and plan of operations (covering 
approved means of access outside the boundaries of the mining claim) 
when the operator has either completed reclamation in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section or those requirements are waived by the 
authorized officer.
    (f) When all or any portion of the reclamation has been completed in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of Sec. 3802.3-2 of this title, the 
operator shall notify the authorized officer who shall promptly make a 
joint inspection with the operator. The authorized officer shall then 
notify the operator whether the performance under the plan of operations 
is accepted. When the authorized officer has accepted as completed any 
portion of the reclamation, he shall reduce proportionally the amount of 
bond with respect to the remaining reclamation.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.3  Environmental protection.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.3-1  Environmental assessment.

    (a) When a plan of operations or significant modification is filed, 
the authorized officer shall make an environmental assessment to 
identify the impacts of the proposed mining operations upon the 
environment and to determine whether the proposed activity will impair 
the suitability of the area for preservation as wilderness or cause 
unnecessary and undue degradation and whether an environmental impact 
statement is required.
    (b) Following completion of the environmental assessment or the 
environmental impact statement, the authorized officer shall develop 
measures deemed necessary for inclusion in the plan of operations that 
will prevent impairment of wilderness suitability and undue or 
unnecessary degradation of land and resources.
    (c) If as a result of the environment assessment, the authorized 
officer determines that there is substantial public interest in the 
proposed mining operations, the operator may be notified that an 
additional period of time is required to consider public comments. The 
period shall not exceed the additional 60 days provided for approval of 
a plan in Sec. 3802.1-4 of this title except as provided for cases 
requiring an environmental impact statement, a cultural resource 
inventory or section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.3-2  Requirements for environmental protection.

    (a) Air quality. The operator shall comply with applicable Federal 
and State air quality standards, including the requirements of the Clean 
Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857 et seq.).
    (b) Water quality. The operator shall comply with applicable Federal 
and State water quality standards, including regulations issued pursuant 
to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1151 et seq.).
    (c) Solid wastes. The operator shall comply with applicable Federal 
and State standards for the disposal and treatment of solid wastes. All 
garbage, refuse, or waste shall either be removed from the affected 
lands or disposed or treated to minimize, so far as is practicable, its 
impact on the environment and the surface resources. All tailings, waste 
rock, trash, deleterious materials of substances and other waste 
produced by operations shall be deployed, arranged, disposed or treated 
to minimize adverse impact upon the environment, surface and subsurface 
resources.
    (d) Visual resources. The operator shall, to the extent practicable, 
harmonize operations with the visual resources, identified by the 
authorized officer, through such measures as the design, location of 
operating facilities and improvements to blend with the landscape.
    (e) Fisheries, wildlife and plant habitat. The operator shall take 
such action as may be needed to minimize or prevent adverse impact upon 
plants, fish, and wildlife, including threatened or endangered species, 
and their habitat

[[Page 710]]

which may be affected by the operations.
    (f) Cultural and paleontological resources. (1) The operator shall 
not knowingly disturb, alter, injure, destroy or take any scientifically 
important paleontological remains or any historical, archaeological, or 
cultural district, site, structure, building or object.
    (2) The operator shall immediately bring to the attention of the 
authorized officer any such cultural and/or paleontological resources 
that might be altered or destroyed by his operation, and shall leave 
such discovery intact until told to proceed by the authorized officer. 
The authorized officer shall evaluate the discoveries brought to his 
attention, and determine within 10 working days what action shall be 
taken with respect to such discoveries.
    (3) The responsibility and the cost of investigations and salvage of 
such values discovered during approved operations shall be the Federal 
Goverment's.
    (g) Access routes. No new access routes that would cause more than 
temporary impact and therefore would impair wilderness suitability shall 
be constructed in a wilderness study area. Temporary access routes that 
are constructed by the operator shall be constructed and maintained to 
assure adequate drainage and to control or prevent damage to soil, 
water, and other resource values. Unless otherwise approved by the 
authorized officer, roads no longer needed for operations shall be 
closed to normal vehicular traffic; bridges and culverts shall be 
removed; cross drains, dips, or water bars shall be constructed, and the 
road surface shall be shaped to as near a natural contour as 
practicable, be stabilized and revegetated as required in the plan of 
operations.
    (h) Reclamation. (1) The operator shall perform reclamation of those 
lands disturbed or affected by the mining operation conducted by the 
operator under an approved plan of operations containing reclamation 
measures stipulated by the authorized officer as contemporaneously as 
feasible with operations. The disturbance or effect on mined land shall 
not include that caused by separate operations in areas abandoned before 
the effective date of these regulations.
    (2) An operator may propose and submit with his plan of operations 
measures for reclamation of the affected area.
    (i) Protection of survey monuments. The operator shall, to the 
extent practicable and consistent with the operation, protect all survey 
monuments, witness corners, reference monuments, bearing trees and line 
trees against destruction, obliteration, or damage from the approved 
operations. If, in the course of operations, any monuments, corners or 
accessories are destroyed, obliterated or damaged by such operations, 
the operator shall immediately report the matter to the authorized 
officer. The authorized officer shall prescribe in writing the 
requirement for the restoration or reestablishment of monuments, 
corners, bearing trees, and line trees.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.4  General provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.4-1  Noncompliance.

    (a) An operator who conducts mining operations undertaken either 
without an approved plan of operations or without taking actions 
specified in a notice of noncompliance within the time specified therein 
may be enjoined by an appropriate court order from continuing such 
operations and be liable for damages for such unlawful acts.
    (b) Whenever the authorized officer determines that an operator is 
failing or has failed to comply with the requirements of an approved 
plan of operations, or with the provisions of these regulations and that 
noncompliance is causing impairment of wilderness suitability or 
unnecessary and undue degradation of the resources of the lands 
involved, the authorized officer shall serve a notice of noncompliance 
upon the operator by delivery in person to the operator or the 
operator's authorized agent, or by certified mail addressed to the 
operator's last known address.
    (c) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respects the 
operator is failing or has failed to comply with the requirements of the 
plan of operations of the provisions of applicable regulations, and 
shall specify the actions

[[Page 711]]

which are in violation of the plan or regulations and the actions which 
shall be taken to correct the noncompliance and the time limits, not to 
exceed 30 days, within which corrective action shall be taken.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.4-2  Access.

    (a) An operator is entitled to non-exclusive access to his mining 
operations consistent with provisions of the United States mining laws 
and Departmental regulations.
    (b) In approving access as part of a plan of operations, the 
authorized officer shall specify the location of the access route, the 
design, construction, operation and maintenance standards, means of 
transportation, and other conditions necessary to prevent impairment of 
wilderness suitability, protect the environment, the public health or 
safety, Federal property and economic interests, and the interests of 
other lawful users of adjacent lands or lands traversed by the access 
route. The authorized officer may also require the operator to utilize 
existing access routes in order to minimize the number of separate 
rights-of-way, and, if practicable, to construct access routes within a 
designated transportation and utility corridor. When commercial hauling 
is involved and the use of an existing access route is required, the 
authorized officer may require the operator to make appropriate 
arrangements for use and maintenance.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.4-3  Multiple-use conflicts.

    In the event that uses under any lease, license, permit, or other 
authorization pursuant to the provisions of any other law, shall 
conflict, interfere with, or endanger operations in approved plans or 
otherwise authorized by these regulations, the conflicts shall be 
reconciled, as much as practicable, by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.4-4  Fire prevention and control.

    The operator shall comply with all applicable Federal and State fire 
laws and regulations, and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent 
and suppress fires on the area of mining operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.4-5  Maintenance and public safety.

    During all operations, the operator shall maintain his structures, 
equipment, and other facilities in a safe and orderly manner. Hazardous 
sites or conditions resulting from operations shall be marked by signs, 
fenced, or otherwise identified to protect the public in accordance with 
applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 3802.4-6  Inspection.

    The authorized officer shall periodically inspect operations to 
determine if the operator is complying with these regulations and the 
approved plan of operations, and the operator shall permit access to the 
authorized officer for this purpose.


<R05>

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 3809.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to establish procedures to prevent 
unnecessary or undue degradation of Federal lands which may result from 
operations authorized by the mining laws.


<R05>
Sec. 3809.0-2  Objectives.

    The objectives of this regulation are to:
    (a) Provide for mineral entry, exploration, location, operations, 
and purchase pursuant to the mining laws in a manner that will not 
unduly hinder such activities but will assure that these activities are 
conducted in a manner that will prevent unnecessary or undue degradation 
and provide protection of nonmineral resources of the Federal lands;
    (b) Provide for reclamation of disturbed areas; and
    (c) Coordinate, to the greatest extent possible, with appropriate 
State agencies, procedures for prevention of unnecessary or undue 
degradation with respect to mineral operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3809.0-3  Authority.

    (a) Section 2319 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.) 
provides that exploration, location and purchase of valuable mineral 
deposits, under the mining laws, on Federal lands shall be ``under 
regulations prescribed by law,'' and section 2478 of the Revised 
Statutes, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1201), provides that those regulations 
shall be issued by the Secretary.
    (b) Sections 302, 303, 601, and 603 of the Federal and Policy and 
Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) require the Secretary to 
take any action, by regulation or otherwise, to prevent unnecessary or 
undue degradation of the Federal lands, provide for enforcement of those 
regulations, and direct the Secretary to manage the California Desert 
Conservation Area under reasonable regulations which will protect the 
scenic, scientific, and environmental values against undue impairment, 
and to assure against pollution of streams and waters.

[[Page 713]]

    (c) The Act of July 23, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 612), provides that rights 
under mining claims located after July 23, 1955, shall prior to issuance 
of patent therefor, be subject to the right of the United States to 
manage and dispose of the vegetative surface resources and to manage 
other surface resources. The Act also provides that ``Any mining claim 
hereafter located under the mining laws of the United States shall not 
be used, prior to issuance to patent therefor, for any purposes other 
than prospecting, mining or processing operations and uses reasonably 
incident thereto.''
    (d) Section 9 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1280) 
provides that regulations issued shall, among other things, provide 
safeguards against pollution of the rivers involved and unnecessary 
impairment of the scenery within the area designated for potential 
addition to, or an actual component of the national wild and scenic 
rivers system.
    (e) The Act of October 21, 1970 (16 U.S.C. 460y et seq.), as amended 
by Section 602 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (16 
U.S.C. 460y-8), established the King Range Conservation Area in 
California. The Secretary is required under these Acts to manage 
activities in this conservation area under the General Mining Law of 
1872 in such a manner as to protect the scenic, scientific, and 
environmental values against undue impairment, and ensure against 
pollution of streams and waters.

<R05>
Sec. 3809.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the term:
    (a) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management to whom authority has been delegated to perform the duties 
described in this subpart.
    (b) Casual Use means activities ordinarily resulting in only 
negligible disturbance of the Federal lands and resources. For example, 
activities are generally considered casual use if they do not involve 
the use of mechanized earth moving equipment or explosives or do not 
involve the use of motorized vehicles in areas designated as closed to 
off-road vehicles as defined in subpart 8340 of this title.
    (c) Federal lands means lands subject to the mining laws including, 
but not limited to, the certain public lands defined in section 103 of 
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Federal lands does 
not include lands in the National Park System, National Forest System, 
and the National Wildlife Refuge System, nor does it include acquired 
lands, Stockraising Homestead lands or lands where only the mineral 
interest is reserved to the United States or lands under Wilderness 
Review and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (these lands 
are subject to the 43 CFR part 3802 regulations).
    (d) Mining claim means any unpatented mining claim, millsite, or 
tunnel site located under the mining laws and those patented mining 
claims and millsites located in the California Desert Conservation Area 
which have been patented subsequent to the enactment of the Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976.
    (e) Mining laws means the Lode Law of July 26, 1866, as amended (14 
Stat. 251); the Placer Law of July 9, 1870, as amended (16 Stat. 217); 
and the Mining Law of May 10, 1872, as amended (17 Stat. 91); and all 
laws supplementing and amending those laws, including among others the 
Building Stone Act of August 4, 1892, as amended (27 Stat. 348); and the 
Saline Placer Act of January 31, 1901 (31 Stat. 745).
    (f) Operations means all functions, work, facilities, and activities 
in connection with prospecting, discovery and assessment work, 
development, extraction, and processing of mineral deposits locatable 
under the mining laws and all other uses reasonably incident thereto, 
whether on a mining claim or not, including but not limited to the 
construction of roads, transmission lines, pipelines, and other means of 
access for support facilities across Federal lands subject to these 
regulations.
    (g) Operator means a person conducting or proposing to conduct 
operations.
    (h) Person means any citizen of the United States or person who has 
declared the intention to become such

[[Page 714]]

and includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity.
    (i) Project area means a single tract of land upon which an operator 
is, or will be, conducting operations. It may include one mining claim 
or a group of mining claims under one ownership on which operations are 
or will be conducted, as well as Federal lands on which an operator is 
exploring or prospecting prior to locating a mining claim.
    (j) Reclamation means taking such reasonable measures as will 
prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the Federal lands, including 
reshaping land disturbed by operations to an appropriate contour and, 
where necessary, revegetating disturbed areas so as to provide a diverse 
vegetative cover. Reclamation may not be required where the retention of 
a stable highwall or other mine workings is needed to preserve evidence 
of mineralization.
    (k) Unnecessary or undue degradation means surface disturbance 
greater than what would normally result when an activity is being 
accomplished by a prudent operator in usual, customary, and proficient 
operations of similar character and taking into consideration the 
effects of operations on other resources and land uses, including those 
resources and uses outside the area of operations. Failure to initiate 
and complete reasonable mitigation measures, including reclamation of 
disturbed areas or creation of a nuisance may constitute unnecessary or 
undue degradation. Failure to comply with applicable environmental 
protection statutes and regulations thereunder will constitute 
unnecessary or undue degradation. Where specific statutory authority 
requires the attainment of a stated level of protection or reclamation, 
such as in the California Desert Conservation Area, Wild and Scenic 
Rivers, areas designated as part of the National Wilderness System 
administered by the Bureau of Land Management and other such areas, that 
level of protection shall be met.
    (l) King Range Conservation Area means the area designated pursuant 
to the Act of October 21, 1970 (16 U.S.C. 460y et seq.), as amended by 
Section 602 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (16 
U.S.C. 460y-8).

<R05>
Sec. 3809.0-6  Policy.

    Consistent with section 2 of the Mining and Mineral Policy Act of 
1970 and section 102(a) (7), (8), and (12) of the Federal Land Policy 
and Management Act, it is the policy of the Department of the Interior 
to encourage the development of Federal mineral resources and 
reclamation of disturbed lands. Under the mining laws a person has a 
statutory right, consistent with Departmental regulations, to go upon 
the open (unappropriated and unreserved) Federal lands for the purpose 
of mineral prospecting, exploration, development, extraction and other 
uses reasonably incident thereto. This statutory right carries with it 
the responsibility to assure that operations include adequate and 
responsible measures to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the 
Federal lands and to provide for reasonable reclamation.


<R05>
Sec. 3809.0-9  Information collection.

    (a) The collections of information contained in subpart 3809 have 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1004-0176. BLM will use the 
information in regulating and monitoring mining and exploration 
operations on public lands. Response to requests for information is 
mandatory in accordance with 43 U.S.C 1701 et seq., The information 
collection approval expires December 31, 1999.
    (b) Public reporting burden for this information is estimated to 
average 16 hours per response for notices and 32 hours per response for 
plans of operations, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send 
comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer (783), Bureau of 
Land Management, Washington, DC 20240,

    (iii) Measures to isolate, remove, or control toxic materials;
    (iv) Reshaping the area disturbed, application of the topsoil, and 
revegetation of disturbed areas, where reasonably practicable; and
    (v) Rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife habitat.
    (5) When reclamation of the disturbed area has been completed, 
except to the extent necessary to preserve evidence of mineralization, 
the authorized officer shall be notified so that an inspection of the 
area can be made.
    (e) Operations conducted pursuant to this subpart are subject to 
monitoring by the authorized officer to ensure that operators are 
conducting operations in a manner which will not cause unnecessary or 
undue degradation.
    (f) Failure of the operator to prevent undue or unnecessary 
degradation or to complete reclamation to the standards described in 
this subpart may cause the operator to be subject to a notice of 
noncompliance as described in Sec. 3809.3-2 of this title.

<R05>
Sec. 3809.1-6  Plan approval.

    (a) A proposed plan of operations shall be submitted to the 
authorized officer, who shall promptly acknowledge receipt thereof to 
the operator. The authorized officer shall, within 30 days of such 
receipt, analyze the proposal in the context of the requirement to 
prevent unnecessary or undue degradation and provide for reasonable 
reclamation, and shall notify the operator:
    (1) That the plan is approved; or
    (2) Of any changes in or additions to the plan necessary to meet the 
requirements of these regulations; or
    (3) That the plan is being reviewed, but that a specified amount of 
time, not to exceed an additional 60 days, is necessary to complete the 
review, setting forth the circumstances which justify additional time 
for review. However, days during which the area of operations is 
inaccessible for inspection shall not be counted when computing the 60 
day period; or
    (4) That the plan cannot be approved until 30 days after a final 
environmental statement has been prepared and filed with the 
Environmental Protection Agency; or
    (5) That the plan cannot be approved until the authorized officer 
has complied with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act 
or section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.
    (b) The authorized officer shall consult with the appropriate 
official of the bureau or agency having surface management 
responsibilities where such responsibility is not exercised by the 
Bureau of Land Management. Prior to plan approval the authorized officer 
shall obtain the concurrence of such appropriate official to the terms 
and conditions that may be needed to prevent unnecessary or undue 
degradation.
    (c) The authorized officer shall undertake an appropriate level of 
cultural resource inventory of the area to be disturbed. The inventory 
shall be completed within the time allowed by these regulations for 
approval of the plan (30 days). The operator is not required to do the 
inventory but may hire an archaeologist approved by the Bureau of Land 
Management in order to complete the inventory more expeditiously. The 
responsibility for and cost of salvage of cultural resources discovered 
during the inventory shall be the Federal Government's. The 
responsibility of avoiding adverse impacts on those cultural resources 
discovered during the inventory shall be the operator's.
    (d) Pending final approval of the plan, the authorized officer shall 
approve any operations that may be necessary for timely compliance with 
requirements of Federal and State laws, subject to any terms and 
conditions that may be needed to prevent unnecessary or undue 
degradation.
    (e) In the event of a change of operators involving an approved plan 
of operations, the new operator shall satisfy the requirements of 
Sec. 3809.1-9 of this title as it relates to bonding.

<R05>
Sec. 3809.1-7  Modification of plan.

    (a) At any time during operations under an approved plan, the 
operator on his/her own initiative may modify the plan or the authorized 
officer may request the operator to do so.

[[Page 718]]

    (b) A significant modification of an approved plan must be reviewed 
and approved by the authorized officer in the same manner as the initial 
plan.
    (c)(1) If, when requested to do so by the authorized officer, the 
operator does not furnish a proposed modification within a reasonable 
time, usually 30 days, the authorized officer may recommend to the State 
Director that the operator be required to submit a proposed modification 
of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer shall be 
accompanied by a statement setting forth the facts and the reasons for 
the recommendations.
    (2) In acting upon such recommendations the State Director shall 
determine, within 30 days, whether:
    (i) All reasonable measures were taken by the authorized officer at 
the time the plan was approved to ensure that the proposed operations 
would not cause unnecessary or undue degradation of the Federal land;
    (ii) The disturbance from the operations of the plan as approved or 
from unforeseen circumstances is or may become of such significance that 
modification of the plan is essential in order to prevent unnecessary or 
undue degradation; and
    (iii) The disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means.
    (3) Once the matter has been sent to the State Director, an operator 
is not required to submit a proposed modification of an approved plan 
until a determination is made by the State Director. Where the State 
Director determines that a plan shall be modified, the operator shall 
timely submit a modified plan to the authorized officer for review and 
approval.
    (4) Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan 
until a modified plan is approved, unless the State Director determines 
that the operations are causing unnecessary or undue degradation to the 
land. The State Director shall advise the operator of those reasonable 
measures needed to avoid such degradation and the operator shall 
immediately take all necessary steps to implement those measures within 
a reasonable period established by the State Director.

Sec. 3809.1-9  Bonding requirements.

    (a) No bond shall be required for operations that constitute casual 
use (Sec. 3809.1-2) or that are conducted under a notice (Sec. 3809.1-3 
of this title).
    (b) Any operator who conducts operations under an approved plan of 
operations as described in Sec. 3809.1-5 of this title may, at the 
discretion of the authorized officer, be required to furnish a bond in 
an amount specified by the authorized officer. The authorized officer 
may determine not to require a bond in circumstances where operations 
would cause only minimal disturbance to the land. In determining the 
amount of the bond, the authorized officer shall consider the estimated

[[Page 719]]

cost of reasonable stabilization and reclamation of areas disturbed. In 
lieu of the submission of a separate bond, the authorized officer may 
accept evidence of an existing bond pursuant to State law or regulations 
for the same area covered by the plan of operations, upon a 
determination that the coverage would be equivalent to that provided in 
this section.
    (c) In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit and maintain in a 
Federal depository account of the United States Treasury, as directed by 
the authorized officer, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar 
amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having 
a market value at the time of deposit of not less than the required 
dollar amount of the bond.
    (d) In place of the individual bond on each separate operation, a 
blanket bond covering statewide or nationwide operations may be 
furnished at the option of the operator, if the terms and conditions, as 
determined by the authorized officer, are sufficient to comply with 
these regulations.
    (e) In the event that an approved plan is modified in accordance 
with Sec. 3809.1-7 of this title, the authorized officer shall review 
the initial bond for adequacy and, if necessary, adjust the amount of 
the bond to conform to the plan as modified.
    (f) When all or any portion of the reclamation has been completed in 
accordance with the approved plan, the operator may notify the 
authorized officer that such reclamation has occurred and that she/he 
seeks a reduction in bond or Bureau approval of the adequacy of the 
reclamation, or both. Upon any such notification, the authorized officer 
shall promptly inspect the reclaimed area with the operator. The 
authorized officer shall then notify the operator, in writing, whether 
the reclamation is acceptable. When the authorized officer has accepted 
as completed any portion of the reclamation, the authorized officer 
shall authorize that the bond be reduced proportionally to cover the 
remaining reclamation to be accomplished.
    (g) When a mining claim is patented, the authorized officer shall 
release the operator from that portion of the performance bond which 
applies to operations within the boundaries of the patented land. The 
authorized officer shall release the operator from the remainder of the 
performance bond, including the portion covering approved means of 
access outside the boundaries of the mining claim, when the operator has 
completed acceptable reclamation. However, existing access to patented 
mining claims, if across Federal lands shall continue to be regulated 
under the approved plan. The provisions of this subsection do not apply 
to patents issued on mining claims within the boundaries of the 
California Desert Conservation Area (see Sec. 3809.6 of this title).

<R05>
Sec. 3809.2-1  Environmental assessment.

    (a) When an operator files a plan of operations or a significant 
modification which encompasses land not previously covered by an 
approved plan, the authorized officer shall make an environmental 
assessment or a supplement thereto to identify the impacts of the 
proposed operations on the lands and to determine whether an 
environmental impact statement is required.
    (b) In conjunction with the operator, the authorized officer shall 
use the environmental assessment to determine the adequacy of mitigating 
measures and reclamation procedures included in the plan to insure the 
prevention of unnecessary or undue degradation of the land. If an 
operator advises the authorized officer that he/she is unable to prepare 
mitigating measures, the authorized officer, in conjunction with the 
operator, shall use the environmental assessment as a basis for 
assisting the operator in developing such measures.
    (c) If, as a result of the environmental assessment, the authorized 
officer determines that there is substantial public interest in the 
plan, the authorized officer shall notify the operator, in writing, that 
an additional period of time, not to exceed the additional 60 days 
provided for approval of a plan in Sec. 3809.1-6 of this title, is 
required to

[[Page 720]]

consider public comments on the environmental assessment.

seq.). All garbage, refuse or waste shall either be removed from the 
affected lands or disposed of or treated to minimize, so far as is 
practicable, its impact on the lands.
    (d) Fisheries, wildlife and plant habitat. The operator shall take 
such action as may be needed to prevent adverse impacts to threatened or 
endangered species, and their habitat which may be affected by 
operations.
    (e) Cultural and paleontological resources. (1) Operators shall not 
knowingly disturb, alter, injure, or destroy any scientifically 
important paleontological remains or any historical or archaeological 
site, structure, building or object on Federal lands.
    (2) Operators shall immediately bring to the attention of the 
authorized officer any cultural and/or paleontological resources that 
might be altered or destroyed on Federal lands by his/her operations, 
and shall leave such discovery intact until told to proceed by the 
authorized officer. The authorized officer shall evaluate the 
discoveries brought to his/her attention, take action to protect or 
remove the resource, and allow operations to proceed within 10 working 
days after notification to the authorized officer of such discovery.
    (3) The Federal Government shall have the responsibility and bear 
the cost of investigations and salvage of cultural and paleontology 
values discovered after a plan of operations has been approved, or where 
a plan is not involved.
    (f) Protection of survey monuments. To the extent practicable, all 
operators shall protect all survey monuments, witness corners, reference 
monuments, bearing trees and line trees against unnecessary or undue 
destruction, obliteration or damage. If, in the course of operations, 
any monuments, corners, or accessories are destroyed, obliterated or 
damaged by such operations, the operator shall immediately report the 
matter to the authorized officer. The authorized officer shall 
prescribe, in writing, the requirements for the restoration or 
reestablishment of monuments, corners, bearing and line trees.

Sec. 3809.3-2  Noncompliance.

    (a) Failure of an operator to file a notice under Sec. 3809.1-3 of 
this title or a plan of operations under Sec. 3809.1-4 of this title 
will subject the operator, at the discretion of the authorized officer, 
to being served a notice of non-compliance or enjoined from the 
continuation of such operations by a court order until such time as a 
notice or plan is filed with the authorized officer. The operator shall 
also be responsible to reclaim operations conducted without an approved 
plan of operations or prior to the filing of a required notice.
    (b) Failure to reclaim areas disturbed by operations under 
Sec. 3809.1-3 of this title is a violation of these regulations.
    (1) Where an operator is conducting operations covered by 3809.1-3 
(notice) of this title and fails to comply with the provisions of that 
section or properly conduct reclamation according to standards set forth 
in 3809.1-3(d) of this title, a notice of noncompliance shall be served 
by delivery in person to the operator or his/her authorized agent, or by 
certified mail addressed to his/her address of record.
    (2) Operators conducting operations under an approved plan of 
operations who fails to follow the approved plan of operations may be 
subject to a notice of noncompliance. A notice of noncompliance shall be

section.
    (c) All operators who conduct operations under a notice pursuant to 
Sec. 3809.1-3 and a plan pursuant to Sec. 3809.1-4 of this title on 
Federal lands without taking the actions specified in a notice of 
noncompliance within the time specified therein may be enjoined by an 
appropriate court order from continuing such operations and be liable 
for damages for such unlawful acts.
    (d) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respects the 
operator is failing or has failed to comply with the requirements of 
applicable regulations, and shall specify the actions which are in 
violation of the regulations and the actions which shall be taken to 
correct the noncompliance and the time, not to exceed 30 days, within 
which corrective action shall be started.
    (e) Failure of an operator to take necessary actions on a notice of 
non-compliance, may constitute justification for requiring the 
submission of a plan of operations under Sec. 3809.1-5 of this title, 
and mandatory bonding for subsequent operations which would otherwise be 
conducted pursuant to a notice under Sec. 3809.1-3 of this title.

<R05>
Sec. 3811.1  Lands: General.

    Vacant public surveyed or unsurveyed lands are open to prospecting, 
and upon discovery of mineral, to location and purchase. The Act of June 
4, 1897 (30 Stat. 36), provides that ``any mineral lands in any forest 
reservation which have been or which may be shown to be such, and 
subject to entry under the existing mining laws of the United States and 
the rules and regulations applying thereto, shall continue to be subject 
to such location and entry,'' notwithstanding the reservation. This 
makes mineral lands in the forest reserves in the public land states, 
subject to location and entry under the general mining laws in the usual 
manner. Lands entered or patented under the stockraising homestead law 
(title to minerals and the use of the surface necessary for mining 
purposes can be acquired), lands entered under other agricultural laws 
but not perfected, where prospecting can be done peaceably are open to 
location.

Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920 (41 Stat. 437), shall hereafter 
be subject to disposal to the holders of those valid and subsisting 
rights by patent under the mining laws of the United States in force at 
the time of such disposal. Any person qualified to acquire the reserved 
deposits may enter upon said lands with a view of prospecting for the 
same upon the approval of the Secretary of the Interior of a bond or 
undertaking to be filed with him as security for the payment of all 
damages of the crops and improvements on such lands by reason of such 
prospecting, the measure of any such damage to be fixed by agreement of 
parties or by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any person who has 
acquired from the United States the title to or the right to mine and 
remove the reserved deposits, should the United States dispose of the 
mineral deposits in lands, may re-enter and occupy so much of the 
surface thereof as may be required for all purposes reasonably incident 
to the mining and removel of the minerals therefrom; and mine and remove 
such minerals, upon payment of damages caused thereby to the owner of 
the land, or upon giving a good and sufficient bond or undertaking 
therefor in an action instituted in any competent court to ascertain and 
fix said damages:


<R05>
Sec. 3813.2  Minerals subject to disposition.

    The Act of July 20, 1956, applies only to any mineral deposit 
discovered and located under the U.S. mining laws prior to February 25, 
1920, and reserved to the United States under the Act of July 17, 1914 
(38 Stat. 509; 30 U.S.C. 122), and which, at the time of application for 
mineral patent, is subject to valid and subsisting rights under the said 
mining laws. Only that mineral deposit together with the right to use 
the surface to prospect for, mine, and remove the said deposit shall, on 
or after July 20, 1956, be subject to disposal to the holders of such 
valid and subsisting rights by patent under the mining laws in force at 
the time of such disposal. ``Oil'' reserved under the Act of 1914 has 
been held to include oil shale. See 52 L.D. 329.


<R05>
Sec. 3813.3  Provisions of the mineral patent.

    (a) Each patent issued under the Act of July 20, 1956, shall 
specifically name

[[Page 726]]

the discovered mineral deposit which had been reserved to the United 
States under the Act of July 17, 1914, and shall recite that, in 
accordance with the reservation in the land patent, the mineral patentee 
and its successors (or his heirs and assigns, if a person) shall have 
the right to prospect for, mine and remove the mineral deposit for which 
the patent is issued.
    (b) If, when it is determined that mineral deposit is subject to 
patenting under the mining laws pursuant to the Act of July 20, 1956, 
there is a subsisting mineral lease or permit covering such deposit, the 
mineral patent shall be issued subject to the mineral lease or permit 
for so long as rights under the lease or permit shall exist, the 
patentee being substituted for the United States as lessor or permittor 
and the patentee being entitled to all revenues derived subsequent to 
the issuance of patent from any such lease or permit.

   Subpart 3814--Disposal of Reserved Minerals Under the Stockraising 
                              Homestead Act


<R05>
Sec. 3814.1  Mineral reservation in entry and patent; mining and removal of reserved deposits; bonds.

    (a) Section 9 of the Act of December 29, 1916 (39 Stat. 864; 43 
U.S.C. 299), provides that all entries made and patents issued under its 
provisions shall contain a reservation to the United States of all coal 
and other minerals in the lands so entered and patented, together with 
the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same; also that the coal 
and other mineral deposits in such lands shall be subject to disposal by 
the United States in accordance with the provisions of the coal and 
mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal.
    (b) Said section 9 also provides that any person qualified to locate 
and enter the coal or other mineral deposits, or having the right to 
mine and remove the same under the laws of the United States, shall have 
the right at all times to enter upon the lands entered or patented under 
the Act, for the purpose of prospecting for the coal or other mineral 
therein, provided he shall not injure, damage, or destroy the permanent 
improvements of the entryman or patentee and shall be liable to and 
shall compensate the entryman or patentee for all damages to the crops 
on the land by reason of such prospecting. Under the Act of June 21, 
1949 (30 U.S.C. 54), a mineral entryman on a stock raising or other 
homestead entry or patent is also held liable for any damage that may be 
caused to the value of the land for grazing by such prospecting for, 
mining, or removal of minerals except that vested rights existing prior 
to June 21, 1949, are not impaired.
    (c) It is further provided in said section 9 that any person who has 
acquired from the United States the coal or other mineral deposits in 
any such land or the right to mine and remove the same, may reenter and 
occupy so much of the surface thereof as may be required for all 
purposes reasonably incident to the mining or removal of the coal, or 
other minerals, first, upon securing the written consent or waiver of 
the homestead entryman or patentee; or, second, upon payment of the 
damages to crops or other tangible improvements to the owner thereof 
under agreement; or, third, in lieu of either of the foregoing 
provisions, upon the execution of a good and sufficient bond or 
undertaking to the United States for the use and benefit of the entryman 
or owner of the land, to secure payment of such damages to the crops or 
tangible improvements of the entryman or owner as may be determined and 
fixed in an action brought upon the bond or undertaking in a court of 
competent jurisdiction against the principal and sureties thereon. This 
bond on Form 3814 must be executed by the person who has acquired from 
the United States the coal or other mineral deposits reserved, as 
directed in said section 9, as principal, with two competent individual 
sureties, or a bonding company which has complied with the requirements 
of the Act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. 279; 6 U.S.C. 6-13), as amended 
by the Act of March 23, 1910 (36 Stat. 241; 6 U.S.C. 8, 9), and must be 
in the sum of not less than $1,000. Qualified corporate sureties are 
preferred and may be accepted as sole surety. Except in the case of a 
bond given by a qualified corporate surety there

[[Page 727]]

must be filed therewith affidavits of justification by the sureties and 
a certificate by a judge or clerk of a court of record, a United States 
district attorney, a United States commissioner, or a United States 
postmaster as to the identity, signatures, and financial competency of 
the sureties. Said bond, with accompanying papers, must be filed with 
the authorized officer of the proper office, and there must also be 
filed with such bond evidence of service of a copy of the bond upon the 
homestead entryman or owner of the land.
    (d) If at the expiration of 30 days after the receipt of the 
aforesaid copy of the bond by the entryman or owner of the land, no 
objections are made by such entryman or owner of the land and filed with 
the authorized officer against the approval of the bond by them, he may, 
if all else be regular, approve said bond. If, however, after receipt by 
the homestead entryman or owner of the lands of copy of the bond, such 
homestead entryman or owner of the land timely objects to the approval 
of the bond by said authorized officer, the said officer will 
immediately give consideration to said bond, accompanying papers, and 
objections filed as aforesaid to the approval of the bond, and if, in 
consequence of such consideration he shall find and conclude that the 
proffered bond ought not to be approved, he will render decision 
accordingly and give due notice thereof to the person proffering the 
bond, at the same time advising such person of his right of appeal to 
the Director of the Bureau of Land Management from the action in 
disapproving the bond so filed and proffered. If, however, the 
authorized officer, after full and complete examination and 
consideration of all the papers filed, is of the opinion that the 
proffered bond is a good and sufficient one and that the objections 
interposed as provided herein against the approval thereof do not set 
forth sufficient reasons to justify him in refusing to approve said 
proffered bond, he will, in writing, duly notify the homestead entryman 
or owner of the land of his decision in this regard and allow such 
homestead entryman or owner of the land 30 days in which to appeal to 
the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. If appeal from the 
adverse decision of the authorized officer be not timely filed by the 
person proffering the bond, the authorized officer will indorse upon the 
bond ``disapproved'' and other appropriate notations, and close the 
case. If, on the other hand, the homestead entryman or owner of the 
lands fails to timely appeal from the decision of the authorized officer 
adverse to the contentions of said homestead entryman or owners of the 
lands, said authorized officer may, if all else be regular, approve the 
bond.
    (e) The coal and other mineral deposits in the lands entered or 
patented under the Act of December 29, 1916, will become subject to 
existing laws, as to purchase or lease, at any time after allowance of 
the homestead entry unless the lands or the coal or other mineral 
deposits are, at the time of said allowance, withdrawn or reserved from 
disposition.

<R05>
Sec. 3823.0-3  Purpose.

    This subpart sets forth procedures to be followed by persons wishing 
to prospect on lands within National Forest Wilderness, and special 
provisions pertaining to mineral locations and mineral patents within 
National Forest Wilderness.


<R05>
Sec. 3823.0-5  Definition.

    As used in this subpart the term National Forest Wilderness means an 
area or part of an area of National Forest lands designated by the 
Wilderness Act as a wilderness area within the National Wilderness 
Preservation System.


<R05>
Sec. 3823.1  Prospecting within National Forest Wilderness for the purpose of gathering information about mineral resources.

    (a) The provisions of the Wilderness Act do not prevent any 
activity, including prospecting, within National Forest Wilderness for 
the purpose of gathering information about mineral or other resources if 
such activity is conducted in a manner compatible with the preservation 
of the wilderness environment. While information gathered by prospecting 
concerning mineral resources within National Forest Wilderness may be 
utilized in connection with the location of valuable mineral deposits 
which may be discovered through such activity and which may be open to 
such location, attention is directed to the fact that no claim may be 
located after midnight, December 31, 1983, and no valid discovery may be 
made after that time on any location purportedly made before that time.
    (b) All persons wishing to carry on any activity, including 
prospecting, for the purpose of gathering information about mineral or 
other resources on lands within National Forest Wilderness should make 
inquiry of the officer in charge of the National Forest in which the 
lands are located concerning the regulations of the Secretary of 
Agriculture governing surface use of the lands for such activity.


<R05>
Sec. 3823.2  Mineral locations within National Forest Wilderness.

    (a) Until midnight, December 31, 1983, the mining laws of the United 
States and the regulations of this chapter pertaining thereto, including 
any amendments thereto effective during such period, shall to the same 
extent as applicable before September 3, 1964, extend to National Forest 
Wilderness, subject to the provisions of such regulations as may be 
prescribed by the Secretary of

[[Page 732]]

Agriculture pursuant to section 4(d)(3) of the Wilderness Act.
    (b) All mineral locations established after September 3, 1964, and 
lying within the National Forest Wilderness, shall be held and used 
solely for mining or processing operations and uses incident thereto, 
and such locations shall carry with them no rights in excess of those 
rights which may be patented under the provisions of Sec. 3823.3 of this 
chapter.
    (c) All persons wishing to carry on any activity under the mining 
laws on lands within National Forest Wilderness, on or after September 
3, 1964, should make inquiry of the officer in charge of the National 
Forest in which the lands are located concerning the regulations of the 
Secretary of Agriculture governing activities to be performed thereon in 
connection with the locations of mining claims.


<R05>
Sec. 3823.3  Mineral patents within National Forest Wilderness.

    (a) Each patent issued under the U.S. mining laws for mineral 
locations established after September 3, 1964, or validated by discovery

<R05>
Sec. 3825.1  Mining locations in Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation in Arizona.

    (a) The procedure in the location of mining claims, performance of 
annual labor and the prosecution of patent proceedings therefor shall be 
the same as provided by the United States mining laws and regulations 
thereunder, with the additional requirements prescribed in this section.

[[Page 733]]

    (b) In addition to complying with the existing laws and regulations 
governing the recording of mining locations with the proper local 
recording officer, the locator of a mining claim within the Tohono 
O'Odham Indian Reservation shall furnish to the superintendent or other 
officer in charge of the reservation, within 90 days of such location, a 
copy of the location notice, together with a sum amounting to 5 cents 
for each acre and 5 cents for each fractional part of an acre embraced 
in the location for deposit with the Treasury of the United States to 
the credit of the Tohono O'Odham Tribe as yearly rental. Failure to make 
the required annual rental payment in advance each year until an 
application for patent has been filed for the claim shall be deemed 
sufficient grounds for invalidating the claim. The payment of annual 
rental must be made to the superintendent or other officer in charge of 
the reservation each year on or prior to the anniversary date of the 
mining location.
    (c) Where a mining claim is located within the reservation, the 
locator shall pay to the superintendent or other officer in charge of 
the reservation damages for the loss of any improvements on the land in 
such a sum as may be determined by the Secretary of the Interior to be a 
fair and reasonable value of such improvements, for the credit of the 
owner thereof. The value of such improvements may be fixed by the 
Commissioner, Bureau of Indian Affairs, with the approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior, and payment in accordance with such 
determination shall be made within 1 year from date thereof.
    (d) At the time of filing with the manager an application for 
mineral patent for lands within the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation 
the applicant shall furnish, in addition to the showing required under 
the general mining laws, a statement from the superintendent or other 
officer in charge of the reservation, that he has deposited with the 
proper official in charge of the reservation for deposit in the Treasury 
of the United States to the credit of the Tohono O'Odham Tribe a sum 
equal to $1 for each acre and $1 for each fractional part of an acre 
embraced in the application for patent in lieu of annual rental, 
together with a statement from the superintendent or other officer in 
charge of the reservation that the annual rentals have been paid each 
year and that damages for loss of improvements, if any, have been paid.
    (e) The Act provides that in case patent is not acquired the sum 
deposited in lieu of annual rentals shall be refunded. Where patent is 
not acquired, such sums due as annual rentals but not paid during the 
period of patent application shall be deducted from the sum deposited in 
lieu of annual rental. Applications for refund shall be filed in the 
office of the manager and should follow the general procedure in 
applications for repayment.
    (f) Water reservoirs, charcos, water holes, springs, wells, or any 
other form of water development by the United States or the Tohono 
O'Odham Indians shall not be used for mining purposes under the terms of 
the said Act of August 28, 1937, except under permit from the Secretary 
of the Interior approved by the Tohono O'Odham Indian Council.
    (g) A mining location may not be located on any portion of a 10 acre 
legal subdivision containing water reservoirs, charcos, water holes, 
springs, wells or any other form of water development by the United 
States or the Indians except under a permit from the Secretary of the 
Interior approved by the Tohono O'Odham Indian Council which permit 
shall contain such stipulations, restrictions, and limitations regarding 
the use of the land for mining purposes as may be deemed necessary and 
proper to permit the free use of the water thereon by the United States 
or the Tohono O'Odham Indians.
    (h) The term locator wherever used in this section shall include and 
mean his successors, assigns, grantees, heirs, and all others claiming 
under or through him.

                  Subpart 3831--Rights to Mineral Lands


<R05>
Sec. 3831.1  Manner of initiating rights under locations.

    Rights to mineral lands, owned by the United States, are initiated 
by prospecting for minerals thereon, and, upon the discovery of 
minerals, by locating the lands upon which such discovery has been made. 
A location is made by (a) staking the corners of the claim, except 
placer claims described by legal subdivision where State law permits 
locations without marking the boundaries of the claims on the ground, 
(b) posting notice of location thereon, and (c) complying with the State 
laws, regarding the recording of the location in the county recorder's 
office, discovery work, etc. As supplemental to the United States mining 
laws there are State statutes relative to location, manner of recording 
of mining claims, etc., in the State, which should also be observed in 
the location of mining claims. Information as to State laws can be 
obtained locally or from State officials.

Subpart 3833--Recordation of Mining Claims, Mill Sites, and Tunnel Sites 
       and Payment of Service Charges; and Payment of Rental Fees


<R05>
Sec. 3833.0-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations is to establish procedures for:
    (a) The recordation in the proper BLM office of unpatented mining

[[Page 735]]

claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites on Federal lands;
    (b) The filing in the same office of evidence of performance of 
annual assessment work or of a notice of intention to hold an unpatented 
mining claim;
    (c) The payment in the same office of an annual maintenance fee, if 
required, for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site held by the 
claimant;
    (d) Notifying the proper BLM office of the transfer of an interest 
in unpatented mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites.
    (e) These regulations are not intended to supersede or replace 
existing recording requirements under state law except when specifically 
changed by the provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
(FLPMA) of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701), and are not intended to make the 
Bureau office the official recording office for all ancillary documents 
(wills, liens, judgments, etc.) involving an unpatented mining claim, 
mill site or tunnel site.

[47 FR 56304, Dec. 15, 1982, as amended at 58 FR 38197, July 15, 1993; 
59 FR 44857, Aug. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 3833.0-2  Objectives.

    The objectives of these regulations are:
    (a) To determine the number and location of unpatented mining 
claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites located on Federal lands in order to 
assist in the surface management of those lands and the mineral 
resources therein;
    (b) To remove any cloud on the title to those lands that may exist 
because they are subject to mining claims that may have been abandoned;
    (c) To provide the BLM with information as to the location of active 
mining claims;
    (d) To keep the BLM informed of transfers of interest in unpatented 
mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites.

[47 FR 56304, Dec. 15, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3833.0-3  Authority.

    (a) Sections 314(a) and (b) of the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1744), as amended by 30 U.S.C. 28f-k, as 
amended by the Act of October 21, 1988 (112 Stat. 2681-235, require the 
recordation of unpatented mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, 
and the filing of information concerning annual assessment work 
performed on unpatented mining claims in the proper BLM office within 
specified time periods. Section 314(c) of FLPMA provides that a failure 
to record the required documents within the time limits imposed by the 
statute constitutes a conclusive abandonment of the mining claim, mill 
site, or tunnel site, which shall be void.
    (b) The Secretary has the general responsibility and authority for 
the management of Federal lands under 43 U.S.C. 2, 43 U.S.C. 1212, and 
43 U.S.C. 1457, and section 310 of the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1740).
    (c) The General Mining Law of May 10, 1872, section 2319 of the 
Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 22) provides that the exploration, location, 
and purchase of valuable mineral deposits shall be ``under regulations 
prescribed by law,'' and section 2478 of the Revised Statutes, as 
amended (43 U.S.C. 1201), provides that those regulations will be issued 
by the Secretary.
    (d) The Act of August 31, 1951 (31 U.S.C. 9701) and section 304(a) 
of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1734).
    (e) The Act of October 21, 1998 (112 Stat. 2681-232, 2681-235, 30 
U.S.C. 28f-28k) requires an annual maintenance fee of $100 to be paid to 
the proper State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for each non-
waived mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. With certain exceptions 
provided in Sec. 3833.1-6, this fee is in lieu of the requirement to 
perform and record annual assessment work under 30 U.S.C. 28-28e and 
section 314(a) of FLPMA. Failure to pay the fee within the time limits 
prescribed by 30 U.S.C. 28f, constitutes a statutory abandonment and 
forfeiture of the non-waived mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. 
Provisions relating to maintenance fees and waivers are contained in 
Secs. 3833.0-3(f), 3833.1-5, 3833.1-6, and 3833.1-7.
    (f) Section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (30 U.S.C. 
242) requires oil shale claim holders to pay an annual fee of $550 per 
oil shale claim,

[[Page 736]]

notwithstanding any other provision of law. The Act of August 10, 1993, 
specifically states that the maintenance fee provision shall not apply 
to any oil shale claims for which a fee is required to be paid under 
Section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The $550 fee 
requirement for oil shale claims remains in effect. The $550 fee is 
first payable on or before December 31, 1993, and on or before each 
December 31st thereafter.
    (g) The Stockraising Homestead Act of December 29, 1916 (SRHA) (43 
U.S.C. 299), as amended by the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60), 
provides that no person other than the surface owner may locate a mining 
claim on SRHA lands after October 13, 1993, until a notice of intent to 
locate has been filed with the proper BLM State Office and the surface 
owner is notified of the filing.
    (1)(i) When a notice of intent to locate a mining claim has been 
properly filed by a mining claimant, no other person may, until 90 days 
after the date the notice of intent is filed:
    (A) File such a notice with respect to any portions of the lands 
covered by the first notice;
    (B) Explore for minerals or locate a mining claim on any portion of 
such lands; or
    (C) File an application to acquire any interest in any portion of 
such lands pursuant to Section 209 of the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1719).
    (ii) The 90-day exclusive right may be extended by filing a Plan of 
Operations pursuant to subpart 3809 of this title. The extension runs 
until the BLM has approved or denied the Plan of Operations.
    (2) The mining claimant may not locate mining claims on the lands 
encompassed by a notice under the Act of April 16, 1993, until at least 
30 days after he or she has properly notified the surface owner by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (3) The Act of April 16, 1993, contains numerous other requirements 
prerequisite to a claimant engaging in mineral exploration and 
development activities on SRHA lands. These requirements are 
administered pursuant to subpart 3814 of this title.
    (h) The Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. 
appendix 565) excuses performance of assessment work by military 
personnel while they are on active duty, or within 6 months of their 
release from active duty, or during or within 6 months after their 
release from any period of hospitalization due to military injuries. The 
procedures for obtaining a waiver from the performance of assessment 
work may be found in subpart 3851 of this title.

Sec. 3833.1-2  Recordation of mining claims, mill sites and tunnel sites located after October 21, 1976.

    (a) The owner of an unpatented mining claim, mill site or tunnel 
site located after October 21, 1976, on Federal lands, excluding lands 
within units of the National Park System shall file within 90 days after 
the date of location of that claim or site in the proper BLM office, a 
copy of the official record of the notice or certificate of location of 
that claim or site that was or will be filed under state law. If state 
law does not require the recordation of a notice or certificate of 
location of a claim or site, a notice or certificate of location 
containing the information in paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
filed. (See Sec. 3734.1(a) of this title for mining claims and sites 
filed under Pub. L. 84-359 (69 Stat. 681) and Sec. 3821.2 of this title 
for mining claims and sites filed on O and C lands).
    (b) The copy of the notice or certificates filed in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be supplemented by the following 
additional information unless it is included in the copy:
    (1) The name or number of the claim or site, or both, if the claim 
or site has both;
    (2) The name and current mailing address, if known, of the owner or 
owners of the claim or site;
    (3) The type of claim or site;
    (4) The date of location;
    (5) For all claims or sites a description shall be furnished.
    (i) This description shall recite, to the extent possible, the 
section(s), the approximate location of all or any part of the claim to 
within a 160 acre quadrant of the section (quarter section), or 
sections, if more than one is involved, and the township, range, 
meridian and State obtained from an official survey plat or other U.S. 
Government map showing either the surveyed or protracted U.S. Government 
grid, whichever is applicable.
    (ii) The location of the claims or sites shall be depicted on either 
a topographic map published by the U.S. Geological Survey or by a 
narrative or a sketch describing the claim or site with reference by 
appropriate tie to some topographic, hydrographic, or man-made feature. 
Such map, narrative description, or sketch shall set forth the 
boundaries and position of the individual claim or site with such 
accuracy as will permit the authorized officer of the agency 
administering the lands or mineral interests in such lands

[[Page 740]]

to identify and locate the claims or sites on the ground.
    (iii) More than one claim or site may be shown on a single map or 
described in a single narrative or sketch if they are located in the 
same general area, so long as the individual claims or sites are clearly 
identified;
    (6) In place of the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section, an approved mineral survey may be supplied. A mining claim 
described by legal subdivisions, section, township, range, meridian and 
State fulfills the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (7) Nothing in the requirements for a map and description found in 
this section shall require the owner of a claim or site to employ a 
professional surveyor or engineer.
    (c)(1) Beginning on October 13, 1993, mining claims cannot be 
located on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916, 
as amended by the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat 60); until the 
claimant has first filed a notice of intent to locate with the proper 
BLM State Office and has served a copy of the notice upon the surface 
owner(s) of record, by registered or certified mail, return receipt 
requested. Such notice shall be in the form and contain the information 
required in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) The claimant shall wait 30 days after such service before 
entering the lands to locate any mining claims on the Stockraising 
Homestead Act lands.
    (3) The authorized officer will not record any mining claim located 
on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act, as amended, 
unless the claimant has complied with the requirements of this section, 
and all certificates or notices of location will be returned to the 
claimant without further action.
    (4) The surface owner of land patented under the Stockraising 
Homestead Act, as amended, is exempt from the requirements of this 
section.
    (5) All mining claims located on Stockraising Homestead lands are 
subject to the requirements of the Act of April 16, 1993. These 
additional requirements are found in subpart 3814 of this title.
    (d) A separate notice of intent shall be filed and recorded in the 
appropriate BLM State Office for each separate surface ownership in an 
individual State.
    (1) Each notice of intent submitted shall be accompanied by evidence 
of title of the surface owner(s). Evidence of title shall be either a 
certificate of title or abstract of title certified by a person, 
association, or corporation authorized by State law to execute such a 
certificate within that State, and acceptable to the Bureau of Land 
Management.
    (2) The notice of intent shall contain:
    (i) The names(s), mailing address(es), and telephone number(s) of 
the person(s) filing the notice;
    (ii) The names(s), mailing address(es), and telephone number(s) of 
the surface owner(s);
    (iii) The legal description of the lands to which the notice 
applies, to the nearest 5-acre subdivision or lot;
    (iv) The total number of acres under the specific notice of intent 
filed to the nearest whole acre;
    (v) A brief description of the proposed mineral activities;
    (vi) A map and legal description of the lands to be subject to 
mineral exploration, including access route(s);
    (vii) The name, mailing address, and telephone number of the person 
managing such activities; and
    (viii) A statement of the dates on which such activities will take 
place.
    (3) The legal description shall be based on the public land survey 
or on such other description as is sufficient to permit the authorized 
officer accurately to record the notice on the BLM land status records 
(i.e., to the nearest 5-acre subdivision or lot).
    (4) Upon acceptance of a notice of intent by the authorized officer, 
the notice of intent will be entered upon the official land status 
records of the Bureau of Land Management.
    (5) The total acreage covered at any time by notices of intent filed 
by any person and by affiliates of such person may not exceed 6,400 
acres of such lands in any one State and 1,280 acres of such lands 
nationwide for a single surface owner.
    (6) If the surface owner(s) sells all or part of the surface during 
the authorized exploration period, the person who

[[Page 741]]

filed the notice of intent is not required to notify the new surface 
owner(s) prior to entry during the authorized exploration period.

Sec. 3833.1-3  Service charges, rental fees, maintenance fees, and location fees; form of remittance and acceptance.

    (a) Payment and acceptance policy. All service charges, maintenance 
fees, and location fees shall be payable by United States currency, 
postal money order, or negotiable instrument payable in United States 
currency, and shall be made payable to the Department of the Interior--
Bureau of Land Management, or by a valid credit card acceptable to the 
Bureau of Land Management. A check or negotiable instrument, including 
credit cards submitted for payment of charges and/or fees, for which 
payment is not honored by the issuing authority, and such refusal is not 
an error of the issuing authority, will be deemed to be a nonpayment of 
the charges or fees for which the check or negotiable instrument, 
including a credit card order, was tendered. See Sec. 3833.1-4 (f) and 
(g) for payments made by credit cards or from Declining Deposit 
Accounts.
    (b) Recordation of new mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites 
with the Bureau of Land Management. (1) New location notices or 
certificates submitted for recording pursuant to Sec. 3833.1-2 that are 
not accompanied by full payment of the maintenance and location fees 
required by Sec. 3833.1-4 or 3833.1-5 will not be accepted, and the 
submittal will be returned without further action by the authorized 
officer. The claimant may resubmit the filings with the proper payment 
of service charges and fees within the same 90-day filing period 
referred to in Sec. 3833.1-2(a).
    (2) Failure to provide full payment of service charges set forth in 
Sec. 3833.1-4 will be curable for new location notices or certificates 
submitted for recording pursuant to Sec. 3833.1-2 when the proper 
maintenance and location fees have been submitted. Such documents will 
be noted as being recorded on the date received provided that the 
claimant submits the proper service charge either within 30 days of 
receipt of a deficiency notice sent by the authorized officer, or on or 
before the 90th day of the filing period referred to in 3833.1-2(a), 
whichever date is later.
    (3) If the proper service charges have not been tendered pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2), and if the claimant has not provided written 
instructions regarding the application of the funds received with the 
original filing, the authorized officer will apply such funds and 
serialize the claims in the order received. All notices or certificates 
for which there are insufficient funds to cover all service charges and 
maintenance and location fees will be returned to the claimant.
    (c) Mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites recorded and 
serialized by the Bureau of Land Management. (1) Failure to provide full 
payment of service charges set forth in Sec. 3833.1-4 will be curable 
for documents and filings made pursuant to Secs. 3833.2 and 3833.3 and 
amended locations filed under Sec. 3833.1. Such documents and filings 
will be noted as being recorded on the date initially received, provided 
that the claimant submits the proper service charge within 30 days of 
receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer. Failure to 
submit the proper service charge as required by this paragraph will 
cause filings made pursuant to Secs. 3833.2 and 3833.3 and amended 
locations filed under Sec. 3833.1 to be rejected and returned to the 
claimant/owner. If a payment is received that partially covers the 
claims submitted, the payment shall be applied to mining claims and 
sites in ascending numerical order of serialization.
    (2) If a claimant fails to submit the proper maintenance fees on or 
before each September 1, the authorized officer will apply the fees 
received to existing recorded and serialized mining claims and sites in 
ascending numerical order of serialization, unless otherwise directed by 
the claimant. The authorized officer will note the deficient fees as 
being paid on the original date received, provided that the claimant 
submits the proper fees within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice 
from the authorized officer, if that much

[[Page 742]]

time remains before September 1. If there are less than 30 days before 
September 1, the correct fees shall be filed (see Sec. 3833.0-5(m)) by 
such claimant on or before the September 1 deadline. Failure to submit 
the proper fees will cause the forfeiture of remaining claims or sites 
by the claimant/owner.

    (b) Each notice or certificate of location of a mining claim, mill 
site, or tunnel site that is located on or after August 11, 1993, and 
before September 30, 2001, shall, when filed with BLM, be accompanied by 
a one time nonrefundable location fee of $25.
    (c) Annual filings submitted pursuant to Sec. 3833.2 shall be 
accompanied by a nonrefundable service charge of $5.00 for each mining 
claim, mill site, or tunnel site. A service charge is not required to 
accompany the rental fee submitted in lieu of assessment work or Notice 
of Intent to Hold as required by Sec. 3833.1-5 or the certified 
statement of exemption required to be filed by Sec. 3833.1-7.
    (d) Amendments to a previously recorded notice or certificate of 
location shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable service charge of $5.00 
for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site.
    (e) Each transfer of interest document filed pursuant to Sec. 3833.3 
shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable service charge of $5.00 for each 
mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site affected.
    (f) The claimant/owner may authorize the BLM to charge payment of 
service charges, maintenance fees, and location fees to his or her 
credit card under Sec. 3833.1-3(a) by transmitting a facsimile 
authorization bearing the signature of the claimant/owner to the 
authorized officer, or the authorized officer may accept such 
authorization by telephone if the identity of the claimant/owner is 
established to the satisfaction of the authorized officer.
    (g) The claimant/owner may also maintain a declining deposit account 
with the State Office of the BLM where the mining claims and sites are 
recorded for the payment of service charges, maintenance fees, and 
location fees. The authorized officer may deduct the necessary service 
charges and fees from or add overpayments to such account only at the 
direction of the claimant/owner.

and (e), each claimant shall pay a nonrefundable maintenance fee of $100 
for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site to the proper BLM 
office for each specified assessment year for which the claimant desires 
to hold the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. The assessment 
years covered by 30 U.S.C. 28f, begin at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 
1994, and end at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 2002.
    (a)(1) The initial $100 nonrefundable maintenance fee for the 
assessment year in which the mining claim or site is located shall be 
paid for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site at the time of its 
filing with BLM pursuant to section 314(b) of FLPMA and Sec. 3833.1-2. 
If such claims or sites are located prior to September 1, and the notice 
of location is properly filed within the FLPMA time frame but after 
September 1, then the $100 fee that was due on September 1 for the 
succeeding assessment year shall be paid at the time of filing the 
location notice along with the initial $100 fee.
    (2) The initial maintenance fee described in paragraph (1) is not 
subject to the waiver provisions contained in Secs. 3833.1-6 and 3833.1-
7.
    (b) Under 30 U.S.C. 28f, a nonrefundable maintenance fee of $100.00 
for each mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site shall be paid annually 
on or before September 1 for the subsequent assessment year beginning at 
12 o'clock noon on September 1 of that year. The payments are due on 
each September 1 through September 1, 2001. At the time of payment, the 
claimant/owner shall

[[Page 743]]

submit a list of claim names and BLM serial numbers assigned to each 
mining claim or site for which the maintenance fee is being paid.
    (c) There will be no proration of rental or maintenance fees for 
partial years of holding of mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites.
    (d) A small miner may, under the waiver provisions of Secs. 3833.1-6 
and 3833.1-7, perform assessment work and file the affidavit of labor 
pursuant to Sec. 3833.2 in lieu of paying the rental or maintenance fee.
    (e) The owner of an oil shale placer claim shall pay the required 
$550 annual rental fee to the proper BLM State Office on or before each 
December 30.
    (f) The payment of the required maintenance fee for a mining claim, 
mill site, or tunnel site satisfies the requirement to file an affidavit 
of assessment work or a notice of intention to hold pursuant to 
Sec. 3833.2.
    (g) If a waived mining claim or site is transferred in total or in 
part to a party not qualified for a waiver, the waiver is forfeited for 
the mining claim or site or portion of interest therein transferred to 
the unqualified party. The maintenance fee for the previously waived 
claim or site will be paid for the assessment year in which the transfer 
was effective under State law pursuant to Sec. 3833.3. The applicable 
deadline is the August 31 on or immediately after which the transfer is 
effective under State law.
    (h) The Secretary will adjust the location and maintenance fees 
every 5 years, based upon the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor. The Secretary may 
adjust the location and maintenance fees sooner, if he deems it 
reasonable, based upon changes in the CPI.
    (1) Public notice of any adjustment of maintenance or location fees 
will be provided by July 1 of the assessment year prior to the 
assessment year to which the adjustment becomes effective.
    (2) Any such adjustment of maintenance or location fees to reflect 
changes in the CPI will be payable no later than the second August 31 
following the July 1 by which the notice of the adjustment was given.

Sec. 3833.1-6  Maintenance fee waiver qualifications under the 30 U.S.C. 28f, and other exceptions.

    A small miner may, under certain conditions described in this 
section and in Sec. 3833.1-7, perform the assessment work required under 
30 U.S.C. 28-28e and record it pursuant to Section 314(a) of FLPMA and 
Sec. 3833.2 in lieu of paying the maintenance fee. Assessment work shall 
conform to the requirements contained in subpart 3851 of this title.
    (a) In order to qualify for a waiver of the maintenance fee 
requirements, a small miner shall meet all of the following conditions:
    (1) The claimant and all related parties shall hold no more than 10 
mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, or any combination thereof, 
on Federal lands in the United States on the date the payment is due, 
which is each September 1. For purposes of determining the small miner 
waiver, oil shale claims shall not be counted toward the 10 claim 
limitation for the small miner waiver of the $100 maintenance fee. A 
claimant who owns 10 or fewer claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, and 
otherwise meets the requirements of this section, is not precluded from 
paying the maintenance fee in addition to filing for a small miner 
waiver.
    (2) All mining claims and sites held by a claimant and all related 
parties shall be counted toward the 10 claim and site limit.
    (3) Mill and tunnel sites of a qualified small miner, if listed upon 
the exemption certificate along with the affected lode and placer mining 
claims, are waived from payment of the maintenance fee.
    (b) Mining claims and sites that are undergoing final reclamation, 
as approved by the authorized officer pursuant to subparts 3802, 3809, 
or 3814 of this title, with no intent by the owner thereof to continue 
mining, milling, or processing operations upon or under the mining 
claims or sites, are excused from payment of the maintenance fees. The 
owner shall file a certified statement by September 1 in the proper

[[Page 744]]

BLM office attesting to the reclamation status of the affected mining 
claims and/or sites, with reference to a reclamation plan approved by 
the authorized officer for plan-level activities or submitted in 
consultation with the authorized officer for notice-level activities, 
and to his or her intent to place them into permanent closure. If the 
surface is managed by an entity other than BLM, the claimant shall 
submit evidence of a final reclamation plan that conforms to the 
requirements of the managing entity. A certified statement of such 
intent and reclamation shall be filed pursuant to Sec. 3833.1-7. The 
number of mining claims or sites that may properly qualify for a 
reclamation waiver pursuant to this paragraph is not restricted to a 10-
claim limit.
    (c) Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act (50 U.S.C. 
Appendix 565), military personnel on active duty status may, under 
certain conditions, qualify for an exemption from the performance of 
assessment work and the payment of maintenance fees. See Secs. 3833.1-
7(e)(2) and 3851.6 of this title.
    (d) Under the following circumstances, a waiver may be obtained from 
the payment of the maintenance fee for mining claims and sites:
    (1) The claimant has received a declaration of taking or a notice of 
intent to take from the National Park Service pursuant to Sections 6 and 
7 of the Act of September 28, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1905, 1906), 
or the Act of December 2, 1980, as amended (16 U.S.C. 3192); or the 
claimant has otherwise been denied access by the United States to his/
her mining claims or sites.
    (2) The claimant shall file proof of the above conditions for 
exemption, attested to as a certified statement, pursuant to 
Sec. 3833.1-7, with the proper BLM office by the September 1 at the 
beginning of the assessment year for which a waiver is sought.
    (3) The certified statement required by paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, serves as a notice of intention to hold as to mining claims and 
sites for which the exemption is sought. In such cases, the payment of 
the $5 service charge per claim or site is due upon filing the 
certification statement.
    (e) Payment of the maintenance fee for mining claims covered by a 
deferment of assessment work granted by the authorized officer pursuant 
to 30 U.S.C. 28 (b)-(e) and subpart 3852 of this title may be deferred 
during the period for which the deferment is granted. Deferments are 
governed by the following rule. If a petition for a deferment of 
assessment work, as required by Sec. 3852.2 of this title, is filed with 
the proper BLM office on or before September 1 for a given year, the 
maintenance fee need not be paid on the claims listed in the petition 
for deferment until the authorized officer has acted upon the petition.
    (1) If the petition is granted, maintenance fees for the claims are 
deferred for the upcoming assessment year. At the expiration of the 
deferment, all deferred fees shall be paid within 30 days of the end of 
the deferment, unless the claimant/owner qualifies as a small miner. If 
the claimant/owner qualifies as a small miner, all deferred assessment 
work shall be performed as provided in Sec. 3852.5 of this title upon 
expiration of the deferment.
    (2) If the petition for deferment is denied by the authorized 
officer, the maintenance fees shall be paid within 30 days of receipt of 
the decision of the authorized officer denying the petition for 
deferment. Failure to pay the maintenance fees owed will result in the 
forfeiture of the claims contained within the petition.
    (f) On mining claims for which an application for a mineral patent 
has been filed, and the mineral entry has been allowed, the payment of 
the maintenance fee is excused for the assessment years during which 
assessment work is not required pursuant to Sec. 3851.5 of this title. 
However, no refund of previously deposited maintenance fees will be made 
to the mineral patent applicant.

Sec. 3833.1-7  Filing requirements for the maintenance fee waiver and other exceptions.

    (a) If no change in status has occurred, a small miner exemption 
certification previously filed for the assessment year ending at noon on 
September 1, 1994, under the Act of October 5, 1992 (Pub. L. 102-381, 
106 Stat. 1374), and the pertinent regulations in effect on August 31, 
1993, will be considered a proper certification filing for a waiver of 
payment of the maintenance fee due on August 31, 1994.
    (b) The affidavit of assessment work performed by a small miner 
claiming a maintenance fee waiver shall be filed with the proper BLM 
office pursuant to Sec. 3833.2 and shall meet the requirements of 
Sec. 3833.2-4.
    (c) For mining claims and sites covered by a waiver, the filing of a 
waiver certification pursuant to any of paragraphs (a), (d), (e), or (f) 
of this section will satisfy the requirements for filing of a notice of 
intention to hold pursuant to Sec. 3833.2-5, when such notice of 
intention to hold is otherwise required. In such a case the payment of 
the $5 service charge per claim/site for processing the notice of 
intention to hold is due upon filing of the waiver statement.
    (d) Each small miner shall file a waiver certification on or before 
September 1 each year to hold the claims each assessment year beginning 
at 12 o'clock noon on September 1 of the calendar year the certification 
is due, through September 1, 2002. The small miner shall document, as 
provided in this paragraph (d), the claimed waiver for each assessment 
year a small miner's waiver is claimed, certified, and attested to under 
penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001. The statement shall contain:
    (1) The mining claim and site names and BLM serial numbers assigned 
to the mining claims and sites held by the small miner;
    (2) A declaration by the claimant and all related parties that they 
own no more than 10 mining claims and sites in total nationwide on the 
date the waiver statement is due;
    (3) A declaration that specifies that the assessment work 
requirements have been or will be completed by the date the payment is 
due, which is each September 1, for the assessment year just ending;
    (4) The names and addresses of all owners maintaining an interest in 
the mining claims and sites; and
    (5) The signatures of all the owners of the mining claims and sites 
for which a waiver is claimed.
    (e) Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act, and 
Sec. 3851.6 of this title, a military person entering active service may 
file, or cause to be filed, in the proper BLM office, a notice of his or 
her entry into active military service.
    (1) The filing of the notice excuses the person from performing 
assessment work or paying the maintenance fees until 6 months have 
passed from the person's release from active duty status, or until 6 
months have passed after release from a military hospital, whichever is 
later. To be excused from paying the maintenance fee, the person cannot 
hold the subject claim or site with a related party, as defined in 
paragraph 3833.0-5(x), who does not also qualify under the Soldiers' and 
Sailors' Relief Act.
    (2) The notice must be filed in the assessment year that the person 
entered active duty status, or if active duty began prior to August 30, 
1994, the notice must be filed in the assessment year that he or she 
wishes the benefits provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to take 
effect. If the person previously filed a notice under the Soldiers' and 
Sailors' Relief Act to be excused from performing assessment work, and 
remains qualified under that Act, he or she will automatically be exempt 
from paying the maintenance fee.
    (3) The performance of assessment work or the payment of maintenance 
fees shall resume in the assessment year next following the assessment 
year during which the person was released from active duty or a military 
hospital, whichever is later.
    (4) The notice shall be filed as a certified statement pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section, and shall list all mining claims and 
sites affected by claim/site name and BLM serial number.

Sec. 3833.2-2  Other Federal lands.

    Unpatented mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites located on 
Federal lands which are not within a unit of the National Park System 
except as provided in Secs. 3833.1-5 through 3833.1-7, are subject to 
the following annual filing requirements:
    (a) If a mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site located on or 
before October 20, 1976, was recorded in the proper BLM office prior to 
January 1, 1978, a notice of intention to hold or evidence of annual 
assessment work shall be filed in the proper BLM office on or before 
December 30, of the calendar year following the calendar year of its 
recordation, and of each calendar year thereafter.
    (b) All owners of mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites located 
on or before October 20, 1976, and recorded in the proper BLM office on 
or after January 1, 1978, and on or before October 22, 1979, shall have

December 30 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the 
location of the mining claims, mill site, or tunnel site.
    (d) Evidence of annual assessment work shall be in the form

Sec. 3833.2-3  Consistency between the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the General Mining Law of May 10, 1872, and the Act of October 21, 1998.

    (a) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires that a 
notice of intention to hold or evidence of annual assessment work be 
filed on or before December 30 of each calendar year following the 
calendar year in which the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site was 
located. To comply with the requirements of the Act for mining claims, 
mill sites, or tunnel sites located between September 1 and December 31 
of a given calendar year, the claimant shall submit an annual filing on 
or before December 30, of the following calendar year for each location

[[Page 747]]

to prevent the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site from being 
declared abandoned and void by operation of law.
    (b) Evidence of assessment work filed under this subpart between 
January 1 and the following December 30 of the same calendar year shall 
be deemed to have been filed during that calendar year, regardless of 
what assessment year that work fulfilled under State law.
    (c) Notice of intention to hold a mining claim, mill site, or tunnel 
site may be filed at the election of the owner, regardless of whether 
the assessment work has been suspended, deferred, or not yet accrued. 
However, the owner shall have filed with the Bureau of Land Management 
the same documents which have been or will be recorded with the local 
recordation office. There is no requirement to file a notice of intent 
to hold for a mill site or a tunnel site with the local recordation 
office. A notice of intention to hold a mining claim, mill site, or 
tunnel site shall be effective only to satisfy the filing requirement 
for the calendar year in which the notice is filed. The filing of a 
notice of intention to hold with the Bureau of Land Management shall not 
relieve the owner of complying with Federal and State laws pertaining to 
the performance of assessment work.
    (d) The 30 U.S.C. 28f, does not affect the requirements to do 
assessment work in the assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on 
September 1, 2002, or to make annual filings on or before December 30, 
2003, pursuant to Secs. 3833.2 and 3851.1.
    (e) For mining claims and sites located on or after September 1, 
2001, and on or before September 29, 2001, and for which the required 
$100 maintenance fee was paid at the time of recording pursuant to 
Sec. 314(b) of FLPMA and Sec. 3833.1-2, payment of the maintenance fee 
holds the claims or sites through at least September 1, 2002.

Sec. 3833.4  Failure to file, or to pay maintenance or location fees.

    (a)(1) The failure to make annual filings required by Secs. 3833.2-1 
and 3833.2-2 on or before the December 30 immediately following the 
September 1 by which the small miner filed for a waiver of payment of 
the maintenance fee, shall conclusively constitute a forfeiture of the 
mining claim or site.
    (2) Failure to record the notice or certificate of location required 
by Sec. 3833.1-2(a), Sec. 3734.1(a), or Sec. 3821.2 of this title, or 
failure to pay the maintenance or location fees required by 
Secs. 3833.1-4, 3833.1-5, and 3833.1-7, or failure to file the documents 
required by Sec. 3833.1-7 (b) through (d) within the time periods 
prescribed therein for claimants who also fail to pay the maintenance 
fee, shall be deemed conclusively to constitute a forfeiture of the 
mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site.
    (3) Claimants who fail to pay the maintenance fee, but file a waiver 
certification under Sec. 3833.1-7, shall perform the assessment work 
required by subpart 3851 of this title by the waiver statement filing 
deadline, or the mining claims under the invalid waiver certification 
will be conclusively deemed forfeited for failure to pay the maintenance 
fee on time.
    (4) Failure to list the 10 or fewer mining claims and/or sites for 
which the fee is requested to be waived on the applicable certification 
document filed pursuant to 3833.1-6 or 3833.1-7 will result in the 
affected mining claims and/or sites being deemed abandoned by the owner 
or owners thereof.
    (b) Failure to file the complete information required in 
Secs. 3833.1-2(b), 3833.1-7(d)-(f), 3833.2-4(a), 3833.2-4(b), 3833.2-
5(b) and 3833.2-5(c), when the document is otherwise filed on time, 
shall not be conclusively deemed to constitute an abandonment or 
forfeiture of the claim or site, but such information shall be submitted 
within 30 days of receipt of a notice from the authorized officer 
calling for such information. Failure to submit the information 
requested by the decision of the authorized officer shall result in the 
mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site being deemed abandoned by the 
owner.
    (c) Failure to record a transfer of interest under Sec. 3833.3 will 
result in the Bureau of Land Management refusing to recognize the 
interest acquired by the transferee or to serve notice of any action, 
decision, or contest on the unrecorded owner.
    (d) The fact that an instrument is filed in accordance with other 
laws permitting filing for record thereof and is defective or not timely 
filed for record under those laws shall not be considered failure to 
file under this subpart. The fact that an instrument is filed for record 
under this subpart by or on behalf of some, but not all of the owners of 
the mining claim, mill or tunnel site shall not affect the validity of 
this filing.
    (e) Any mining claim deemed abandoned under section 314(c) of the 
Act for failure to file an instrument in the local jurisdiction of the 
State where the claim is located pursuant to section 314 (a)(1) and (b) 
of the Act, shall not be validated by filing the instrument with the BLM 
in accordance with Sec. 3833.1, 3833.2-1, and 3833.2-2 of this title, 
and such instrument is ineffective even though the claim may currently 
be shown to exist in the BLM records.
    (f) Title IV of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 
1982 (30 U.S.C. 188(f)) provides that where an unpatented oil placer 
mining claim validly located prior to February 24, 1920, which has been 
or is currently producing or is capable of producing oil or gas, has 
been or is hereafter deemed conclusively abandoned for failure to file 
timely the required instruments or copies of instruments required by 
section 314 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 
U.S.C. 1744), and it is shown to the satisfaction of the authorized

    (a) Recordation or application involving an unpatented mining claim, 
mill site, or tunnel site by itself shall not render valid any claim 
which would not be otherwise valid under applicable law and does not 
give the owner any rights he is not otherwise entitled to by law.
    (b) Compliance with the requirements of this subpart shall be in 
addition to and not a substitute for compliance with the other 
requirements of Groups 3700 and 3800 of this title, and with laws and 
regulations issued by any State or other authority relating to locating, 
recording, and maintenance of mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel 
sites located, held, and maintained upon the public lands of the United 
States.
    (c) Filing of instruments pertaining to mining claims under other 
Federal law with the BLM or other Federal agency shall not excuse the 
filings required by this subpart and filings under this subpart shall 
not excuse the filing of instruments pertaining to mining claims under 
any other Federal law, except that filing a notice or certificate of 
location or an affidavit of annual assessment work under this subpart 
which is marked by the owner as also being filed under the Act of April 
8, 1948 (62 Stat. 162) or the Act of August 11, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 621-
625), will satisfy the recording requirement for O & C lands under 43 
CFR subpart 3821 and Pub. L. 359 lands under 43 CFR part 3730, or as 
provided in Sec. 3833.2 of this title.
    (d) In the case of any action or contest initiated by the United 
States affecting an unpatented mining claim, mill, or tunnel site, only 
those owners who have recorded their claim or site pursuant to 
Sec. 3833.1-2 and filed a notice of transfer of interest pursuant to 
Sec. 3833.3 shall be considered by the United States as parties whose 
rights are affected by such action or contest and shall be personally 
notified and served by certified mail sent to their last address of 
record. As provided in subpart 1810 of this title, all owners of record 
with the Bureau of Land Management shall be personally notified and 
served by certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to their last 
address of record. Such owners shall be deemed to have been served if 
the certified mail was delivered to that address of record, regardless 
of whether the certified mail was in fact received by them. The 
provisions of this subpart shall not be applicable to procedures for 
public notice required under part 3860 of this title with respect to 
mineral patent applications.
    (e) Actual notice of an unpatented mining claim or mill or tunnel 
site by any employee or officer of the United States shall not exempt 
the claim or site from the requirements of this subpart.
    (f) Failure of the government to notify an owner upon his filing or 
recording of a claim or site under this subpart that such claim or site 
is located on lands not subject to location or otherwise void for 
failure to comply with Federal or State law or regulations shall not 
prevent the government from

later challenging the validity of or declaring void such claim or site 
in accordance with due process of law.
    (g) Any person who files an instrument required by these regulations 
knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent

<R05>
Sec. 3840.1  Classes of mining claims.

    Mining claims are of two distinct classes: lode claims and placers.

[35 FR 9750, June 13, 1970]


<R04>
                        Subpart 3841--Lode Claims

    Source: 35 FR 9750, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.1  Lodes located previous to May 10, 1872.

    The status of lode claims located or patented previous to May 10, 
1872, is not changed with regard to their extent along the lode or width 
of surface; but the claim is enlarged by 2322 and 2328, R.S. (30 U.S.C. 
26, 33), by investing the locator, his heirs or assigns, with the right 
to follow, upon the conditions stated therein, all veins, lodes, or 
ledges, the top or apex of which lies inside of the surface lines of his 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.2  Lodes must not have been adversely claimed.

    It is to be distinctly understood that the law limits the possessory 
right to veins, lodes, or ledges, other than the one named in the 
original location, to such as were not adversely claimed on May 10, 
1872, and that where such other vein or ledge was so adversely claimed 
at that date the right of the party so adversely claiming is in no way 
impaired by the act of that date.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.3  Discovery.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.3-1  Discovery required before location.

    No lode claim shall be located until after the discovery of a vein 
or lode within the limits of the claim, the object of which provision is 
evidently to prevent the appropriation of presumed mineral ground for 
speculative purposes, to the exclusion of bona fide prospectors, before 
sufficient work has been done to determine whether a vein or lode really 
exists.

[[Page 752]]


<R05>
Sec. 3841.3-2  Discovery work.

    The claimant should, therefore, prior to locating his claim, unless 
the vein can be traced upon the surface, sink a shaft or run a tunnel or 
drift to a sufficient depth therein to discover and develop a mineral-
bearing vein, lode, or crevice; should determine, if possible, the 
general course of such vein in either direction from the point of 
discovery, by which direction he will be governed in marking the 
boundaries of his claim on the surface.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.4  Describing locations.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.4-1  Length of lode claims.

    From and after May 10, 1872, any person who is a citizen of the 
United States, or who has declared his intention to become a citizen, 
may locate, record, and hold a mining claim of 1,500 linear feet along 
the course of any mineral vein or lode subject to location; or an 
association of persons, severally qualified as above, may make joint 
location of such claim of 1,500 feet, but in no event can a location of 
a vein or lode made after May 10, 1872, exceed 1,500 feet along the 
course thereof, whatever may be the number of persons composing the 
association.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.4-2  Width of lode claims.

    No lode located after May 10, 1872, can exceed a parallelogram 1,500 
feet in length by 600 feet in width, but whether surface ground of that 
width can be taken depends upon the local regulations or State or 
Territorial laws in force in the several mining districts. No such local 
regulations or State or Territorial laws shall limit a vein or lode 
claim to less than 1,500 feet along the course thereof, whether the 
location is made by one or more persons, nor can surface rights be 
limited to less than 50 feet in width unless adverse claims existing on 
May 10, 1872, render such lateral limitation necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.4-3  Extent of surface ground.

    With regard to the extent of surface ground adjoining a vein or 
lode, and claimed for the convenient working thereof, the Act of May 10, 
1872, provides that the lateral extent of locations of veins or lodes 
made after said date shall in no case exceed 300 feet on each side of 
the middle of the vein at the surface, and that no such surface rights 
shall be limited by any mining regulations to less than 25 feet on each 
side of the middle of the vein at the surface, except where adverse 
rights existing on May 10, 1872, may render such limitation necessary; 
the end lines of such claims to be in all cases parallel to each other. 
Said lateral measurements cannot extend beyond 300 feet on either side 
of the middle of the vein at the surface, or such distance as is allowed 
by local laws. For example: 400 feet cannot be taken on one side and 200 
feet on the other. If, however, 300 feet on each side are allowed, and 
by reason of prior claims but 100 feet can be taken on one side, the 
locator will not be restricted to less than 300 feet on the other side; 
and when the locator does not determine by exploration where the middle 
of the vein at the surface is, his discovery shaft must be assumed to 
mark such point.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.4-4  Defining of locations.

    Section 5 of the Act of May 10, 1872, now section 2324, Revised 
Statutes (30 U.S.C. 28), requires that ``the location must be distinctly 
marked on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily traced.'' 
Locators can not exercise too much care in defining their locations at 
the outset, inasmuch as section 5 of the Act of May 10, 1872 (17 Stat. 
92; 30 U.S.C. 28) requires that all records of mining locations made 
subsequent to the date of said Act shall contain the name or names of 
the locators, the date of the location, and such a description of the 
claim or claims located, by reference to some natural object or 
permanent monument, as will identify the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.4-5  Location notice; monumenting.

    (a) The location notice should give the course and distance as 
nearly as practicable from the discovery shaft on the claim to some 
permanent, wellknown points or objects, such, for instance, as stone 
monuments, blazed trees, the confluence of streams, point of 
intersection of well-known gulches, ravines, or roads, prominent buttes,

[[Page 753]]

hills, etc., which may be in the immediate vicinity, and which will 
serve to perpetuate and fix the locus of the claim and render it 
susceptible of identification from the description thereof given in the 
record of locations in the district, and should be duly recorded.
    (b) In addition to the foregoing data, the claimant should state the 
names of adjoining claims, or, if none adjoin, the relative positions of 
the nearest claims; should drive a post or erect a monument of stones at 
each corner of his surface ground, and at the point of discovery or 
discovery shaft should fix a post, stake, or board, upon which should be 
designated the name of the lode, the name or names of the locators, the 
number of feet claimed, and in which direction from the point of 
discovery, it being essential that the location notice filed for record, 
in addition to the foregoing description, should state whether the 
entire claim of 1,500 feet is taken on one side of the point of 
discovery, or whether it is partly upon one and partly upon the other 
side thereof, and in the latter case, how many feet are claimed upon 
each side of such discovery point. As to the importance of monuments, 
and as to their paramount authority, see the Act of April 28, 1904 (33 
Stat. 545; 30 U.S.C. 34), which amended R.S. 2327.


<R05>
Sec. 3841.4-6  Recording of location notice.

    The location notice must be filed for record in all respects as 
required by the State or territorial laws, and local rules and 
regulations, if there by any.


<R04>
                       Subpart 3842--Placer Claims

    Source: 35 FR 9751, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.1  Placer claims: General.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.1-1  Discovery.

    But one discovery of mineral is required to support a placer 
location, whether it be of 20 acres by an individual, or of 160 acres or 
less by an association of persons.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.1-2  Maximum allowable acreage.

    (a) By R.S. 2330 (30 U.S.C. 36), it is declared that no location of 
a placer claim made after July 9, 1870, shall exceed 160 acres for any 
one person or association of persons, which location shall conform to 
the United States surveys.
    (b) R.S. 2331 (30 U.S.C. 35) provides that all placer-mining claims 
located after May 10, 1872, shall conform as nearly as practicable with 
the United States system of public land surveys and the rectangular 
subdivisions of such surveys, and such locations shall not include more 
than 20 acres for each individual claimant.
    (c) The foregoing provisions of law are construed to mean that after 
July 9, 1870, no location of a placer claim can be made to exceed 160 
acres, whatever may be the number of locators associated together, or 
whatever the local regulations of the district may allow; and that from 
and after May 10, 1872, no location can exceed 20 acres for each 
individual participating therein; that it, a location by two persons can 
not exceed 40 acres, and one by three persons can not exceed 60 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.1-3  Locations authorized in 10-acre units.

    By R.S. 2330 (30 U.S.C. 36), authority is given for subdividing 40-
acre legal subdivisions into 10-acre tracts. These 10-acre tracts should 
be considered and dealt with as legal subdivisions, and an applicant 
having a placer claim which conforms to one or more of such 10-acre 
tracts, contiguous in case of two or more tracts, may make entry 
thereof, after the usual proceedings, without further survey or plat.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.1-4  Manner of describing 10-acre units.

    A 10-acre subdivision may be described, for instance if situated in 
the extreme northeast of the section, as the ``NE. \1/4\ of the NE. \1/
4\ of the NE. \1/4\'' of the section, or, in like manner, by appropriate 
terms, wherever situated; but in addition to this description, the 
notice must give all the other data required in a mineral application, 
by which parties may be put on inquiry as

[[Page 754]]

to the land sought to be patented. The proofs submitted with 
applications must show clearly the character and extent of the 
improvements upon the premises.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.1-5  Conformity of placer claims to the public land surveys.

    (a) All placer-mining claims located after May 10, 1872, shall 
conform as near as practicable with the United States system of public-
land surveys and the rectangular subdivisions of such surveys, whether 
the locations are upon surveyed or unsurveyed lands.
    (b) Conformity to the public-land surveys and the rectangular 
subdivisions thereof will not be required where compliance with such 
requirement would necessitate the placing of the lines thereof upon 
other prior located claims or where the claim is surrounded by prior 
locations.
    (c) Where a placer location by one or two persons can be entirely 
included within a square 40-acre tract, by three or four persons within 
two square 40-acre tracts placed end to end, by five or six persons 
within three square 40-acre tracts, and by seven or eight persons within 
four square 40-acre tracts, such locations will be regarded as within 
the requirements where strict conformity is impracticable.
    (d) Whether a placer location conforms reasonably with the legal 
subdivisions of the public survey is a question of fact to be determined 
in each case, and no location will be passed to patent without 
satisfactory evidence in this regard. Claimants should bear in mind that 
it is the policy of the Government to have all entries whether of 
agricultural or mineral lands as compact and regular in form as 
reasonably practicable, and that it will not permit or sanction entries 
or locations which cut the public domain into long narrow strips or 
grossly irregular or fantastically shaped tracts. (Snow Flake Fraction 
Placer, 37 L.D. 250.)


<R05>
Sec. 3842.2  Building-stone placers.

    The Act of August 4, 1892 (27 Stat. 348; 30 U.S.C. 161), extends the 
mineral land laws so as to bring lands chiefly valuable for building 
stone within the provisions of said laws.
    (a) Common varieties of building stone are, since the Act of July 
23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367; 30 U.S.C. 611) no longer locatable under the 
mining laws.
    (b) Uncommon varieties of building stone continue to be subject to 
the building stone placer supplement to the mining law, 30 U.S.C. 161.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.3  Saline placers.

    (a) Under the Act approved January 31, 1901 (31 Stat. 745; 30 U.S.C. 
162), extending the mining laws to saline lands, the provisions of the 
law relating to placer-mining claims are extended to all States so as to 
permit the location and purchase thereunder of all unoccupied public 
lands containing salt springs, or deposits of salt in any form, and 
chiefly valuable therefor, with the proviso, ``That the same person 
shall not locate or enter more than one claim hereunder.'' The saline 
placer act was superseded by the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 
1920 (41 Stat. 437; 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), whereby saline (sodium) 
deposits were made subject to disposal by leases instead of mining 
locations.
    (b) Rights obtained by location under the placer-mining laws are 
assignable, and the assignee may make the entry in his own name; so, 
under this act a person holding as assignee may make entry in his own 
name: Provided, That he has not held under this act, at any time, either 
as locator or entryman, any other lands; his right is exhausted by 
having held under this act any particular tract, either as locator or 
entryman, either as an individual or as a member of an association. It 
follows, therefore, that no application for patent or entry, made under 
this act, shall embrace more than one single location.
    (c) In order that the conditions imposed by the proviso, as set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section, may duly appear, the application 
for patent must contain or be accompanied by a specific statement by 
each person whose name appears therein that he never has, either as an 
individual or as a member of an association, located or entered any 
other lands under the provisions of this act. The application for patent 
should also be accompanied by a

[[Page 755]]

showing, fully disclosing the qualifications as defined by the proviso, 
of the applicants' predecessors in interest.


<R05>
Sec. 3842.4  Petroleum placers.

    The Act of February 11, 1897 (29 Stat. 526), provides for the 
location and entry of public lands chiefly valuable for petroleum or 
other mineral oils, and entries of that nature made prior to the passage 
of said act are to be considered as though made thereunder. This Act was 
superseded by the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920 (41 Stat. 
437).


<R04>
                       Subpart 3843--Tunnel Sites

    Source: 35 FR 9752, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3843.1  Possessory right of tunnel proprietor.

    The effect of R.S. 2323 (30 U.S.C. 27), is to give the proprietors 
of a mining tunnel run in good faith the possessory right to 1,500 feet 
of any blind lodes cut, discovered, or intersected by such tunnel, which 
were not previously known to exist within 3,000 feet from the face or 
point of commencement of such tunnel, and to prohibit other parties, 
after the commencement of the tunnel, from prospecting for and making 
locations of lodes on the line thereof and within said distance of 3,000 
feet, unless such lodes appear upon the surface or were previously known 
to exist. The term ``face,'' as used in said sections, is contrued and 
held to mean the first working face formed in the tunnel, and to signify 
the point at which the tunnel actually enters cover; it being from this 
point that the 3,000 feet are to be counted upon which prospecting is 
prohibited as aforesaid. R.S. 2323 provides: ``Failure to prosecute the 
work on the tunnel for six months shall be considered as an abandonment 
of the right to all undiscovered veins on the line of such tunnel.''


<R05>
Sec. 3843.2  Location of tunnel claims.

    To avail themselves of the benefits of this provision of law, the 
proprietors of a mining tunnel will be required, at the time they enter 
cover as aforesaid, to give proper notice of their tunnel location by 
erecting a substantial post, board, or monument at the face or point of 
commencement thereof, upon which should be posted a good and sufficient 
notice, giving the names of the parties or company claiming the tunnel 
right; the actual or proposed course or direction of the tunnel, the 
height and width thereof, and the course and distance from such face or 
point of commencement to some permanent well-known objects in the 
vicinity by which to fix and determine the locus in manner heretofore 
set forth applicable to locations of veins or lodes, and at the time of 
posting such notice they shall, in order that miners or prospectors may 
be enabled to determine whether or not they are within the lines of the 
tunnel, establish the boundary lines thereof, by stakes or monuments 
placed along such lines at proper intervals, to the terminus of the 
3,000 feet from the face or point of commencement of the tunnel, and the 
lines so marked will define and govern as to specific boundaries within 
which prospecting for lodes not previously known to exist is prohibited 
while work on the tunnel is being prosecuted with reasonable diligence.


<R05>
Sec. 3843.3  Recording of notices.

    A full and correct copy of such notice of location defining the 
tunnel claim must be filed for record with the mining recorder of the 
district, to which notice must be attached the sworn statement or 
declaration of the owners, claimants, or projectors of such tunnel, 
setting forth the facts in the case; stating the amount expended by 
themselves and their predecessors in interest in prosecuting work 
thereon; the extent of the work performed, and that it is bona fide 
their intention to prosecute work on the tunnel so located and described 
with reasonable diligence for the development of a vein or lode, or for 
the discovery of mines, or both, as the case may be. This notice of 
location must be duly recorded, and, with the said sworn statement 
attached, kept on the recorder's files for future reference.

<R04>
                         Subpart 3844--Millsites


<R05>
Sec. 3844.0-3  Authority.

    The location and patenting of lands for millsite purposes is 
authorized by R.S. 2337 as amended by the Act of March 18, 1960. The 
Act, 30 U.S.C. 42, reads as follows:

    Patents for nonmineral lands.

    (a) Where nonmineral land not contiguous to the vein or lode is used 
or occupied by the proprietor of such vein or lode for mining or milling 
purposes, such nonadjacent surface ground may be embraced, and included 
in an application for a patent for such vein or lode, and the same may 
be patented therewith, subject to the same preliminary requirements as 
to survey and notice as are applicable to veins or lodes; but no 
location made of such nonadjacent land shall exceed five acres, and 
payment for the same must be made at the same rate as fixed by sections 
21-24, 26-28, 29, 30, 33-48, 50-52, and 71-76 of this title for the 
superficies of the lode. The owner of a quartz mill or reduction works, 
not owning a mine in connection therewith, may also receive a patent for 
his mill site, as provided in this section.
    (b) Where nonmineral land is needed by the proprietor of a placer 
claim for mining, milling, processing, beneficiation, or other 
operations in connection with such claim, and is used or occupied by the 
proprietor for such purposes, such land may be included in an 
application for a patent for such claim, and may be patented therewith 
subject to the same requirements as to survey and notice as are 
applicable to placers. No location made of such nonmineral land shall 
exceed five acres and payment for the same shall be made at the rate 
applicable to placer claims which do not include a vein or lode. (As 
amended Mar. 18, 1960, Pub. Law 86-390, 74 Stat. 7.)

[35 FR 9752, June 13, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 3844.1  Required use.

    A millsite is required to be used or occupied distinctly and 
explicitly for mining or milling purposes in connection with the lode or 
placer claim with which it is associated. A custom or independent 
millsite may be located for the erection and maintenance of a quartz 
mill or reduction works.

    Source: 35 FR 9753, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3851.1  Assessment work requirements.

    (a) The assessment year begins at 12 o'clock noon on September 1st 
and ends at 12 o'clock noon on the following September 1st.
    (b) All lode and placer mining claimants shall have performed, or 
caused to have been performed, not less than $100 of labor or 
improvements upon each lode or placer claim held by the claimant for 
each assessment year following the assessment year of the lode or placer 
claim's location.
    (c) Where a group of lode or placer claims are held in common, and 
cover the same mineral deposit, the assessment work may be performed on 
one or several claims of the group, as long as the aggregate expenditure 
totals not less than $100 per claim, and the work performed or 
improvements made will benefit the development of the claim block as a 
whole.

[58 FR 38202, July 15, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 3851.2  Inclusion of surveys in assessment work.

    (a) In addition to the several types of work that may fulfill the 
annual labor requirement, the requirement can also be satisfied by 
conducting geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys. Pub. L. 85-
876, Act of September 2, 1958 (72 Stat. 1701; 30 U.S.C. 28-1-2). Such 
surveys must be conducted by qualified experts and verified by a 
detailed report filed in the county or recording district office in 
which the claim is located. This report must set forth fully the 
following:
    (1) The location of the work performed in relation to the point of 
discovery and boundaries of the claim.
    (2) Nature, extent and cost of the work performed.
    (3) The basic findings of the surveys.
    (4) The name, address and professional background of the person or 
persons conducting the work.

Such surveys may not be applied as labor for more than two consecutive 
years or for more than a total of five years on any one mining claim. 
Each survey shall be nonrepetitive of any previous survey of the same 
claim. Such surveys will not apply toward the statutory provision 
requiring the expenditure of $500 for each claim for mineral patent.
    (b) As used in this section--
    (1) The term geological surveys means surveys on the ground for 
mineral deposits by the proper application of the principles and 
techniques of the science of geology as they relate to the search for 
and discovery of mineral deposits;
    (2) The term geochemical surveys means surveys on the ground for 
mineral deposits by the proper application of the principles and 
techniques of the science of chemistry as they relate to the search for 
and discovery of mineral deposits;
    (3) The term geophysical surveys means surveys on the ground for 
mineral deposits through the employment of generally recognized 
equipment and methods for measuring physical difference between rock 
types or discontinuities in geological formations;

[[Page 758]]

    (4) The term qualified expert means an individual qualified by 
education or experience to conduct geological, geochemical, or 
geophysical surveys, as the case may be.


<R05>
Sec. 3851.3  Effect of failure to perform assessment work.

    (a) Failure of a mining claimant to comply substantially with the 
requirement of an annual expenditure of $100 in labor or improvements on 
a claim imposed by section 2324 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 28) 
will render the claim subject to cancellation.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 3851.5 and subpart 3852, failure to 
perform the assessment work required under Sec. 3851.1 causes the 
interest of the claimant(s) in the minerals subject to the mining laws 
to revert back to the public domain.
    (c) The 30 U.S.C. 28f, with certain exceptions for small miners, 
temporarily suspends and supersedes the requirement to perform 
assessment work under Sec. 3851.1, and requires the payment of an annual 
$100 maintenance fee per mining claim in lieu of the assessment work. 
For oil shale claims, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (30 U.S.C. 242) 
suspends and supersedes the requirement to perform assessment work under 
Sec. 3851.1, and requires the payment of an annual $550 rental fee per 
oil shale mining claim in lieu of the assessment work. The maintenance 
fee requirements and waivers from the maintenance fee are described in 
Secs. 3833.0-3(f), 3833.1-5, 3833.1-6, and 3833.1-7 of this title.

[37 FR 17836, Sept. 1, 1972, as amended at 58 FR 38202, July 15, 1993; 
59 FR 44863, Aug. 30, 1994; 64 FR 47022, Aug. 27, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 3851.4  Failure of a co-owner to contribute to annual assessment work; or to the payment of maintenance fees.

    (a) Upon the failure of any co-owner of a mining claim or mill or 
tunnel site to contribute the proper proportion of the required 
expenditures, the co-owners who have performed the labor, made 
improvements, paid the maintenance fee required under Secs. 3833.1-5 and 
3833.1-6 of this title, may, at the expiration of the assessment year, 
give such delinquent co-owner personal notice of this failure in 
writing. Alternatively, this notice may be given by publication in the 
newspaper published nearest the claim for at least once a week for 90 
days. If, upon the expiration of 90 days, after such notice in writing, 
or upon the expiration of 180 days after the first newspaper publication 
of notice, the delinquent co-owner shall have failed to contribute the 
proportionate share of such expenditures or improvements, such interest 
in the claim by law passes to the co-owners who have made the 
expenditures or improvements.
    (b) A claimant alleging ownership of a forfeited interest under 
paragraph (a) of this section who requests the authorized officer to 
change the ownership records of the affected mining claims or sites 
shall present the following:
    (1) Statement of the publisher of the newspaper as to the facts of 
publication, giving the beginning and ending dates of publication, a 
printed copy of the notice published, and a statement by the claimant 
that the delinquent co-owner failed to contribute the proper proportion 
within the period fixed by the statute, or
    (2) Evidence of personal notice of delinquency upon the delinquent 
party. If notice is effected by mail, the minimum sufficient evidence 
shall consist of a copy of the notice and a copy of the return receipt 
of the U.S. Postal Service evidencing receipt by the delinquent party of 
a registered or certified envelope containing the notice. If notice was 
made in person, an affidavit signed and dated on the date of notice will 
suffice as evidence of such notice; and
    (3) In all cases, a signed and dated statement by the claimant that 
the delinquent co-owner failed to contribute the proper proportion 
within the period fixed by the statute.
    (c) Upon determination by the authorized officer that paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section have been complied with, the BLM records of the 
mining claim shall be changed pursuant to Sec. 3833.3 of this title. 
Such a change in ownership requires that the claimant submit the service 
charge required for a transfer of interest pursuant to Sec. 3833.1-4 of 
this title.

[[Page 759]]

    (d) Active duty military personnel who give notice and comply with 
Sec. 3851.6 are not subject to the provisions of this section.

[59 FR 44863, Aug. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 3851.5  Assessment work not required after allowance of mineral entry.

    Performance of annual assessment work and payment of maintenance 
fees is not required after the date that the mineral entry has been 
allowed.
    (a) The assessment year in which the mineral entry is allowed is the 
first assessment year for which the assessment work and payment of 
maintenance fees is no longer required, and assessment work is not 
required in any assessment year thereafter until a mineral patent 
issues.
    (b) If a mineral entry is canceled in whole or in part, the mining 
claims and mill sites that are no longer covered by the mineral entry 
shall be subject to the assessment work requirement, or the payment of 
maintenance fees, beginning in the next assessment year following the 
assessment year that the mineral entry was canceled.

[59 FR 44863, Aug. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 3851.6  Assessment work not required for active duty military personnel.

    Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act (50 U.S.C. 
Appendix 565), a person entering active military service is exempt from 
the performance of annual assessment work under this subpart for each 
assessment year in which the service person is on active duty.
    (a) To claim the exemption, the person entering active military 
service shall file, or cause to be filed with the proper BLM office, a 
notice of his or her entry into active military service. The notice 
shall be filed in the assessment year that the person entered active 
duty status.
    (b) The filing of the notice exempts the person from performing 
assessment work or paying the maintenance fees until 6 months have 
passed from the person's release from active duty status, or until 6 
months have passed from release from a military hospital, whichever is 
later.
    (c) The performance of assessment work or the payment of maintenance 
fees shall resume in the assessment year beginning at least 6 months 
after the date the person was released from active duty or a military 
hospital, whichever is later.
    (d) The notice shall be filed as a certified statement pursuant to 
section 3833.1-7 of this title, and shall list all mining claims and 
sites affected by claim name and BLM serial number.

               Subpart 3852--Deferment of Assessment Work

    Source: 35 FR 9753, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3852.0-3  Authority.

    The Act of June 21, 1949 (63 Stat. 214; 30 U.S.C. 28b-c), provides 
for the temporary deferment in certain unavoidable contingencies of the 
performance of annual assessment work on mining claims held by location 
in the United States. The relief under this act is in addition to any 
other relief available under any other act of Congress with respect to 
the suspension of annual assessment work on mining claims.


<R05>
Sec. 3852.1  Conditions under which deferment may be granted.

    The deferment may be granted where any mining claim or group of 
claims in the United States is surrounded by lands over which a right-
of-way for the performance of assessment work has been denied or is in 
litigation or is in the process of acquisition under State law or where 
other legal impediments exist which affect the right of the claimant to 
enter upon the surface of such claim or group of claims or to gain 
access to the boundaries thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 3852.2  Filing of petition for deferment, contents.

    (a) In order to obtain a deferment, the claimant shall file with the 
proper BLM office a petition in duplicate requesting such a deferment. 
No particular form of petition is required, but the applicant shall 
attach to one copy thereof a copy of the notice to the public required 
by 30 U.S.C. 28e showing

[[Page 760]]

that it has been filed or recorded in the local recording office in 
which the notices or certificates of location were filed or recorded. 
The petition and duplicate should be signed by at least one of the 
owners of each of the locations involved, shall give the names of the 
claims, dates of location, and the date of the beginning of the one-year 
period for which deferment is requested. Each petition shall be 
accompanied by a $25 nonrefundable service charge.
    (b) If the petition is based upon the denial of a right-of-way, it 
must state the nature and ownership of the land or claim thereto over 
which it is necessary to obtain a right-of-way in order to reach the 
surrounded claims, and the land description thereof by legal 
subdivisions if the land is surveyed, and give full details as to why 
present use of the right-of-way is denied or prevented and as to the 
steps which have been taken to acquire the right to use it. The petition 
should state whether any other right-of-way is available and if so, give 
reasons why it is not feasible or desirable to use that right-of-way.
    (c) If the petition is based on other legal impediments, they must 
be set out and their effect described in detail.

[35 FR 9753, June 13, 1970, as amended at 53 FR 48882, Dec. 2, 1988; 59 
FR 44863, Aug. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 3852.3  Notice of action on petition to be recorded.

    The claimant shall file or record, in the local recording office in 
which the notice of petition for deferment was filed or recorded, a copy 
of the order or decision of the BLM authorized officer disposing of the 
petition.

[59 FR 44864, Aug. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 3852.4  Period for which deferment may be granted.

    If the showing made is satisfactory, the authorized officer of the 
Bureau of Land Management will grant a deferment for an initial period 
not exceeding one year. The period shall begin on the date requested in 
the petition unless the approval sets a different date. Upon petition, 
the one year period may be renewed for another year if justifiable 
conditions exist. If the conditions justifying deferment are removed 
prior to the specified termination date of the deferment period, the 
deferment shall automatically be ended as of such earlier date.


<R05>
Sec. 3852.5  When deferred assessment work is to be done.

    All deferred assessment work may be begun at any time after the 
termination of the deferment but must be completed not later than the 
end of the assessment year commencing after the removal or cessation of 
the causes for the deferment or the expiration of any deferments granted 
under the act and shall be in addition to the annual assessment work 
required by law for such year.

<R05>
Sec. 3861.1  Surveys of mining claims.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.1-1  Application for survey.

    The claimant is required, in the first place, to have a correct 
survey of his claim made under authority of the proper cadastral 
engineer, such survey to show with accuracy the exterior surface 
boundaries of the claim, which boundaries are required to be distinctly 
marked by monuments on the ground. He is required to have a correct 
survey where patent is applied for and where the mining claim is in vein 
or lode formation, or covers lands not surveyed in accordance with the 
U.S. system of rectangular surveys, or where the mining claim fails to 
conform with the legal subdivisions of the federal surveys. Application 
for authorization of survey should be made to the appropriate land 
office (see Sec. 1821.2-1 of this chapter).

[Circ. 2220, 31 FR 16785, Dec. 31, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 3861.1-2  Survey must be made subsequent to recording notice of location.

    The survey and plat of mineral claims required to be filed in the 
proper office with application for patent must be made subsequent to the 
recording of the location of the claim (if the laws of the State or the 
regulations of the mining district require the notice of location to be 
recorded), and when the original location is made by survey of a mineral 
surveyor such location survey cannot be substituted for that required by 
the statute, as above indicated. All matters relating to the duties of 
mineral surveyors, and to the field and office procedure to be observed 
in the execution of mineral surveys, are set forth in Chapter X of the 
Manual of Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands of the United 
States, 1947.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.1-3  Plats and field notes of mineral surveys.

    When the patent is issued, one copy of the plat and field notes 
shall accompany the patent and be delivered to the patentee.

[[Page 762]]


<R05>
Sec. 3861.2  Surveys: Specific.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.2-1  Particulars to be observed in mineral surveys.

    (a) The following particulars should be observed in the survey of 
every mining claim:
    (1) The exterior boundaries of the claim, the number of feet claimed 
along the vein, and, as nearly as can be ascertained, the direction of 
the vein, and the number of feet claimed on the vein in each direction 
from the point of discovery or other well-defined place on the claim 
should be represented on the plat of survey and in the field notes.
    (2) The intersection of the lines of the survey with the lines of 
conflicting prior surveys should be noted in the field notes and 
represented upon the plat.
    (3) Conflicts with unsurveyed claims, where the applicant for survey 
does not claim the area in conflict, should be shown by actual survey.
    (4) The total area of the claim embraced by the exterior boundaries 
should be stated, and also the area in conflict with each intersecting 
survey, substantially as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   Acres
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total area of claim.............................................   10.50
Area in conflict with survey No. 302............................    1.56
Area in conflict with survey No. 948............................    2.33
Area in conflict with Mountain Maid lode mining claim,              1.48
 unsurveyed.....................................................
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) It does not follow that because mining surveys are required to 
exhibit all conflicts with prior surveys the area of conflict with prior 
surveys the area of conflict are to be excluded. The field notes and 
plat are made a part of the application for patent, and care should be 
taken that the description does not inadvertently exclude portions 
intended to be retained. The application for patent should state the 
portions to be excluded in express terms.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.2-2  Certificate of expenditures and improvements.

    (a) The claimant at the time of filing the application for patent, 
or at any time within the 60 days of publication, is required to file 
with the authorized officer a certificate of the office cadastral 
engineer that not less than $500 worth of labor has been expended or 
improvements made, by the applicant or his grantors, upon each location 
embraced in the application, or if the application embraces several 
contiguous locations held in common, that an amount equal to $500 for 
each location has been so expended upon, and for the benefit of, the 
entire group; that the plat filed by the claimant is correct; that the 
field notes of the survey, as filed, furnish such an accurate 
description of the claim as will, if incorporation in a patent, serve to 
identify the premises fully, and that such reference is made therein to 
natural objects or permanent monuments as will perpetuate and fix the 
locus thereof.
    (b) In case of a lode and mill-site claim in the same survey the 
expenditure of $500 must be shown upon the lode claim.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.2-3  Mineral surveyor's report of expenditures and improvements.

    (a) In the mineral surveyor's report of the value of the 
improvements all actual expenditures and mining improvements made by the 
claimant or his grantors, having a direct relation to the development of 
the claim, must be included in the estimate.
    (b) The expenditures required may be made from the surface or in 
running a tunnel, drifts, or crosscuts for the development of the claim. 
Expenditures for drill holes for the purpose of prospecting and securing 
data upon which further development of a group of lode mining claims 
held in common may be based are available toward meeting the statutory 
provision requiring an expenditure of $500 as a basis for patent as to 
all of the claims of the group situated in close proximity to such 
common improvement. Improvements of any other character, such as 
buildings, machinery, or roadways, must be excluded from the estimate, 
unless it is shown clearly that they are associated with actual 
excavations, such as cuts, tunnels, shafts, etc., are essential to the 
practical development of and actually facilitate the extraction of 
mineral from the claim.
    (c) Improvements made by a former locator who has abandoned his 
claim cannot be included in the estimate, but

[[Page 763]]

should be described and located in the notes and plat.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.2-4  Supplemental proof of expenditures and improvements.

    If the value of the labor and improvements upon a mineral claim is 
less than $500 at the time of survey the mineral surveyor may file with 
the cadastral engineer supplemental proof showing $500 expenditure made 
prior to the expiration of the period of publication.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.2-5  Amended mineral surveys.

    (a) Inasmuch as amended surveys are ordered only by special 
instructions from the Bureau of Land Management, and the conditions and 
circumstances peculiar to each separate case and the object sought by 
the required amendment, alone govern all special matters relative to the 
manner of making such survey and the form and subject matter to be 
embraced in the field notes thereof, but few general rules applicable to 
all cases can be laid down.
    (b) The expense of amended surveys, including amendment of plat and 
field notes, and office work in the Bureau of Land Management office 
will be borne by the claimant.
    (c) The amended survey must be made in strict conformity with, or be 
embraced within, the lines of the original survey. If the amended and 
original surveys are identical, that fact must be clearly and distinctly 
stated in the field notes. If not identical, a bearing and distance must 
be given from each established corner of the amended survey to the 
corresponding corner of the original survey. The lines of the original 
survey, as found upon the ground, must be laid down upon the preliminary 
plat in such manner as to contrast and show their relation to the lines 
of the amended survey.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.3  Mineral surveyors.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.3-1  Extent of duties.

    The duty of a mineral surveyor in any particular case ceases when he 
has executed the survey and returned the field notes and preliminary 
plat, with his report, to the cadastral engineer. He will not be allowed 
to prepare for the mining claimant the papers in support of his 
application for patent. He is not permitted to combine the duties of 
surveyor and notary public in the same case by administering oaths. It 
is preferable that both preliminary and final oaths of assistants should 
be taken before some officer duly authorized to administer oaths, other 
than the mineral surveyor. In cases, however, where great delay, 
expense, or inconvenience would result from a strict compliance with 
this section, the mineral surveyor is authorized to administer the 
necessary oaths to his assistants, but in each case where this is done, 
he will submit to the proper cadastral engineer a full written report of 
the circumstances which required his stated action; otherwise he must 
have absolutely nothing to do with the case, except in his official 
capacity as surveyor. He will not employ field assistants interested 
therein in any manner.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.3-2  Assistants.

    The employing of claimants, their attorneys, or parties in interest, 
as assistants in making surveys of mineral claims will not be allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.4  Contract for surveys.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.4-1  Payment.

    (a) The claimant is required, in all cases, to make satisfactory 
arrangements with the surveyor for the payment for his services and 
those of his assistants in making the survey, as the United States will 
not be held responsible for the same.
    (b) The state director has no jurisdiction to settle differences 
relative to the payment of charges for field work, between mineral 
surveyors and claimants. These are matters of private contract and must 
be enforced in the ordinary manner, i.e., in the local courts. The 
Department has, however, authority to investigate charges affecting the 
official actions of mineral surveyors, and will, on sufficient cause 
shown, suspend or revoke their appointment.

Sec. 3861.5  Appointment and employment of mineral surveyors.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.5-1  Appointment.

    Pursuant to section 2334 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 39), the 
Director or his delegate will appoint only a sufficient number of 
surveyors for the survey of mining claims to meet the demand for that 
class of work. Each appointee shall qualify as prescribed by the 
Director or his delegate. Applications for appointment as a mineral 
surveyor may be made at any office of the Bureau of Land Management 
listed in Sec. 1821.2-1 of these regulations. A roster of appointed 
mineral surveyors will be available at these offices. Each appointee may 
execute mineral surveys in any State where mineral surveys are 
authorized.

[38 FR 30001, Oct. 31, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 3861.5-2  Employment.

    A mineral claimant may employ any United States mineral surveyor 
qualified as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section to make the 
survey of his claim. All expenses of the survey of mining claims and the 
publication of the required notices of application for patent are to be 
borne by the mining claimants.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.6  Plats and notices.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.6-1  Payment of charges of the public survey office.

    With regard to the platting of the claim and other office work in 
the Bureau of Land Management office, including the preparation of the 
copies of the plat and field notes to be furnished the claimant, that 
office will make an estimate of the cost thereof, which amount the 
claimant will deposit with it to be passed to the credit of the fund 
created by ``Deposits by Individuals for Surveying Public Lands.''


<R05>
Sec. 3861.7  Posting.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.7-1  Plat and notice to be posted on claim.

    The claimant is required to post a copy of the plat of survey in a 
conspicuous place upon the claim, together with notice of his intention 
to apply for a patent therefor, which notice will give the date of 
posting, the name of the claimant, the name of the claim, the number of 
the survey, the mining district and county, and the names of adjoining 
and conflicting claims as shown by the plat of survey.


<R05>
Sec. 3861.7-2  Proof of posting on the claim.

    After posting the said plat and notice upon the premises the 
claimant will file with the proper manager two copies of such plat and 
the field notes of survey of the claim, accompanied by two copies of the 
statement of at least two credible witnesses that such plat and notice 
are posted conspicuously upon the claim, giving the date and place of 
such posting, and two copies of the notice so posted to be attached to 
and form a part of said statement.

    Source: 35 FR 9756, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.1  Lode claim patent applications: General.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.1-1  Application for patent.

    (a) At the time the proof of posting is filed the claimant must file 
in duplicate an application for patent showing that he has the 
possessory right to the claim, in virtue of a compliance by himself (and 
by his grantors, if he claims by purchase) with the mining rules, 
regulations, and customs of the mining district or State in which the 
claim lies, and with the mining laws of Congress, such statement to 
narrate briefly, but as clearly as possible, the facts constituting such 
compliance, the origin of his possession, and the basis of his claim to 
a patent. The application should contain a full description of the kind 
and character of the vein or lode and should state whether ore has been 
extracted therefrom; and if so, in what amount and of what value. It 
should also show the precise place within the limits of each of the 
locations embraced in the application where the vein or lode has been 
exposed or discovered and the width thereof. The showing in these 
regards should

[[Page 765]]

contain sufficient data to enable representatives of the Government to 
confirm the same by examination in the field and also enable the Bureau 
of Land Management to determine whether a valuable deposit of mineral 
actually exists within the limits of each of the locations embraced in 
the application.
    (b) Every application for patent, based on a mining claim located 
after August 1, 1946, shall state whether the claimant has or has not 
had any direct or indirect part in the development of the atomic bomb 
project. The application must set forth in detail the exact nature of 
the claimant's participation in the project, and must also state whether 
as a result of such participation he acquired any confidential, official 
information as to the existence of deposits of uranium, thorium, or 
other fissionable source materials in the lands covered by his 
application.
    (c) In applying for patent to a mining claim embracing land lying 
partly within one proper office and partly within another, a full set of 
papers must be filed in each office, except that one abstract of title 
and one proof of patent expenditures will be sufficient. Only one 
newspaper publication and one posting on the claim will be required, but 
proof thereof must be filed in both offices, the statements as to 
posting plat and notice on the claim to be signed within the respective 
land districts, as well, also, as all of the other statements required 
in mineral patent proceedings, except such as, under the law, may be 
signed outside of the land district wherein the land applied for is 
situated. Publication, payment of fees, and the purchase price of the 
land will be further governed by the provisions of Secs. 1823.4(a) and 
1861.2 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.1-2  Service charge.

    Each Mineral Patent Application shall be accompanied by a 
nonrefundable service charge of $250 per application and the initial 
mining claim or site plus $50 for each additional mining claim or site 
contained within the application.

[54 FR 48882, Dec. 2, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 3862.1-3  Evidence of title.

    (a) Each patent application must be supported by either a 
certificate of title or an abstract of title certified to by the legal 
custodian of the records of locations and transfers of mining claims or 
by an abstracter of titles. The certificate of title or certificate to 
an abstract of title must be by a person, association, or corporation 
authorized by the State laws to execute such a certificate and 
acceptable to the Bureau of Land Management.
    (b) A certificate of title must conform substantially to a form 
approved by the Director.
    (c) Each certificate of title or abstract of title must be 
accompanied by single copies of the certificate or notice of the 
original location of each claim, and of the certificates of amended or 
supplemental locations thereof, certified to by the legal custodian of 
the record of mining locations.
    (d) A certificate to an abstract of title must state that the 
abstract is a full, true, and complete abstract of the location 
certificates or notices, and all amendments thereof, and of all deeds, 
instruments, or actions appearing of record purporting to convey or to 
affect the title to each claim.
    (e) The application for patent will be received and filed if the 
certificate of title or an abstract is brought down to a day reasonably 
near the date of the presentation of the application and shows full 
title in the applicant, who must as soon as practicable thereafter file 
a supplemental certificate of title or an abstract brought down so as to 
include the date of the filing of the application.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.1-4  Evidence relating to destroyed or lost records.

    In the event of the mining records in any case having been destroyed 
by fire or otherwise lost, a statement of the fact should be made, and 
secondary evidence of possessory title will be received, which may 
consist of the statement of the claimant, supported by those of any 
other parties cognizant of the facts relative to his location, 
occupancy, possession, improvements, etc.; and in such case of lost 
records, any deeds, certificates of location or purchase, or other 
evidence which may be

[[Page 766]]

in the claimant's possession and tend to establish his claim, should be 
filed.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.1-5  Statement required that land is unreserved, unoccupied, unimproved, and unappropriated.

    Each person making application for patent under the mining laws, for 
lands in Alaska, must furnish a duly corroborated statement showing that 
no portion of the land applied for is occupied or reserved by the United 
States, so as to prevent its acquisition under said laws; that the land 
is not occupied or claimed by natives of Alaska; and that the land is 
unoccupied, unimproved and unappropriated by any person claiming the 
same other than the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.2  Citizenship.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.2-1  Citizenship of corporations and of associations acting through agents.

    The proof necessary to establish the citizenship of applicants for 
mining patents must be made in the following manner: In case of an 
incorporated company, a certified copy of its charter or certificate of 
incorporation must be filed. In case of an association of persons 
unincorporated, the statement of their duly authorized agent, made upon 
his own knowledge or upon information and belief, setting forth the 
residence of each person forming such association, must be submitted. 
This statement must be accompanied by a power of attorney from the 
parties forming such association, authorizing the person who makes the 
citizenship showing to act for them in the matter of their application 
of patent.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.2-2  Citizenship of individuals.

    (a) In case of an individual or an association of individuals who do 
not appear by their duly authorized agent, the statement of each 
applicant, showing whether he is a native or naturalized citizen, when 
and where born, and his residence, will be required.
    (b) In case an applicant has declared his intention to become a 
citizen or has been naturalized, his statement must show the date, 
place, and the court before which he declared his intention, or from 
which his certificate of citizenship issued, and present residence.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.2-3  Trustee to disclose nature of trust.

    Any party applying for patent as trustee must disclose fully the 
nature of the trust and the name of the cestui que trust; and such 
trustee, as well as the beneficiaries, must furnish satisfactory proof 
of citizenship; and the names of beneficiaries, as well as that of the 
trustee, must be inserted in the final certificate of entry.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.3  Possessory rights.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.3-1  Right by occupancy.

    (a) The provisions of R.S. 2332 (30 U.S.C. 38), greatly lessen the 
burden of proof, more especially in the case of old claims located many 
years since, the records of which, in many cases, have been destroyed by 
fire, or lost in other ways during the lapse of time, but concerning the 
possessory right to which all controversy or litigation has long been 
settled.
    (b) When an applicant desires to make his proof of possessory right 
in accordance with this provision of law, he will not be required to 
produce evidence of location, copies of conveyances, or abstracts of 
title, as in other cases, but will be required to furnish a duly 
certified copy of the statute of limitation of mining claims for the 
State, together with his statement giving a clear and succinct narration 
of the facts as to the origin of his title, and likewise as to the 
continuation of his possession of the mining ground covered by his 
application; the area thereof; the nature and extent of the mining that 
has been done thereon; whether there has been any opposition to his 
possession, or litigation with regard to his claim, and if so, when the 
same ceased; whether such cessation was caused by compromise or by 
judicial decree, and any additional facts within the claimant's 
knowledge having a direct bearing upon his possession and bona fides 
which he may desire to submit in support of his claim.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.3-2  Certificate of court required.

    There should likewise be filed a certificate, under seal of the 
court having jurisdiction of mining cases within the judicial district 
embracing the claim,

[[Page 767]]

that no suit or action of any character whatever involving the right of 
possession to any portion of the claim applied for is pending, and that 
there has been no litigation before said court affecting the title to 
said claim or any part thereof for a period equal to the time fixed by 
the statute of limitations for mining claims in the State as aforesaid 
other than that which has been finally decided in favor of the claimant.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.3-3  Corroborative proof required.

    The claimant should support his narrative of facts relative to his 
possession, occupancy, and improvements by corroborative testimony of 
any disinterested person or persons of credibility who may be cognizant 
of the facts in the case and are capable of testifying understandingly 
in the premises.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.4  Publication of notice.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.4-1  Newspaper publication.

    Upon the receipt of applications for mineral patent and accompanying 
papers, if no reason appears for rejecting the application, the 
authorized officer will, at the expense of the claimant (who must 
furnish the agreement of the publisher to hold applicant for patent 
alone responsible for charges of publication), publish a notice of such 
application for the period of 60 days in a newspaper published nearest 
to the claim. If the notice is published in a daily paper, it shall be 
published in the Wednesday issue for nine consecutive weeks; if weekly, 
in nine consecutive issues; if semiweekly or triweekly, in the issue of 
the same day of each week for nine consecutive weeks. In all cases the 
first day of issues shall be excluded in estimating the period of 60 
days.

<R05>
Sec. 3862.4-2  Contents of published notice.

    The notices published as required by the preceding section must 
embrace all the data given in the notice posted upon the claim. In 
addition to such data the published notice must further indicate the 
locus of the claim by giving the connecting line, as shown by the field 
notes and plat, between a corner of the claim and a United States 
mineral monument or a corner of the public survey, and thence the 
boundaries of the claim by courses and distances.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.4-3  Authorized officer to designate newspaper.

    The authorized officer shall have the notice of application for 
patent published in a paper of established character and general 
circulation, to be by him designated as being the newspaper published 
nearest the land.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.4-4  Charges for publication.

    (a) The charge for the publication of notice of application for 
patent in a mining case in all districts shall not exceed the legal 
rates allowed by the laws of the several States for the publication of 
legal notices wherein the notice is published.
    (b) It is expected that these notices shall not be so abbreviated as 
to curtail the description essential to a perfect notice, and on the 
other hand that they shall not be of unnecessary length. The printed 
matter must be set solid without paragraphing or any display in the 
heading and shall be in the usual body type used in legal notices. If 
other type is used, no allowance will be made for additional space on 
that account. The number of solid lines only used in advertising by 
actual count will be allowed. All abbreviations and copy must be 
strictly followed. The following is a sample of advertisement set up in 
accordance with Government requirements and contains all the essential 
data necessary for publication:

    M. A. No. 04421, U. S. Land Office, Elko, Nevada, October 5, 1921.

Manager.

    (c) For the publication of citations in contests or hearings, 
involving the character of lands, the charges may not exceed the rates 
provided for similar notices by the law of the State.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.4-5  Proof by applicant of publication and posting.

    After the 60-day period of newspaper publication has expired, the 
claimant will furnish from the office of publication a sworn statement 
that the notice was published for the statutory period, giving the first 
and last day of such publication, and his own statement showing that the 
plat and notice aforesaid remained conspicuously posted upon the claim 
sought to be patented during said 60-day publication, giving the dates.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.4-6  Payment of purchase price and statement of charges and fees.

    Upon the filing of the statement required by the preceding section, 
the authorized officer will, if no adverse claim was filed in his office 
during the period of publication, and no other objection appears, permit 
the claimant to pay for the land to which he is entitled at the rate of 
$5 for each acre and $5 for each fractional part of an acre, except as 
otherwise provided by law, issuing the usual receipt therefor. The 
claimant will also make a statement of all charges and fees paid by him 
for publication and surveys, together with all fees and money paid the 
authorized officer of the proper office, and a patent shall be issued 
thereon if found regular.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.5  Entry and transfers.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.5-1  Allowance of entry; transfers subsequent to application not recognized.

    No entry will be allowed until the authorized officer has satisfied 
himself, by careful examination, that proper proofs have been filed upon 
the points indicated in the law and official regulations. Transfers made 
subsequent to the filing of the application for patent will not be 
considered, but entry will be allowed and patent issued in all cases in 
the name of the applicant for patent, the title conveyed by the patent, 
of course, in each instance inuring to the transferee of such applicant 
where a transfer has been made pending the application for patent.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.6  Diligent prosecution.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.6-1  Failure to prosecute application with diligence.

    The failure of an applicant for patent to a mining claim to 
prosecute his application to completion, by filing the necessary proofs 
and making payment for the land, within a reasonable time after the 
expiration of the period of publication of notice of the application, or 
after the termination of adverse proceedings in the courts, constitutes 
a waiver by the applicant of all rights obtained by the earlier 
proceedings upon the application.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.7  Application processing upon contest or protest.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.7-1  Resumption of patent proceedings after suspension due to adverse claim or protest.

    The proceedings necessary to the completion of an application for 
patent to a mining claim, against which an adverse claim or protest has 
been filed, if taken by the applicant at the first opportunity afforded 
therefor under the law and departmental practice, will be as effective 
as if taken at the date when, but for the adverse claim or protest, the 
proceedings on the application could have been completed.

<R05>
Sec. 3862.8  Patents for mining claims.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.8-1  Land descriptions in patents.

    The land description in a patent for a lode mining claim, for a 
millsite, or for a placer claim not consisting of legal subdivisions, 
shall hereafter consist of the names and survey numbers of the claims 
being patented and those being excluded, or of the names of the excluded 
claims if they are unsurveyed, or of the legal subdivisions of excluded 
land covered by homestead or other nonmineral entry. The land 
description shall refer to the field notes of survey and the plat 
thereof for a more particular description and the patent shall expressly 
make them a part thereof. Where shown by the mineral entry the patent 
shall give the actual or approximate legal subdivision, section, 
township and range, the name of the county and of the mining district, 
if any, wherein the claims are situated. A copy of the plat and field 
notes of each mineral survey patented will be furnished to the patentee.


<R05>
Sec. 3862.9  Public availability of information.

    (a) All data and information concerning Federal and Indian minerals 
submitted under this part 3860 are subject to part 2 of this title. Part 
2 of this title includes the regulations of the Department of the 
Interior covering the public disclosure of data and information 
contained in Department of the Interior records. Certain mineral 
information not protected from public disclosure under part 2 of this 
title may be made available for inspection without a Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) request.
    (b) When you submit data and information under this part 3860 that 
you believe to be exempt from disclosure to the public, you must clearly 
mark each page that you believe includes confidential information. BLM 
will keep all data and information confidential to the extent allowed by 
Sec. 2.13(c) of this title.

          Subpart 3863--Placer Mining Claim Patent Applications

    Source: 35 FR 9758, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3863.1  Placer mining claim patent applications: General.

    (a) The proceedings to obtain patents for placer claims, including 
all forms of mineral deposits excepting veins of quartz or other rock in 
place, are similar to the proceedings prescribed for obtaining patents 
for vein or lode claims; but where a placer claim shall be upon surveyed 
lands, and conforms to legal subdivisions, no further survey or plat 
will be required. Where placer claims cannot be conformed to legal 
subdivisions, survey and plat shall be made as on unsurveyed lands.
    (b) The price of placer claims is fixed at $2.50 per acre or 
fractional part of an acre.


<R05>
Sec. 3863.1-1  Application for patent.


<R05>
Sec. 3863.1-2  Proof of improvements for patent.

    The proof of improvements must show their value to be not less than 
$500 and that they were made by the applicant for patent or his 
grantors. This proof should consist of the statement of two or more 
disinterested witnesses.


<R05>
Sec. 3863.1-3  Data to be filed in support of application.

    (a) In placer applications, in addition to the recitals necessary in 
and to both vein or lode and placer applications, the placer application 
should contain, in detail, such data as will support the claim that the 
land applied for is placer ground containing valuable mineral deposits 
not in vein or lode formation and that title is sought not to control 
water courses or to obtain valuable timber but in good faith because of 
the mineral therein. This statement, of course, must depend upon the 
character of the deposit and the natural features of the ground, but the 
following details should be covered as fully as possible: If the claim 
be for a deposit of placer gold, there must be stated the yield per pan, 
or cubic yard,

[[Page 770]]

as shown by prospecting and development work, distance to bedrock, 
formation and extent of the deposit, and all other facts upon which he 
bases his allegation that the claim is valuable for its deposits of 
placer gold. If it be a building stone or other deposit than gold 
claimed under the placer laws, he must describe fully the kind, nature, 
and extent of the deposit, stating the reasons why same is by him 
regarded as a valuable mineral claim. He will also be required to 
describe fully the natural features of the claim; streams, if any, must 
be fully described as to their course, amount of water carried, fall 
within the claim; and he must state kind and amount of timber and other 
vegetation thereon and adaptability to mining or other uses.
    (b) If the claim be all placer ground, that fact must be stated in 
the application and corroborated by accompanying proofs; if of mixed 
placers and lodes, it should be so set out, with a description of all 
known lodes situated within the boundaries of the claim. A specific 
declaration, such as is required by R.S. 2333 (30 U.S.C. 37) must be 
furnished as to each lode intended to be claimed. All other known lodes 
are, by the silence of the applicant, excluded by law from all claim by 
him, of whatsoever nature, possessory or otherwise.
    (c) While these data are required as a part of the mineral 
surveyor's report in case of placers taken by special survey, it is 
proper that the application for patent incorporate these facts.
    (d) Inasmuch as in case of claims taken by legal subdivisions, no 
report by a mineral surveyor is required, the claimant, in his 
application in addition to the data above required, should describe in 
detail the shafts, cuts, tunnels, or other workings claimed as 
improvements, giving their dimensions, value, and the course and 
distance thereof to the nearest corner of the public surveys.
    (e) The statement as to the description and value of the 
improvements must be corroborated by the statements of two disinterested 
witnesses. The proof showing must be made in duplicate. See 51 L.D. 265 
and 52 L.D. 190.
    (f) Applications awaiting entry, whether published or not, must be 
made to conform to this part, with respect to proof as to the character 
of the land. Entries already made will be suspended for such additional 
proofs as may be deemed necessary in each case.


<R05>
Sec. 3863.1-4  Applications for placers containing known lodes.

    Applicants for patent to a placer claim, who are also in possession 
of a known vein or lode included therein, must state in their 
application that the placer includes such vein or lode. The published 
and posted notices must also include such statement. If veins or lodes 
lying within placer locations are owned by other parties, the fact 
should be distinctly stated in the application for patent and in all the 
notices. But in all cases whether the lode is claimed or excluded, it 
must be surveyed and marked upon the plat, the field notes and plat 
giving the area of the lode claim or claims and the area of the placer 
separately. An application which omits to claim such known vein or lode 
must be construed as a conclusive declaration that the applicant has no 
right of possession to the vein or lode. Where there is no known lode or 
vein, the fact must appear by the statement of two or more witnesses.

<R05>
Sec. 3864.1  Millsite patents: General.


<R05>
Sec. 3864.1-1  Application for patent.

    (a) Land entered as a millsite must be shown to be nonmineral. 
Millsites are simply auxiliary to the working of mineral claims. R.S. 
2337 (30 U.S.C. 42) provides for the patenting of millsites.
    (b) To avail themselves of this provision of law, parties holding 
the possessory right to a vein or lode claim, and to a piece of 
nonmineral land not contiguous thereto for mining or milling purposes, 
not exceeding the quantity allowed for such purpose by R.S. 2337, or 
prior laws, under which the land was appropriated, the proprietors of 
such vein or lode may file in the proper office their application for a 
patent, which application, together

[[Page 771]]

with the plat and field notes, may include, embrace, and describe, in 
addition to the vein or lode claim, such noncontiguous millsite, and 
after due proceedings as to notice, etc., a patent will be issued 
conveying the same as one claim. The owner of a patented lode may, by an 
independent application, secure a millsite, if good faith is manifest in 
its use or occupation in connection with the lode and no adverse claim 
exists.
    (c) The Act of March 18, 1960 (74 Stat. 7; 43 U.S.C. 42(b)), amends 
R.S. 2337 to allow the holders of possessory right in a placer claim to 
hold nonmineral land for mining, milling, processing beneficiation, or 
other operations in connection with the placer claim. Applications for 
patent for such millsites are subject to the same requirements as to 
survey and notice as one applicable to placer mining claims. No one 
millsite may exceed five acres and payment will be $2.50 per acre or 
fraction thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 3864.1-2  Millsites applied for in conjunction with a lode claim.

    Where the original survey includes a lode claim and also a millsite 
the lode claim should be described in the plat and field notes as ``Sur. 
No. 37, A,'' and the millsite as ``Sur. No. 37, B,'' or whatever may be 
its appropriate numerical designation; the course and distance from a 
corner of the millsite to a corner of the lode claim to be invariably 
given in such plat and field notes, and a copy of the plat and notice of 
application for patent must be conspicuously posted upon the millsite as 
well as upon the vein or lode claim for the statutory period of 60 days. 
In making the entry no separate receipt or certificate need be issued 
for the millsite, but the whole area of both lode and millsite will be 
embraced in one entry, the price being $5 for each acre and fractional 
part of an acre embraced by such lode and millsite claim.


<R05>
Sec. 3864.1-3  Millsites for quartz mills or reduction works.

    In case the owner of a quartz mill or reduction works is not the 
owner or claimant of a vein or lode claim the law permits him to make 
application therefor in the same manner prescribed for mining claims, 
and after due notice and proceedings, in the absence of a valid adverse 
filing, to enter and receive a patent for his millsite at the price 
named in the preceding section.


<R05>
Sec. 3864.1-4  Proof of nonmineral character.

    In every case there must be satisfactory proof that the land claimed 
as a millsite is not mineral in character, which proof may, where the 
matter is unquestioned, consist of the statement of two or more persons 
capable, from acquaintance with the land to testify understandingly.

                      Subpart 3871--Adverse Claims

    Source: 35 FR 9759, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3871.1  Filing of claim.

    (a) An adverse claim must be filed with the authorized officer of 
the proper office where the application for patent is filed or with the 
manager of the

[[Page 772]]

district in which the land is situated at the time of filing the adverse 
claim. The claim may be filed by the adverse claimant, or by his duly 
authorized agent or attorney in fact cognizant of the facts stated.
    (b) Where an agent or attorney in fact files the adverse claim he 
must furnish proof that he is such agent or attorney.
    (c) The agent or attorney in fact must sign the statement of the 
adverse claim within the land district where the claim is situated, 
stating that it was so signed.
    (d) A fee of $10 is payable by an adverse claimant at the time of 
filing his adverse claim. This charge is not refundable.


<R05>
Sec. 3871.2  Statement of claim.

    (a) The adverse claim must fully set forth the nature and extent of 
the interference or conflict; whether the adverse party claims as a 
purchaser for valuable consideration or as a locator. If the former, a 
certified copy of the original location, the original conveyance, a duly 
certified copy thereof, or an abstract of title from the office of the 
proper recorder should be furnished, or if the transaction was a merely 
verbal one he will narrate the circumstances attending the purchase, the 
date thereof, and the amount paid, which facts should be supported by 
the statement of one or more witnesses, if any were present at the time, 
and if he claims as a locator he must file a duly certified copy of the 
location from the office of the proper recorder.
    (b) In order that the ``boundaries'' and ``extent'' of the claim may 
be shown, it will be incumbent upon the adverse claimant to file a plat 
showing his entire claim, its relative situation or position with the 
one against which he claims, and the extent of the conflict: Provided, 
however, That if the application for patent describes the claim by legal 
subdivisions, the adverse claimant, if also claiming by legal 
subdivisions, may describe his adverse claim in the same manner without 
further survey or plat. If the claim is not described by legal 
subdivisions it will generally be more satisfactory if the plat thereof 
is made from an actual survey by a mineral surveyor and its correctness 
officially certified thereon by him.


<R05>
Sec. 3871.3  Action by authorized officer.

    (a) Upon the adverse claim being filed within the 60-day period of 
publication, the authorized officer will immediately give notice in 
writing to the parties that such adverse claim has been filed, informing 
them that the party who filed the adverse claim will be required within 
30 days from the date of such filing to commence proceedings in a court 
of competent jurisdiction to determine the question of right of 
possession, and to prosecute the same with reasonable diligence to final 
judgment, and that should such adverse claimant fail to do so, his 
adverse claim will be considered waived and the application for patent 
be allowed to proceed upon its merits.
    (b) The Act of September 21, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-260; 75 Stat. 541), 
amends the Act of June 7, 1910 (36 Stat. 459; 48 U.S.C. 386), and 
provides that adverse suits against mineral entries in Alaska shall be 
instituted within the 60-day time limit set forth in R.S. 2325 and 2326, 
(30 U.S.C. 29, 30). The act further provides that where a mineral patent 
application was filed prior to the effective date of the act, the time 
in which to file adverse suits is governed by the Act of June 7, 1910. 
Where a mineral patent application was filed prior to September 21, 
1961, the entry will not be allowed until after the expiration of eight 
months following the publication period.


<R05>
Sec. 3871.4  Patent proceedings stayed when adverse claim is filed; exception.

    When an adverse claim is filed as aforesaid, the authorized officer 
will endorse upon the same the precise date of filing and preserve a 
record of the date of notifications issued thereon; and thereafter all 
proceedings on the application for patent will be stayed with the 
exception of the completion of the publication and posting of notices 
and plat and the filing of the necessary proof thereof, until the 
controversy shall have been finally adjudicated in court or the adverse 
claim waiver or withdrawn.

[[Page 773]]


<R05>
Sec. 3871.5  Termination of adverse suit.

    (a) Where an adverse claim has been filed and suit thereon commenced 
within the statutory period and final judgment rendered determining the 
right of possession, it will not be sufficient to file with the 
authorized officer a certificate of the clerk of the court setting forth 
the facts as to such judgment, but the successful party must, before he 
is allowed to make entry, file a certified copy of the judgment roll, 
together with the other evidence required by R.S. 2326 (30 U.S.C. 30), 
and a certificate of the clerk of the court under the seal of the court 
showing, in accord with the record facts of the case, that the judgment 
mentioned and described in the judgment roll aforesaid is a final 
judgment; that the time for appeal therefrom has, under the law, 
expired, and that no such appeal has been filed, or that the defeated 
party has waived his right to appeal. Other evidence showing such waiver 
or an abandonment of the litigation may be filed.
    (b) Where such suit has been dismissed, a certificate of the clerk 
of the court to that effect or a certified copy of the order of 
dismissal will be sufficient.
    (c) After an adverse claim has been filed and suit commenced, a 
relinquishment or other evidence of abandonment of the adverse claim 
will not be accepted, but the case must be terminated and proof thereof 
furnished as required by the last two paragraphs.


<R05>
Sec. 3871.6  Certificate required when no suit commenced.

    Where an adverse claim has been filed but no suit commenced against 
the applicant for patent within the statutory period, a certificate to 
that effect by the clerk of the State court having jurisdiction in the 
case, and also by the clerk of the district court of the United States 
for the district in which the claim is situated, will be required.


<R04>
             Subpart 3872--Protests, Contests and Conflicts

    Source: 35 FR 9760, June 13, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3872.1  Protest against mineral applications.

    (a) At any time prior to the issuance of patent, protest may be 
filed against the patenting of the claim as applied for, upon any ground 
tending to show that the applicant has failed to comply with the law in 
any matter essential to a valid entry under the patent proceedings. Such 
protest cannot, however, be made the means of preserving a surface 
conflict lost by failure to adverse or lost by the judgment of the court 
in an adverse suit. One holding a present joint interest in a mineral 
location included in an application for patent who is excluded from the 
application, so that his interest would not be protected by the issue of 
patent thereon, may protest against the issuance of a patent as applied 
for, setting forth in such protest the nature and extent of his interest 
in such location, and such a protestant will be deemed a party in 
interest entitled to appeal. This results from the holding that a co-
owner excluded from an application for patent does not have an 
``adverse'' claim within the meaning of R.S. 2325 and 2326 (30 U.S.C. 
29, 30). (See Turner v. Sawyer, 150 U.S. 578-586, 37 L. ed. 1189-1191.)
    (b) Such protest filed by any party, other than a Federal agency, 
must be accompanied by a $10 nonrefundable service charge.


<R05>
Sec. 3872.2  Procedure in contest cases.

    Parts 1840 and 1850 of this chapter, in cases before the United 
States, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Department of the 
Interior will, so far as applicable, govern in all cases and proceedings 
arising in contests and hearings to determine the character of lands.

[[Page 774]]


<R05>
Sec. 3872.3  Presumption as to land returned as mineral.

    Public land returned upon the survey records as mineral shall be 
withheld from entry as agricultural land until the presumption arising 
from such a return shall be overcome.


<R05>
Sec. 3872.4  Procedure to dispute record character of land.

    (a) When lands returned as mineral are sought to be entered as 
agricultural under laws which require the submission of final proof 
after due notice by publication and posting, the filing of the proper 
nonmineral statement in the absence of allegations that the land is 
mineral will be deemed sufficient as a preliminary requirement. A 
satisfactory showing as to character of land must be made when final 
proof is submitted.
    (b) In case of application to enter, locate, or select such lands as 
agricultural, under laws in which the submission of final proof after 
due publication and posting is not required, notice thereof must first 
be given by publication for 60 days and posting in the local office 
during the same period, and affirmative proof as to the character of the 
land submitted. In the absence of allegations that the land is mineral, 
and upon compliance with this requirement, the entry location, or 
selection will be allowed, if otherwise regular.
    (c) Where as against the claimed right to enter such lands as 
agricultural it is alleged that the same are mineral, or are applied for 
as mineral lands, the proceedings in this class of cases will be in the 
nature of a contest, and the practice will be governed by the rules in 
force in contest cases.


<R05>
Sec. 3872.5  Testimony at hearings to determine character of lands.

    (a) At hearings to determine the character of lands the claimants 
and witnesses will be thoroughly examined with regard to the character 
of the land; whether the same has been thoroughly prospected; whether or 
not there exists within the tract or tracts claimed any lode or vein of 
quartz or other rock in place bearing gold, silver, cinnabar, lead, tin, 
copper, or other valuable deposit which has ever been claimed, located, 
recorded, or worked; whether such work is entirely abandoned, or whether 
occasionally resumed; if such lode does exist, by whom claimed, under 
what designation, and in which subdivision of the land it lies; whether 
any placer mine or mines exist upon the land; if so, what is the 
character thereof, whether of the shallow-surface description, or of the 
deep cement, blue lead, or gravel deposits; to what extent mining is 
carried on when water can be obtained, and what the facilities are for 
obtaining water for mining purposes; upon what particular 10-acre 
subdivisions mining has been done, and at what time the land was 
abandoned for mining purposes, if abandoned at all. In every case, where 
practicable, an adequate quantity or number of representative samples of 
the alleged mineral-bearing matter or material should be offered in 
evidence, with proper identification, to be considered in connection 
with the record, with which they will be transmitted upon each appeal 
that may be taken. Testimony may be submitted as to the geological 
formation and development of mineral on adjoining or adjacent lands and 
their relevancy.
    (b) The testimony should also show the agricultural capacities of 
the land, what kind of crops are raised thereon, the value thereof; the 
number of acres actually cultivated for crops of cereals or vegetables, 
and within which particular 10-acre subdivision such crops are raised; 
also which of these subdivisions embrace the improvements, giving in 
detail the extent and value of the improvements, such as house, barn, 
vineyard, orchard, fencing, etc., and mining improvements.
    (c) The testimony should be as full and complete as possible; and in 
addition to the leading points indicated above, where an attempt is made 
to prove the mineral character of lands which have been entered under 
the agricultural laws, it should show at what date, if at all, valuable 
deposits of minerals were first known to exist on the lands.

<R05>
Sec. 3873.1  Segregation of mineral from non-mineral land.

    Where a survey is necessary to set apart mineral from non-mineral 
land the appropriate authorized officer will have special instructions 
prepared outlining the procedure to be followed in the required survey. 
The survey will be executed at the expense of the United States. Where, 
in stock-raising homestead entries, it has been satisfactorily 
established that there are existent prior unpatented mining claims, the 
segregation of the latter is not strictly a segregation of mineral from 
non-mineral land, but rather the procedure adopted to define the 
boundaries of and provide a legal description for that part of the 
homestead entry which is not within the segregated mining claims.


<R05>
Sec. 3873.2  Effect of decision that land is mineral.

    The fact that a certain tract of land is decided upon testimony to 
the mineral in character is by no means equivalent to an award of the 
land to a miner. In order to secure a patent for such land, he must 
proceed as in other cases, in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3873.3  Non-mineral entry of residue of subdivisions invaded by mining claims.

    (a) The authorized officer will accept and approve any application 
(if otherwise regular), to make a non-mineral entry of the residue of 
any original lot or legal subdivision which is invaded by mining claims 
if the tract has already been lotted to exclude such claims. If not so 
lotted, and if the original lot or legal subdivision is invaded by 
patented mining claims, or by mining claims covered by pending 
applications for patent which the non-mineral applicant does not desire 
to contest, or by approved mining claims of established mineral 
character, the authorized officer will accept and approve the 
application (if otherwise regular), exclusive of the conflict with the 
mining claims.
    (b) The authorized officer will allow no non-mineral application for 
any portion of an original lot or 40-acre legal subdivision, where the 
tract has not been lotted to show the reduced area by reason of approved 
surveys of mining claims for which applications for patent have not been 
filed, until the non-mineral applicant submits a satisfactory showing 
that such surveyed claims are in fact mineral in character. Applications 
to have lands which are asserted to be mineral, or mining locations, 
segregated by survey with a view to the non-mineral appropriation of the 
remainder, will be made to the authorized officer of the proper office. 
Such applications must be supported by a written statement of the party 
in interest, duly corroborated by two or more disinterested persons, or 
by such other or further evidence as may be required, that the land 
sought to be segregated as mineral is in fact mineral in character.

(43 U.S.C. 315, 315a-315r).
    Active use means the current authorized use, including livestock 
grazing and conservation use. Active use may constitute a portion, or 
all, of permitted use. Active use does not include temporary nonuse or 
suspended use of forage within all or a portion of an allotment.
    Activity plan means a plan for managing a resource use or value to 
achieve specific objectives. For example, an allotment management plan 
is an activity plan for managing livestock grazing use to improve or 
maintain rangeland conditions.

[[Page 778]]

    Actual use means where, how many, what kind or class of livestock, 
and how long livestock graze on an allotment, or on a portion or pasture 
of an allotment.
    Actual use report means a report of the actual livestock grazing use 
submitted by the permittee or lessee.
    Affiliate means an entity or person that controls, is controlled by, 
or is under common control with, an applicant, permittee or lessee. The 
term ``control'' means having any relationship which gives an entity or 
person authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which 
an applicant, permittee or lessee conducts grazing operations.
    Allotment means an area of land designated and managed for grazing 
of livestock.
    Allotment management plan (AMP) means a documented program developed 
as an activity plan, consistent with the definition at 43 U.S.C. 
1702(k), that focuses on, and contains the necessary instructions for, 
the management of livestock grazing on specified public lands to meet 
resource condition, sustained yield, multiple use, economic and other 
objectives.
    Animal unit month (AUM) means the amount of forage necessary for the

Sec. 4110.2  Grazing preference.


<R05>
Sec. 4110.2-1  Base property.

    (a) The authorized officer shall find land or water owned or 
controlled by an applicant to be base property (see Sec. 4100.0-5) if:
    (1) It is capable of serving as a base of operation for livestock 
use of public lands within a grazing district; or
    (2) It is contiguous land, or, when no applicant owns or controls 
contiguous land, noncontiguous land that is capable of being used in 
conjunction with a livestock operation which would utilize public lands 
outside a grazing district.
    (b) After appropriate consultation, cooperation, and coordination, 
the authorized officer shall specify the length of time for which land 
base property shall be capable of supporting authorized livestock during 
the year, relative

[[Page 782]]

to the multiple use management objective of the public lands.
    (c) An applicant shall provide a legal description, or plat, of the 
base property and shall certify to the authorized officer that this base 
property meets the requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. A permittee's or lessee's interest in water previously 
recognized as base property on public land shall be deemed sufficient in 
meeting the requirement that the applicant control base property. Where 
such waters become unusable and are replaced by newly constructed or 
reconstructed water developments that are the subject of a range 
improvement permit or cooperative range improvement agreement, the 
permittee's or lessee's interest in the replacement water shall be 
deemed sufficient in meeting the requirement that the applicant control 
base property.
    (d) If a permittee or lessee loses ownership or control of all or 
part of his/her base property, the permit or lease, to the extent it was 
based upon such lost property, shall terminate immediately without 
further notice from the authorized officer. However, if, prior to losing 
ownership or control of the base property, the permittee or lessee 
requests, in writing, that the permit or lease be extended to the end of 
the grazing season or grazing year, the termination date may be extended 
as determined by the authorized officer after consultation with the new 
owner. When a permit or lease terminates because of a loss of ownership 
or control of a base property, the grazing preference shall remain with 
the base property and be available through application and transfer 
procedures at 43 CFR 4110.2-3, to the new owner or person in control of 
that base property.
    (e) Applicants who own or control base property contiguous to or 
cornering upon public land outside a grazing district where such public 
land consists of an isolated or disconnected tract embracing 760 acres 
or less shall, for a period of 90 days after the tract has been offered 
for lease, have a preference right to lease the whole tract.

<R05>
Sec. 4110.2-2  Specifying permitted use.

    (a) Permitted use is granted to holders of grazing preference and 
shall be specified in all grazing permits and leases. Permitted use 
shall encompass all authorized use including livestock use, any 
suspended use, and conservation use, except for permits and leases for 
designated ephemeral rangelands where livestock use is authorized based 
upon forage availability, or designated annual rangelands. Permitted 
livestock use shall be based upon the amount of forage available for 
livestock grazing as established in the land use plan, activity plan, or 
decision of the authorized officer under Sec. 4110.3-3, except, in the 
case of designated ephemeral or annual rangelands, a land use plan or 
activity plan may alternatively prescribe vegetation standards to be met 
in the use of such rangelands.
    (b) The permitted use specified shall attach to the base property 
supporting the grazing permit or grazing lease.
    (c) The animal unit months of permitted use attached to:
    (1) The acreage of land base property on a pro rata basis, or
    (2) Water base property on the basis of livestock forage production 
within the service area of the water.

Sec. 4110.2-3  Transfer of grazing preference.

    (a) Transfers of grazing preference in whole or in part are subject 
to the following requirements:
    (1) The transferee shall meet all qualifications and requirements of 
Secs. 4110.1, 4110.2-1, and 4110.2-2.
    (2) The transfer applications under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section shall evidence assignment of interest and obligation in range 
improvements authorized on public lands under Sec. 4120.3 and maintained 
in conjunction with the transferred preference (see Sec. 4120.3-5). The 
terms and conditions of the cooperative range improvement agreements and 
range improvement permits are binding on the transferee.
    (3) The transferee shall accept the terms and conditions of the 
terminating grazing permit or lease (see

[[Page 783]]

Sec. 4130.2) with such modifications as he may request which are 
approved by the authorized officer or with such modifications as may be 
required by the authorized officer.
    (4) The transferee shall file an application for a grazing permit or 
lease to the extent of the transferred preference simultaneously with 
filing a transfer application under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section.
    (b) If base property is sold or leased, the transferee shall within 
90 days of the date of sale or lease file with the authorized officer a 
properly executed transfer application showing the base property and the 
amount of permitted use being transferred in animal unit months.
    (c) If a grazing preference is being transferred from one base 
property to another base property, the transferor shall own or control 
the base property from which the grazing preference is being transferred 
and file with the authorized officer a properly completed transfer 
application for approval. If the applicant leases the base property, no 
transfer will be allowed without the written consent of the owner(s), 
and any person or entity holding an encumbrance of the base property 
from which the transfer is to be made. Such consent will not be required 
where the applicant for such transfer is a lessee without whose 
livestock operations the grazing preference would not have been 
established.
    (d) At the date of approval of a transfer, the existing grazing 
permit or lease shall terminate automatically and without notice to the 
extent of the transfer.
    (e) If an unqualified transferee acquires rights in base property 
through operation of law or testamentary disposition, such transfer will 
not affect the grazing preference or any outstanding grazing permit or 
lease, or preclude the issuance or renewal of a grazing permit or lease 
based on such property for a period of 2 years after the transfer. 
However, such a transferee shall qualify under paragraph (a) of this 
section within the 2-year period or the grazing preference shall be 
subject to cancellation. The authorized officer may grant extensions of 
the 2-year period where there are delays solely attributable to probate 
proceedings.
    (f) Transfers shall be for a period of not less than 3 years unless 
a shorter term is determined by the authorized officer to be consistent 
with management and resource condition objectives.
    (g) Failure of either the transferee or the transferor to comply 
with the regulations of this section may result in rejection of the 
transfer application or cancellation of grazing preference.

    (a) Additional forage temporarily available for livestock grazing 
use may be apportioned on a nonrenewable basis.
    (b) Additional forage available on a sustained yield basis for 
livestock grazing use shall first be apportioned in satisfaction of 
suspended permitted use to the permittee(s) or lessee(s) authorized to 
graze in the allotment in which the forage is available.
    (c) After consultation, cooperation, and coordination with the 
affected permittees or lessees, the State having lands or managing 
resources within the area, and the interested public, additional forage 
on a sustained yield basis available for livestock grazing use in an 
allotment may be apportioned to permittees or lessees or other 
applicants, provided the permittee, lessee, or other applicant is found 
to be qualified under subpart 4110 of this part. Additional forage shall 
be apportioned in the following priority:
    (1) Permittees or lessees in proportion to their contribution or 
stewardship efforts which result in increased forage production;
    (2) Permittee(s) or lessee(s) in proportion to the amount of their

temporary basis due to drought, fire, or other natural causes, or to 
facilitate installation, maintenance, or modification of range 
improvements.
    (b) When monitoring or field observations show grazing use or 
patterns of use are not consistent with the provisions of subpart 4180, 
or grazing use is otherwise causing an unacceptable level or pattern of 
utilization, or when use exceeds the livestock carrying capacity as 
determined through monitoring, ecological site inventory or other 
acceptable methods, the authorized officer shall reduce permitted 
grazing use or otherwise modify management practices.

Sec. 4110.4-2  Decrease in land acreage.

    (a) Where there is a decrease in public land acreage available for 
livestock grazing within an allotment:
    (1) Grazing permits or leases may be cancelled or modified as 
appropriate to reflect the changed area of use.
    (2) Permitted use may be cancelled in whole or in part. 
Cancellations determined by the authorized officer to be necessary to 
protect the public lands will be apportioned by the authorized officer 
based upon the level of available forage and the magnitude of the change 
in public land acreage available, or as agreed to among the authorized 
users and the authorized officer.
    (b) When public lands are disposed of or devoted to a public purpose 
which precludes livestock grazing, the permittees and lessees shall be 
given 2 years' prior notification except in cases of emergency (national 
defense requirements in time of war, natural disasters, national 
emergency needs, etc.) before their grazing permit or grazing lease and 
grazing preference may be canceled. A permittee or lessee may 
unconditionally waive the 2-year prior notification. Such a waiver shall 
not prejudice the permittee's or lessee's right to reasonable 
compensation for, but not to exceed the fair market value of his or her 
interest in authorized permanent range improvements located on these 
public lands (see Sec. 4120.3-6).

purpose, including disposal, the permittee or lessee shall receive from 
the United States reasonable compensation for the adjusted value of 
their interest in authorized permanent improvements placed or 
constructed by the permittee or lessee on the public lands covered by 
the cancelled permit or lease. The adjusted value is to be determined by 
the authorized officer. Compensation shall not exceed the fair market 
value of the terminated portion of the permittee's or lessee's interest 
therein. Where a range improvement is authorized by a range improvement 
permit, the livestock operator may elect to salvage materials and 
perform rehabilitation measures rather than be compensated for the 
adjusted value.
    (d) Permittees or lessees shall be allowed 180 days from the date of 
cancellation of a range improvement permit or cooperative range 
improvement agreement to salvage material owned by them and perform 
rehabilitation measures necessitated by the removal.

Sec. 4130.8  Fees.


<R05>
Sec. 4130.8-1  Payment of fees.

    (a) Grazing fees shall be established annually by the Secretary.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this 
section, the calculated fee or grazing fee shall be equal to the $1.23 
base established by the 1966 Western Livestock Grazing Survey multiplied 
by the result of the Forage Value Index (computed annually from data 
supplied by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) added to the 
Combined Index (Beef Cattle Price Index minus the Prices Paid Index) and 
divided by 100; as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC13NO91.013

CF = Calculated Fee (grazing fee) is the estimated economic value of 
          livestock grazing, defined by the Congress as fair market 
          value (FMV) of the forage;
$1.23=The base economic value of grazing on public rangeland established 
          by the 1966 Western Livestock Grazing Survey;
FVI=Forage Value Index means the weighted average estimate of the annual 
          rental charge per head per month for pasturing cattle on 
          private rangelands in the 11 Western States (Montana, Idaho, 
          Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, 
          Washington, Oregon, and California) (computed by the National 
          Agricultural Statistics Service from the June Enumerative 
          Survey) divided by $3.65 and multiplied by 100;
BCPI=Beef Cattle Price Index means the weighted average annual selling 
          price for beef cattle (excluding calves) in the 11 Western 
          States (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, 
          Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, and California) for 
          November through October (computed by the National 
          Agricultural Statistics Service divided by $22.04 per hundred 
          weight and multiplied by 100; and
PPI=Prices Paid Index means the following selected components from the 
          National Agricultural Statistics Service's Annual National 
          Index of Prices Paid by Farmers for Goods and Services 
          adjusted by the weights indicated in parentheses to reflect 
          livestock production costs in the Western States: 1. Fuels and 
          Energy (14.5); 2. Farm and Motor Supplies (12.0); 3. Autos and 
          Trucks (4.5); 4. Tractors and Self-Propelled Machinery (4.5); 
          5. Other Machinery (12.0); 6. Building and Fencing Materials 
          (14.5); 7. Interest (6.0); 8. Farm Wage Rates (14.0); 9. Farm 
          Services (18.0).

    (2) Any annual increase or decrease in the grazing fee for any given 
year shall be limited to not more than plus or minus 25 percent of the 
previous year's fee.
    (3) The grazing fee for any year shall not be less than $1.35 per 
animal unit month.
    (b) Fees shall be charged for livestock grazing upon or crossing the 
public lands and other lands administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management at a specified rate per animal unit month.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 4130.5, the full fee shall be charged 
for each animal unit month of authorized grazing use. For the purposes 
of calculating the fee, an animal unit month is defined as a month's use 
and occupancy of range by 1 cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro, 
mule, 5 sheep, or 5 goats, over the age of 6 months at the time of 
entering the public lands or other lands administered by the Bureau of 
Land Management; by any such weaned animals regardless of age; and by 
such animals that will become 12 months of age during the authorized 
period of use. No charge shall be made for animals under 6 months of 
age, at the time of entering public lands or other lands administered by 
the Bureau of Land Management, that are the natural progeny of animals 
upon which fees are paid, provided they will not become 12 months

[[Page 795]]

of age during the authorized period of use, nor for progeny born during 
that period. In calculating the billing the grazing fee is prorated on a 
daily basis and charges are rounded to reflect the nearest whole number 
of animal unit months.
    (d) A surcharge shall be added to the grazing fee billings for 
authorized grazing of livestock owned by persons other than the 
permittee or lessee except where such use is made by livestock owned by 
sons and daughters of permittees and lessees as provided in 
Sec. 4130.7(f). The surcharge shall be over and above any other fees 
that may be charged for using public land forage. Surcharges shall be 
paid prior to grazing use. The surcharge for authorized pasturing of 
livestock owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee will be 
equal to 35 percent of the difference between the current year's Federal 
grazing fee and the prior year's private grazing land lease rate per 
animal unit month for the appropriate State as determined by the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service.
    (e) Fees are due on due date specified on the grazing fee bill. 
Payment will be made prior to grazing use. Grazing use that occurs prior 
to payment of a bill, except where specified in an allotment management 
plan, is unauthorized and may be dealt with under subparts 4150 and 4170 
of this part. If allotment management plans provide for billing after 
the grazing season, fees will be based on actual grazing use and will be 
due upon issuance. Repeated delays in payment of actual use billings or 
noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the allotment management 
plan and permit or lease shall be cause to revoke provisions for after-
the-grazing-season billing.
    (f) Failure to pay the grazing bill within 15 days of the due date 
specified in the bill shall result in a late fee assessment of $25.00 or 
10 percent of the grazing bill, whichever is greater, but not to exceed 
$250.00. Payment made later than 15 days after the due date, shall 
include the appropriate late fee assessment. Failure to make payment 
within 30 days may be a violation of Sec. 4140.1(b)(1) and shall result 
in action by the authorized officer under Secs. 4150.1 and 4160.1-2.

grazing use and related refund are filed prior to the period of use for 
which the refund is requested.
    (b) No refunds shall be made for failure to make grazing use, except 
during periods of range depletion due to drought, fire, or other natural 
causes, or in case of a general spread of disease among the livestock 
that occurs during the term of a permit or lease. During these periods 
of range depletion the authorized officer may credit or refund fees in 
whole or in part, or postpone fee payment for as long as the emergency 
exists.

Sec. 4150.3  Settlement.

    Where violations are repeated willful, the authorized officer shall 
take action under Sec. 4170.1-1(b) of this title. The amount due for 
settlement shall include the value of forage consumed as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section. Settlement 
for willful and repeated willful violations shall also include the full 
value for all damages to the public lands and other property of the 
United States; and all reasonable expenses incurred by the United States 
in detecting, investigating, resolving violations, and livestock 
impoundment costs.
    (a) For nonwillful violations: The value of forage consumed as 
determined by the average monthly rate per AUM for pasturing livestock 
on privately owned land (excluding irrigated land) in each State as 
published annually by the Department of Agriculture. The authorized 
officer may approve nonmonetary settlement of unauthorized use only when 
the authorized officer determines that each of the following conditions 
is satisfied:
    (1) Evidence shows that the unauthorized use occurred through no 
fault of the livestock operator;
    (2) The forage use is insignificant;
    (3) The public lands have not been damaged; and
    (4) Nonmonetary settlement is in the best interest of the United 
States.
    (b) For willful violations: Twice the value of forage consumed as 
determined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) For repeated willful violations: Three times the value of the 
forage consumed as determined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Payment made under this section does not relieve the alleged 
violator of any criminal liability under Federal or State law.
    (e) Violators shall not be authorized to make grazing use on the 
public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management until any 
amount found to be due the United States under this section has been 
paid. The authorized officer may take action under Sec. 4160-1 of this 
title to cancel or suspend grazing authorizations or to deny approval of 
applications for grazing use until such amounts have been paid. The 
proposed decision shall include a demand for payment.

    The authorized officer shall take appropriate action under subparts 
4110, 4120, 4130, and 4160 of this part as soon as practicable but not 
later than the start of the next grazing year upon determining that 
existing grazing management needs to be modified to ensure that the 
following conditions exist.
    (a) Watersheds are in, or are making significant progress toward, 
properly functioning physical condition, including their upland, 
riparian-wetland, and aquatic components; soil and plant conditions 
support infiltration, soil moisture storage, and the release of water 
that are in balance with climate and landform and maintain or improve 
water quality, water quantity, and timing and duration of flow.
    (b) Ecological processes, including the hydrologic cycle, nutrient 
cycle, and energy flow, are maintained, or there is significant progress 
toward their attainment, in order to support healthy biotic populations 
and communities.
    (c) Water quality complies with State water quality standards and

[[Page 802]]

achieves, or is making significant progress toward achieving, 
established BLM management objectives such as meeting wildlife needs.
    (d) Habitats are, or are making significant progress toward being, 
restored or maintained for Federal threatened and endangered species, 
Federal Proposed, Category 1 and 2 Federal candidate and other special 
status species.

<R05>
Sec. 4180.2  Standards and guidelines for grazing administration.

    (a) The Bureau of Land Management State Director, in consultation 
with the affected resource advisory councils where they exist, will 
identify the geographical area for which standards and guidelines are 
developed. Standards and guidelines will be developed for an entire 
state, or an area encompassing portions of more than 1 state, unless the 
Bureau of Land Management State Director, in consultation with the 
resource advisory councils, determines that the characteristics of an 
area are unique, and the rangelands within the area could not be 
adequately protected using standards and guidelines developed on a 
broader geographical scale.
    (b) The Bureau of Land Management State Director, in consultation 
with affected Bureau of Land Management resource advisory councils, 
shall develop and amend State or regional standards and guidelines. The 
Bureau of Land Management State Director will also coordinate with 
Indian tribes, other State and Federal land management agencies 
responsible for the management of lands and resources within the region 
or area under consideration, and the public in the development of State 
or regional standards and guidelines. Standards and guidelines developed 
by the Bureau of Land Management State Director must provide for 
conformance with the fundamentals of Sec. 4180.1. State or regional 
standards or guidelines developed by the Bureau of Land Management State 
Director may not be implemented prior to their approval by the 
Secretary. Standards and guidelines made effective under paragraph (f) 
of this section may be modified by the Bureau of Land Management State 
Director, with approval of the Secretary, to address local ecosystems 
and management practices.
    (c) The authorized officer shall take appropriate action as soon as 
practicable but not later than the start of the next grazing year upon 
determining that existing grazing management practices or levels of 
grazing use on public lands are significant factors in failing to 
achieve the standards and conform with the guidelines that are made 
effective under this section. Appropriate action means implementing 
actions pursuant to subparts 4110, 4120, 4130, and 4160 of this part 
that will result in significant progress toward fulfillment of the 
standards and significant progress toward conformance with the 
guidelines. Practices and activities subject to standards and guidelines 
include the development of grazing-related portions of activity plans, 
establishment of terms and conditions of permits, leases and other 
grazing authorizations, and range improvement activities such as 
vegetation manipulation, fence construction and development of water.
    (d) At a minimum, State or regional standards developed under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must address the following:
    (1) Watershed function;
    (2) Nutrient cycling and energy flow;
    (3) Water quality;
    (4) Habitat for endangered, threatened, proposed, Candidate 1 or 2, 
or special status species; and
    (5) Habitat quality for native plant and animal populations and 
communities.
    (e) At a minimum, State or regional guidelines developed under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must address the following:
    (1) Maintaining or promoting adequate amounts of vegetative ground 
cover, including standing plant material and litter, to support 
infiltration, maintain soil moisture storage, and stabilize soils;
    (2) Maintaining or promoting subsurface soil conditions that support 
permeability rates appropriate to climate and soils;

[[Page 803]]

    (3) Maintaining, improving or restoring riparian-wetland functions 
including energy dissipation, sediment capture, groundwater recharge, 
and stream bank stability;
    (4) Maintaining or promoting stream channel morphology (e.g., 
gradient, width/depth ratio, channel roughness and sinuosity) and 
functions appropriate to climate and landform;
    (5) Maintaining or promoting the appropriate kinds and amounts of 
soil organisms, plants and animals to support the hydrologic cycle, 
nutrient cycle, and energy flow;
    (6) Promoting the opportunity for seedling establishment of 
appropriate plant species when climatic conditions and space allow;
    (7) Maintaining, restoring or enhancing water quality to meet 
management objectives, such as meeting wildlife needs;
    (8) Restoring, maintaining or enhancing habitats to assist in the 
recovery of Federal threatened and endangered species;
    (9) Restoring, maintaining or enhancing habitats of Federal 
Proposed, Category 1 and 2 Federal candidate, and other special status 
species to promote their conservation;
    (10) Maintaining or promoting the physical and biological conditions 
to sustain native populations and communities;
    (11) Emphasizing native species in the support of ecological 
function; and
    (12) Incorporating the use of non-native plant species only in those 
situations in which native species are not available in sufficient 
quantities or are incapable of maintaining or achieving properly 
functioning conditions and biological health;
    (f) In the event that State or regional standards and guidelines are 
not completed and in effect by February 12, 1997, and until such time as 
State or regional standards and guidelines are developed and in effect, 
the following standards provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and 
guidelines provided in (f)(2) of this section shall apply and will be 
implemented in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. However, 
the Secretary may grant, upon referral by the BLM of a formal 
recommendation by a resource advisory council, a postponement of the 
February 12, 1997, fallback standards and guidelines implementation 
date, not to exceed the 6-month period ending August 12, 1997. In 
determining whether to grant a postponement, the Secretary will 
consider, among other factors, long-term rangeland health and 
administrative efficiencies.
    (1) Fallback standards. (i) Upland soils exhibit infiltration and 
permeability rates that are appropriate to soil type, climate and 
landform.
    (ii) Riparian-wetland areas are in properly functioning condition.
    (iii) Stream channel morphology (including but not limited to 
gradient, width/depth ratio, channel roughness and sinuosity) and 
functions are appropriate for the climate and landform.
    (iv) Healthy, productive and diverse populations of native species 
exist and are maintained.
    (2) Fallback guidelines. (i) Management practices maintain or 
promote adequate amounts of ground cover to support infiltration, 
maintain soil moisture storage, and stabilize soils;
    (ii) Management practices maintain or promote soil conditions that 
support permeability rates that are appropriate to climate and soils;
    (iii) Management practices maintain or promote sufficient residual 
vegetation to maintain, improve or restore riparian-wetland functions of 
energy dissipation, sediment capture, groundwater recharge and stream 
bank stability;
    (iv) Management practices maintain or promote stream channel 
morphology (e.g., gradient, width/depth ratio, channel roughness and 
sinuosity) and functions that are appropriate to climate and landform;
    (v) Management practices maintain or promote the appropriate kinds 
and amounts of soil organisms, plants and animals to support the 
hydrologic cycle, nutrient cycle, and energy flow;
    (vi) Management practices maintain or promote the physical and 
biological conditions necessary to sustain native populations and 
communities;
    (vii) Desired species are being allowed to complete seed 
dissemination in 1 out of every 3 years (Management actions will promote 
the opportunity

[[Page 804]]

for seedling establishment when climatic conditions and space allow.);
    (viii) Conservation of Federal threatened or endangered, Proposed, 
Category 1 and 2 candidate, and other special status species is promoted 
by the restoration and maintenance of their habitats;
    (ix) Native species are emphasized in the support of ecological 
function;
    (x) Non-native plant species are used only in those situations in 
which native species are not readily available in sufficient quantities 
or are incapable of maintaining or achieving properly functioning 
conditions and biological health;
    (xi) Periods of rest from disturbance or livestock use during times 
of critical plant growth or regrowth are provided when needed to achieve 
healthy, properly functioning conditions (The timing and duration of use 
periods shall be determined by the authorized officer.);
    (xii) Continuous, season-long livestock use is allowed to occur only 
when it has been demonstrated to be consistent with achieving healthy, 
properly functioning ecosystems;
    (xiii) Facilities are located away from riparian-wetland areas 
wherever they conflict with achieving or maintaining riparian-wetland 
function;
    (xiv) The development of springs and seeps or other projects 
affecting water and associated resources shall be designed to protect 
the ecological functions and processes of those sites; and
    (xv) Grazing on designated ephemeral (annual and perennial) 
rangeland is allowed to occur only if reliable estimates of production 
have been made, an identified level of annual growth or residue to 
remain on site at the end of the grazing season has been established, 
and adverse effects on perennial species are avoided.

                           General Information


<R05>
Sec. 4300.1  What is a reindeer?

    Reindeer, Rangifer tarandus, are a semi-domesticated member of the 
deer family, Cervidae. They are essentially the same animal as their 
wild cousins, the caribou, but tend to be smaller than caribou. Reindeer 
and caribou are different subspecies of the same family, genus, and 
species. The term ``reindeer'' includes caribou that have been 
introduced into animal husbandry or have joined reindeer herds, the 
offspring of these caribou, and the offspring of reindeer.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.2  Is there a special form for my application?

    All applications you submit to BLM must be on a BLM-approved form 
and in duplicate. The forms to be used in this part are the Grazing 
Lease or Permit Application (Form 4201-1), the Reindeer Grazing Permit 
(Form 4132-2), and the Range Improvement Permit (Form 4120-7).

             Before You Apply for a Reindeer Grazing Permit


<R05>
Sec. 4300.10  On what types of public land can I obtain a reindeer grazing permit?

    (a) You may apply for public lands that are vacant and 
unappropriated.
    (b) You may apply for public lands which have been withdrawn for any 
purpose, but the Department or agency

[[Page 806]]

with administrative jurisdiction of the withdrawn lands must give its 
prior consent, and may impose terms or conditions on the use of the 
land.
    (c) If the lands you apply for are within natural caribou migration 
routes, or if they have other important values for wildlife, BLM will 
consult with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game before issuing a 
permit. BLM may include such lands in a permit at its discretion, and a 
permit will contain any special terms and conditions to protect wildlife 
resources.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.11  Who qualifies to apply for a permit?

    Natives, groups, associations or corporations of Natives as defined 
by the Act of September 1, 1937 (50 Stat. 900) qualify. If you are a 
Native corporation, you must be organized under the laws of the United 
States or the State of Alaska. Native corporations organized under the 
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act also qualify.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.12  What is the definition of a Native?

    Natives are:
    (a) Native Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts of whole or part blood 
living in Alaska at the time of the Treaty of Cession of Alaska to the 
United States, and their descendants of whole or part blood; and
    (b) Indians and Eskimos who, between 1867 and September 1, 1937, 
migrated into Alaska from Canada, and their descendants of whole or part 
blood.

                      Applying for a Grazing Permit


<R05>
Sec. 4300.20  How do I apply for a permit?

    You must execute a completed application for a grazing permit (Form 
4201-1) and file it in the BLM office with jurisdiction over the lands 
for which you are applying.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.21  What must I include in my application?

    (a) You must include a certification of reindeer allotment to you, 
signed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, if you are to receive a herd 
from the Government. If you obtain reindeer from a source other than the 
Government, you should state the source and show evidence of purchase or 
option to purchase.
    (b) Your initial application must list the location of and describe 
the improvements you own in the application area. You must have this 
statement verified by the Bureau of Indian Affairs before you submit it 
to BLM.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.22  What fees must I pay?

    You must pay a $10 filing fee with each application. No grazing fee 
will be charged.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.23  After I file my application, can I use the land before BLM issues my permit?

    No. You cannot use the land until BLM issues you a permit. 
Generally, BLM will issue a permit within 120 days after receiving an 
application and will keep you informed if there are delays in meeting 
that timeframe.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.24  Does my filed application mean that no one else can file an application?

    No. The filing of your application will not segregate the land. 
Anyone else may file an application and BLM may dispose of the lands 
under the public land laws.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.25  Does my filed application mean I will automatically receive a permit?

    No. BLM issues grazing permits at its discretion. Our decisionmaking 
is based on resource management guidelines developed in land use plans 
and in consultation with other State and Federal resource management 
agencies.

              Protests Against a Grazing Permit Application


<R05>
Sec. 4300.30  Can someone else protest my permit application?

    (a) Yes, anyone may file a protest with BLM. The protest does not 
have to be in a particular format nor on a BLM-approved form but it 
must:
    (1) Be filed in duplicate with BLM;
    (2) Contain a complete description of all facts upon which it is 
based;
    (3) Describe the lands involved; and
    (4) Be accompanied by evidence of service of a copy of the protest 
on the applicant.

[[Page 807]]

    (b) If the person protesting also wants a grazing permit for all or 
part of the land described in the protested application, the protest 
must be accompanied by a grazing permit application.

                   Conditions of Your Approved Permit


<R05>
Sec. 4300.40  How long can I graze reindeer with my permit?

    BLM issues permits for a maximum of 10 years, except when you 
request a shorter term, or when BLM determines that a shorter period is 
in the public interest. The issued permit will specify the number of 
years you can graze reindeer.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.41  What will the permit say about the number of reindeer and where I can graze them?

    (a) The permit will indicate the maximum number of reindeer you can 
graze on the permit area based on range conditions. BLM can adjust this 
number if range conditions change, as for example, by natural causes, 
overgrazing, or fire.
    (b) The permit will restrict grazing to a definitely described area 
which BLM feels is usable and adequate for your needs.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.42  If I have existing improvements on the land, will these be allowed in the initial permit?

    Yes, any improvements existing on the land will be allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.43  What should I do if I want to construct and maintain improvements on the land?

    (a) You should file an application (Form 4120-7) with BLM for a 
permit to do this. A permit will allow you to construct, maintain, and 
use any fence, building, corral, reservoir, well or other improvement 
needed for grazing under the grazing permit; and
    (b) You must comply with Alaska state law in the construction and 
maintenance of fences, but any fence must be constructed to permit 
ingress and egress of miners, mineral prospectors, and other persons 
entitled to enter the area for lawful purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.44  Are there any major restrictions on my grazing permit that I might otherwise think are allowed?

    Yes. You must not:
    (a) Enclose roads, trails and highways as to disturb public travel 
there;
    (b) Interfere with existing communication lines or other 
improvements;
    (c) Prevent legal hunting, fishing or trapping on the land;
    (d) Prevent access by persons, such as miners and mineral 
prospectors, entitled to lawfully enter; or
    (e) Graze reindeer without complying with applicable State and 
Federal laws on livestock quarantine and sanitation.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.45  Must I submit any reports?

    Yes. Before April 1 of the second permit year and each year 
afterwards, you must submit a report in duplicate to BLM which describes 
your grazing operations during the preceding year. Reports do not have 
to be on a BLM-approved form nor in a particular format.

                   Changes That Can Affect Your Permit

                         Other Uses of the Land


<R05>
Sec. 4300.50  Are there other uses of the land that may affect my permit?

    Yes. The lands described in your grazing permit and the subsurface 
can be affected by uses that BLM considers more important than grazing. 
Your permit can be modified or reduced in size or canceled by BLM to 
allow for:
    (a) Protection, development and use of the natural resources, e.g., 
minerals, timber, and water, under applicable laws and regulations;
    (b) Agricultural use;
    (c) Applications for and the acquisition of homesites, easements, 
permits, leases or other rights and uses, or any disposal or withdrawal, 
under the applicable public land laws; or
    (d) Temporary closing of portions of the permitted area to grazing 
whenever, because of improper handling of reindeer, overgrazing, fire or 
other cause, BLM judges this necessary to restore the range to its 
normal condition.

[[Page 808]]


<R05>
Sec. 4300.51  Will I be notified if another use, disposal, or withdrawal occurs on the land?

    Yes. If there is a settlement, location, entry, disposal, or 
withdrawal on any lands described in your permit, BLM will notify you 
and will reduce your permit area by the amount of the area involved.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.52  Can other persons use the land in my permit for mineral exploration or production?

    Yes. Unless the land is otherwise withdrawn, the land in your permit 
is subject to lease or leasing under the mineral leasing laws and under 
the Geothermal Steam Act, and mineral materials disposal under the 
Materials Act. Also, it can be prospected, located, and purchased under 
the mining laws and applicable regulations at 43 CFR Group 3800.

                 Changes in the Size of the Permit Area


<R05>
Sec. 4300.53  Can BLM reduce the size of the land in my permit?

    Yes. BLM may reduce it at any time but must notify you at least 30 
days before taking this action. BLM can reduce the area when:
    (a) BLM determines that the area is too large for the number of 
reindeer you are grazing; or
    (b) When disposal, withdrawal, natural causes, such as drought or 
fire, or any other reason in Sec. 4300.50 so requires.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.54  Can BLM increase the size of the land in my permit?

    Yes. BLM may increase the area on its own initiative or by your 
request if BLM determines that the area is too small for the number of 
reindeer you are grazing. BLM will give you at least 30 days' notice of 
this action.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.55  What if I don't agree with an adjustment of my permit area?

    You must contact BLM within the notice period to show cause why the 
area should not be adjusted. After the BLM field office manager makes a 
decision on the adjustment, you have the right to appeal that decision 
to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) under 43 CFR part 4. The 
IBLA makes the final decision.

                             Permit Renewals


<R05>
Sec. 4300.57  How do I apply for a renewal of my permit?

    You must submit an application for renewal, using the same form as 
the original application, between four and eight months before the 
permit expires. A $10 filing fee must accompany the application.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.58  Will the renewed permit be exactly the same as the old permit?

    At its discretion, BLM may offer you a renewed grazing permit with 
such terms, conditions, and duration that it determines are in the 
public interest.

                 Assigning Your Permit to Another Party


<R05>
Sec. 4300.59  If I want to assign my permit to another party, when must I notify BLM?

    You must file a proposed assignment of your permit, in whole or in 
part, in duplicate with BLM within 90 days of the assignment execution 
date. No particular format is required. The assignment is effective when 
BLM approves it.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.60  What must be included in my assignment document?

    Assignments must contain:
    (a) All terms and conditions agreed to by the parties;
    (b) A showing under Secs. 4300.11 and 4300.12 that the assignee is 
qualified to hold a permit;
    (c) A showing under Sec. 4300.21(a) regarding a reindeer allotment; 
and
    (d) The assignee's statement agreeing to be bound by the provisions 
of the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.61  Can I sublease any part of the land in my permit?

    No.

                         Closing Out Your Permit


<R05>
Sec. 4300.70  May I relinquish my permit?

    Yes. You may relinquish the permit by filing advance written notice 
with BLM. Your relinquishment will be effective on the date you 
indicate, as

[[Page 809]]

long as it is at least 30 days after the date you file.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.71  Under what circumstances can BLM modify, reduce or cancel my permit?

    (a) BLM may cancel the permit if:
    (1) BLM issued it improperly through error as to a material fact;
    (2) You fail to comply with any of the provisions of the permit or 
the regulations of this part; or
    (3) Disposal, withdrawal, natural causes, such as drought or fire, 
or any other reason in Sec. 4300.50 so requires.
    (b) BLM will not cancel the permit for failure to comply until BLM 
has notified you in writing of the nature of your noncompliance, and you 
have been given at least 30 days to show why BLM should not cancel your 
permit.
    (c) BLM may modify or reduce a permit in accordance with 
Sec. 4300.50.


<R05>
Sec. 4300.72  May I remove my personal property or improvements when the permit expires or terminates?

    (a) Yes. Within 90 days of the expiration or termination of the 
grazing permit, or within any extension period, you may remove all your 
personal property and any removable range improvements you own, such as 
fences, corrals, and buildings.
    (b) Property that is not removed within the time allowed will become 
property of the United States.

                        Reindeer Crossing Permits


<R05>
Sec. 4300.80  How can I get a permit to cross reindeer over public lands?

    (a) BLM may issue a crossing permit free of charge when you file an 
application with BLM at least 30 days before the crossing is to begin. 
Lands crossed may include lands under a grazing permit.
    (b) The application does not have to be on a BLM-approved form nor 
in a particular format, but it must show:
    (1) The number of reindeer to be driven;
    (2) The start date;
    (3) The approximate period of time required for the crossing; and
    (4) The land to be crossed.
    (c) You must comply with applicable State and Federal laws on 
livestock quarantine and sanitation when crossing reindeer on public 
land.

                                Trespass


<R05>
Sec. 4300.90  What is a trespass?

    (a) A trespass is any use of Federal land for reindeer grazing 
purposes without a valid permit issued under the regulations of this 
part; a trespass is unlawful and is prohibited.
    (b) Any person who willfully violates the regulations in this part 
will be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is 
punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by a fine of 
not more than $500.

<R04>
                          Subpart 4600--General


<R05>
Sec. 4600.0-2  Objectives.

    When it is determined by the authorized officer that any State, 
county, or privately owned lands located within grazing districts are 
chiefly valuable for grazing, and are necessary to promote the orderly 
use, improvement, and development of grazing districts,

[[Page 810]]

steps should be taken to secure offers of leases of such lands from the 
owners thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 4600.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The Act of June 23, 1938. The Act of June 23, 1938 (52 Stat. 
1033; 43 U.S.C. 315m-1, 315m-4 inclusive), known as the Pierce Act, 
authorizes the Secretary of the Interior in his discretion to lease, at 
rates to be determined by him, any State, county, or privately owned 
lands chiefly valuable for grazing purposes and lying within the 
exterior boundaries of grazing districts created under the Taylor 
Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269, as amended; 43 U.S.C. 315 
et seq.) when in his judgment, the leasing of such lands will promote 
the orderly use of the district and aid in conserving the forage 
resources of the public lands therein, and the authorized officer of the 
Bureau of Land Management may approve leases under the Pierce Act on 
behalf of the United States in accordance with this part. Leases so 
approved need not be submitted for Secretarial approval.


<R04>
                        Subpart 4610--Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 4610.1  Evidence of ownership.

    Parties offering to lease lands to the United States under the 
provisions of this Act will be required to furnish evidence of ownership 
as follows:


<R05>
Sec. 4610.1-1  Certificate of ownership for State or county lands.

    Where State and county lands are offered for lease, a certificate 
from the proper State or county official will be required showing that 
title to the lands is in the State or county and that the officer or 
agency of the State or county offering them for lease is empowered by 
the laws of such State to lease such lands.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.1-2  Certificate of ownership for private lands.

    Where privately owned lands are offered for lease, the party 
offering them will be required to file with the local office of the 
Bureau of Land Management certificates from either the proper county 
officials, a licensed abstracter, or an administrative officer of the 
Bureau of Land Management whichever is required by an authorized 
officer, certifying that the records of the county in which the lands 
are situated show that the party offering the lands for lease is the 
record owner thereof or in legal control of such lands under appropriate 
recorded lease permitting the subleasing of the property, and including 
an itemized statement showing the nature and extent of any liens, tax 
assessments, mortgages, or other encumbrances.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.2  Leases.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.2-1  Form of lease.

    Leases under the Pierce Act should conform in general to a form 
approved by the Director. This form is believed adaptable for use in all 
of the States within which grazing districts have been established under 
the Taylor Grazing Act. Leases under the Pierce Act must be executed by 
the lessor in the manner prescribed by the laws of the State within 
which the lands leased are situated.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.2-2  Period of lease.

    Leases may be made for such periods as are deemed proper by an 
authorized officer in promoting a proper land-use program in connection 
with the public range, not to exceed, however, the 10-year period as 
limited by the Pierce Act, beginning with the date of the approval of 
such lease.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.2-3  Approval of lease; renewal.

    Local negotiations for leasing of lands under this act will not be 
effective until the lease and any renewal thereof has been approved by 
an authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management. Upon such 
approval the lease should be recorded in the land records of the county 
in which the land is situated.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.3  Payment of rental.

    The carrying capacity of the lands will be taken into consideration 
in negotiating the rental to be paid. Payment of rentals will be made 
annually by the United States at the end of the period for which 
licenses or permits to graze on the lands involved have been granted, or 
as soon thereafter as the moneys collected by the United States

[[Page 811]]

from its licensees or permittees for the use of such lands have been 
appropriated by the Congress in accordance with the provisions of the 
Pierce Act, and made available for such purpose, or moneys for the 
payment of such rentals have been made available through contributions 
under section 9 of the Taylor Grazing Act (48 Stat. 1273; 43 U.S.C. 
315h).


<R05>
Sec. 4610.4  Fees.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.4-1  Computation of fees.

    The aggregate of the grazing fees collected for the use of the lands 
leased under the provisions of the Pierce Act must be sufficient to 
insure a return to the United States of an amount equal to the aggregate 
of the rentals paid for such lands and the aggregate of the grazing fees 
collected for the use of all the lands leased in any one State must be 
at least equal to the aggregate of the rentals paid in that State.


<R05>
Sec. 4610.4-2  Disposition of receipts.

    All moneys received in the administration of lands leased under the 
Pierce Act will be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as

to the protection, management, and control of wild horses and burros 
under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management.


<R05>
Sec. 4700.0-2  Objectives.

    The objectives of these regulations are management of wild horses 
and burros as an integral part of the natural system of the public lands 
under the principle of multiple use; protection of wild horses and 
burros from unauthorized capture, branding, harassment or death; and 
humane care and treatment of wild horses and burros.


<R05>
Sec. 4700.0-3  Authority.

    The Act of September 8, 1959 (18 U.S.C. 47); the Act of December 15, 
1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331-1340); the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1711, 1712, and 1734); the Act of June 
28, 1934, as amended (43 U.S.C. 315); and the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 4331-4335, and 4341-4347).


<R05>
Sec. 4700.0-5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    (a) Act means the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
1331-1340), commonly referred to as the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and 
Burro Act.
    (b) Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land 
Management to whom has been delegated the authority to perform the 
duties described herein.
    (c) Commercial exploitation means using a wild horse or burro 
because of its characteristics of wildness for direct or indirect 
financial gain. Characteristics of wildness include the rebellious and 
feisty nature of such animals

[[Page 813]]

and their defiance of man as exhibited in their undomesticated and 
untamed state. Use as saddle or pack stock and other uses that require 
domestication of the animal are not commercial exploitation of the 
animals because of their characteristics of wildness.
    (d) Herd area means the geographic area identified as having been 
used by a herd as its habitat in 1971.
    (e) Humane treatment means handling compatible with animal husbandry 
practices accepted in the veterinary community, without causing 
unnecessary stress or suffering to a wild horse or burro.
    (f) Inhumane treatment means any intentional or negligent action or 
failure to act that causes stress, injury, or undue suffering to a wild 
horse or burro and is not compatible with animal husbandry practices 
accepted in the veterinary community.
    (g) Lame wild horse or burro means a wild horse or burro with one or 
more malfunctioning limbs that permanently impair its freedom of 
movement.
    (h) Old wild horse or burro means a wild horse or burro 
characterized because of age by its physical deterioration and inability 
to fend for itself, suffering, or closeness to death.
    (i) Private maintenance means the provision of proper care and 
humane treatment to excess wild horses and burros by qualified 
individuals under the terms and conditions specified in a Private 
Maintenance and Care Agreement.
    (j) Public lands means any lands or interests in lands administered 
by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management.
    (k) Sick wild horse or burro means a wild horse or burro with 
failing health, infirmity or disease from which there is little chance 
of recovery.
    (l) Wild horses and burros means all unbranded and unclaimed horses 
and burros that use public lands as all or part of their habitat, that 
have been removed from these lands by the authorized officer, or that 
have been born of wild horses or burros in authorized BLM facilities, 
but have not lost their status under section 3 of the Act. Foals born to 
a wild horse or burro after approval of a Private Maintenance and Care 
Agreement are not wild horses or burros. Such foals are the property of 
the adopter of the parent mare or jenny. Where it appears in this part 
the term wild horses and burros is deemed to include the term free-
roaming.

Sec. 4750.4-2  Adoption fee.

    (a) Does BLM charge an adoption fee for wild horses and burros?
    You must pay an adoption fee for each wild horse or burro you adopt. 
Usually BLM will charge you a $125 base fee. BLM will not charge you an 
adoption fee for orphan foals.
    (b) Can BLM increase the adoption fee?
    Yes, BLM may increase the adoption fee. BLM may hold competitive 
adoption events for wild horses or burros. At competitive adoptions, 
qualified adopters set adoption fees through competitive bidding. For 
these adoptions, the fee is the highest bid received over the base fee 
of $125. Horses or burros remaining at the end of a competitive adoption 
event will be available for adoption at the established adoption fee.
    (c) May BLM reduce or waive the adoption fee?
    (1) The BLM Director may reduce or waive the fee when wild horses or 
burros are un-adoptable at the base adoption fee.
    (2) A reduction or waiver of the adoption fee is available only if 
you are willing to comply with all regulations relating to wild horses 
and burros.

PART 5040--SUSTAINED-YIELD FOREST UNITS--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
5040.1  Under what authority does BLM establish sustained-yield forest 
          units?
5040.2  What will BLM do before it establishes sustained-yield forest 
          units?
5040.3  How does BLM establish sustained-yield forest units?
5040.4  What is the effect of designating sustained-yield forest units?
5040.5  How does BLM determine and declare the annual productive 
          capacity?

    Authority: 43 U.S.C. 1181e; 43 U.S.C. 1740.

[[Page 822]]


    Source: 63 FR 13132, Mar. 18, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 5040.1  Under what authority does BLM establish sustained-yield forest units?

    BLM is authorized, under the O. and C. Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1181a et 
seq.) and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, to divide the 
lands it manages in western Oregon into sustained-yield forest units. 
These lands are hereafter referred to as ``the O. and C. lands.'' BLM 
establishes units that contain enough forest land to provide, insofar as 
practicable, a permanent source of raw materials to support local 
communities and industries, giving due consideration to established 
forest products operations.


<R05>
Sec. 5040.2  What will BLM do before it establishes sustained-yield forest units?

    Before BLM designates sustained-yield forest units, it will:
    (a) Hold a public hearing in the area where it proposes to designate 
the units. BLM will provide notice, approved by the BLM Director, to the 
public of any hearing concerning sustained-yield forest units. This 
notice must be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the 
forest units are situated. BLM may also publish the notice in a trade 
publication; and
    (b) Forward the minutes or meeting records to the BLM Director, 
along with an appropriate recommendation concerning the establishment of 
the units.


<R05>
Sec. 5040.3  How does BLM establish sustained-yield forest units?

    After a public hearing, BLM will publish a notice in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the county or counties affected by the proposed 
units, stating whether or not the BLM Director has decided to establish 
the units. If the BLM Director determines that the units should be 
established, BLM will include in its notice information on the 
geographical description of the sustained-yield forest units, how the 
public may review the BLM document that will establish the units, and 
the date the units will become effective. BLM will publish the notice 
before the units are established.


<R05>
Sec. 5040.4  What is the effect of designating sustained-yield units?

    Designating new sustained-yield forest units abolishes previous O. 
and C. master unit or sustained-yield forest unit designations. Until 
new sustained-yield forest units are designated for the first time in 
accordance with 43 CFR part 5040, the current master unit designations 
will continue to be in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 5040.5  How does BLM determine and declare the annual productive capacity?

    (a) If BLM has not established sustained-yield forest units under 
part 5040, then BLM will determine and declare the annual productive 
capacity by applying the sustained-yield principle to the O. and C. 
lands, treating them as a single unit.
    (b) If BLM has established sustained-yield forest units under part 
5040, then BLM will determine and declare the annual productive capacity 
by applying the sustained-yield principle to each separate forest unit.
    (c) If it occurs that BLM has established sustained-yield forest 
units for less than all of the O. and C. lands, then BLM will determine 
and declare the annual productive capacity as follows:
    (1) BLM will treat sustained-yield forest units as in paragraph (b) 
of this section; and
    (2) BLM will treat any O. and C. lands not located within sustained-
yield forest units as a single unit.

Sec. 5400.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The Act of August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C. 1181a) authorizes the sale 
of timber from the Revested Oregon and California Railroad and 
Reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands and directs that such lands 
shall be managed for permanent forest production and the timber thereon 
sold, cut and removed in conformity with the principle of sustained 
yield for the purpose of providing a permanent source of timber supply, 
protecting watersheds, regulating streamflow and contributing to the 
economic stability of local communities and industries, and providing 
recreational facilities.
    (b) The Act of July 31, 1947, as amended (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
authorizes the disposal of timber and other vegetative resources on 
public lands of the United States including lands embraced within an 
unpatented mining claim located after July 23, 1955, if the disposal of 
such resources is not otherwise expressly authorized by law including, 
but not limited to, the Act of June 28, 1934, as amended (43 U.S.C. 315 
through 315o-1) and the U.S. mining laws; is not expressly prohibited by 
laws of the United States; and would not be detrimental to the public 
interest.
    (1) The Act also authorizes the United States, its permittees, and 
licensees to use so much of the surface of any unpatented mining claim 
located under the mining law of the United States after July 23, 1955, 
as may be necessary for access to adjacent land for the purposes of such 
permittees or licensees. Any authorized use of the surface of any such 
mining claim shall be such as not to endanger or materially interfere 
with prospecting, mining, or processing operations or uses reasonably 
incident thereto.
    (2) Where the lands have been withdrawn in aid of a function of a 
Federal department or agency other than the Department of the Interior, 
or of a State county, municipality, water district, or other local 
governmental subdivision or agency, the Secretary of the Interior may 
make disposals under the regulations in this subpart only with the 
consent of such other Federal department or agency or of such State, or 
local governmental unit. The Act provides, however, that the Secretary 
of Agriculture shall dispose of materials if such materials are on lands 
administered by the Secretary of Agriculture for national forest 
purposes or for purposes of title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant 
Act or where withdrawn for the purpose of any other function of the 
Department of Agriculture.
    (3) The provisions of the Act in disposal of vegetative or mineral 
materials do not apply to lands in any national park, or national 
monument or to any Indian lands or lands set aside or held for the use 
or benefit of Indians including lands over which jurisdiction has been 
transferred to the Department of the Interior by Executive order for the 
use of Indians.
    (c) The Department of the Interior and Related Agencies 
Appropriation Act, 1976 (Pub. L. 94-165) prohibits the use of funds 
appropriated thereunder for sale of unprocessed timber from Federal 
lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States which will 
be exported from the United States, or which will be used as a 
substitute for timber from private lands which is exported by the 
purchaser. The law also provides that the export restriction shall not 
apply to specific quantities of grades and species of timber which the 
Secretary of the Interior determines to be surplus to domestic lumber 
and plywood manufacturing needs.
    (d) Authority for small sales of timber for use in Alaska is 
contained in the Act of May 14, 1898, as amended (16 U.S.C. 615a).
    (e) Authority to enforce the provisions of this title is contained

representatives of the Department of the Interior and the Department of 
Agriculture, respectively. At the conclusion of the hearing, the record 
thereof together with appropriate recommendations shall be forwarded to 
the Director for further action deemed appropriate. The Director shall 
give the public due notice as to the quantities and species of 
unprocessed timber determined to be surplus to the needs of domestic

Sec. 5401.0-6  Policy.

    (a) All sales other than those specified in Sec. 5402.0-6 shall be 
made only after inviting competitive bids through publication and 
posting. Sales shall not be held sooner than one week after the last 
advertisement. Competitive sales shall be offered by the authorized 
officer when access to the sale area is available to anyone who is 
qualified to bid. Further, timber or other vegetative resources that 
would normally be sold by negotiated sale because of lack of legal 
access may be sold competitively without access if the authorized 
officer determines that there is competitive interest in such a sale.
    (b) All competitive sales shall be subject to the restrictions 
relating to the export and substitution from the United States of 
unprocessed timber.

(Sec. 5, 50 Stat. 875, 61 Stat. 681, as amended, 69 Stat. 367; 43 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 5402.0-6  Policy.

    (a) When it is determined by the authorized officer to be in the 
public interest, he may sell at not less than the appraised value, 
without advertising or calling for bids, timber where the contract is 
for the sale of less than 250 M board feet.
    (b) Timber on the right-of-way of a logging road and danger trees 
adjacent to the right-of-way on O. and C. lands may be sold at not less 
than the appraised value without advertising or calling for bids to (1) 
permittee who constructs a road pursuant to a permit issued under 
Subpart 2800 of this chapter, or (2) a contractor who is constructing a 
road with Government funds.
    (c) In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, negotiated sales 
with no limitations as to volume may be made if:
    (1) The contract is for the disposal of materials to be used in 
connection with a public works improvement program on behalf of a 
Federal, State or local government agency and the public exigency will 
not permit the delay incident to advertising; or if
    (2) The contract is for the disposal of timber or other vegetative 
resources, for which it is impracticable to obtain competition.
    (d) All negotiated sales shall be subject to the restrictions 
relating to the export and substitution from the United States of 
unprocessed timber. Timber purchased for right-of-way purposes will not 
be subject to substitution restrictions.

cruise basis.


<R05>
Sec. 5422.2  Scale sales.

    (a) Scaling by the Bureau will be used from time to time for 
administrative reasons. Such reasons would include but not be limited to 
the following: To improve cruising standards; check accuracy of cruising 
practices; for volumetric analysis; and for highly defective timber 
where it is impossible to determine the tree cruise volume within a 
reasonable degree of accuracy.
    (b) Third party scaling may be ordered by the Bureau after a 
determination that all of the following factors exist: (1) A timber 
disaster has occurred; (2) a critical resource loss is imminent; (3) 
measurement practices listed in Sec. 5422.1 and paragraph (a) of this 
section are inadequate to permit orderly disposal of the damaged timber. 
Third party scaling volumes must be capable of being equated to Bureau 
standards in use for timber depletion computations, to insure 
conformance with sustained yield principles.

    (a) All timber sales shall be made on contract or permit forms 
approved by the Director, BLM.
    (b) Other than for incidental use, the severance and/or removal of 
any vegetative resource for personal or commercial use requires a 
written contract or permit issued by the authorized officer or other 
person authorized by the United States. All contracts or permits shall 
contain the following:
    (1) The name of the purchaser or his/her authorized representative 
with complete mailing address.
    (2) The specific vegetative resources authorized for removal and 
their respective quantities and values.
    (3) The specific location from which the vegetative resources are to

reforestation, snag felling, slash disposal, fire prevention, fire 
control, and the protection of improvements, watersheds, recreational 
values, and the prevention of pollution or other environmental 
degradation.
    (d) The contract or permit from and any additional provisions shall 
be made available for inspection by prospective bidders during the 
advertising period.

[[Page 828]]

When sales are negotiated, all additional provisions shall be made part 
of the contract or permit.
    (e) Except for such specific quantities of grades and species of 
unprocessed timber determined to be surplus to domestic lumber and 
plywood manufacturing needs, each timber sale contract shall include 
provisions that prohibit:
    (1) The export of any unprocessed timber harvested from the area 
under contract; and
    (2) The use of any timber of sawing or peeler grades, sold pursuant 
to the contract, as a substitute for timber from private lands which is 
exported or sold for export by the purchaser, an affiliate of the 
purchaser, or any other parties.

[56 FR 10175, Mar. 11, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 5424.1  Reporting provisions for substitution determination.

    (a) To determine whether substitution has occurred, the authorized 
officer may require that information identified in the contract be 
reported by:
    (1) A purchaser who has exported private timber within one year 
preceding the purchase date of Federal timber, and/or
    (2) An affiliate of a timber purchaser who exported private timber 
within one year before the acquisition of Federal timber from the 
purchaser.
    (b) Purchasers or affiliates of purchasers shall retain a record of 
Federal timber acquisitions and private timber exports for three years 
from the date the activity occurred.

<R05>
Sec. 5441.1  Qualification of bidders.

    (a) A bidder or purchaser for the sale of timber must be (1) an 
individual who is a citizen of the United States, (2) a partnership 
composed wholly of such citizens, (3) an unincorporated association 
composed wholly of such citizens, or (4) a corporation authorized to 
transact business in the States in which the timber is located. A bidder 
must also have submitted a deposit in advance, as required by 
Sec. 5441.1-1. To qualify for bidding to purchase set-aside timber, the 
bidder must not have been determined by the Small Business 
Administration to be ineligible for preferential award of set-aside 
sales and must accompany his deposit with a self-certification statement 
that he is qualified as a small business concern as defined by the Small 
Business Administration (13 CFR part 121).
    (b) At the request of the authorized officer, or the officer 
conducting the sale, bidders must furnish evidence of qualification in 
conformance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section or if such 
evidence has already been furnished, make appropriate reference to the 
record containing it.
    (c)(1) A purchaser who is under review for debarment may continue to 
bid on timber purchase contracts until a final debarment determination 
has been made by the debarring official. However, contracts will not be 
awarded during the review period.
    (2) Debarred purchasers are prohibited from bidding on timber 
purchase contracts.

<R05>
Sec. 5441.1-1  Bid deposits.

    Sealed bids shall be accompanied by a deposit of not less than 10 
percent of the appraised value of the timber or other vegetative 
resources. For offerings at oral auction, bidders shall make a deposit 
of not less than 10 percent of the appraised value prior to the opening 
of the bidding. The authorized officer may, in his discretion, require 
larger deposits. Deposits may be in the form of cash, money orders, bank 
drafts, cashiers or certified checks made payable to the Bureau of Land 
Management, bid bonds of a corporate surety shown on the approved list 
of the United States Treasury Department or any guaranteed remittance 
approved by the authorized officer. Upon conclusion of the bidding, the 
bid deposits of all bidders, except the high bidder, will be returned. 
The deposit of the successful bidder will be applied on the purchase 
price at the time the contract is signed by the authorized officer 
unless the deposit is a corporate surety bid bond, in which case the 
surety bond will be returned to the purchaser.

[55 FR 22917, June 5, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 5441.1-2  Special considerations.

    Where a timber sale notice provides that the successful bidder may 
use a Small Business Administration road construction loan, and the 
bidder has reason to believe that he qualifies for such road 
construction loan under SBA regulations (13 CFR part 121), the bidder 
shall submit to the authorized officer a statement of his intention to 
file with SBA for such SBA road construction loan. The purpose of the 
filing is to facilitate action by the authorized officer and the Small 
Business Administration on the loan application.

Sec. 5441.1-3  SBA set-aside sales.

    Only bids of small business concerns which have filed a self-
certification statement as required by Sec. 5441.1 may be considered for 
sales subject to set-asides. When no such bids are received, the timber 
may be sold under Sec. 5443.1 in the same manner as timber not 
previously made subject to a set-aside. When timber subject to a set-
aside is not sold for any other reason, the sale may be rescheduled for 
a set-aside sale.

Sec. 5442.1  Bidding.

    (a) Bidding at competitive sales shall be conducted by the 
submission of sealed bids, written bids, oral bids, or a combination of 
bidding methods as directed by the authorized officer.
    (b) In sealed bid sales, the bidder submitting the highest sealed 
bid shall be declared the high bidder. In the event of a tie in high 
sealed bids, the high bidder shall be determined by lot from among those 
who submitted the tie bids.
    (c) In oral auction sales, submission of the required minimum bid 
deposit and a written bid at not less than the advertised appraised 
price shall be required to participate in oral bidding. The officer 
conducting the sale shall declare a specific period, prior to oral 
bidding on each tract, during which bid deposits and written bids may be 
submitted. Bid deposits and written bids also may be submitted any time 
prior to the specific period declared by the officer conducting the 
sale. Oral bidding to determine the high bidder shall begin from the 
highest written bid after closure of the submittal period. In the event 
there is a tie in high written bids, and no oral bidding occurs, the 
bidder who was the first to submit his bid deposit and written bid shall 
be declared the high bidder. If the officer conducting the sale cannot 
determine who made the first submission of high tie written bids, the 
high bidder shall be determined by lot. The declared high bidder must 
confirm his oral bid in writing immediately after the sale, but failure 
to do so shall not relieve him of his purchase obligation.

Sec. 5442.2  Resale of timber from uncompleted contract.

    (a) This section applies to the sale of timber only when 50 percent 
or more of the timber included in the sale is timber remaining from an 
uncompleted contract. A bid from a purchaser who held the uncompleted 
contract, or an affiliate of such purchaser, will be considered only if:
    (1) The contract was not canceled because of breach by the 
purchaser, and
    (2) The purchaser has made full payment of the total purchase price 
and any related charges by the expiration date.
    (b) The purchaser who held the uncompleted contract, or affiliate of 
such purchaser, shall, upon execution of the resale contract, agree that 
the Bureau of Land Management shall retain the original payment for 
timber not removed under the uncompleted contract, less the cost of 
resale, as a credit toward the purchase price of the resale contract.

[55 FR 17755, Apr. 27, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 5442.3  Rejection of bids; waiver of minor deficiencies.

    When the authorized officer determines it to be in the interest of 
the Government to do so, he may reject any or all bids and may waive 
minor deficiencies in the bids or the timber sale advertisement.

Sec. 5443.1  General.

    If no bid is received within the time specified in the advertisement 
of sale, and if the authorized officer determines that there has been no 
significant rise in the market value, he may in his discretion, keep the 
sale open for not to exceed 90 days by posting notice thereof in a 
conspicuous place in the office where bids are to be submitted. If 
during such period a written bid is submitted, together with the 
required deposit, for not less than the advertised appraised value, a 
notice of such bid shall be posted immediately after receipt of such bid 
for seven successive days in the same office and in the same manner. If 
no other written bid is received during the seven day posting period, 
the sole bidder shall be deemed the high bidder. If, however, during 
such seven day posting period other written bids are received, an oral 
auction shall be conducted in the usual manner for those who have 
submitted written bids. The authorized officer shall notify those who 
have submitted written bids of the time and place of the oral auction. 
The written bids shall be considered the initial bids in such

[[Page 831]]

oral auction. If there is a tie in the high written bids that are 
submitted during the seven day posting period and if no higher bid is 
offered during the oral auction, the party who first submitted the high 
bid shall be deemed the high bidder.

<R05>
Sec. 5450.1  Pre-award qualifications of high bidder.

    (a) The authorized officer may require the high bidder to furnish 
such information as is necessary to determine the ability of the bidder 
to perform the obligations of the contract. The contract shall be 
awarded to the high bidder, unless he is not qualified or responsible, 
or unless all bids are rejected. If the high bidder is not qualified or 
responsible or fails to sign and return the contract together with the 
required performance bond and any required payment; the contract may be 
offered and awarded for the amount of the high bid to the highest of the 
bidders who is qualified, responsible, and willing to accept the 
contract.
    (b) A purchaser who has defaulted on a timber sale contract under 
this title by failing to complete payment of its total purchase price by 
the expiration date of the contract is considered a risk for purposes of 
being awarded future timber sale contracts. If a purchaser deemed a risk 
is the high bidder on a new timber sale, the authorized officer shall 
send a notice by registered mail requiring such purchaser to establish 
bidder responsibility by paying or bonding, or a combination of payment 
and bonding, for any one of the following: The total unpaid balance of 
the purchase price of all defaulted sales, the unsettled damages on all 
defaults, or 50 percent of the purchase price of contracts bid after the 
most recent default. Any payment applied toward 50 percent of a 
contract's bid price after the default(s) will be held as final payment 
for timber cut and/or removed under terms of the contracts. Acceptable 
bonding options are listed at Sec. 5451.1 of this title. Payment and 
bonding are due within time limits stated in Sec. 5450.1(c). Should the 
purchaser fail to demonstrate responsibility within 30 days of receipt 
of the notice, the authorized officer shall offer the contract for the 
amount of the high bid to the highest of the bidders who is qualified, 
responsible, and willing to accept the contract. Failure to demonstrate 
responsibility within 30 days of receipt of the notice indicates that 
the purchaser is not responsible, and debarment proceedings shall be 
considered under Sec. 5441.1 of this title.
    (c) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract the successful 
bidder shall sign and return the contract, together with any required 
performance bond and any required payment: Provided, That the authorized 
officer may, in his discretion, extend such period an additional 30 days 
if the extension is applied for in writing and granted in writing within 
the first 30-day period. If the successful bidder fails to comply within 
the stipulated time, his bid deposit shall be retained as liquidated 
damages.
    (d) Award of contracts or permits on negotiated sales occurs upon 
the execution of the contract or permit. Terms and conditions shall 
reflect the contractor's ability to perform, and shall require 
prevention or mitigation of environmental degradation associated

[[Page 832]]

    (a) A minimum performance bond of not less than 20 percent of the 
total contract price shall be required for all contracts of $2,500 or 
more, but the amount of the bond shall not be in excess of $500,000, 
except when the purchaser opts to increase the minimum bond as provided 
in Sec. 5451.2 of this title. A minimum performance bond of not less 
than $500 will be required for all installment contracts less than 
$2,500. For cash sales less than $2,500, bond requirements, if any, will 
be in the discretion of the authorized officer. The performance bond may 
be:
    (1) Bond of a corporate surety shown on the approved list issued by 
the United States Treasury Department and executed on an approved 
standard form; or
    (2) Personal surety bond, executed on an approved standard form if 
the authorized officer determines the principals and bondsmen are 
capable of carrying out the terms of the contract; or
    (3) Cash bond; or
    (4) Negotiable securities of the United States.
    (5) Any guaranteed remittance approved by the authorized officer.

increasing the minimum bond required by Sec. 5451.1(a) of this part by 
an amount equal to one or more installment payments; Provided, however, 
That the authorized officer may grant permission to cut timber only when 
the value of the timber to be cut does not exceed the amount by which 
the minimum bond has been increased. The purchaser shall secure approval 
in writing of the adjusted bond by the authorized officer prior to 
cutting any timber under the adjusted bond.
    (b) If payment and bonding for 50 percent of the purchase price of a 
contract is provided in accordance with Sec. 5450.1(b) of this title, 
the amount of performance bond in excess of the minimum performance bond 
required by Sec. 5451.1(a) of this title may be used as an increased 
performance bond as specified in Sec. 5451.2(a) of this title.

Sec. 5451.3  Performance bond reduction.

    (a) As contract provisions are satisfactorily completed, the 
authorized officer may, in his discretion, reduce the amount of the 
required performance bond: Provided, however, That the amount of the 
performance bond shall not be reduced below the minimum required by 
Sec. 5451.1 until
    (1) Payment of no less than 60 percent of the total purchase price 
has been made, or
    (2) Road construction required under the contract has been 
completed, the value of which when combined with contract payments is 
equal to no less than 60 percent of the total purchase price.
    (b) At the request of the purchaser, when the requirements set forth 
in the proviso to paragraph (a) of this section have been met, the 
amount of the performance bond may be reduced to 10 percent of the total 
purchase price or the entire cost of the uncompleted post-harvest 
contract requirements, whichever is greater. The amount of the 
performance bond shall not be reduced below 10 percent of the total 
purchase price until payment for all the timber sold under the terms of 
the contract is complete.
    (c) For the purpose of this section, the value of completed road 
construction shall be based on the Bureau's appraisal allowance.

[[Page 833]]


Satisfactory completion of portions of the required road construction, 
to reasonable points that can be easily identified in the road 
construction appraisal, shall be considered as completed road 
construction for the purpose of this section.

Sec. 5451.4  Payment bond.

    To obtain permission to (a) cut and remove timber, or (b) remove 
timber already cut, which has been secured by an increased performance 
bond as provided for in Sec. 5451.2, before payment of the first or 
subsequent installments, the purchaser must obtain a payment bond in an 
amount equal to one or more installment payments as determined by the 
authorized officer. The payment bond may be a bond of a corporate surety 
shown on the approved list issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and 
executed on an approved form or negotiable securities of the United 
States. The payment bond may be a bond of a corporate surety shown on 
the approved list issued by the United States Treasury Department and 
executed on an approved form, negotiable securities of the United 
States, or any guaranteed remittance approved by the authorized officer. 
If a bond of a corporate surety is used, the payment bond shall provide 
that if the purchaser fails to make payment as required by 
Sec. 5461.2(c) of this chapter, the surety will make such payment 
including any required interest to the Bureau within 60 days after 
demand therefor by the Bureau. With the written approval of the 
authorized officer a single blanket payment bond may be allocated to two 
or more contracts with the same purchaser in the same Bureau of Land 
Management administrative district. When operations cease for 60 days or 
more, the amount of a payment bond may be adjusted downward to an amount 
equal to the value of the timber cut. Before operations resume, a 
reduced bond shall be increased to the amount of a full installment.

Sec. 5461.1  Payment in advance of cutting or removal.

    Except as provided in Secs. 5451.2 and 5451.4 no part of any timber 
or other vegetative resources sold may be cut or removed unless advance 
payment has been made as provided in the contract.

[35 FR 9787, June 13, 1970, as amended at 38 FR 6281, Mar. 8, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 5461.2  Required payment schedule.

    (a)(1) For sales of less than $500,000, installment payments shall 
not be less than 10 percent of the total purchase price. For sales of 
$500,000 or more, installment payments shall be $50,000.

[[Page 834]]

    (2) The first installment shall be paid prior to or at the time the 
authorized officer signs the contract. A purchaser cannot apply any 
portion of the first installment to cover other payments due on the 
contract until either 60 percent of the total purchase price has been 
paid or road construction required by the contract, the value of which 
when combined with contract payments is equal to 60 percent of the total 
purchase price, has been completed. When either of these 60-percent 
levels has been reached, one-half of the first installment may be 
applied to other payments due on the contract.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, when the contracting officer suspends or requests the purchaser 
to interrupt or delay operations during the operating season for a 
reason beyond the control of the purchaser, the contracting officer may 
reduce the amount of the first installment to 5 percent of the 
installment amount listed in the timber sale contract. Reductions may be 
made when the suspension, interruption, or delay can reasonably be 
expected to last longer than 30 days or has been in effect for more than 
30 days for existing contracts. The purchaser shall request such 
reduction in writing from the contracting officer. The contracting 
officer will answer such requests within 15 days. The funds released may 
be refunded or credited to other contracts. When the contracting officer 
notifies the purchaser that operations may proceed, the purchaser shall 
have 15 days after such notification to return the first installment to 
the full amount specified in the timber sale contract. Failure to pay 
the full first installment amount within the specified time will be 
considered a material breach of contract, and the contracting officer 
may cancel the contract. No timber may be cut or removed from the 
contract area until the first installment is restored to the full amount 
required by the contract.
    (4) The second installment shall be paid prior to the cutting or 
removal of the material sold. Each subsequent installment shall be due 
and payable without notice when the value of material cut or removed 
equals the sum of all payments made up to that point, not including the 
first installment, or one-half of the first installment after the other 
one-half of the first installment has been released as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (5) Timber sale contracts shall contain provisions requiring 
periodic payments for all sales with a contract term of 19 months or 
longer. For sales with a contract term of 19-26 months, one periodic 
payment of 20 percent of the total purchase price will be required. For 
all sales with a contract term of 27 months or longer, two periodic 
payments will be required. The first payment shall be 20 percent of the 
total purchase price and the second payment shall be 40 percent of the 
total purchase price. The value of satisfactorily completed road 
construction required by the contract and all completed contract 
payments may be used as a credit against the amount due for periodic 
payments. The due dates for the periodic payments will be specified in 
the timber sale contract. Adjustment of the periodic payment dates in 
the contract may be made when the contracting officer suspends, 
interrupts, or delays operations during the operating season prior to 
the due date for a periodic payment for a reason beyond the control of 
the purchaser. The adjustment may be made when the suspension, 
interruption, or delay can reasonably be expected to last longer than 30 
days or has been in effect for more than 30 days for existing contracts. 
The purchaser shall request such adjustment in writing from the 
contracting officer. The contracting officer will answer such requests 
within 15 days.
    (6) For the purpose of this section, the value of satisfactorily 
completed road construction shall be based on the Bureau of Land 
Management's appraisal allowance. Satisfactory completion of portions of 
the required road construction, to reasonable points that can be easily 
identified in the road construction appraisal, shall be considered as 
completed road construction for purposes of this section.
    (b) Delayed payment of installments shall be allowed if the 
purchaser furnishes a bond as provided in Sec. 5451.2 of this title. A 
deposit shall be paid in the

[[Page 835]]

same manner as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. If cutting 
is permitted before payment, as prescribed in Sec. 5451.2 of this title, 
payment by installment shall be made before any timber may be skidded or 
yarded to a loading point or removed from the contract area. Each 
subsequent installment shall be due and payable without notice when the 
sale value of the timber skidded or yarded to a loading point or removed 
equals the sum of all payments not including the deposit. The unenhanced 
value of timber allowed to be cut in advance of payment shall be limited 
to the amount of the increase over and above the required performance 
bond. Upon payment, the amount of the bond may be applied to other 
timber sold under the contract to permit its cutting in advance of 
payment.
    (c) Where cutting or removal is permitted under payment bond under 
Sec. 5451.4 of this title, a deposit shall be paid as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section. If cutting and/or removal is permitted 
before payment, as provided in Sec. 5451.4 of this title, the purchaser 
shall be billed monthly for timber skidded or yarded to a loading point 
or removed from the contract area and for any related road maintenance 
fees unless a lesser period is agreed to by the authorized officer and 
the purchaser. Payment shall be made within 15 days of the billing date 
shown on the billing form. The unenhanced value of timber allowed to be 
cut and/or removed in advance of payment is limited to the amount of the 
payment bond. Upon payment, the amount of the bond may be applied to 
other timber.

Sec. 5461.3  Total payment.

    The total amount of the contract purchase price must be paid prior 
to expiration of the time for cutting and removal under the contract. 
For a cruise sale the purchaser shall not be entitled to a refund even 
though the amount of timber cut, removed, or designated for cutting may 
be less than the estimated total volume shown in the contract. For a 
scale sale, if it is determined after all designated timber has been cut 
and measured that the total payments made under the contract exceed the 
total sale value of the timber measured, such excess shall be refunded 
to the purchaser within 60 days after such determination is made.

    (c)(1) The authorized officer may cancel a contract or permit upon 
determining that the holder has failed to comply with a law or 
regulation pertinent to the contract or permit. The authorized officer 
may also cancel a contract or permit upon determining that the holder 
has failed to comply with a stipulation or requirement contained in the 
contract or permit and the noncompliance is detrimental to the public 
interest. Individual contracts or permits may contain specific language 
defining the remedies or penalties associated with noncompliance.

Sec. 5473.4  Approval of request.

    (a) If the purchaser shows that his delay in cutting or removal was 
due to causes beyond his control and without his fault or negligence, 
the contracting officer may grant an extension of time, upon written 
request by the purchaser. Such extension will not exceed one year, and 
will require an appraisal, if the delay was not imposed by the United 
States or any State government agency as provided by paragraph (c) of 
this section. Market fluctuations are not cause for consideration of 
contract extensions. Additional extensions may be granted upon written 
request by the purchaser.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
requiring reappraisal if the delay was not imposed by the United States 
or any State government under paragraph (c) of this section, the 
contracting officer may grant an extension of time, without reappraisal, 
not to exceed enough time to provide 30 days of operating time, if the 
delay was due to causes beyond the purchaser's control and without his 
fault or negligence. No additional extensions may be granted without 
reappraisal under the provisions of this paragraph.
    (c) On a showing that the purchaser performed as the average prudent 
operator would be expected to perform in a like time period prior to any 
delaying event listed in this paragraph, the contracting officer may 
grant, without reappraisal, an extension of time not to exceed that 
necessary to provide an additional amount of operating time equal to 
operating time lost as a result of:
    (1) Additional contract requirements incorporated in contract 
modifications requested by the Government;
    (2) Delays necessitated by the requirements for consultation with 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act;

    (5) Closure of operations by State fire protection agencies due to 
fire danger.
    (d) Upon written request of the purchaser, the State Director may 
extend a contract to harvest green timber to allow that purchaser to 
harvest as salvage from Federal lands timber that has been damaged by 
fire or other natural or man-made disaster. The duration of the 
extension shall not exceed the time necessary to meet the salvage 
objectives. The State Director may

[[Page 838]]

also waive reappraisal for such extension.

extension. The authorized officer may require that the reappraised total 
purchase price shall be paid in advance as a condition of granting an 
extension.

contract area shall be reappraised. The reappraised unit price for each 
species shall be effective for the remaining life of the contract: 
Provided, however, The reappraised unit price for each species shall not

Sec. 5500.0-3  Authority.

    (a) The Act of July 31, 1947 (61 Stat. 681), as amended by the Acts 
of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367, 30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and the Act of 
September 25, 1962 (76 Stat. 587) authorizes the disposal of timber and 
other vegetative resources on public lands of the United States 
including lands embraced within an unpatented mining claim located after 
July 23, 1955, if the disposal of such resources is not otherwise 
expressly authorized by law including, but not limited to, the Act of 
June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269; 43 U.S.C. 315 through 315o-1), as amended, 
and the United States mining laws; is not expressly prohibited by laws 
of the United States; and would not be detrimental to the public 
interest.
    (1) The Act also authorizes the United States, its permittees, and 
licensees to use so much of the surface of any unpatented mining claim 
located under the mining law of the United States after July 23, 1955, 
as may be necessary for access to adjacent land for the purposes of such 
permittees or licensees. Any authorized use of the

[[Page 839]]

surface of any such mining claim shall be such as not to endanger or 
materially interfere with prospecting, mining or processing operations 
or uses reasonably incident thereto.
    (2) Where the lands have been withdrawn in aid of a function of a 
Federal department or agency other than the Department of the Interior, 
or of a State, county, municipality, water district, or other local 
governmental subdivision or agency, the Secretary of the Interior may 
make disposals under the regulations in this subpart only with the 
consent of such other Federal department or agency or of such State, or 
local governmental unit. The Act of July 23, 1955, supra, provides, 
however, that the Secretary of Agriculture shall dispose of materials 
under the Act of July 31, 1947, as amended, supra, if such materials are 
on lands administered by the Secretary of Agriculture for national 
forest purposes or for purposes of Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm 
Tenant Act or where withdrawn for the purpose of any other function of 
the Department of Agriculture.
    (3) The provisions of the Act of July 23, 1955, supra, in disposal 
of vegetative or mineral materials do not apply to lands in any national

15, 1938 (52 Stat. 699), so as to permit the use of such timber by 
churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions for firewood, fencing, 
buildings, and for other domestic purposes.


<R04>
                   Subpart 5511--Free Use Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 5511.1  Act of 1878.


<R05>
Sec. 5511.1-1  Free use of timber on mineral and nonmineral public lands.

    (a) Lands on which timber may be cut. Free-use permits to cut timber 
may be issued covering public lands as follows:
    (1) Mineral lands, unoccupied and unreserved and not subject to 
entry under existing laws of the United States, except for mineral 
entry, in the States of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. (Act of June 3, 
1878, 20 Stat. 88; 16 U.S.C. 604 through 606);
    (2) Nonmineral, unoccupied, and unreserved public lands in the 
States mentioned and also in the States of California, Oregon, and 
Washington.
    (b) Kind of timber which may be cut. The proper protection of the 
timber and undergrowth necessarily varies with the nature of the 
topography, soil, and forest. No timber not matured may be cut, and each 
tree taken must be utilized for some beneficial domestic purpose. 
Persons taking timber for specific purposes will be required to take 
only such matured trees as will work up to such purpose without 
unreasonable waste. Stumps will be cut so as to cause the least possible 
waste and all trees will be utilized to as low a diameter in the tops as 
possible. All brush, tops, logs, and other forest debris made in felling 
and removing timber under this section shall be disposed of as best 
adapted to the protection of the remaining growth and in such manner as 
shall be prescribed by the authorized officer, and failure on the part 
of the applicant, or an agent cutting for an

[[Page 841]]

applicant, to comply with this requirement will render him liable for 
all expenses incurred by the authorized officer in putting this 
regulation into effect.
    (c) Area of land to be cut over. The permits shall limit the area of 
cutting to embrace only so much land as is necessary to produce the 
quantity of timber applied for.
    (d) Use which may be made of timber. Timber may be cut under 
approved permit when actually needed for firewood, fencing, building, or 
other agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and domestic purposes.
    (e) Exportation of timber. Timber may not be exported from the State 
in which it is cut except:
    (1) Timber from a specified area in Wyoming may be exported into 
Idaho (Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 618; 16 U.S.C. 607, 611);
    (2) Timber from a specified area in Montana may be exported into 
Wyoming (Act of March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1439; 16 U.S.C. 607, 613);
    (3) Under the Act of March 3, 1919 (40 Stat. 1321; 16 U.S.C. 608), 
citizens of Malheur County, Oregon, may cut timber in Idaho and remove 
such timber to Malheur County, Oregon;
    (4) Under the Act of March 3, 1919 (40 Stat. 1322; 16 U.S.C. 609), 
citizens of Modoc County, California, may cut timber in Nevada and 
remove such timber to Modoc County, California;
    (5) Timber from a specified area in Arizona may be exported into 
Utah (Act of February 27, 1922, 42 Stat. 398; 16 U.S.C. 610);
    (6) Citizens of Bear Lake County, Idaho, may cut timber from public 
lands in Lincoln County, Wyoming, and remove such timber to Bear Lake 
County, Idaho, but no live standing timber may be taken without 
compensation (Act of August 21, 1935, 49 Stat. 665; 16 U.S.C. 611a).
    (f) Application and permit--(1) Information to be furnished by 
applicant. (i) Applications should be filed in duplicate and should set 
forth the names and post-office addresses of the applicants, and any 
agent or agents who may be employed to procure the timber. Where a 
corporation is the applicant, the State in which it was incorporated 
should also be shown.
    (ii) Blank forms for making application may be procured from the 
State Director for the State in which the timber to be removed is 
located.
    (iii) Applications should show the amount of timber required by each 
applicant; the use to be made thereof; a description of the land from 
which the timber is to be cut, by subdivision, section, township, and 
range, if surveyed, or by natural objects sufficient to identify the 
same if unsurveyed; and the date it is desired to begin cutting.
    (2) Duration of permit. All rights and privileges under a permit 
shall terminate at the expiration of the period of 1 year from the date 
of approval of the permit.
    (g) Agents--(1) Cutting of timber by agents. Where one or more 
persons desire timber, and are not in a position to procure the same for 
themselves, an agent or agents may be appointed for that purpose. Such 
agent shall not be paid more than a fair recompense for the time, labor, 
and money expended in procuring the timber and manufacturing the same 
into lumber, and no charge shall be made for the timber itself. The said 
compensation must be set forth in a written contract to be entered into 
by the parties, and a copy thereof must be filed with the application.
    (2) Cutting of timber by agent who is a sawmill operator. If the 
amount of timber applied for exceeds $50 in stumpage value, for any 
continuous period of 12 months, and the timber is to be procured by an 
agent who is a sawmill operator, a bond equal to three times the amount 
of the stumpage value of the timber applied for will be required, 
conditioned upon the faithful performance of the requirements.

Sec. 5511.1-2  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 5511.1-3  Use of timber on lands covered by grazing leases, by lessees, and others.

    (a) Before taking timber under a lease issued under section 15 of 
the Taylor Grazing Act, as amended by the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1978; 43 U.S.C. 315m), the lessee should file application for and 
procure a permit in

[[Page 842]]

accordance with the regulations issued under the Acts of June 3, 1878 
(20 Stat. 88; 16 U.S.C. 604 through 606), and March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 
1093; 16 U.S.C. 607), Secs. 5510.0-3(a) and 5511.1-1(a) to 5511.1-1(g).
    (b) Where application is made by a person other than the lessee to 
take timber from lands embraced in a grazing lease issued under section 
15 of the said Act, investigation should be made to ascertain the facts 
in the case and whether or not the cutting of the timber applied for 
would adversely affect the lands for grazing purposes. If no objection 
appears, the permit may issue but should contain a provision that the 
timber cutting thereunder must be done in such manner as will not 
interfere with the rights of the lessee.
    (c) All applications for timber should be filed with the State 
Director for the State in which the timber to be cut is located and 
should comply with the regulations contained in Sec. 5511.1-1.

(Sec. 1, 20 Stat. 88, as amended, 26 Stat. 1003, as amended; 16 U.S.C.

timber for such use, an application for permit in duplicate on a form 
approved by the Director must be filed, as in other cases, and a copy of 
the contract must be attached to the application.


<R05>
Sec. 5511.2-3  Permits.

    (a) Application for permit. Before timber is cut for free use, an

fails to observe its terms and conditions, or the regulations in 
Secs. 5511.2-1 to 5511.2-6, or if the permit has been issued 
erroneously.
    (3) No timber shall be removed until the permit is issued. If deemed 
necessary by the signing officer, a bond, satisfactory to him, may be 
required as a guarantee of faithful performance of the provisions of the 
permit and the regulations in Secs. 5511.2-1 to 5511.2-6.
    (c) Cutting rules and restrictions. All free-use timber shall be cut 
and removed in accordance with approved forestry and conservation 
practices so as to preserve to the maximum extent feasible all scenic, 
recreational, watershed, and other values of the land and resources. In 
the free-use disposal of timber, the cutting and removal shall be 
accomplished in such manner as to leave the stand in condition for 
continuous production. Moreover, no green timber shall be cut within 300 
feet of either side of the center line of a highway or public road, or 
bordering streams or the shores of lakes designated for recreational use 
unless specifically authorized by the authorized officer, to prevent or 
control fungus infection or insect attacks, or for other reasons found 
sufficient to justify such cutting.
    (d) Amount of timber which may be cut. During each calendar year 
each applicant entitled to the benefits of section 11 of the Act of May

in excess of the amount stated may be granted to churches, hospitals, 
and charitable institutions upon a showing of special necessity 
therefor, and with the approval of the authorized officer.
    (e) Notice of completion of timber cutting operations. Upon 
completion of the cutting and the removal of the timber, the permittee 
must notify the State Director, or other forest officer, stating when 
the work was completed, the land from which the timber was taken, the

<R05>
Sec. 5511.3-6  Permits to governmental units.

    A free-use permit may be issued to a Federal or State agency, unit, 
or subdivision, including a municipality, only if the applicant makes a 
satisfactory showing to the authorized officer that such timber will be 
used for a public project. The right to remove timber under the permit 
is not revoked or terminated by (a) any subsequent claim or entry of the 
lands, (b) by any mining claim located prior to the issuance of the 
permit if such location was subsequent to July 23, 1955, nor (c) by any 
other mining claim as to which the Government's right to manage the 
surface resources has been established in accordance with Group 3800 of 
this chapter, or other proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 5511.3-7  Permits to nonprofit organizations.

    A free-use permit issued to a nonprofit association or corporation 
may not provide for the disposition of more than $100 worth of timber to 
the permittee during any one calendar year. Such permittee is granted a 
right to remove timber as against a subsequent applicant who may wish to 
obtain the same timber by purchase. The timber may not be removed by the 
permittee after the land has been included in a valid claim by reason of 
settlement, entry, or similar rights obtained under the public land 
laws.


<R05>
Sec. 5511.3-8  Permits to mining claimants.

    (a) Free-use timber shall be granted under Sec. 5510.0-3(b) to the 
record owner of a valid mining claim if such claim was located 
subsequent to July 23, 1955, or if the Government's right to manage the 
surface resources has been established in accordance with Group 3400 of 
this chapter, and he requires more timber than is available to him for 
prospecting, mining, or processing operations on his claim or claims 
after disposition of timber from his claim by the United States. The 
claimant shall be entitled to the free use of timber for such 
requirements from the nearest timber administered by the Bureau which is 
substantially equal in kind and quantity to the timber estimated by the 
authorized officer at the time of application to have been disposed of 
by the Bureau from the claim. Upon issuance of a patent to the mining 
claims, the free-use privilege will automatically terminate.
    (b) The application required to be filed for free-use timber under 
this section must contain a statement that the timber applied for will 
be used for bona fide prospecting, mining, or prospecting operations on 
the claim or group of claims designated in the application. The 
applicant must also include a statement that he is the record owner of a

<R05>
Sec. 8342.1  Designation criteria.

    The authorized officer shall designate all public lands as either 
open, limited, or closed to off-road vehicles. All designations shall be 
based on the protection of the resources of the public lands, the 
promotion of the safety of all the users of the public lands, and the 
minimization of conflicts among various uses of the public lands; and in 
accordance with the following criteria:
    (a) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize damage to soil, 
watershed, vegetation, air, or other resources of the public lands, and 
to prevent impairment of wilderness suitability.
    (b) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize harassment of 
wildlife or significant disruption of wildlife habitats. Special 
attention will be given to protect endangered or threatened species and 
their habitats.
    (c) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize conflicts between 
off-road vehicle use and other existing or proposed recreational uses of 
the same or neighboring public lands, and to ensure the compatibility of 
such uses with existing conditions in populated areas, taking into 
account noise and other factors.
    (d) Areas and trails shall not be located in officially designated 
wilderness areas or primitive areas. Areas and trails shall be located 
in natural areas only if the authorized officer determines that off-road 
vehicle use in such locations will not adversely affect their natural, 
esthetic, scenic, or other values for which such areas are established.


<R05>
Sec. 8342.2  Designation procedures.

    (a) Public participation. The designation and redesignation of 
trails is accomplished through the resource management planning process 
described in part 1600 of this title. Current and potential impacts of 
specific vehicle types on all resources and uses in the planning area 
shall be considered in

[[Page 851]]

the process of preparing resource management plans, plan revisions, or 
plan amendments. Prior to making designations or redesignations, the 
authorized officer shall consult with interested user groups, Federal, 
State, county and local agencies, local landowners, and other parties in 
a manner that provides an opportunity for the public to express itself 
and have its views given consideration.
    (b) Designation. The approval of a resource management plan, plan 
revision, or plan amendment constitutes formal designation of off-road 
vehicle use areas. Public notice of designation or redesignation shall 
be provided through the publication of the notice required by 
Sec. 1610.5-1(b) of this title. Copies of such notice shall be available 
to the public in local Bureau offices.
    (c) Identification of designated areas and trails. The authorized 
officer shall, after designation, take action by marking and other 
appropriate measures to identify designated areas and trails so that the 
public will be aware of locations and limitations applicable thereto. 
The authorized officer shall make appropriate informational material, 
including maps, available for public review.

similar device, or producing excessive noise exceeding Environmental 
Protection Agency standards, when established, may be operated on public 
lands.
    (c) By posting appropriate signs or by marking a map which shall be 
available for public inspection at local Bureau offices, the authorized 
officer may indicate those public lands upon which no off-road vehicle 
may be operated unless equipped with a properly installed spark 
arrester. The spark arrester must meet either the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture--Forest Service Standard 5100-1a, or the 80-percent 
efficiency level standard when determined by the appropriate Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended Practices J335 or J350. These 
standards include, among others, the requirements that: (1) The spark 
arrester shall have an efficiency to retain or destroy at least 80 
percent of carbon particles for all flow rates, and (2) the spark 
arrester has been warranted by its manufacturer as meeting this 
efficiency requirement for at least 1,000 hours subject to normal use, 
with maintenance and mounting in accordance with the manufacturer's 
recommendation. A spark arrester is not required when an off-road 
vehicle is being operated in an area which has 3 or more inches of snow 
on the ground.
    (d) Vehicles operating during night hours, from a half-hour after 
sunset to a half-hour before sunrise, shall comply with the following:
    (1) Headlights shall be of sufficient power to illuminate an object 
at 300 feet at night under normal, clear atmospheric conditions. Two- or 
three-wheeled vehicles or single-tracked vehicles will have a minimum of 
one headlight. Vehicles having four or more wheels or more than a single 
track will have a minimum of two headlights, except double tracked 
snowmachines with a maximum capacity of two people may have only one 
headlight.

comfort and well-being of the public in its use of recreation areas, 
sites and facilities on public lands.

[[Page 855]]


<R05>
Sec. 8365.0-2  Objective.

    The objective of this subpart is to insure that public lands, 
including recreation areas, sites and facilities, can be used by the 
maximum number of people with minimum conflict among users and minimum 
damage to public lands and resources.


<R05>
Sec. 8365.1  Public lands--general.

    The rules in this subsection shall apply to use and occupancy of all 
public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. 
Additional rules for developed sites and areas are found in Sec. 8365.2 
of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 8365.1-1  Sanitation.

    (a) Whenever practicable, visitors shall pack their trash for 
disposal at home.
    (b) On all public lands, no person shall, unless otherwise 
authorized:
    (1) Dispose of any cans, bottles and other nonflammable trash and 
garbage except in designated places or receptacles;
    (2) Dispose of flammable trash or garbage except by burning in 
authorized fires, or disposal in designated places or receptacles;
    (3) Drain sewage or petroleum products or dump refuse or waste other 
than wash water from any trailer or other vehicle except in places or 
receptacles provided for that purpose;
    (4) Dispose of any household, commercial or industrial refuse or 
waste brought as such from private or municipal property;
    (5) Pollute or contaminate water supplies or water used for human 
consumption; or
    (6) Use a refuse container or disposal facility for any purpose 
other than for which it is supplied.


<R05>
Sec. 8365.1-2  Occupancy and use.

    On all public lands, no person shall:
    (a) Camp longer than the period of time permitted by the authorized 
officer; or
    (b) Leave personal property unattended longer than 10 days (12 
months in Alaska), except as provided under Sec. 8365.2-3(b) of this 
title, unless otherwise authorized. Personal property left unattended 
longer than 10 days (12 months in Alaska), without permission of the 
authorized officer, is subject to disposition under the Federal Property 
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 484(m)).


<R05>
Sec. 8365.1-3  Vehicles.

    (a) When operating a vehicle on the public lands, no person shall 
exceed posted speed limits, willfully endanger persons or property, or 
act in a reckless, careless or negligent manner.
    (b)(1) The operator of a motor vehicle is prohibited from operating 
a motor vehicle in motion, unless the operator and each front seat 
passenger is restrained by a properly fastened safety belt that conforms 
to applicable United States Department of Transportation standards, 
except that children, as defined by State law, shall be restrained as 
provided by State law.
    (2) Paragraph (b) applies on public lands, or portions thereof, that 
are located within a State in which there is no State law in effect that 
requires the mandatory use of a safety belt by the vehicle operator and 
any front seat passenger. It also applies on public lands, or portions 
thereof, located within a State in which the mandatory safety belt law 
of the State does not apply to the public lands or in which any 
provision of State law renders the mandatory safety belt law of the 
State unenforceable by the authorized officer as to acts or omissions 
occurring on the public lands.
    (3) This section does not apply to an operator or a passenger of a 
motor vehicle occupying a seat that was not originally equipped by the 
manufacturer with a safety belt, nor does it apply to an operator or 
passenger with a medical condition that prevents restraint by a safety 
belt or other occupant restraining device.
    (4) An authorized officer may not stop a motor vehicle for the sole 
purpose of determining whether a violation of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is being committed.

purposes of this paragraph, delivery means the actual, attempted or 
constructive transfer of a controlled substance whether or not there 
exists an agency relationship; or

    This subpart sets forth the procedures for authorizing certain 
recreational uses of lands and waters administered by the Bureau.

<R05>
Sec. 8372.0-5  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart:
    (a) Commercial use is recreational use of the public lands for 
business or financial gain. When any permittee, employee or agent of a 
permittee, operator, or participant makes or attempts to make a profit, 
salary, increase his business or financial standing, or supports, in any 
part, other progams or activities from amounts received from or for 
services rendered to customers or participants in the permitted 
activity, as a result of having the special recreation permit, the use 
will be considered commercial. Subsistence activities of Alaskan Natives 
(as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act) in Alaska are 
not considered recreational use. The collection by a permittee or his 
agent of any fee, charge, or other compensation which is not strictly a 
sharing of, or is in excess of, actual expenses incurred for the 
purposes of the activity or use shall make

[[Page 859]]

the activity or use commercial. Use by educational and therapeutic 
institutions is considered commercial when the above criteria are met. 
Profit making organizations are automatically classified as commercial, 
even if that part of their activity covered by the permit is not profit 
making. Nonprofit status of any group or organization under the Internal 
Revenue or Postal Laws or regulations does not in itself determine 
whether an event or activity arranged by such a group or organization is 
noncommercial. Any person, group, or organization seeking to qualify as 
noncommercial shall have the burden of establishing to the satisfaction 
of the authorized officer that no financial or business gain will be 
derived from the proposed use.
    (b) Actual expenses are expenses necessarily incurred for the 
permitted activity or use. These include, but are not limited to, the 
actual costs of such items as expendable equipment and supplies. Actual 
expenses do not include any salaries, profit, increase of capital worth, 
allowances, or subsidies of any other activities of the permittee or 
sponsor, the purchase or amortization of nonexpendable supplies or 
equipment, any allowance for undersubscribed events or any monetary 
compensation for sponsors or participants.

and may be adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in costs. The 
fee schedule shall be incorporated in the Manual of the Bureau of Land 
Management, published periodically in the Federal Register and otherwise 
made generally available to the public.
    (2) Actual costs to the United States shall be charged in lieu of 
the fees provided in the schedule when the estimated cost of issuing and 
monitoring the permit (estimated at the time of application) exceeds 
$5,000, except when the total estimated fees from the schedule over the 
term of the permit exceed the estimated actual cost. In that case, the 
fees from the schedule shall be charged. The authorized officer shall 
notify the applicant in writing of such charges within 30 days of 
receipt of the permit application and shall not process said application 
until payment has been made for such charges.
    (b) Payment of use fees. (1) Payment of fees will be required at the 
time a permit is issued.
    (2) Where the amount of intended use is precisely specified in the 
application, the fee shall be nonrefundable. However, on receipt by the 
authorized officer of notification from the applicant of the intention 
not to use the permit in whole or in part, in sufficient time to allow 
reallocation of use to others, the authorized officer may refund the 
fee, less a minimum amount for permit processing.
    (3) Where the amount of intended use cannot be precisely determined, 
the fee will be based on an estimation and payment will be required of 
that amount. The fee will be adjusted, based on actual use, after use is 
made. Refunds will be made or additional payment will be required to the 
extent the payment requirement for actual use varies from the initial 
amount paid by $10.
    (4) If an applicant is unable to pay the fee in advance, the 
authorized officer may allow the posting of a payment bond or other 
guarantee in an amount equal to the actual or estimated fee. The 
authorized officer will establish a payment date which is no later than 
15 days following the use period.
    (c) Exceptions, exclusions, and exemptions. (1) Nothing contained 
herein shall authorize Federal hunting, trapping, or fishing licenses, 
permits, or fees.
    (2) Fees under provisions of this part shall not be charged and 
permits shall not be required for commercial or other activities not 
related to recreation. Permits may be required but fees shall not be 
charged for uses including, but not limited to, organized tours or 
outings conducted for educational or scientific purposes related to the 
resources of the area visited by bona fide institutions established for 
these purposes.
    (3) Applicants for waiver of fees on this basis may be required to 
provide documentation of their official recognition as educational or 
scientific institutions by Federal, State, or local government bodies or 
any other documentation necessary to demonstrate educational use as 
defined in Sec. 8372.0-5(e) of this title. The use of recreational 
resources for which a waiver on this basis is requested shall relate 
directly to scientific or educational purposes and shall not be 
primarily for recreational purposes.

provided by the United States mining laws then applicable to the public 
lands involved.
    (d) Any person prospecting or locating a mining claim in a Bureau-
administered wilderness area on or after the date the wilderness area 
was included in the National Wilderness Preservation System, but prior 
to the date on which the mining laws cease to apply to that area, shall 
have the rights provided by the United States mining laws, subject to 
the provisions of the Wilderness Act and subsequent establishing 
legislation.
    (e) All mining claimants shall comply with the reasonable 
stipulations established by the authorized officer for the protection of 
resources in accordance with the general purposes of maintaining the 
National Wilderness Preservation System unimpaired for future use and 
enjoyment as wilderness

[[Page 867]]

and preserving its wilderness character, consistent with the use of the 
lands for mineral exploration, development, drilling and production, and 
for transmission lines, water lines, telephone lines or facilities 
necessary in exploring, drilling, producing, mining and processing 
operations. Where the use of mechanized transport, aircraft and 
motorized equipment is essential, these stipulations shall control their 
use.
    (f) As soon as feasible after mining operations cease, but no more 
than one year thereafter, the operator shall remove all structures, 
equipment and other facilities and, no more than 6 months thereafter, 
commence reclamation. Reclamation, including appropriate revegetation, 
shall be completed within a reasonable time as determined by the 
authorized officer. Whenever possible and feasible, reclamation shall 
restore the surface to a contour which appears to be natural, although 
this may not be the original contour. Where such measures are 
impractical or impossible, as determined by the authorized officer, 
reclamation shall provide the maximum achievable slope stability.
    (g) The authorized officer may require the posting of a cash or 
surety bond or other guarantee in such amount as the authorized officer 
determines to be sufficient to defray the costs of reclamation.
    (h) In the development and operation of mining claims, claimants 
shall, to extent practicable as determined by the authorized officer and 
consistent with the use of lands for mineral development, prevent 
erosion, deterioration of the lands, impairment of their wilderness 
character, and the obstruction, pollution, or siltation of the streams, 
lakes and springs.
    (i) The owner of patented mining claims located after the lands were 
included in the National Wilderness Preservation System may cut and use 
as much of the mature timber as is needed in the extraction, removal and 
beneficiation of the mineral deposits, if needed timber is not otherwise 
reasonably available. The cutting shall comply with sound principles of 
forest management as set forth in stipulations issued by the authorized 
officer.
    (j) Where there exists no current approved mineral examination 
report concluding that unpatented mining claims are valid, prior to 
approving plans of operations or allowing previously approved operations 
to continue on unpatented mining claims after the date on which the 
lands were withdrawn from appropriation under the mining laws, the 
authorized officer shall cause a mineral examination of the unpatented 
mining claim to be conducted by a Bureau of Land Management mineral 
examiner to determine whether or not the claim was valid prior to the 
withdrawal and remains valid. If the approved mineral examination report 
concludes that the claim lacks a discovery of a valuable mineral 
deposit, or is invalid for any other reason, the authorized officer 
shall either deny the plan of operation or, in the case of an existing 
approved operation, issue a notice ordering the cessation of operations 
and shall promptly initiate contest proceedings to determine the status 
of the claim conclusively. However, neither the adverse conclusions of 
an approved mineral examination report nor the pendency of contest 
proceedings shall constitute grounds to disallow a plan of operations to 
the extent the plan proposes operations that will cause only 
insignificant surface disturbance and are for the purpose of: (1) Taking 
samples or gathering other evidence of claim validity to confirm and 
corroborate mineral exposures which are physically disclosed and 
existing on the claim prior to the withdrawal date, or (2) performing 
the minimum necessary annual assessment work as required by Sec. 3851.1 
of this title. Surface disturbance exceeding the insignificant level is 
permissible only when it is the minimum disturbance necessary to remove 
mineral samples to confirm and corroborate preexisting exposures of a 
valuable mineral deposit discovered prior to the withdrawal. The 
requirement in this subsection for a mineral examination shall not cause 
a suspension of the time limitations governing approval of operating 
plans contained in Sec. 3809.1-6 of this title. Once a final 
administrative decision is rendered declaring a claim to be null and 
void, all operations, except required reclamation

[[Page 868]]

work, shall be disallowed and shall cease unless and until such decision 
is reversed in a judicial review action.
    (k) Activities, including prospecting under the United States mining 
laws, for the purpose of gathering information about minerals in 
wilderness, shall be allowed, except that any such activity for 
gathering mineral information after the date on which the United States 
mining laws cease to apply shall be conducted in a manner compatible 
with the preservation of the wilderness environment. After such date, 
mining claims shall not be located in wilderness areas.

<R05>
Sec. 8560.4-7  Mineral leases and mineral permits.

    (a) No mineral leases shall be issued under the mineral leasing laws 
in any wilderness area on public lands.
    (b) Holders of valid mineral leases established on any Bureau-
administered wilderness area before the date such unit was included in 
the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be accorded the rights 
granted by the terms and conditions of the specific leases.
    (c) Subject to valid existing rights, no person shall obtain any 
right or interest in or to any mineral deposits that may be discovered 
in a wilderness area through prospecting or other information-gathering 
activity after the date on which the laws pertaining to mineral leasing 
cease to apply to the specific wilderness area.
    (d) Permits shall not be issued for the removal of mineral materials 
commonly known as common varieties under the Materials Act of July 31, 
1947, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 601, 604).


<R05>
Sec. 8560.4-8  Water and power resources.

    Prospecting for water resources and the establishment of new 
reservoirs, water-conservation works, power projects, transmission lines 
and other facilities needed in the public interest, and the subsequent 
maintenance of such facilities, all pursuant to section 4(d)(4)(1) of 
the Wilderness Act, may be permitted if specifically authorized by the 
President.


<R05>
Sec. 8560.5  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who knowingly and willfully violates the regulations 
in Sec. 8560.1-2 is subject to arrest, conviction and punishment by a 
fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 12 
months, or both.
    (b) At the request of the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney 
General may institute a civil action in any United States district court 
for an injunction or other appropriate order to prevent any person from 
utilizing public lands in violation of the regulations of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 9180.0-2  Objectives.

    (a) Alaska; existing surveys and extension thereof. The surveys up 
to the present time have been confined to known agricultural areas, the 
coal fields, and such other lands as have been considered to be suitable 
for development by settlers or otherwise. The extensions of the surveys 
to other areas will be governed largely by the character of the lands 
and their suitability for use, development, and administration under the 
public land laws applicable to Alaska.
    (b) Resurveys. The real interest of the Government in the resurvey 
of the public lands is well stated in the said Act of March 3, 1909, 
``to properly mark the boundaries of the public lands remaining 
undisposed of.'' Its duty being thus defined, the Bureau of Land 
Management will refrain from attempting to do more in the relocation of 
the corners of privately owned lands in a township being resurveyed than 
to reestablish such corners from the best available evidence of the 
original survey.


<R05>
Sec. 9180.0-3  Authority.

    (a) Delegation to Director, Bureau of Land Management. (1) In the 
establishment of the Bureau of Land Management by Reorganization Plan 
No. 3 of 1946, the office of Supervisor of Surveys was abolished and the 
functions and powers thereof were transferred to the Secretary of the 
Interior, to be performed by such officers or agencies of the Department 
as might be designated by the Secretary. Under that authority, the 
functions and powers formerly exercised by the Supervisor of Surveys 
were delegated to the Chief Cadastral Engineer, subject to the 
supervision of the Director, Bureau of Land Management. In the general 
reorganization and realignment of functions of the Bureau, the office of 
Chief Cadastral Engineer has been abolished, and the functions of that 
office have been delegated to the Director.
    (2) By this sequence, the cadastral surveying work of the Bureau of 
Land Management has been placed under the

[[Page 870]]

immediate jurisdiction of the Director, subject to the direction and 
control of the Secretary of the Interior. Certain functions relating to 
specific phases of the cadastral surveying work have been delegated to 
the State Director.
    (b) Alaska. The rectangular system of survey of the public lands was 
extended to the State of Alaska by the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 
1098; 48 U.S.C. 351). The regular township surveys in Alaska conform to 
that system, but departures therefrom are permitted under the conditions 
stated in the Act of April 13, 1926 (44 Stat. 243; 48 U.S.C. 379), and 
in certain other cases, such as special surveys for trade and 
manufacturing sites, headquarters sites, and homesites under section 10 
of the Act of May 14, 1898 (30 Stat. 413; 48 U.S.C. 461), as amended; 
for soldiers additional entries, pursuant to sections 2306 and 2307 of 
the Revised Statutes (43 U.S.C. 274, 278); and for small tracts under 
the Act of June 1, 1938 (52 Stat. 609; 43 U.S.C. 682a), as amended.
    (1) Administration of the public land surveying activities in Alaska 
is under the general supervision of the State Director, Bureau of Land 
Management, at Anchorage, Alaska. The office, in which the records 
relating to the public land surveys in the State are maintained, is 
located at Anchorage, Alaska. Correspondence relating to local survey 
matters should be addressed to the State Director, Juneau, Alaska.
    (c) Resurvey of township--(1) Without cost to applicant when title 
to at least 50 percent of the area is in the United States. The Act of 
March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 845), as amended by the Joint Resolution of June 
25, 1910 (36 Stat. 884; 43 U.S.C. 772), authorizes the Secretary of the 
Interior to cause to be made such resurveys of the public lands as after 
full investigation he may deem essential to properly mark the boundaries 
of the public lands remaining undisposed of.
    (2) Cost to be prorated between applicants and United States, when 
more than 50 percent of the area is privately owned. (i) The Act of 
September 21, 1918 (40 Stat. 965; 43 U.S.C. 773), provides authority for 
the resurvey by the Government of townships heretofore held to be 
ineligible for resurvey under existing departmental regulations by 
reason of disposals in excess of 50 percent of the total area thereof.
    (ii) Under the Act mentioned, and upon the application of the owners 
of three-fourths of the privately owned lands in any township previously 
surveyed, or upon the application of a court of competent jurisdiction, 
accompanied by a deposit of funds sufficient to cover the estimated 
cost, inclusive of the necessary office work, of the resurvey of all of 
the privately owned lands in such township, the State Director, Bureau 
of Land Management, is authorized, in his discretion, to cause to be 
made a resurvey of the township in question in accordance with the laws 
and regulations governing surveys and resurveys of the public lands; the 
cost of the resurvey of the residue of the public lands in such township 
to be paid by the Government from the current annual appropriation for 
the survey and resurvey of the public lands in addition to the portion 
thereof made available for resurveys and retracements by the provisions 
of the Act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 845), as amended by Joint 
Resolution of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 884; 43 U.S.C. 772). The total 
cost of the resurvey of the township is thus divided between the 
Government and the petitioners in proportion to the extent of their 
respective holdings.
    (iii) It is further provided that any portion of such deposit in 
excess of the actual cost of the field and office work incident to such 
resurvey of privately owned lands shall be repaid pro rata to the 
applicants for resurvey or to their legal representatives.


<R05>
Sec. 9180.1  Interpretation of survey records.


<R05>
Sec. 9180.1-1  Meridians.

    (a) Alaska. The public land surveys in Alaska are governed by three 
principal meridians established as follows: The Seward Meridian, 
initiated just north of Resurrection Bay and extending to the Matanuska 
coal fields; the Fairbanks Meridian, commencing near the town of 
Fairbanks and controlling the surveys in that vicinity, including the 
Nenana coal fields; and the Copper River Meridian which lies in the 
valley of the Copper River and from which

[[Page 871]]

surveys have been executed as far north as the Tanana River and south to 
the Bering River coal fields and the Gulf of Alaska.
    (b) Copies of records. Copies of plats of surveys in Alaska, or 
other records of the Public Survey Office, will be sold at the cost of 
production, in accordance with section 1 of the Act of August 24, 1912 
(37 Stat. 497), as amended (5 U.S.C. 488), and Sec. 2.3 of this title.

<R05>
Sec. 9185.1-1  Surveys.

    (a) Original surveys. Application for the original extension of the 
rectangular system of public land surveys to include unsurveyed 
townships should be filed in duplicate with the State Director for the 
State in which the lands are situated. The application may be in letter 
form, and should describe the unsurveyed area by township and range of 
the public surveys, and should set forth the interest of the applicant 
in the land and the basis of need for extension of the surveys.
    (b) Lands omitted from original survey. Application for the survey 
of an unsurveyed island or other land omitted from the original survey 
shall be made on Form 9600-2, or its equivalent, and filed in duplicate 
with the State director for the State in which lands are situated.

<R05>
Sec. 9185.1-2  Resurveys.

    (a) Filing of applications for survey without cost to applicant. The 
application prepared in accordance with this part, should be submitted 
to the State Director for the State in which the lands are situated.
    (b) Filing of applications for survey with cost prorated. 
Applications for resurvey based upon the provisions of the Act of 
September 21, 1918, prepared in accordance with this part should be 
submitted to the State Director for the State in which the lands are 
situated. Prior to filing formal application, however, the interested 
parties should obtain from the proper office, as above designated, an 
estimate of the cost of the proposed resurvey.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.1-3  Mining claims.

    (a) Application for survey. Application for the survey of a mining 
claim should be filed with the State Director for the State in which the 
claim is situated.
    (b) Mineral surveyors. See Sec. 3861.5-1 for the appointment of 
mineral surveyors pursuant to section 2334 of the Revised Statutes (30 
U.S.C. 39).

<R05>
Sec. 9185.2-1  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 9185.2-2  Lands omitted from original survey.

    (a) Notice of intended application. Notice of intention to apply for 
survey of an island or other land omitted from the original survey shall 
be served on the adjacent land owners, and the Attorney General and the 
Secretary of State for the State in which the land is situated, at least 
30 days prior to the date of application for survey. Service may be had 
by return receipt mail or in person, evidence of which may consist of 
the return receipt or signed acknowledgment of service. A copy of each 
notice, with proof of service thereof, shall be filed with the 
application. Failure to obtain evidence of service may be explained.
    (b) Form of notice. No particular form of notice is prescribed. The 
notice must make it clear, however, that the land covered by the 
application is contended

[[Page 872]]

to be public land of the United States and subject to survey and 
administration as such, and that any protest against the proposed survey 
should be filed with the appropriate State Director. It must be shown 
what particular surveyed lands opposite the island, or adjoining the 
unsurveyed land, are owned by the adjacent land owner on whom the notice 
is served.
    (c) Evidence required as to character of land in existence at time 
of original survey. An application for the survey of an island or other 
land omitted from the original survey must be accompanied by evidence 
showing that the land was in existence and above ordinary high-water 
elevation when the State was admitted into the Union, and when the 
adjacent lands were surveyed. Such evidence should consist of statements 
from at least two persons familiar with the land, as to its size, 
elevation, and appearance, and the species, size, and age of the timber 
growth thereon, or nature of other vegetation.
    (d) Diagram required with application. A diagram showing the 
approximate configuration of the island or other land applied for, and 
its location with reference, to the public land surveys, must accompany 
the application.
    (e) Cost of survey. In the event of approval of the application, the 
costs of the survey will be borne by the Government.
    (f) No preference right. Should the island or other land be surveyed 
as public land, no preference right to acquire the same under the laws 
governing the disposal of public lands will be gained by the filing of 
the application for survey.

<R05>
Sec. 9185.2-3  Unsurveyed islands and omitted lands.

    (a) Section 211(a) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 
1976 (90 Stat. 2758), provides for the conveyance under the Recreation 
and Public Purposes Act of unsurveyed islands determined by the 
Secretary to be public lands of the United States. The conveyance of any 
such island may be made without survey; however, such island shall be 
surveyed at the request of the qualified applicant. If the applicant 
requests that a survey be executed, the applicant shall be required to:
    (1) Furnish a written statement identifying his choice of donation 
of money, services, or both for the survey.
    (2) If the applicant elects to donate money, such donation shall 
equal the Bureau of Land Management's estimated cost of survey. The 
donated money shall be credited and expended in accordance with section 
307(c) of the Act. A written estimate of such costs shall be furnished 
to the applicant by the Bureau.
    (3) If the applicant elects to donate services, such services shall 
be conducted and performed pursuant to the criteria established by the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Management.
    (b) Section 211(b) of the Act, provides for conveyance, under the 
Recreation and Public Purposes Act (43 U.S.C. 869), of lands other than 
islands determined by the Secretary by survey to be public lands of the 
United States erroneously or fraudulently omitted from the original 
surveys. An applicant may be required to donate money, services, or a 
combination thereof for such survey. The procedures contained in 
Sec. 9185.2-3(a) of this title shall be followed.

[44 FR 41795, July 18, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 9185.3  Requirements for resurveys; without cost to applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.3-1  Eligibility.

    (a) Determined by ownership of land. As a general rule, and in the 
absence of any particular governmental purpose to be subserved, no 
township is eligible for resurvey unless title to at least 50 percent of 
the area of the lands embraced therein remains in the United States. For 
the purpose of determining the eligibility of a township under this 
rule, lands covered by approved selections, school sections, and entries 
upon which final certificates or patents have been issued are to be 
considered as alienated lands. Townships within the primary limits of 
railroad land grants are generally ineligible.
    (b) Determined by physical character of remaining public land. In 
general no resurvey will be undertaken unless the preliminary 
examination of the township develops evidence of existing settlement and 
agricultural possibilities

[[Page 873]]

sufficient to support the presumption that the unappropriated lands 
therein are such as to attract bona fide entrymen, thus eliminating 
townships which, although theoretically eligible, are of such a physical 
character that the resurvey thereof would serve no useful purpose.
    (c) Small areas. In the application of the terms of the Act of March 
3, 1909 (35 Stat. 845), as amended, is not intended that there shall be 
undertaken any work involving the mere reestablishment of lost or 
obliterated or misplaced corners in a limited area of a township, such 
work being within the province of the local surveyors, and the authority 
of the public survey office will be limited to the giving of advice in 
accordance with the circular for the restoration of lost or obliterated 
corners. Employees of the Bureau of Land Management are prohibited from 
participating in the resurvey of a township, the reestablishment of lost 
corners, or in the subdivision of sections for private parties, even if 
the expense is borne by the county or municipal authorities or by 
individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.3-2  Showing required.

    (a) Necessity. The applicants for the resurvey of any township are 
required to present satisfactory prima facie evidence of the necessity 
for such action, based either upon general obliteration of evidences of 
the original survey or upon conditions so grossly defective as to 
preclude the possibility of a reasonably certain identification of the 
subdivisions of the subsisting survey or a satisfactory local 
restoration thereof.
    (b) Condition of original survey. Applications for the resurvey of 
each township must be supported by evidence in the form of a statement, 
preferably from the county or other competent surveyor, showing in 
detail that the evidences of the original survey have been obliterated 
to such an extent as to make it impracticable to apply the suggestions 
of the circular issued by the Bureau of Land Management for the 
necessary restoration of the lines and corners in the proper 
identification of the legal subdivisions occupied by the present or 
prospective entrymen or that the obliteration of the original monuments 
has become so advanced that the land boundaries can be identified only 
through extensive retracements by experienced engineers of the Bureau of 
Land Management.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.3-3  Majority of land owners.

    A majority of the settlers in each township are required to join in 
the application, and, in addition, there must appear the endorsements of 
the entrymen and owners, including the State, whose holdings represent 
the major part of the area entered or patented, with a description 
opposite each name of the lands actually occupied, entered, or owned, 
and a statement as to whether the applicant is a settler, entryman, or 
owner thereof. Where an entryman or owner, including the State, has 
failed for any reason whatsoever to join in the application, evidence of 
service of notice upon him for at least 30 days in advance of the filing 
of the application is required in order that he may be afforded ample 
opportunity to make timely protest against the granting of such resurvey 
if in his opinion such action is undesirable.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.4  Requirements for resurvey; with cost prorated.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.4-1  Estimate of cost.

    (a) The cost of resurvey procedure is as a rule considerably in 
excess of that incident to the execution of original surveys and may 
range between rather wide limits. Where the obliteration is not 
excessive and the evidences of the original survey are harmoniously 
related, extensive verifying retracements will be unnecessary and 
ordinary dependent methods of resurvey can usually be applied. If, 
however, the obliteration is general or total, many miles of preliminary 
retracement may be required in order to obtain technical control, and 
where, by reason of errors in the original survey, the existing 
evidences thereof are discordant and conflicting locations have 
resulted, the procedure required may, in the case of densely entered 
townships, involve an expense of $5,000 or more per township.
    (b) The applicants for resurvey should understand, therefore, that 
although the estimate supplied will be as

[[Page 874]]

nearly correct as the available information will permit, its accuracy 
cannot be guaranteed, and, consequently, all such estimates are subject 
to revision, if necessary, as the work proceeds and the field conditions 
are more fully developed. Any deposit in excess of actual cost will be 
returned to the applicants as provided by law, but in cases where the 
cost exceeds the deposit made in accordance with the estimate, an 
additional deposit will be required, failing which, operations will be 
suspended.
    (c) In the application of the terms of this Act it is not intended 
that there shall be undertaken any work involving the mere 
reestablishment of lost or obliterated or misplaced corners in a limited 
area of a township, such work being within the province of the local 
surveyor, and the authority of the State Director will be restricted to 
the giving of advice in accordance with the circular for the restoration 
of lost or obliterated corners. Employees of the Government are 
prohibited from participating in the resurvey of a township or the 
reestablishment of lost corners or in the subdivision of sections for 
private parties, even if the expense is borne by the county or State 
authorities or by individuals, except as such action is specifically 
authorized by the Director, Bureau of Land Management, in accordance 
with the provisions of existing statutes.
    (d) Deposit required: The deposit required of the petitioners by law 
must accompany the application and must be made in the amount, at the 
place and in the manner prescribed by the instructions which will 
accompany the estimate.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.4-2  Showing required.

    (a) Necessity. The applicants for the resurvey of any township are 
required to present satisfactory prima facie evidence of the necessity 
for such action. In general, it must be shown that the evidences of the 
original survey are so widely obliterated or that the prevailing survey 
conditions are so grossly defective as to preclude the satisfactory 
identification of the subdivisions of the subsisting survey or that the 
evidences of the original survey are in such an advanced state of 
deterioration that action looking to their preservation and perpetuation 
is expedient as in the public interest.
    (b) Ownership of land. The applicants for resurvey are required to 
preface their petition by the statement that the extent of privately 
owned lands within the township is in excess of 50 percent of the total 
area thereof. If necessary, information in this connection may be 
obtained by the petitioners from the manager of the land office having 
local jurisdiction. Failure to comply with the condition set forth in 
this section or material error in the showing made, will not only result 
in delaying action upon the petition, but may require its rejection if 
it is found that the township is not properly subject to resurvey under 
the terms of the governing Act.


<R05>
Sec. 9185.4-3  Three-fourths of land owners.

    The owners of three-fourths of the privately owned lands within the 
township are required to join in the application, and all petitioners in 
whom ownership is vested, either individuals, the State, or corporations 
such as railroad companies whose interests are involved, are further 
required to supply, following their respective signatures, an accurate 
description by legal subdivision, section, township, and range of the 
lands to which title is claimed. Moreover, it must appear that notice of 
the proposed resurvey has been served upon all owners who have for any 
reason failed to join in the petition, and, in addition, it is highly 
desirable that all record entrymen who, under the terms of the act are 
not required to become parties to the petition, be similarly informed to 
the end that their objections, if any, may be heard and subsequent 
protest based upon the plea of ignorance may, insofar as possible, be 
avoided.

vegetative resources, coal, oil, and other trespass in accordance with 
the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of 
Mason et al. v. United States (260 U.S. 545, 67 L. ed. 396), will be the

<R05>
Sec. 9239.0-9  Sale, lease, permit, or license to trespassers.

    (a) For the purpose of this section, a trespasser is any person, 
partnership, association, or corporation responsible for the unlawful 
use of, or injury to, property of the United States.
    (b) The authorized officer may refuse to sell to a trespasser timber 
or materials, or to issue to him a lease, permit, or license if, after a 
demand for payment has been served by certified or registered mail on 
the trespasser, a satisfactory arrangement for payment of the debt due 
the United States has not been made within reasonable time, and there is 
reason for the authorized officer to believe payment will not be made. 
Satisfactory arrangement shall be deemed to have been made by:
    (1) Payment by the trespasser of the amount found to be due by the 
authorized officer, by a final judgment of a court, or pursuant to a 
compromise settlement accepted by the United States; or
    (2) Execution by the trespasser of a promissory note or installment 
agreement, satisfactory to the authorized officer, so long as the 
agreed-upon payments are made on schedule; or
    (3) Delivery by the trespasser of a bond guaranteeing payment to the 
United States of the amount found to be due by the authorized officer or 
by a court of competent jurisdiction; or
    (4) Cancellation of the debt due the United States by a discharge in 
bankruptcy.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
the authorized officer may sell to a trespasser timber or materials or 
issue to him a lease, permit, or license for materials despite lack of a 
satisfactory arrangement for payment if such officer establishes in 
writing that:
    (1) There is no other qualified bidder or no other qualified bidder 
will meet the high bid, and
    (2) The sale, lease, permit, or license to the trespasser is 
necessary to protect substantial interests of the United States either 
by preventing deterioration of, or damage to, resources of the United 
States or by accepting an advantageous offer, and
    (3) The timber management or other resource management program of 
the United States will not be adversely affected by the action.

    (b) The cutting of timber from the public land in Alaska, other than 
in accordance with the terms of the law and Secs. 5511.2 to 5511.2-6 of

States in a civil action for trespass and such persons may be prosecuted 
criminally under title 18 U.S.C., or under State law.

<R05>
Sec. 9239.1-3  Measure of damages.

    (a) Unless State law provides stricter penalties, in which case the 
State law shall prevail, the following minimum

[[Page 878]]

damages apply to trespass of timber and other vegetative resources:
    (1) Administrative costs incurred by the United States as a

value at the time of the trespass when the violation was willful.
    (4) In the case of a purchase from a trespasser, if the purchaser 
has no knowledge of the trespass, but should have had such knowledge 
through reasonable diligence, the value at the time of the purchase.

deemed to limit the measure of damages that may be determined under 
State law.

<R05>
Sec. 9239.2  Unlawful enclosures or occupancy.


<R05>
Sec. 9239.2-1  Enclosures of public lands in specified cases declared unlawful.

    (a) Section 1 of the Act of February 25, 1885 (23 Stat. 321; 43 
U.S.C. 1061), declares any enclosure of public lands made or maintained 
by any party, association, or corporation who ``had no claim or color of 
title made or acquired in good faith, or an asserted right thereto, by 
or under claim, made in good faith with a view to entry thereof at the 
proper land office under the general laws of the United States at the 
time any such enclosure was or shall be made'' to be unlawful and 
prohibits the maintenance of erection thereof.
    (b) Section 4 of the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 
1271; 43 U.S.C. 315o) provides:

    Fences * * * and other improvements necessary to the care and 
management of the permitted livestock may be constructed on the public 
lands within such grazing districts under permit issued by the authority 
of the Secretary, or under such cooperative arrangement as the Secretary 
may approve.

    (c) Section 10, paragraph (4) of the Federal Range Code, Sec. 4112.3 
of this chapter, containing rules for the administration of grazing 
districts prohibits ``Constructing or maintaining any kind of 
improvements, structures, fences, or enclosures on the Federal range, 
including stock driveways, without authority of law or a permit.''
    (d) Section 2 of the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 
1270; 43 U.S.C. 315a), provides that ``any willful violation of the 
provisions of this act'' or of ``rules and regulations thereunder after 
actual notice thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than 
$500.''
    (e) Violations of any of the provisions of the Act of February 25, 
1885, constitute a misdemeanor (Sec. 4, 23 Stat. 322; 35 Stat. 40; 43 
U.S.C. 1064).


<R05>
Sec. 9239.2-2  Duty of district attorney.

    Section 2 of the Act of February 25, 1885 (23 Stat. 321; 43 U.S.C. 
1062, 28 U.S.C. 41, Par. 21), provides that it shall be the duty of the 
district attorney of the United States for the proper district on 
affidavit filed with him by any citizen of the United States that such 
unlawful enclosure is being made or maintained, showing the description 
of the lands enclosed with reasonable certainty so that the enclosure 
may be identified, to institute a civil suit in the proper United States 
district or circuit court or territorial district court in the name of 
the United States and against the parties named or described who shall 
be in charge of or controlling the enclosure complained of.


<R05>
Sec. 9239.2-3  Responsibility for execution of law.

    The execution of this law devolves primarily upon the officers of 
the Department of Justice, but as it is the purpose to free the public 
lands from unlawful enclosures and obstructions, it is deemed incumbent 
upon the officers of the Department of the Interior to furnish the 
officers of the Department of Justice with the evidence necessary to a 
successful prosecution of the law.

[[Page 879]]


<R05>
Sec. 9239.2-4  Filing of charges or complaints.

    All charges or complaints against unlawful enclosures or 
obstructions upon the public lands should be filed with the proper State 
Director. Such charges or complaints, when possible, should give the 
name and address of the party or parties making or maintaining such 
enclosure or obstruction and should describe the land enclosed in such a 
way that it may be readily identified. The section, township, and range 
numbers should be given, if possible.


<R05>
Sec. 9239.2-5  Settlement and free passage over public lands not to be obstructed.

    Section 3 of the Act of February 25, 1885 (23 Stat. 322; 43 U.S.C. 
1063), provides that no person by force, threats, intimidation, or by 
any fencing or enclosing or any other unlawful means shall prevent or 
obstruct or shall combine or confederate with others to prevent or 
obstruct any person from peaceably entering upon or establishing a 
settlement or residence upon any tract of public land subject to 
settlement or entry under the public land laws of the United States or 
shall prevent or obstruct free passage or transit over or through the 
public lands.


<R05>
Sec. 9239.3  Grazing, Alaska.

    (a) Reindeer. (1) Any use of the Federal lands for reindeer grazing 
purposes, unless authorized by a valid permit issued in accordance with 
the regulations in subpart 4132 of this chapter, is unlawful and is 
prohibited.
    (2) Any person who willfully violates any of the rules and 
regulations in subpart 4132 of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by 
imprisonment for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than 
$500.
    (b) Livestock. (1) Grazing livestock upon, allowing livestock to 
drift and graze on, or driving livestock across lands that are subject 
to lease or permit under the provisions of this part or within a stock 
driveway, without a lease or other authorization from the Bureau of Land 
Management, is prohibited and constitutes trespass. Trespassers will be 
liable in damages to the United States for the forage consumed and for 
injury to Federal property, and may be subject to civil and criminal 
prosecution for such unlawful acts. A lessee who grazes livestock in 
violation of the terms and conditions of his lease by exceeding numbers 
specified, or by allowing the livestock to be on Federal land in an area 
or at a time different from that designated in his lease shall be in 
default and shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 4131.2-7 (g) and 
(h) of this chapter. Under section 2 of the Act, any person who 
willfully grazes livestock on public lands without authority, shall, 
upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $500.
    (2) Whenever it appears that a violation exists the authorized 
officer shall serve written notice upon the alleged violator. The notice 
shall set forth the act or omission constituting such violation and will 
allow the party involved a reasonable specified time from receipt of 
notice to demonstrate that there has been no violation or that he has 
since achieved compliance. If the showing is satisfactory to the 
authorized officer he will close the case. If satisfactory showing is 
not made within the time allowed, the violation alleged in the notice 
will be deemed to have been willful.
    (3) Where the owner of the trespassing livestock, or his 
representative, is known, the authorized officer shall determine the 
amount of the damage to the public land and other property of the United 
States and shall make a demand for payment upon the alleged violator 
setting forth the foregoing values including the value of the forage 
consumed. Such forage value shall be computed at the commercial rates, 
if susceptible to proof by reasonably available and reliable data; 
otherwise, a minimum charge of $2 per animal unit month for trespass not 
clearly willful will be made. Where the trespasses are repeated and/or 
willful, a minimum charge of $4 per animal unit month for forage 
consumed will be charged. All offers for settlement for value of forage 
consumed and for damage to the public land or to other property of the 
United States resulting from an alleged violation of any provision of 
the act or regulations found

[[Page 880]]

within Sec. 4131.0-3 et seq. of this chapter in the amount of $2,000 or 
less may be accepted by the authorized officer. Offers for settlement in 
excess of $2,000 will be transmitted to the State Director for 
appropriate action. An offer of settlement will not constitute 
satisfaction of civil liability for consumed forage and damage involved 
until finally accepted by the authorized officer or the State Director, 
and in no event will it relieve the violator of criminal liability. No 
lease or permit will be issued or renewed until payment of any amount 
found to be due the United States under this section has been offered.

<R05>
Sec. 9239.5-1  Ores.

    (a) For ores trespass in a State where there is no State law 
governing such trespass, the measure of damages will be as follows:
    (1) Measure of damages is the same as in the case of coal. Benson 
Mining and Smelting Co. v. Alta Mining and Smelting Co. (145 U.S. 428, 
36 L. ed. 762; Durant Mining Co. v. Percy Consolidated Mining Co. (93 
Fed. 166)).


<R05>
Sec. 9239.5-2  Oil.

    For oil trespass in a State where there is no State law governing 
such trespass, the measure of damages will be as follows:
    (a) Innocent trespass. Value of oil taken, less amount of expense 
incurred in taking the same.
    (b) Willful trespass. Value of the oil taken without credit or 
deduction for the expense incurred by the wrongdoers in getting it. 
Mason v. United States (273 Fed. 135).


<R05>
Sec. 9239.5-3  Coal.

    (a) Determination of payment in coal trespass. For coal trespass in 
a State where there is no State law governing such trespass, the measure 
of damages will be as follows:
    (1) For innocent trespass, payment must be made for the value of the 
coal in place before severance. United States v. Homestake Mining 
Company (117 Fed. 481).
    (2) For willful trespass, payment must be made for the full value of 
the coal at the time of conversion without deduction for labor bestowed 
or expense incurred in removing and marketing the coal. Liberty Bell 
Gold Mining Company v. Smuggler-Union Mining Company (203 Fed. 795). The 
mining of coal in trespass is presumed to be willful, in the absence of 
persuasive evidence of the innocence and good faith of the trespasser. 
United States v. Ute Coal and Coke Company (158 Fed. 20).
    (b) Coal mined when there is no lease in effect. Any mining of coal 
which is not pursuant to a coal lease in effect at the time of the 
mining shall constitute a trespass, and the coal so mined must be paid 
for on a trespass basis.
    (c) Coal mined by successful bidder at public sale. The successful 
bidder at public sale for a coal leasing unit does not acquire any right 
to mine coal until he has complied with all the formalities required by

the issuance of a lease is in trespass and must be paid for on a 
trespass basis.

account settled. No coal permit, lease, or license will be issued to 
anyone known to have mined coal in trespass until the trespass account 
is settled.

of land patented with a reservation of the coal deposits, either under 
the act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 844; 30 U.S.C. 81), or under the Act 
of June 22, 1910 (36 Stat. 583; 30 U.S.C. 83-85), has the right to mine 
coal for use upon the land for domestic purposes at any time prior to 
the disposal by the United States of the coal deposits.
    (f) Penalties for unauthorized exploration for coal. (1) Any person 
who willfully conducts coal exploration for commercial purposes without 
an exploration license issued under subpart 3507 of this chapter shall 
be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 for each day of violation.
    (2) All data collected by said person on any Federal lands as a 
result of such

[[Page 881]]

violations shall immediately be made available to the Secretary, who 
shall make the data available to the public as soon as possible.
    (3) No penalty under this section may be assessed unless such person 
is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to such 
violation pursuant to part 4 of this chapter.

    For turpentine trespass in a State where there is no State law 
governing such trespass, the measure of damages will be as follows:
    (a) Innocent trespass. Value of the gum and injury done to the 
trees. United States v. Taylor (35 Fed. 484).

Sec. 9239.7-1  Public lands.

    The filing of an application under part 2800, 2810, or 2880, of this 
chapter does not authorize the applicant to use or occupy the public 
lands for right-of-way purposes, except as provided at Secs. 2800.0-
5(m), 2802.1(d) and 2882.1, until written authorization has been issued 
by the authorized officer. Any unauthorized occupancy or use of public 
lands or improvements for right-of-way purposes constitutes a trespass 
against the United States for which the trespasser is liable for costs, 
damages, and penalties as provided in Secs. 2801.3, 2812.1-3, and 
2881.3, of this title. No new permit, license, authorization or grant of 
any kind shall be issued to a trespasser until:
    (a) The trespass claim is fully satisfied; or
    (b) The trespasser files a bond conditioned upon payment of the 
amount of damages determined to be due the United States; or
    (c) The authorized officer determines in writing that there is a 
legitimate dispute as to the fact of the trespasser's liability or as to 
the extent of his liability and the trespasser files a bond in an amount 
determined by the authorized officer to be sufficient to cover payment 
of a future court judgment in favor of the United States.

regulations that have a bearing on how the Commission conducts its 
business, with specific reference to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination 
Act of 1934, as amended (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.); the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); 
and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
seq.).
    Plan and five-year plan refer to the Commission's mitigation and 
conservation plan as required by section 301 of the Act.
    Planning rule refers to this part, which is a component of the 
Commission's administrative rules and which provides guidance for the 
development, and implementation, of the Commission's plan.
    Section 8 funds refers to the section of the Colorado River Storage 
Project Act that provides for congressionally authorized funds to be 
used in mitigating the effects of the Colorado River Storage Project on 
fish, wildlife, and related recreation resources.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.3  Policy.

    (a) As directed in section 301(a) of the Act, the Commission was 
established ``to coordinate the implementation of the mitigation and 
conservation provisions of this Act among the Federal and State fish, 
wildlife, and recreation agencies. The United States Senate Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources report accompanying the Act provided 
further clarification of Congressional intent: ``Focusing of such 
authority into a single entity is intended to eliminate past dispersion 
among several Federal and State resource management agencies of the 
responsibility, and therefore accountability, for reclamation mitigation 
in Utah.''
    (b) It is the policy of the Commission that the mitigation and 
conservation plan, in tandem with the Act, serve as the principal 
guidance for the Commission in fulfilling its mitigation and 
conservation responsibilities. Further, the Commission will use the 
development of the plan, and subsequent amendment processes, as the 
primary means to involve agencies and the public in the Commission's 
decision making process.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.4  Planning rule authority.

    (a) The Commission is required to adopt administrative rules 
pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act. The Commission adopts the 
rule in this part pursuant to that authority and to Section 301(g)(3)(A) 
and (C) of the Act, which provide for establishment of a rule to guide 
applicants in making recommendations to the Commission, and to ensure 
appropriate public involvement.
    (b) Adoption of the planning rule constitutes a policy decision on 
the part of the Commission and, as such, requires formal public 
notification and approval by the Commission according to established 
procedures. The planning rule is a component of the administrative rules 
of the Commission and has the authority accorded to such administrative 
rules, as described in the Administrative Procedures Act.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.5  Directives from the Act relating to the plan.

    The basic directions for preparation of the plan are contained in 
Section 301 of the Act. Sections 304, 314, and 315 provide additional 
guidance. Provisions that hold particular relevance are identified 
below.
    (a) Primary authority. Section 301(f)(1) directs that the mitigation 
and conservation funds available under the Act are to be used to 
``conserve, mitigate,

[[Page 897]]

and enhance fish, wildlife, and recreation resources affected by the 
development and operation of Federal reclamation projects in the State 
of Utah,'' and, further, that these funds are to be administered in 
accordance with ``the mitigation and conservation schedule in Section 
315 of this Act, and if in existence, the applicable five-year plan.'' 
Section 301 further clarifies that Commission expenditures ``shall be in 
addition to, not in lieu of, other expenditures authorized or required 
from other entities under other agreements or provisions of law.''
    (b) Reallocation of funds. Section 301(f)(2) provides for the 
reallocation of Section 8 funds if the Commission determines ``after 
public involvement and agency consultation * * * that the benefits to 
fish, wildlife, or recreation will be better served by allocating such 
funds in a different manner.'' Such reallocation requires the approval 
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if funds are to be reallocated 
from fish and wildlife purposes to recreation purposes. The Commission's 
authority to depart from the mitigation and conservation schedule 
specified in Section 315 of the Act is reiterated in Section 301(h)(1).
    (c) Funding priority. Section 301(f)(3) directs that the Commission 
``shall annually provide funding on a priority basis for environmental 
mitigation measures adopted as a result of compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for project features constructed 
pursuant to titles II and III of this Act.''
    (d) Plan adoption and content. Section 301(g)(1) directs that the 
Commission adopt a plan ``for carrying out its duties'' and that the 
plan ``shall consist of the specific objectives and measures the 
Commission intends to administer * * * to implement the mitigation and 
conservation projects and features authorized in this Act.''
    (e) Recommendations. Section 301(g)(3)(A) directs that ``the 
Commission shall request in writing from the Federal and State fish, 
wildlife, recreation, and water management agencies, the appropriate 
Indian tribes, and county and municipal entities, and the public, 
recommendations for objectives and measures to implement the mitigation 
and conservation projects and features authorized in this Act or 
amendments thereto.''
    (f) Public involvement. Section 301(g)(3)(C) directs the Commission 
to provide for appropriate public involvement in the review of 
Commission documents produced subsequent to receiving recommendations.
    (g) Guidance on selecting measures. Section 301(g)(4) identifies the 
types of measures that are to be included in the plan, namely those that 
will--
    (1) Restore, maintain, or enhance the biological productivity and 
diversity of natural ecosystems within the State and have substantial 
potential for providing fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and 
conservation opportunities;
    (2) Be based on, and supported by, the best available scientific 
knowledge;
    (3) Utilize, where equally effective alternative means of achieving 
the same sound biological or recreational objectives exist, the 
alternative that will also provide public benefits through multiple 
resource uses;
    (4) Complement the existing and future activities of the Federal and 
State fish, wildlife, and recreation agencies and appropriate Indian 
tribes;
    (5) Utilize, when available, cooperative agreements and partnerships 
with private landowners and nonprofit conservation organizations; and
    (6) Be consistent with the legal rights of appropriate Indian 
tribes.
    (h) Definite plan report. Section 304 directs that mitigation 
commitments included in the 1988 draft Definite Plan Report for the 
Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project (DPR) which have not yet 
been completed are to be undertaken in accordance with that report and 
the schedule specified in Section 315 of the Act, unless otherwise 
provided for in the Act.
    (i) Implementation schedule. Section 315 identifies mitigation and 
conservation projects to be implemented and provides a schedule and 
budget for doing so. Details on select components of Section 315 may be 
found in Sections 302 through 313, excluding Section 304.

[[Page 898]]


<R05>
Sec. 10005.6  Responsibilities.

    Responsibilities concerning implementation of this planning rule are 
assigned as follows:
    (a) Commission. The Commission is responsible for adopting this 
planning rule, including the project evaluation procedures contained 
herein. The Commission is also responsible for formal adoption of the 
final plan and, following this, approving, on a project by project 
basis, of agreements to implement the specific elements contained in the 
plan.
    (b) Executive Director and Commission staff. The Executive Director 
and Commission staff are responsible for preparing planning documents, 
including preliminary evaluation of projects, and for consultation with 
agencies and other interested parties regarding the various aspects of 
the planning process, in accordance with procedures set forth in this 
planning rule.
    (c) Department of Interior Solicitor. The Department of the 
Interior's Regional Solicitor acts as the agency's attorney-advisor and 
is responsible for advising the Commission on legal matters related to 
the planning rule, the plan, and the planning process as agreed upon 
between the Department and the Commission.
    (d) Secretary of the Interior's Representative to the Central Utah 
Project. The Secretary's Representative is responsible for monitoring 
the plan, and activities undertaken as components of the plan, with 
regard to their consistency with the Act and their compatibility with 
other activities required by the Act. The Secretary's Representative is 
also responsible for coordinating relevant activities of other agencies 
within the Department of the Interior and for coordinating the process 
by which Congressionally appropriated funds are made available for 
Commission mitigation and conservation activities.
    (e) Interested parties. Federal and State resource agencies, Indian 
tribes, and other interests are, should they choose to become involved, 
responsible for providing meaningful recommendations regarding potential 
projects, for coordinating the development of these recommendations with 
other appropriate agencies and organizations, and, as applicable, for 
participation in implementation of projects.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.7  Agency consultation and public involvement.

    The Commission considers agency consultation and public involvement 
to be central components of the planning process. Interested parties 
will be given the opportunity to become involved at several stages in 
the plan development, process. The major opportunities are as follows:
    (a) Planning rule development. The initial opportunity for 
involvement occurs in the preparation of this planning rule, through 
providing written or oral comment to the Commission prior to adoption.
    (b) Project recommendations. The next opportunity is in the 
preparation of recommendations for projects to be included in the 
Commission's plan. The Commission will make a formal announcement that 
it is soliciting recommendations for potential projects. Interested 
parties will have ninety days within which to respond. Commission staff 
will, upon request and as dictated by work load, provide guidance and 
other assistance in the preparation of project recommendations. 
Interested parties are encouraged to work cooperatively with others in 
the preparation of joint recommendations. Commission staff will 
facilitate this as appropriate. Section 10005.18 provides additional 
direction on this. At the end of the ninety day period the Commission 
will make all recommendations received during that time available for 
public review. These will be available at the Commission office during 
normal business hours. Copies will also be provided to those requesting 
them at a reasonable charge.
    (c) Plan preparation. At the close of the ninety day project 
solicitation period, the Commission will proceed to prepare a draft 
plan. Several opportunities for agency consultation and public 
involvement will be provided during the preparation of the plan. One or 
more public briefings will be held during this period. Briefings will be 
announced in appropriate local and regional media. Work sessions may 
also

[[Page 899]]

be held, sponsored either by the Commission or jointly with other 
interested parties, to discuss individual projects or other topics of 
general interest. Interested parties may also request meetings with 
Commission staff to discuss specific projects or issues. The 
availability of staff for such meetings will be dictated by work load. 
During this time, interested parties may also attend, and participate 
in, Commission meetings where the various aspects of the plan are 
discussed. Written comments will also be accepted during the plan 
preparation period.
    (d) Review of draft plan. Following release of the draft plan, 
interested parties will be given thirty days within which to provide 
formal written comments. During this time, interested parties may 
request meetings with Commission staff to discuss aspects of the draft 
plan. The Commission will also receive comments on the draft plan at 
appropriate times during regularly scheduled Commission meetings. The 
Commission may, at its discretion, convene one or more public meetings 
to discuss issues related to the draft plan.
    (e) Final plan. The release of the final plan will be announced in 
the media and copies made available to the public. As warranted, the 
Commission may hold one or more meetings to brief interested parties on 
the final plan.
    (f) Amendments to the plan. The opportunities for agency 
consultation and public involvement described above will also be 
provided each time the Commission undertakes a comprehensive revision of 
the plan. In addition, the Commission will give appropriate public 
notice and grant an opportunity to comment at such times as the 
Commission is considering other, less comprehensive amendments. Section 
10005.21 provides additional information on how agencies and the public 
may become involved in the plan amendment process.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.8  Mitigation obligations.

    While the Act authorizes the Commission to undertake a wide range of 
general planning and mitigation activities, it also specifies certain 
projects or groups of projects that the Commission is to implement. The 
Commission considers these obligations from the Act to be integral 
components of the mitigation and conservation plan and of the planning 
process used to develop this plan. From the perspective of the plan, two 
issues are germane. These are the extent to which these obligations must 
take priority over other projects, either in terms of funding or 
sequencing and the extent to which there is flexibility in the specific 
actions to be taken in fulfillment of these obligations. Through this 
planning rule and other means the Commission will ensure that interested 
parties are made aware of the implications of these obligations in order 
that they might use this information when participating in the 
development and implementation of the plan.
    (a) Description of mitigation obligations. Obligations principally 
derive from three portions of the Act: Title II, section 304, and 
section 315. Following is a description of the obligations contained in 
each.
    (1) Title II. Title II authorizes funding and provides guidance for 
completion of certain features of the Central Utah Project. It also 
provides for Commission involvement in several specific activities 
relating to Central Utah Project mitigation, including funding for 
specific Section 8 mitigation activities. In the future, additional 
Title II features will be implemented. These will be subject to 
environmental review through NEPA or other applicable Federal laws and 
will, in many instances, be coupled with mitigation measures. Section 
301(f)(3) of the Act directs that priority be given for funding of 
mitigation measures that are associated with Central Utah Project 
features identified in either Title II or III of the Act that have been, 
or will be, authorized through compliance with NEPA.
    (2) Section 304. This section directs that mitigation and 
conservation projects contained in the DPR be completed and that this be 
accomplished in accordance with the DPR and the schedule specified in 
section 315 of the Act. Several elements of the DPR have been either 
completed or initiated.
    (3) Section 315. This section identifies several mitigation and 
conservation projects that are to be implemented to

[[Page 900]]

enhance fish, wildlife, and recreation resources. It also identifies the 
funds that are to be authorized for each project. Initial phases of 
selected section 315 projects have already received Commission funding 
approval. Additional section 315 projects have undergone substantial 
review and detailed implementation plans have, in some cases, been 
prepared.
    (b) Commission policy on fulfilling obligations. As referenced in 
Sec. 10005.5, Section 301(f)(1) and (2) of the Act provides for re-
programming of Section 8 funds to other projects in accordance with the 
plan and/or following appropriate public involvement and agency 
consultation, and provided ``that the benefits to fish, wildlife, or 
recreation will be better served'' by doing so. The Commission 
interprets this as giving the Commission broad discretion to determine, 
with appropriate agency consultation and public involvement, whether to 
implement projects delineated in the above stated sections and, should 
the Commission choose to implement these, the form that this 
implementation will take.
    (1) This notwithstanding, the Commission recognizes that the 
projects referenced in Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 have, in 
most cases, undergone considerable planning as well as agency and public 
scrutiny. Their inclusion in the Act represents a consensus among 
Federal and state agencies, water developers, and the national and state 
environmental communities that these mitigation measures have merit. 
Further, NEPA proceedings have, in some instances, been completed.
    (2) Absent the plan, the Commission will rely on Title II, Section 
304, and Section 315 as the principal guidance in authorizing projects. 
Once adopted, the plan will become the principal form of guidance. In 
selecting projects for the plan, mitigation measures referenced in Title 
II, Section 304, and Section 315 will be given priority consideration. 
They will, however, be subjected to the same analysis as other proposed 
projects. Should these projects be found to not meet the Commission's 
standards for project approval, they will be rejected. Title II, Section 
304, and Section 315 projects that meet Commission standards will only 
be superseded in the plan if it can be demonstrated that the 
contributions to be made by other projects proposed through the project 
solicitation process significantly outweigh those of the aforementioned 
Title II, Section 304, and/or Section 315 projects.
    (3) Regardless, the Commission will retain flexibility regarding how 
Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 projects will be implemented. 
Interested parties may, if they choose, propose modifications or 
enhancements to these projects through the normal project solicitation 
process. The Commission will pay particular attention to proposals that 
will accomplish Title II, Section 304, or Section 315 measures at lower 
cost, thereby freeing up funds for heretofore unidentified projects.
    (4) The Commission is aware that future NEPA procedures related to 
the development of Title II features may result in the identification of 
additional impacts and mitigation measures. The Commission considers 
implementation of measures that result from a formal NEPA procedure to 
be non-discretionary. The Commission recognizes a commitment to 
implement such measures as are within its authority. Further, in 
accordance with Section 301(f)(3), the Commission is committed to giving 
these measures high priority. In order to ensure that such measures are 
consistent with the Commission's overall program, and can be implemented 
within budget, the Commission will take an active role in NEPA 
procedures that are likely to result in significant mitigation 
obligations for the Commission.
    (5) If the Commission chooses not to implement a mitigation measure 
or, for any reason be unable to implement a measure resulting from NEPA 
procedures, the Commission will conduct, or cause to have conducted, a 
supplemental environmental evaluation to determine suitable alternative 
mitigation measures. The Commission will implement the findings of that 
evaluation to the extent possible. The only exception will be when the 
Commission proposes to substitute an equivalent mitigation measure that 
meets with the approval of applicable Federal,

[[Page 901]]

State, or Tribal fish and wildlife agencies, the Secretary of the 
Interior, and other affected parties.
    (6) In order to assist agencies and other interested parties in 
understanding the scope of the obligations contained in Title II, 
Section 304, and Section 315, and others that may arise in the future, 
the Commission will, at the time it invites recommendations on measures 
to be included in the plan, prepare and distribute a list of projects 
that the Commission considers to be obligations as defined in this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.9  Relationship of the plan to congressional appropriations and Commission expenditures.

    (a) The plan itself does not constitute a commitment of resources 
for any given project. The commitment to expend resources is dependent 
upon Congressional appropriation, and, following this, Commission 
approval of specific projects.
    (b) The Commission will rely on the plan as the primary source of 
information for the development of the agency's annual budget. For each 
fiscal year, projects identified in the plan will be arranged into a 
series of programs based on project type or ecological and geographical 
associations. These programs will serve as the basis for the agency's 
budget request.
    (c) Once the budget request is formulated and submitted to the 
Congress, the request may be altered or reformulated by the Congress 
before the appropriation statute is finally approved. The appropriation 
statute will then control the implementation of the plan. In light of 
the controlling nature of the appropriation statute over the 
implementation of the plan, the plan must maintain sufficient 
flexibility to allow adjustments to comply with appropriations. The 
amendment process described in Sec. 10005.21 provides the mechanism for 
modifying the plan to correspond to changes in Congressional 
appropriations. Changes to the annual project portfolio will, in most 
instances, constitute a ``substantive'' amendment as described in 
Sec. 10005.21.
    (d) Once appropriations have been approved by the Congress, the plan 
will serve as the principal guidance to the Commission in entering into 
agreements and approving the expenditure of funds for specific projects.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.10  Relationship of the plan to the authorities and responsibilities of other agencies.

    Within Utah, several federal agencies, state agencies, and tribal 
governments have authorities and responsibilities related to the 
management of fish and wildlife resources, through management of the 
resource itself, through management of the land and water upon which 
fish and wildlife depend, or, in the case of Federal reclamation 
projects, through involvement in mitigation activities. The Act 
specifically recognizes the authority of other Federal and State 
agencies to take actions in accordance with other applicable laws. The 
guidance for this is provided by Section 301(a)(2), which states that 
``Nothing herein is intended to limit or restrict the authorities of 
Federal, State, or local governments, or political subdivisions thereof, 
to plan, develop, or implement mitigation, conservation, or enhancement 
of fish, wildlife, or recreation resources in the State in accordance 
with applicable provisions of Federal or State law.'' In preparing and 
implementing its plan, it is the Commission's intent to form a 
cooperative partnership with other agencies having fish, wildlife, and 
recreation responsibilities and authorities, both recognizing and 
relying upon their authorities. The Commission recognizes that these 
agencies may have specific legal obligations to take actions to maintain 
or restore fish, wildlife, or recreation resources that are independent 
of Commission mandates. While the Commission will, as appropriate, 
authorize the use of funds to complement the resource protection and 
restoration activities of these agencies, Commission involvement should 
not be viewed as a replacement for funding or other actions that are 
rightfully the responsibility of another agency.
    (a) Agencies with land management authority. The Commission 
recognizes that the Federal government, the State of Utah, and 
applicable Indian tribes each own and/or manage lands that are important 
to fish and wildlife resources

[[Page 902]]

and provide significant outdoor recreation opportunities. At the Federal 
level, the Forest Service manages National Forest System lands, the Fish 
and Wildlife Service manages national wildlife refuges, the National 
Park Service manages national parks, monuments, and recreation areas, 
the Bureau of Reclamation manages reservoirs and lands adjoining those 
reservoirs, and the Bureau of Land Management manages other public 
lands. Indian tribes own and manage lands in accordance with treaties 
between the tribes and the United States Government. The State of Utah 
owns and manages state parks, wildlife management areas, and public 
trust lands. The Commission recognizes the importance of federal, 
tribal, and state lands to fish, wildlife, and recreation and will 
entertain proposals for mitigation and conservation activities involving 
these lands when the following conditions are met:
    (1) The managing agency concurs with the proposed action,
    (2) All appropriate legal procedures have been followed, and
    (3) The land management agency is willing to assume long-term 
responsibility for operation and maintenance of mitigation and 
conservation features and to refrain from management activities that may 
negate or significantly diminish the effects of the project on fish, 
wildlife, or recreation.
    (b) Agencies with Federal reclamation project mitigation 
responsibilities and/or authorities. Several agencies also have direct 
authorities and responsibilities relating to mitigation for the effects 
of Federal reclamation projects in Utah. These include the Department of 
the Interior Central Utah Project Office, the Bureau of Reclamation, the 
Central Utah Water Conservancy District, the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
and the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. The remainder of this 
section summarizes the authorities and responsibilities of these 
agencies with regards to Federal reclamation projects, with emphasis on 
the Commission's relationship to these agencies. This section does not 
identify or describe all of the potential relationships between the 
Commission and other agencies with Federal reclamation project 
mitigation obligations. As appropriate, the Commission may enter into 
formal agreements with any or all of the above agencies in order to 
provide additional detail regarding the relationship or to assign 
specific program or project responsibilities. The arrangements that are 
described in this section may also be modified through interagency 
agreement.
    (1) Secretary of the Interior's Representative to the Central Utah 
Project. As required by Section 201(e) of the Act, the Secretary of the 
Interior is ultimately responsible for carrying out all responsibilities 
specifically identified in the Act. The Secretary's Representative 
serves as the Secretary's official representative to the Central Utah 
Project. The Secretary's Representative monitors activities undertaken 
in fulfillment of the various aspects of the Act to ensure that these 
activities, including mitigation activities, are in accordance with 
applicable law and that Federal funds are used appropriately. The 
Secretary's Representative also coordinates activities among Department 
of the Interior agencies involved with the Central Utah Project. The 
Commission is a Federal Commission within the executive branch of 
government and its activities are subject to the direct oversight of 
Congress. While essentially independent of the Secretary of the 
Interior, the Commission nevertheless has a vital relationship with the 
Department via both the budget process and the similarity in missions. 
The Secretary's Representative serves as the principal link between the 
Commission and the Department of the Interior and is responsible for 
transmitting Congressional appropriations to fund the Commission's 
mitigation, conservation, and administrative activities. For purposes of 
plan development and implementation, the following will guide the 
Commission's relationship to the Secretary's Representative:
    (i) The Commission acknowledges the authority of the Secretary in 
overseeing implementation of the Act and recognizes that the Secretary's 
Representative plays an essential role in ensuring the compatibility of 
mitigation and conservation measures with the overall Central Utah 
Project. The Commission is committed to a strong

[[Page 903]]

and productive partnership with the Secretary's Representative in 
fulfilling the Commission's mitigation and conservation 
responsibilities.
    (ii) The Commission will maintain close communication with the 
Secretary's Representative regarding the relationship between the plan 
and Congressional appropriations. The Commission will provide the 
Secretary's Representative with both long range and annual funding 
proposals and otherwise assist in preparing the Commission's budget 
requests to Congress.
    (iii) The Commission and the Secretary's Representative will 
independently and cooperatively monitor the plan in terms of meeting 
Section 8 mitigation obligations as directed by the Act.
    (iv) The Commission will actively involve the Secretary's 
Representative in the Commission's NEPA related activities, including 
the identification of appropriate roles for the Secretary's 
Representative and Department of the Interior agencies in the 
preparation and review of NEPA documents.
    (v) The Commission will, as appropriate, involve the Secretary's 
Representative in coordinating Commission mitigation and conservation 
activities with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and with individual Indian 
tribes.
    (vi) The Commission will utilize the Secretary's Representative as 
its principal contact for matters regarding the Department of the 
Interior and, when appropriate, will seek assistance from the 
Secretary's Representative in coordinating activities involving agencies 
within the Department, especially when activities involve several 
agencies. The Commission will, as appropriate, involve the Secretary's 
Representative in resolving differences that might arise among the 
various agencies within the Department with regard to the Commission's 
plan, or the implementation of any measure contained in the plan. This 
provision does not alter the direct working relationships that the 
Commission maintains with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau 
of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, and other applicable 
agencies.
    (2) U.S.D.I. Bureau of Reclamation. Prior to the Act, the Bureau of 
Reclamation (Bureau) had the responsibility for implementing mitigation 
measures associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State 
of Utah. Section 301(a)(1) of the Act granted authority to the 
Commission ``to coordinate the implementation of the mitigation and 
conservation provisions of this Act.'' Section 301(n) further 
transferred from the Bureau to the Commission ``the responsibility for 
implementing Section 8 funds for mitigation and conservation projects 
and features authorized in this Act.'' While the Act therefore clearly 
transfers mitigation responsibilities concerning the Bonneville Unit of 
the Central Utah Project from the Bureau to the Commission, it does not 
alter the Bureau's mitigation responsibilities with respect to other 
components of the Colorado River Storage Project or other Federal 
reclamation projects in Utah. For purposes of plan development and 
implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship 
to the Bureau:
    (i) The Commission recognizes that the Bureau and the Commission 
share fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation responsibilities 
associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State of Utah 
and is committed to maintaining a strong and productive partnership with 
the Bureau in this regard.
    (ii) Except for those features that the Secretary has assigned to 
others in allocating the $214,352,000 increase in CRSP authorization 
specified in Section 201(a) of the Act, the Commission has the primary 
authority and responsibility for all mitigation projects involving use 
of Section 8 funds for the Bonneville Unit and for alternative 
formulations of the Uintah and Upalco units of the Central Utah Project, 
and all mitigation projects identified in Section 315 of the Act, or as 
modified in the plan.
    (iii) The Bureau retains the responsibility and primary authority to 
undertake fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and conservation 
activities for Federal reclamation projects in Utah other than those as 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section wherein the Bureau 
acts at the direction of the Commission. The Commission also has

[[Page 904]]

the authority to undertake selective fish, wildlife, and recreation 
mitigation and conservation activities concerning these same projects, 
as authorized in Section 315 of the Act or in the plan. The Commission 
will actively consult with the Bureau with regard to potential 
mitigation or enhancement activities in those areas in order to ensure 
that Bureau and Commission mitigation activities are coordinated.
    (iv) The Bureau retains responsibility for implementation of fish, 
wildlife, and recreation mitigation measures associated with Federal 
reclamation projects in Utah that were initiated prior to the 
establishment of the Act where that responsibility has not specifically 
been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.
    (v) The Bureau retains responsibility for operation, maintenance, 
and replacement of facilities related to fish, wildlife, and recreation 
mitigation measures undertaken by the Bureau where that responsibility 
has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water 
district, or other entity.
    (vi) The Bureau retains responsibility for mitigating future impacts 
to fish, wildlife, and recreation caused by operation, maintenance, and 
replacement of water resource development facilities where that 
responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, 
a water district, or other entity.
    (vii) The Commission has no responsibility or authority for 
mitigation or replacement measures associated with Federal reclamation 
projects in Utah that are not related to fish, wildlife, and recreation.
    (3) Central Utah Water Conservancy District. The Central Utah Water 
Conservancy District (District) is responsible for construction, 
operation, and management of the various features of the Central Utah 
Project. NEPA compliance regarding many of these features has resulted 
in the identification of several measures that are to be undertaken as 
mitigation for the Central Utah Project's impacts to fish, wildlife, 
and/or recreation. NEPA compliance for future project features is likely 
to identify additional fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and 
conservation measures. The Act directs that the Commission give funding 
priority to measures that result from applicable NEPA procedures. The 
Act does not, however, specify what role the Commission is to have in 
determining, or planning for, these measures. For purposes of plan 
development and implementation, the following will guide the 
Commission's relationship to the District:
    (i) The Commission is committed to maintaining a strong and 
productive partnership with the District in order to adequately plan for 
and implement mitigation measures associated with the Central Utah 
Project.
    (ii) The Commission recognizes that the District and the Commission 
have complementary responsibilities for fish, wildlife, and recreation 
mitigation regarding the Central Utah Project. The District retains the 
overall responsibility for planning for mitigation activities associated 
with its completion of the Central Utah Project. The Commission has the 
responsibility for ensuring that mitigation measures meet with the 
intent of the Act with regard to protection and restoration of fish, 
wildlife, and recreation resources and for approving and implementing 
mitigation and conservation measures. Accordingly, the Commission will 
monitor District mitigation and conservation planning activities and 
provide such assistance as is mutually agreed upon.
    (iii) The Commission will actively monitor or, as appropriate, 
participate in NEPA procedures undertaken by the District that may 
result in the identification of mitigation and conservation measures 
that, if implemented, would require Commission funding or may affect 
other mitigation activities of interest to the Commission. For NEPA 
procedures that are likely to result in significant Commission 
obligations, the Commission may request ``joint lead agency'' status 
with the District. In such instances the specific involvement of the 
Commission in the preparation of NEPA documentation will be determined 
through agreement with the District.
    (iv) The District retains responsibility for mitigating future 
impacts to

[[Page 905]]

fish, wildlife, and recreation caused by the operation, maintenance, and 
replacement of its water resource development facilities, unless that 
responsibility has been specifically transferred to the Commission or 
other entity.
    (v) The District retains responsibility for operation, maintenance, 
and, where necessary, replacement of fish, wildlife, and recreation 
mitigation features managed by the District, unless that responsibility 
has been specifically transferred to the Commission or other entity.
    (4) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service (Service) has mandated responsibility to implement several acts 
relevant to the Commission's activities. In Section 301(b)(3), the Act 
specifically references a Commission obligation to comply with the Fish 
and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) and the Endangered Species Act 
(ESA). Other acts administered by the Service and relevant to Commission 
activities include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) and the Bald Eagle Protection 
Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d). The FWCA directs that the Service, and the 
state fish and wildlife agency, must be consulted where the ``waters of 
any stream or other body of water are proposed or authorized to be 
impounded, diverted * * * or otherwise controlled or modified * * * by 
any department or agency of the United States, or by any public or 
private agency under Federal permit or license. * * *'' The purpose of 
this consultation is to provide for ``the conservation of wildlife 
resources by preventing loss of and damage to such resources.'' The FWCA 
provides the major mechanism for Service involvement in the Federal 
reclamation project decision process. The Service's most important role 
in Federal reclamation projects is in the development and later the 
monitoring of fish and wildlife mitigation measures. The Service is also 
responsible for reporting to the Secretary of the Interior on the status 
of mitigation programs. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act provides 
for the funding of Service FWCA consultation by the agency sponsoring 
the proposed activity. The Service's ESA responsibilities that are most 
relevant to Commission activities include listing of new species, 
preparation and implementation of recovery plans and consultations 
regarding adverse effects on listed species. Section 7(a)(1) of the 
Endangered Species Act authorizes Federal agencies to carry out programs 
for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Participating 
in, and being consistent with, recovery plans is a fundamental component 
of this obligation. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires that, prior to 
taking any action that may affect a listed species, a Federal agency 
must consult with the Service to ensure that the action will not 
jeopardize the continued existence of the species or adversely modify 
critical habitat. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) establishes a 
Federal role in protecting bird species that generally migrate across 
national boundaries. In Utah, these include most indigenous bird 
species. The MBTA is not intended as a substitute for state wildlife 
management authority but rather as a complement. The Service is 
responsible for implementing many of the features of the MBTA, and for 
encouraging states to undertake actions to protect migratory bird 
species. The Bald Eagle Protection Act prohibits the taking or 
possession of either bald or golden eagles, both of which commonly 
inhabit areas near Utah's rivers and wetlands. For purposes of plan 
development and implementation, the following will guide the 
Commission's relationship to the Service:
    (i) The Commission acknowledges the biological expertise of the 
Service with regard to Federal reclamation projects and other Commission 
activities relating to the protection and restoration of fish and 
wildlife resources and will seek to utilize this expertise to the 
fullest extent. The Commission further recognizes the similarity in 
agency missions with regard to fish and wildlife mitigation and 
conservation and is committed to a strong and productive partnership 
with the Service in this regard.
    (ii) The Commission acknowledges the Service's mandated 
responsibility with regard to Federal reclamation projects and will 
specifically consult with the Service regarding activities

[[Page 906]]

that are subject to the FWCA. These include both projects directly 
related to mitigation for Federal water resource projects and applicable 
fish, wildlife, and recreation conservation projects. In developing its 
plan and adopting specific projects, the Commission will give 
significant weight to the Service's recommendations. Should the 
Commission choose to not follow Service recommendations, it will seek 
resolution through active consultation with the Service. As appropriate, 
the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources will be asked to be involved in 
these consultations as that agency also has co-responsibilities under 
the FWCA. Should no agreement be reached, the Commission will document 
its decision and provide this to the Service. The Commission recognizes 
that the Service has a responsibility to forward its FWCA reports to the 
Secretary regardless of the resolution of issues contained in the 
reports. The Commission recognizes that several projects contained in 
Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 have previously been subjected to 
Service evaluation pursuant to FWCA. Prior to reallocating funds 
authorized for these projects, the Commission will formally consult with 
the Service regarding the relative adequacy of proposed new projects, or 
significant modifications to Title II, Section 304, or Section 315 
projects, in mitigating for impacts to fish and wildlife resources.
    (iii) The Commission will comply with applicable provisions of the 
ESA and, accordingly, will consult with the Service regarding activities 
that may affect a listed or candidate species, regardless whether the 
effect is beneficial or adverse. In addition, the Commission will 
endeavor to undertake mitigation and conservation projects that are 
consistent with an adopted recovery plan for a listed species and that 
aid in the protection of candidate species.
    (iv) The Commission will, in accordance with the Act, formally seek 
the Service's approval prior to reallocating funds from a project whose 
primary objectives are the protection and/or restoration of fish and 
wildlife resources to a project whose objectives are primarily related 
to recreation. No such funds will be reallocated unless this meets with 
the approval of the Service.
    (v) The Commission anticipates that the Service will be an active 
participant in the planning for, and implementation, of mitigation and 
conservation projects undertaken pursuant to the Commission's plan.
    (vi) The Commission will invite the Service to participate in NEPA 
activities undertaken or funded by the Commission that bear on fish and/
or wildlife resources. The form that this participation will take will 
be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require agreement on the 
part of both agencies.
    (5) Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. As is the case with other 
states, the State of Utah has the exclusive jurisdiction over non-
migratory fish and wildlife and shared jurisdiction (with the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service) over all migratory birds and Federally listed 
threatened and endangered fish and wildlife within the state. The 
applicable state law is Utah Code, Section 23-15-2, which states that 
``All wildlife within the state, including but not limited to wildlife 
on public or private lands or in public or private waters within the 
state, shall fall within the jurisdiction of the Division of Wildlife 
Resources.'' The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR) has 
authorities and responsibilities at the state level similar to those of 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Federal level, and, like the 
Service, has mandated authorities under the Federal Fish and Wildlife 
Coordination Act that relate directly to Federal Reclamation project 
mitigation. These authorities are described in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section. In addition, the Act provides for the UDWR to assume primary 
responsibility for implementing measures associated with the Act after 
the Commission expires. In addition to the UDWR's responsibilities and 
authorities discussed above, the State of Utah also has jurisdiction 
over other activities that are relevant to the Commission's plan, 
including the granting of water rights and, except on Federal and tribal 
lands, management of land use. For purposes of plan development and 
implementation, the following will

[[Page 907]]

guide the Commission's relationship to the UDWR:
    (i) The Commission acknowledges the biological expertise of the UDWR 
with regard to Federal reclamation projects and other Commission 
activities relating to the protection and restoration of fish and 
wildlife resources and will seek to utilize this expertise to the 
fullest extent practicable. The Commission further recognizes the 
similarity in agency missions with regard to fish and wildlife 
mitigation and conservation and is committed to a strong and productive 
partnership with the UDWR in this regard.
    (ii) The Commission acknowledges the UDWR's authority over the 
management of fish and wildlife within the State and will take no action 
that is inconsistent with this authority.
    (iii) The Commission acknowledges that the UDWR has a mandated 
authority regarding the planning and monitoring of Federal reclamation 
mitigation. As is the case with the Service, the Commission will 
formally consult with the UDWR regarding projects that are subject to 
the FWCA. These include both projects directly related to mitigation for 
Federal reclamation projects and applicable fish and wildlife 
conservation projects not directly related to any Federal reclamation 
project. Consultation will be in accordance with procedures defined in 
the FWCA. It is anticipated that this consultation will be conducted in 
conjunction with the Service. However, the Commission recognizes that 
the UDWR has the right to prepare recommendations independent of the 
Service should it so desire. The Commission will, in making its 
decisions, give significant weight to recommendations made by the UDWR. 
Should the Commission choose to not follow the UDWR's recommendations, 
it will seek to resolve outstanding issues through active consultation 
with the UDWR. As appropriate, the Service will be asked to be involved 
in these consultations. Should no agreement be reached, the Commission 
will document its decision and provide this to the UDWR. The Commission 
recognizes that several mitigation projects contained in Title II, 
Section 304, and Section 315 have previously been subjected to the UDWR 
evaluation pursuant to FWCA. As is the case with the Service, the 
Commission will specifically consult with the UDWR prior to 
significantly modifying or reallocating funds away from these projects.
    (iv) The Commission will specifically consult with the UDWR 
regarding any project that might have an affect on species identified by 
the UDWR as wildlife species of special concern and species listed by 
the UDWR Natural Heritage Program as G1 and G2 plant and animal species.
    (v) The Commission anticipates that the UDWR will be an active 
participant in the planning for, and implementation, of mitigation and 
conservation projects undertaken pursuant to the Commission's plan.
    (vi) The Commission will invite the UDWR to participate in NEPA 
activities undertaken or funded by the Commission that bear on fish and/
or wildlife resources. The form that this participation will take will 
be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require agreement on the 
part of both agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.11  Environmental compliance.

    (a) Section 301(c)(3) establishes that the Commission is to be 
considered a Federal agency ``for purposes of compliance with the 
requirements of all Federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and 
environmental laws, including (but not limited to) the Fish and Wildlife 
Coordination Act, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 
and the Endangered Species Act of 1973.'' While not specifically 
referenced in that section, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
(Clean Water Act) (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) also contains environmental 
compliance provisions that are directly relevant to the Commission's 
mitigation and conservation activities. The Commission is committed to 
full and active compliance with these laws as well as applicable State 
environmental law.
    (b) The Commission's NEPA procedures are addressed in a different 
chapter of the agency's administrative rules. Because the plan is 
subject to alteration or amendment under a number of circumstances, the 
plan does not

[[Page 908]]

constitute an irretrievable commitment of resources and thus is not 
subject to NEPA. Projects preliminarily selected for funding by the 
Commission will, however, be subject to formal NEPA review. The 
Commission recognizes that these procedures may affect both project 
budgets and scheduling and will therefore give specific consideration to 
this when preparing the plan. As described in Sec. 10005.16 the plan 
will identify, at a reconnaissance level, the need for individual 
projects to comply with NEPA and other Federal and State environmental 
laws and the opportunities available for consolidating NEPA review into 
programmatic or watershed-wide analysis as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.12  Policy regarding the scope of measures to be included in the plan.

    The terms ``mitigation'' and ``conservation'' are used repeatedly 
throughout the Act and committee reports accompanying the Act. The 
importance of these terms is exemplified by the fact that Congress saw 
fit to include them in the official name of the Commission. The 
Commission interprets the term ``mitigation'' to mean activities 
undertaken to avoid or lessen environmental impacts associated with a 
Federal reclamation project or, should impact occur, to protect, 
restore, or enhance fish, wildlife, and recreation resources adversely 
affected by the project. Mitigation at the site of the impact typically 
involves restoration or replacement. Off-site mitigation might involve 
protection, restoration, or enhancement of a similar resource value at a 
different location. Mitigation may also involve substituting one 
resource feature for another. In meeting its mitigation 
responsibilities, the Commission sees an obligation to give priority to 
protection and restoration activities that are within the same watershed 
as the original impact and that address the same fish, wildlife, or 
recreation resource that was originally affected. The Commission's 
``conservation'' authority allows it to invest in the conservation of 
fish, wildlife, and recreation resources generally, and not directly 
associated with any Federal reclamation project. Conservation projects 
may, therefore, be considered for any area of the state, regardless of 
the presence of a reclamation project. Nothing in this section is meant 
to restrict consideration of conservation projects directly associated 
with a Federal reclamation project. The Commission recognizes that, with 
limited resources, it is not possible to address the entire range of 
fish, wildlife, and recreation needs throughout the State. Indeed, 
addressing only the most critical issues will require prudent and 
judicious planning and use of resources. This section defines the areas 
where the Commission intends to focus its attention over the long-term 
and, in so doing, provides guidance for the development of the 
Commission's mitigation and conservation plan. By defining priorities, 
the Commission narrows the options of applicants in making 
recommendations for potential projects, and of the Commission itself in 
selecting measures to be incorporated into the plan.
    (a) Priority resources. The Commission's intent is to focus 
expenditures and activities on those areas and resources where the 
Commission believes that it can, consistent with its mandate, have the 
greatest positive impact. Accordingly, it is the policy of the 
Commission that projects selected for the plan must accomplish one or 
more of the following:
    (1) Protect and/or restore aquatic systems that provide essential 
habitat for fish and wildlife,
    (2) Protect and/or restore wetland and riparian systems that provide 
essential habitat for fish and wildlife,
    (3) Protect and/or restore upland areas that contribute to important 
terrestrial ecosystems and/or support aquatic systems,
    (4) Provide outdoor recreation opportunities that are dependent on 
the natural environment and that support the conservation of aquatic 
systems, and/or
    (5) Address fish, wildlife, or recreation resources from a statewide 
context in order to provide essential information on aquatic systems or 
to assist in the establishment of statewide programs for fish, wildlife, 
or recreation conservation.

[[Page 909]]

    (b) Priority projects. In recognition of its responsibility to 
mitigate for Federal reclamation projects, the Commission will give 
special consideration to projects that:
    (1) Address fish, wildlife, and recreation resources affected by the 
development of the Central Utah Project, including projects authorized 
in Title II, section 304, or section 315 of the Act, as described in 
Sec. 10005.8,
    (2) Address fish, wildlife, and recreation resources affected by the 
development of other features of the Colorado River Storage Project in 
Utah, or
    (3) Address fish, wildlife, and recreation resources affected by the 
development of other Federal reclamation projects in Utah.
    (c) Specific objectives for five-year plans. Each five-year plan 
will contain a set of specific objectives derived from the above 
elements. Objectives will be based on the Commission's determinations of 
the issues and resources that are in most need of attention, and the 
potential for making a substantial contribution to fish, wildlife, and 
recreation resources. Objectives may include the targeting of certain 
watersheds and/or basins for priority attention based on these same two 
factors.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.13  Geographic and ecological context for the plan.

    In accordance with the Act, the Commission has the authority to 
implement projects throughout the State of Utah. The Commission believes 
that, to be effective, the plan must be prepared, and evaluated, from a 
state-wide perspective and that, within the state, an ecosystem-based 
approach is appropriate. There is no one correct way to define an 
ecosystem or to approach ecosystem planning. The Commission concludes 
that, for its planning purposes, the watershed provides the appropriate 
geographic and ecological reference within which to evaluate proposed 
projects and otherwise plan its activities. In delineating watersheds, 
the Commission will be consistent with the best ecological and 
hydrological science and, to the extent possible, with the ecological 
and hydrological units currently used by the State of Utah, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, and other applicable Federal agencies. The 
Commission recognizes that mitigation and conservation projects may vary 
in scale and that, therefore, one standard set of watersheds is not 
necessarily appropriate for all projects. For example, a more localized 
project may best be analyzed from a ``watershed within a watershed'' 
perspective. Alternatively, a large-scaled project may need to be 
visualized from the perspective of a major river basin consisting of 
several watersheds. The Commission will prepare, and have available for 
public use, a list or map that identifies major basins, watersheds, and, 
where appropriate, hydrologic units within watersheds, that the 
Commission will use to organize its mitigation and conservation 
activities. This list or map may be revised from time to time as 
circumstances change.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.14  Resource features applicable to the plan.

    In accordance with the Act, projects selected for funding must make 
substantial contributions to fish, wildlife and/or recreation resources. 
Biological projects may focus on the protection or restoration of an 
individual species, a group of inter-related species, or the habitats 
upon which these species depend. Projects that target sensitive plant 
species may also be included in the plan, particularly if they 
contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem. Recreation projects 
should be targeted at increasing the quality of and/or access to outdoor 
recreation opportunities that rely on the natural environment or at 
providing opportunities that have been reduced through Federal 
reclamation projects. Following is a representative list of the types of 
resources that projects may target, along with examples of possible 
activities that might be undertaken for each. The following list is not 
intended to limit the scope of projects that may qualify for inclusion 
in the Commission's plan:
    (a) Fish and Wildlife Production, including:
    (1) Enhancement of natural production,
    (2) Restoration of indigenous species,
    (3) Scientific studies,
    (4) Development of new or upgraded culture facilities.

[[Page 910]]

    (b) Plant Propagation, including:
    (1) Protection of critical habitat for sensitive species or 
communities,
    (2) Reintroduction of native plants in conjunction with habitat 
restoration projects,
    (3) Vegetation manipulation to achieve desired ecological 
conditions.
    (c) Stream Habitat, including:
    (1) Protection or enhancement of instream flow,
    (2) Restoration of natural flow regimes,
    (3) Improvement to water quality,
    (4) Restoration of natural channel, bank, and riparian conditions,
    (5) Restoration of natural instream and bank cover conditions.
    (d) Lake Habitat, including:
    (1) Stabilization of water level,
    (2) Water quality protection or improvement,
    (3) Restoration of natural lakebed conditions,
    (4) Riparian area maintenance,
    (5) Outlet flow maintenance.
    (e) Wetlands Habitat, including:
    (1) Protection of existing wetlands,
    (2) Restoration of drained or otherwise degraded wetlands,
    (3) Enhancement of wetland habitat.
    (f) Upland Habitat, including:
    (1) Protection or restoration of migration corridors,
    (2) Re-connection of fragmented habitats,
    (3) Protection of critical habitats,
    (4) Habitat condition improvement.
    (g) Outdoor Recreation, including:
    (1) Establishment of fishing and boating access,
    (2) Establishment of greenways and low impact trails,
    (3) Providing opportunities for wildlife related recreation, 
including hunting and observation,
    (4) Providing opportunities for passive recreation and sightseeing,
    (5) Stocking waters with fish (where not incompatible with 
biological objectives),
    (6) Education and interpretation related to fish, wildlife, and 
their habitats.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.15  Planning and management techniques applicable to the plan.

    The Commission recognizes that there are a wide range of techniques 
that may be employed to protect or restore natural resources. The 
Commission will consider projects that make use of techniques that 
either have previously been proven to be effective at meeting stated 
objectives or represent new and innovative approaches that hold promise 
for being effective and establishing positive precedents for future 
activities. Following is a representative list of techniques that the 
Commission may choose to fund. This list is not exhaustive. Other 
appropriate techniques may exist or be developed in the future.
    (a) Acquisition of property (land or water), or an interest in 
property, for fish, wildlife, or recreation purposes.
    (b) Physical restoration of ecological functions and habitat values 
of lands or water courses.
    (c) Construction and reconstruction of facilities, such as trails, 
fish culture facilities, instream spawning facilities, water control 
structures, and fencing that aid in the conservation of fish and 
wildlife resources, and/or provide recreation opportunities.
    (d) Regional planning aimed at conserving fish and wildlife, and/or 
providing recreation opportunities.
    (e) Management and operations agreements, strategies, and other 
institutional arrangements aimed at conserving fish and wildlife and 
their habitats, and/or providing recreation opportunities.
    (f) Inventory and assessment of biological resources.
    (g) Applied research that targets specific biological information or 
management needs.
    (h) Development of educational materials and programs aimed at 
increasing public enjoyment and awareness of fish and wildlife resources 
and the ecosystems upon which they depend.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.16  Plan content.

    (a) Minimum requirements. At a minimum, the plan will include:
    (1) A summary of basic information from the planning rule, including 
project evaluation procedures and plan amendment procedures,
    (2) The identification of measurable objectives for the term of the 
plan,
    (3) A list, and description, of the projects selected for 
implementation

[[Page 911]]

during the term of the plan--with particular emphasis on projects to be 
implemented early in the planning cycle,
    (4) A description of the relationship between the projects to be 
included in the plan and the Commission's mitigation obligations,
    (5) A preliminary determination regarding environmental review 
requirements for each project,
    (6) A preliminary determination of management and operation 
requirements and how these will be met,
    (7) A budget, both for the next fiscal year and for the entire five-
year period,
    (8) A project phasing plan spanning the term of the plan, and
    (9) A strategy for monitoring progress and evaluating 
accomplishments, and
    (b) Potential additions. At the Commission's discretion, the plan 
may also include:
    (1) A discussion of the relationship of the plan to other activities 
affecting fish, wildlife, and recreation resources within the State of 
Utah, and/or
    (2) Discussions of, or information on, other topics that the 
Commission determines to be relevant. For example, the Commission may 
wish to identify mitigation and/or conservation measures that the 
Commission may wish to consider in later years of the five-year plan or 
in subsequent five-year plans.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.17  Plan development process.

    Following adoption of the planning rule, the Commission will proceed 
with the preparation of the plan, in adherence with the following 
procedures and in the order stated:
    (a) A formal request for recommendations regarding potential 
projects will be made to Federal and State resource agencies, Indian 
tribes, and other interested parties. An appropriate announcement will 
also be made in the Federal Register. Those choosing to participate will 
have 90 days to submit project proposals. The project solicitation 
process is discussed in detail in Sec. 10005.18.
    (b) The Commission will compile all recommendations and make these 
available for public review at the Commission's office. The Commission 
will also provide copies upon request for a reasonable cost.
    (c) The Commission will evaluate each project proposal according to 
the decision factors, standards, and evaluation procedures described in 
Sec. 10005.19 and prepare a preliminary list of priority projects.
    (d) One or more public meetings will be scheduled in which 
Commission staff will present the Commission's analysis and preliminary 
conclusions.
    (e) The Commission will prepare a final list of projects proposed 
for implementation during the term of the plan.
    (f) A draft plan will be prepared, approved by the Commission, and 
released for public review. Availability of the document will be 
announced in the Federal Register. The public will be given a minimum of 
thirty days to review the draft and submit written comments.
    (g) The Commission will make necessary revisions and formally adopt 
a final version of the plan. Completion of the plan will be announced in 
the Federal Register. The Act requires that the initial final plan be 
completed by March 31, 1996 and be revised at least every five years 
thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.18  Project solicitation procedures.

    As provided for in Section 301 of the Act, the Commission will make 
a formal invitation to Federal and State resource agencies, Indian 
tribes, and other interested parties to prepare recommendations 
concerning projects that will be considered for funding. This invitation 
will take the form of a ``project solicitation packet.'' The packet will 
contain a cover letter, this planning rule or a reference as to where it 
may be obtained, a format for preparing applications, and other 
materials that the Commission concludes will assist in the preparation 
of recommendations. Appropriate announcement will also be made in the 
Utah media and in the Federal Register in order that other interested 
parties might be made aware of the opportunity to participate. To assist 
applicants, the format for preparing application may be made available 
in electronic form upon request. As warranted, the Commission may 
propose specific projects and/or assist others in

[[Page 912]]

the preparation of recommendations in order to fully execute its 
obligations as described in Sec. 10005.8. The following information will 
be requested of applicants:
    (a) An abstract of the proposed project,
    (b) Information on the applicant, including the name of the person 
preparing the recommendation, the official authorizing the 
recommendation, and partners to the application, if any,
    (c) The location of the proposed project,
    (d) The overall goal for the project and the specific fish, 
wildlife, or recreation objective(s) that the project's proponent seeks 
to achieve,

<R05>
Sec. 10005.19  Decision factors.

    This section identifies the principle decision factors that the 
Commission will use to evaluate the relative merit of proposed projects 
and the way that the Commission will apply these decision factors. The 
Commission has selected six general decision factors that will be used 
to evaluate the relative priority of proposed projects. ``Standards'' 
related to each decision factor provide a means for measuring the extent 
to which each proposed project responds to the decision factors. The 
Commission's decision factors and standards are as follows:
    (a) Decision Factor 1: Benefits to fish, wildlife, and recreation 
resources. The following three standards apply:
    (1) Biological integrity. Projects will contribute to the 
productivity, integrity, and diversity of fish and wildlife resources 
within the State of Utah. To meet the Biological Integrity standard, 
projects should accomplish one or more of the following:
    (i) Protect, restore, or enhance the ecological functions, values, 
and integrity of natural ecosystems supporting fish and wildlife 
resources,
    (ii) Provide conservation benefits to both species and their 
habitats,
    (iii) Provide benefits to multiple species,
    (iv) Promote biodiversity and/or genetic conservation,
    (v) Aid long-term survival/recovery of species, or groups of 
species, that are of special concern, including:
    (A) Species on the Federal List of Endangered or Threatened Wildlife 
and Plants,
    (B) Federal category 1 or 2 candidates for listing,
    (C) Species identified by the UDWR as wildlife species of special 
concern,
    (D) UDWR Natural Heritage Program G1 and G2 plant and animal 
species,
    (E) On lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service or the Bureau of 
Land Management, species of special concern as recognized by the 
appropriate agency, and
    (F) the sensitive species conservation list developed by the Utah 
Interagency Conservation Committee,
    (vi) Provide protection to important aquatic, riparian, or upland 
habitats, especially those that are either critical to a sensitive 
indigenous species or useful to a variety of species over a

[[Page 913]]

range of environmental conditions, and/or
    (vii) Restore self-sustaining, naturally functioning aquatic or 
riparian systems, especially through the use of natural recovery 
methods.
    (2) Recreation opportunities. Projects with recreation objectives 
will provide opportunities for high quality outdoor recreation 
experiences for the general public that are compatible with, and 
support, the conservation of biological resources and natural systems. 
To meet the Recreation Opportunities standard, projects should 
accomplish one or more of the following:
    (i) Create opportunities for the public to enjoy fish, wildlife, and 
native plants in their natural habitats,
    (ii) Provide permanent access to aquatic areas for recreation 
purposes,
    (iii) Create opportunities for walking or bicycling that complement 
protection and restoration of riparian and aquatic corridors,
    (iv) Create opportunities for fishing, boating, and other water-
based recreation activities that complement protection and restoration 
of aquatic areas,
    (v) Provide outdoor recreation opportunities that are lacking within 
the watershed or State,
    (vi) Provide outdoor recreation opportunities near to or accessible 
by urban populations,
    (vii) Provide outdoor recreation opportunities for people who are 
physically challenged or economically disadvantaged,
    (viii) Provide opportunities for environmental education and 
interpretation, and/or
    (ix) Do not cause a disruption to the natural environment that will, 
itself, require mitigation.
    (3) Scientific Foundation. Projects will be based on and supported 
by the best available scientific knowledge. To meet the Scientific 
Foundation standard, projects should accomplish one or more of the 
following:
    (i) Include specific and sound biological objectives,
    (ii) Be supported by appropriate population and/or habitat 
inventories or other scientific documentation,
    (iii) Provide tangible results and, to the extent possible, 
measurable benefits to species, habitats, and/or recreation 
opportunities,
    (iv) Involve accepted techniques that have been demonstrated to 
produce significant results, or, alternatively, innovative techniques 
that hold promise for resolving significant issues and that might serve 
as models for other initiatives,
    (v) Make a significant contribution to the scientific knowledge 
concerning ecosystem protection and restoration, and/or
    (vi) Be recognized as scientifically valid by the American Fisheries 
Society, the Wildlife Society, or other applicable professional 
scientific organization.
    (b) Decision Factor 2: Fiscal responsibility. The following three 
standards apply:
    (1) Fiscal accountability. Projects will provide a substantial 
return on the public's investment. To meet the Fiscal Accountability 
standard, projects should accomplish one or more of the following:
    (i) Provide significant benefit at reasonable cost,
    (ii) Where alternatives exist, utilize the least cost alternative 
that fully meets objectives,
    (iii) Continue to provide value over the long term, and/or
    (iv) Encourage and facilitate economic efficiency among agencies.
    (2) Shared funding. While not an absolute requirement, projects 
should, when practical, be funded through cost sharing with project 
participants or involve other contributions. To meet the Shared Funding 
standard, projects should accomplish one or more of the following:
    (i) Have guaranteed partial funding from other sources,
    (ii) Have a high potential for leveraging additional funding by 
others in the future,
    (iii) Be coupled with other ongoing or proposed projects that have 
compatible objectives and secured non-Commission funding, and/or
    (iv) Involve significant in-kind contributions by the applicant and 
participating agencies or organizations.
    (3) Protection of investment. Successful implementation of projects 
over time

[[Page 914]]

will be ensured. To meet the Protection of Investment standard, projects 
should accomplish one or more of the following:
    (i) Result in permanent, as opposed to temporary, protection to fish 
and/or wildlife habitats,
    (ii) Have low maintenance cost and/or be self sustaining over the 
long term,
    (iii) Have clearly assigned operations and management 
responsibilities and assurances of long term support on the part of 
implementors,
    (iv) For those projects likely to require substantial operations and 
management expenditures, have in place a realistic strategy for 
obtaining the necessary funds, including, where applicable, a commitment 
by the applicable agency(ies) to seek necessary appropriations,
    (v) Contain guarantees on the part of the applicable landowner(s) or 
manager(s) that incompatible land uses will not be allowed, and/or
    (vi) Have a high probability that action will not be negated by 
other activities outside of the control of the land owner/manager.
    (c) Decision Factor 3: Agency and public involvement and commitment. 
The following three standards apply:
    (1) Partnerships. Projects should, when practical, involve a 
partnership among Federal and State agencies, local governments, private 
organizations, and/or landowners or other citizens. To meet the 
Partnerships standard, projects should accomplish one or more of the 
following:
    (i) Span multiple jurisdictions or otherwise require, or benefit 
from, inter-organizational cooperation and involvement,
    (ii) Have been proposed through a cooperative effort among two or 
more agencies, governments, and/or private entities, each having a stake 
in the outcome and/or possessing complementary expertise, and/or
    (iii) Encourage, or facilitate, the establishment of complementary 
management plans and programs among land and resource managers.
    (2) Authority and capability. The entities charged with undertaking 
and, after completion, managing each project must have the authority to 
be involved in the proposed activity and possess the administrative, 
financial, technical, and logistical capability necessary for successful 
implementation. To meet the Authority and Capability standard, projects 
should:
    (i) Be supported by documented evidence that the entities involved 
have previously undertaken similar work successfully, and/or
    (ii) Be supported by fully developed implementation plans.
    (3) Public support. Projects should, wherever possible, enjoy broad 
support within the natural resource community, and/or with the public 
at-large. To meet the Public Support standard, projects should:
    (i) Build upon previous compatible efforts that have undergone 
public involvement and are widely supported,
    (ii) Be supported by implementation plans that have previously been 
subjected to peer and/or public review,
    (iii) Have documented support from affected interests, and/or
    (iv) Have a high probability that agency and public support will be 
sustained into the future. This is especially important for multi-year 
projects and projects that are part of a larger, long-term initiative.
    (d) Decision factor 4: Consistency with laws and programs. The 
following two standards apply:
    (1) Laws and tribal rights. Projects will be consistent with the 
legal rights of Indian tribes and with applicable State and Federal 
laws.
    (2) Complementary activities. Projects will complement the policies, 
plans, and management activities of Federal and State resource 
management agencies and appropriate Indian tribes. To meet the 
Complementary Activities standard, projects should:
    (i) Complement, or contribute to, established, documented fish and 
wildlife protection and/or restoration programs,
    (ii) Be a component of, or support, a recognized ecosystem or 
watershed planning initiative where protection or restoration of fish, 
wildlife, or recreation is a primary goal, and/or
    (iii) For projects involving Federal or state lands, be consistent 
with, and supported by, an adopted management plan.

[[Page 915]]

    (e) Decision Factor 5: Other contributions. The following two 
standards apply:
    (1) Public benefits. Projects will, wherever practicable, provide 
benefits in addition to those provided to fish, wildlife, and 
recreation. To meet the Public Benefits standard, projects should:
    (i) To the extent that this is compatible with the primary objective 
of protecting or restoring fish, wildlife, or outdoor recreation, 
provide opportunities for multiple use of resources,
    (ii) Provide benefits to aspects of the environment beyond fish, 
wildlife, and recreation,
    (iii) Not result in unacceptable impacts to other aspects of the 
environment, and/or
    (iv) Contribute to the social and/or economic well-being of the 
community, the region, and/or the State.
    (2) Unmet needs. Projects will satisfy significant needs that would 
not otherwise be met. To meet the Unmet Needs standard, projects should:
    (i) Address significant fish, wildlife, or recreation needs that are 
unable to secure adequate funding from other sources,
    (ii) Not duplicate actions already taken or underway, and/or
    (iii) Not substitute for actions that are the responsibility of 
another agency and that must be implemented regardless of Commission 
involvement. This is not meant to restrict the Commission's ability to 
be involved in projects advanced by land management or other agencies 
that, while within the general responsibility of the agency, cannot be 
implemented because of internal funding limitations.
    (f) Decision Factor 6: Compatibility with the Commission's overall 
program. This decision factor is relevant to the overall project 
portfolio rather than to individual projects. The following five 
standards apply:
    (1) Commission obligations. Taken as a whole, the project portfolio 
must help fulfill the Commission's obligations for mitigation of Federal 
reclamation projects as described in Sec. 10005.8.
    (2) Project mix. The Commission's portfolio should provide an 
appropriate mix of projects in terms of project type, geographical 
distribution, and other appropriate factors. While the Commission 
desires to implement a broad range of projects, and to have an effect 
throughout the State, this alone will not determine the Commission's mix 
of projects. Among the factors that the Commission will consider when 
selecting projects are the following:
    (i) The Commission will consider concentrating projects in one 
watershed or basin if these projects are ecologically connected and are 
likely to result in a significant cumulative effect on fish, wildlife, 
and/or recreation that could not otherwise be realized.
    (ii) The Commission will consider implementing a major, high cost 
project--as opposed to several smaller projects with the same total 
cost--if that project is likely to produce net cumulative benefits to 
fish, wildlife, and/or recreation that exceed those of the smaller 
projects.
    (iii) The Commission will consider small projects that appear 
unconnected to other Commission activities if these can serve to 
demonstrate the viability of a certain type of protection and 
restoration project, or to establish the groundwork for additional fish, 
wildlife, and recreation initiatives.
    (3) Timing. Projects should address needs that are time sensitive. 
To meet the Timing standard, projects should:
    (i) Target immediate, high priority needs,
    (ii) Target opportunities that are of limited duration,
    (iii) Preempt future crises, and/or
    (iv) Be consistent with identified ``critical paths'' or other 
logical, multiple-year project phasing plans.
    (4) Project completion. Ongoing projects that are making 
satisfactory progress will generally be approved for continued funding 
prior to allocating funds for new projects.
    (5) Budget. The total cost of proposed projects for any given fiscal 
year must not exceed the Commission's anticipated budget allocation for 
that year. When the total cost of qualified projects exceeds funding 
capability, the Commission will re-evaluate all qualified projects and 
identify those that, in combination, produce the most meaningful 
results. High cost projects will be subjected to particular scrutiny and 
may be scaled back, phased over

[[Page 916]]

multiple years, or deferred if doing otherwise would preclude other 
worthwhile but lower cost projects.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.20  Project evaluation procedures.

    Projects proposed for inclusion in the plan will be subjected to a 
systematic evaluation using the decision factors delineated in 
Sec. 10005.19. The Commission may, at any time in the project evaluation 
process, contact applicants to ask for clarification, to propose 
modifications, or to otherwise cause the formulation of project 
proposals that are in keeping with the Commission's authority and 
mission. The result of the evaluation will be a preliminary list of 
eligible projects, arrayed by year over the term of the plan. The 
evaluation will adhere to the following process:
    (a) Each project will be arrayed according to location (by 
watershed), project type, and the resource that the project seeks to 
address.
    (b) Each project's consistency with Commission policy delineated in 
Sec. 10005.12 will be determined.
    (c) Complementary, competing, and duplicative projects will be 
identified. (If warranted, applicants may be asked to combine efforts or 
otherwise modify projects.)
    (d) Projects that satisfy obligations described in Sec. 10005.8 will 
be identified.
    (e) Using best professional judgement, Commission staff will 
evaluate each project according to the standards delineated in 
Sec. 10005.19 with the exception of Decision Factor 6, which relates to 
the Commission's overall portfolio and is, therefore, not applicable to 
the evaluation of a specific project.
    (1) For each standard, a preliminary rating will be made, with the 
project rated as:
    (i) Exceeding minimum standard,
    (ii) Meeting minimum standard,
    (iii) Minor deficiency in meeting standard,
    (iv) Deficient, or
    (v) Not applicable.
    (2) Commission ratings will be contrasted to those of applicants and 
major discrepancies re-evaluated. Commission findings will be recorded 
and will be available for review.
    (f) Each project will be given an overall rating based on the extent 
to which it meets Commission criteria as defined in paragraphs (b) 
through (e) of this section. The rating will be made on the basis of 
best professional judgement using quantitative and/or qualitative rating 
techniques as appropriate. A given project need not meet all standards 
to be selected for inclusion in the Commission's plan. A project may, 
for example, be deficient in an area that the Commission determines is 
not important for that type of project or, alternatively, deficiencies 
in some areas may be off-set by major assets in others. A tiered rating 
scale will be used, with projects grouped into two or more categories 
according to how well they meet Commission criteria.
    (g) Projects with moderate to high ratings will then be re-evaluated 
from a multiple project perspective. Decision Factor 6, Compatibility 
with the Commission's Overall Program, will be the focus of this 
evaluation. For those areas with a concentration of projects this might 
involve a watershed-wide analysis. It will also involve a state-wide 
analysis. As with the previous step, the evaluation will be conducted 
using best professional judgement and may involve a variety of 
applicable techniques.


<R05>
Sec. 10005.21  Amending the plan.

    The Commission considers the plan to be a dynamic instrument that 
guides decisions over time and is capable of responding to changing 
circumstances. Amendments to the plan provide the vehicle for 
maintaining this dynamic quality.
    (a) Types of plan amendment. The Commission recognizes three 
distinct types of plan amendment: comprehensive revisions, substantive 
revisions, and technical revisions. The particulars regarding each is as 
follows:
    (1) Comprehensive revision. The Act requires that the Commission 
``develop and adopt'' a plan every five years. At the end of each five 
year period the Commission will undertake a comprehensive review of the 
plan to determine its adequacy and the need for revision. The need to 
revise, and add to, the Commission's portfolio of proposed

[[Page 917]]

projects will be central to this review. Other elements, for example, 
reconsideration of the Commission's objectives for the preceding five-
year period and the Commission's standards for selecting projects, may 
also be reconsidered. Based on this review the Commission may call for 
the preparation of a new plan. The consultation procedures described in 
Sec. 10005.7 will apply, as will the procedures described in 
Sec. 10005.17, and the procedures described in Sec. 10005.18. The 
Commission is not obligated to wait five years to undertake such 
revision to the plan. This may be undertaken at any time that the 
Commission deems appropriate.
    (2) Substantive revision. The Commission may, from time to time, 
determine that changes to the plan's list of projects are in order. 
Typically this will take the form of substituting a project in the plan 
with a new project, changing the order for implementation, or making 
significant modifications to previously selected projects. When the 
Commission determines that there is a need for such substantive changes, 
a formal announcement will be made and interested parties will be given 
the opportunity to provide recommendations following the procedures 
described in Sec. 10005.18. Changes of this nature will not necessitate 
a total revision to the plan but rather involve select modifications to 
specific portions of the plan. Changes to other specific elements of the 
plan may also be amended in this way. Portions of the plan that are 
proposed for modification will be released in draft form, with the 
public given thirty days to provide comments prior to formal adoption by 
the Commission. Substantive amendments provide a way to incrementally 
amend the plan over time without the necessity of a major rewrite and 
will be central to the Commission's planning process. The Commission 
will specifically consider the need for substantive amendments on at 
least an annual basis. Consideration of substantive amendments will 
typically be made in concert with preparation of the annual budget 
request.
    (3) Technical revision. Technical revisions include changes that 
correct inadvertent errors or provide current information, other minor 
revisions that do not substantively modify the plan, or, changes in the 
particulars of one or more projects that do not change basic project 
goals and objectives nor substantively modify expected environmental 
effects. Technical revisions to projects might include, but are not 
limited to, changes in the list of participating organizations, changes 
in the exact location of certain project activities, and changes to 
specific tasks. Substitution of one project for another, or aggregation 
of projects, may also be considered a technical revision if the projects 
possess similar qualities and the action is supported by affected 
parties and the general public. Technical revisions do not constitute a 
formal amendment to the plan and do not require the notification and 
reporting procedures of a formal amendment. Affected agencies and 
interests must, however, be consulted, and the rationale for making the 
technical revision documented. The plan document will be corrected to 
reflect technical revisions, and a historical record kept in order to 
track the plan's evolution.
    (b) Public petitions. Agencies and members of the public have the 
right to, at any time, petition the Commission to open the plan to 
comprehensive or substantive amendments. Petitions must be made in 
writing and should state the specific reason why the action is 
requested. The petition may be accompanied by a specific project 
recommendation. The Commission will, during the public session of the 
next official Commission meeting, announce that such a petition has been 
received. The Commission may choose to vote on the petition at that time 
or to take the matter under advisement until the following Commission 
meeting at which time the Commission must vote to determine if the 
petition has merit. Following acceptance of a petition the Commission 
will promptly establish the procedures and schedule that will be 
followed in considering amendments. Project recommendations made 
pursuant to a petition must be presented using the format described in 
Sec. 10005.18 and will be evaluated in the manner described in 
Sec. 10005.20. Proposals for technical amendments do not require a 
formal petition. Written requests for technical amendment will

[[Page 918]]

be acted upon by the Commission in a timely manner.

     Subpart A--Protection and Enhancement of Environmental Quality


<R05>
Sec. 10010.1  Purpose.

    This Subpart establishes the Commission's policies for complying 
with Title 1 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) (NEPA); Section 2 of Executive Order 
11514, Protection and Enhancement of Environmental Quality, as amended 
by Executive Order 11991; and the regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality (CEQ)

[[Page 919]]

implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500 
through 1508).


<R05>
Sec. 10010.2  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Commission:
    (a) To provide leadership in protecting and enhancing those aspects 
of the quality of the Nation's environment which relate to or may be 
affected by the Commission's policies, goals, programs, plans, or 
functions in furtherance of national environmental policy;
    (b) To use all practicable means to improve, coordinate, and direct 
its policies, plans, functions, programs, and resources in furtherance 
of national environmental goals;
    (c) To interpret and administer, to the fullest extent possible, the 
policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States administered 
by the Commission in accordance with the policies of NEPA;
    (d) To consider and give significant weight to environmental 
factors, along with other essential considerations, in developing 
proposals and making decisions in order to achieve a proper balance 
between the development and utilization of natural, cultural, and human 
resources and the protection and enhancement of environmental quality;
    (e) To consult, coordinate, and cooperate with other Federal 
agencies and State, local, and Indian tribal governments in the 
development and implementation of the Commission's plans and programs 
affecting environmental quality and, in turn, to provide to the fullest 
extent practicable, these entities with information concerning the 
environmental impacts of their respective plans and programs;
    (f) To provide, to the fullest extent practicable, timely 
information to the public to better assist in understanding the 
Commission's plans and programs affecting environmental quality and to 
facilitate their involvement in the development of such plans and 
programs; and
    (g) To cooperate with and assist the CEQ.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.3  General responsibilities.

    The following responsibilities reflect the Commission's decision 
that the officials responsible for making program decisions are also 
responsible for taking the requirements of NEPA into account in those 
decisions and will be held accountable for that responsibility:
    (a) Executive Director. (1) Is the Commission's focal point on NEPA 
matters and is responsible for overseeing the Commission's 
implementation of NEPA.
    (2) Serves as the Commission's principle contact with the CEQ.
    (3) Assigns to Commission staff the responsibilities outlined in 
this part.
    (4) Must comply with the provisions of NEPA, E.O. 11514 as amended, 
the CEQ regulations, and this part.
    (5) Will interpret and administer, to the fullest extent possible, 
the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States 
administered under the Commission's jurisdiction in accordance with the 
policies of NEPA.
    (6) Will continue to review the Commission's statutory authorities, 
administrative regulations, policies, programs, and procedures, in order 
to identify any deficiencies or inconsistencies therein which prohibit 
or limit full compliance with the intent, purpose, and provisions of 
NEPA and, in consultation with the Department of the Interior Office of 
the Solicitor, shall take or recommend, as appropriate, corrective 
actions as may be necessary to bring these authorities and policies into 
conformance with the intent, purpose, and procedures of NEPA.
    (7) Will monitor, evaluate, and control on a continuing basis the 
Commission's activities so as to protect and enhance the quality of the 
environment. Such activities will include those directed to conserving 
and enhancing the environment and designed to accomplish other program 
objectives which may affect the quality of the environment. The 
Executive Director will develop programs and measures to protect and 
enhance environmental quality and assess progress in meeting the 
specific objectives of such activities as they affect the quality of the 
environment.

[[Page 920]]

    (b) Members of the Commission. (1) Are responsible for compliance 
with NEPA, E.O. 11514, as amended, the CEQ regulations, and this part.
    (2) Will insure that, to the fullest extent possible, the policies, 
regulations, and public laws of the United States administered under the 
Commission's jurisdiction are interpreted and administered in accordance 
with the policies of NEPA.
    (c) Department of the Interior Office of the Solicitor. Is 
responsible for providing legal advice to the Commission regarding 
compliance with NEPA.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.4  Consideration of environmental values.

    (a) In Commission management. (1) In the management of the natural, 
cultural, and human resources under its jurisdiction, the Commission 
must consider and balance a wide range of economic, environmental, and 
social objectives at the local, regional, and national levels, not all 
of which are quantifiable in comparable terms. In considering and 
balancing these objectives, Commission plans, proposals, and decisions 
often require recognition of complements and resolution of conflicts 
among interrelated uses of these natural, cultural, and human resources 
within technological, budgetary, and legal constraints.
    (2) Commission project reports, program proposals, issue papers, and 
other decision documents must carefully analyze the various objectives, 
resources, and constraints, and comprehensively and objectively evaluate 
the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed actions and their 
reasonable alternatives. Where appropriate, these documents will utilize 
and reference supporting and underlying economic, environmental, and 
other analyses.
    (3) The underlying environmental analyses will factually, 
objectively, and comprehensively analyze the environmental effects of 
proposed actions and their reasonable alternatives. They will 
systematically analyze the environmental impacts of alternatives, and 
particularly those alternatives and measures which would reduce, 
mitigate, or prevent adverse environmental impacts or which would 
enhance environmental quality.
    (b) In internally initiated proposals. Officials responsible for 
development or conduct of planning and decision making systems within 
the Commission shall incorporate to the maximum extent necessary 
environmental planning as an integral part of these systems in order to 
insure that environmental values and impacts are fully considered and in 
order to facilitate any necessary documentation of those considerations.
    (c) In externally initiated proposals. Officials responsible for 
development or conduct of grant, contract, or other externally initiated 
activities shall require applicants, to the extent necessary and 
practicable, to provide environmental information, analyses, and reports 
as an integral part of their applications. This will serve to encourage 
applicants to incorporate environmental considerations into their 
planning processes as well as provide the Commission with necessary 
information to meet its own environmental responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.5  Consultation, coordination, and cooperation with other agencies and organizations.

    (a) Commission plans and programs. (1) Officials responsible for 
planning or implementing Commission plans and programs will develop and 
utilize procedures to consult, coordinate, and cooperate with relevant 
State, local, and Indian tribal governments; other Federal agencies; and 
public and private organizations and individuals concerning the 
environmental effects of these plans and programs on their jurisdictions 
and/or interests.
    (2) The Commission will utilize, to the maximum extent possible, 
existing notification, coordination, and review mechanisms established 
by the Office of Management and Budget, the Water Resource Council, and 
CEQ. However, use of these mechanisms must not be a substitute for early 
and positive consultation, coordination, and cooperation with others, 
especially State, local, and Indian tribal governments.
    (b) Other Commission activities. (1) Technical assistance, advice, 
data, and

[[Page 921]]

information useful in restoring, maintaining, and enhancing the quality 
of the environment will be made available to other Federal agencies, 
State, local, and Indian tribal governments, institutions, and 
individuals as appropriate.
    (2) Information regarding existing or potential environmental 
problems and control methods developed as a part of research, 
development, demonstration, test, or evaluation activities will be made 
available to other Federal agencies, State, local, and Indian tribal 
governments, institutions and other entities as appropriate.
    (c) Plans and programs of other agencies and organizations. (1) 
Officials responsible for protecting, conserving, developing, or 
managing resources under the Commission's jurisdiction shall coordinate 
and cooperate with State, local and Indian tribal governments, other 
Federal agencies, and public and private organizations and individuals, 
and provide them with timely information concerning the environmental 
effects of these entities' plans and programs.
    (2) The Commission will participate early in applicable planning 
processes of other agencies and organizations in order to ensure full 
cooperation with and understanding of the Commission's programs and 
interests in natural, cultural, and human resources.
    (3) The Commission will utilize to the fullest extent possible, 
existing review mechanisms to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort 
and to avoid confusion by other organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.6  Public involvement.

    The Commission will develop and utilize procedures to ensure the 
fullest practicable provision of timely public information and 
understanding of its plans and programs including information on the 
environmental impacts of alternative courses of action. These procedures 
will include, wherever appropriate, provision for public meetings or 
hearings in order to obtain the views of interested parties. The 
Commission will also encourage State and local agencies and Indian 
tribal governments to adopt similar procedures for informing the public 
concerning their activities affecting the quality of the environment.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.7  Mandate.

    (a) This part provides instructions for complying with NEPA and 
Executive Order 11514, Protection and Enhancement of Environmental 
Quality, as amended by Executive Order 11991.
    (b) The Commission hereby adopts the regulations of the CEQ, 
implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (sec. 102(2)(C)) except 
where compliance would be inconsistent with other statutory 
requirements. In the case of any apparent discrepancies between these 
procedures and the mandatory provisions of the CEQ regulations the 
regulations shall govern.
    (c) Instructions supplementing the CEQ regulations are provided in 
subparts B through G of this part. Citations in brackets refer to the 
CEQ regulations. In addition, the Commission may prepare a handbook or 
other technical guidance, or adopt an appropriate handbook or guidance 
prepared by another agency, for its personnel on how to apply this part 
to principal programs.


<R04>
                 Subpart B--Initiating the NEPA Process


<R05>
Sec. 10010.8  Purpose.

    This subpart provides supplemental instructions for implementing 
those portions of the CEQ regulations pertaining to initiating the NEPA 
process (40 CFR Parts 1501 through 1506).


<R05>
Sec. 10010.9  Apply NEPA early.

    (a) The Commission will initiate early consultation and coordination 
with other Federal agencies having jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved, and with 
appropriate Federal, State, local and Indian tribal agencies authorized 
to develop and enforce environmental standards.
    (b) The Commission will also consult early with interested private 
parties and organizations, including when the Commission's own 
involvement is reasonably foreseeable in a private or non-Federal 
application.
    (c) The Commission will insure that applicants are informed of any 
environmental information required, to be included in their applications 
and of any

[[Page 922]]

consultation with other Federal agencies, and State, local or Indian 
tribal governments required prior to making the application.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.10  Whether to prepare an EIS.

    (a) Categorical exclusions (CX) (40 CFR 1508.4).
    (1) The following criteria will be used to determine categories of 
actions to be excluded from preparation of an EA or EIS:
    (i) Analysis or experience shows that the action or group of actions 
would have no significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment; and
    (ii) The action or group of actions would not involve unresolved 
conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.
    (2) Based on the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
categories of actions listed in subpart G of this part are excluded from 
the preparation of an EA or EIS.
    (3) The exceptions listed in subpart G of this part apply to 
individual actions subject to CX. Appropriate environmental documents 
must be prepared for any actions involving these exceptions.
    (4) Notwithstanding the criteria, exclusions, and exceptions in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (3), extraordinary circumstances may dictate 
or a responsible Commission official may decide to prepare an 
environmental document to assist with decision-making.
    (b) Environmental Assessment (EA) (40 CFR 1508.9). Procedures 
regarding preparation of an EA are addressed in subpart C of this part.
    (c) Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) (40 CFR 1508.13). A 
FONSI will be prepared as a separate document based upon analysis of an 
EA and a determination that the proposed action will have no significant 
environmental impact.
    (d) Notice of Intent (NOI) (40 CFR 1508.22). A NOI will be prepared 
as soon as practicable after a decision to prepare an environmental 
impact statement and shall be published in the Federal Register and made 
available to the affected public in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6. 
Publication of a NOI may be delayed if there is proposed to be more than 
three (3) months between the decision to prepare an environmental impact 
statement and the time preparation is actually initiated. The Commission 
will periodically publish a consolidated list of these notices in the 
Federal Register.
    (e) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (40 CFR 1508.11). 
Decisions/actions which would normally require the preparation of an EIS 
are identified in subpart G of this part. Procedures regarding 
preparation of an EIS are addressed in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.11  Lead agencies.

    (a) The Commission will serve as lead, or, as appropriate, joint-
lead agency for any NEPA procedure that is sponsored by or otherwise 
significantly involves the Commission.
    (b) The Commission will inform the Office of the Solicitor of any 
agreements to assume lead or joint-lead agency status.
    (c) A non-Federal agency may be designated as a joint lead agency if 
it has a duty to comply with a local or State environmental review 
requirement. Any non-Federal agency may be a cooperating agency by 
agreement. The Commission will consult with the Office of the Solicitor 
in cases where such non-Federal agencies are also applicants before the 
Commission to determine joint-lead agency responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.12  Cooperating agencies.

    (a) The Commission will adhere to CEQ directives both in the 
designation of cooperating agencies for Commission sponsored NEPA 
procedures and in seeking designation as a cooperating agency for 
procedures sponsored by others. Any non-Federal agency may be a 
cooperating agency in Commission NEPA proceedings by agreement. The 
Commission will consult with the Office of the Solicitor in cases where 
such non-Federal agencies are also applicants before the Commission to 
determine cooperating agency responsibilities.
    (b) The Commission will inform the Office of the Solicitor of any 
agreements to assume cooperating agency status or any declinations 
pursuant to 40 CFR 1501.6 (c).

[[Page 923]]


<R05>
Sec. 10010.13  Scoping.

    (a) The invitation requirement in 40 CFR 1501.7(a)(1) may be 
satisfied by including such an invitation in the NOI.
    (b) If a scoping meeting is held, consensus is desirable; however, 
the lead agency is ultimately responsible for the scope of an EIS. In 
the case of procedures involving joint-lead agencies, all joint-lead 
agencies share this responsibility.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.14  Time limits.

    When time limits are established to prepare an environmental 
document they should reflect the availability of personnel and funds.


<R04>
                  Subpart C--Environmental Assessments


<R05>
Sec. 10010.15  Purpose.

    This subpart provides supplemental instructions for implementing 
those portions of the CEQ regulations pertaining to environmental 
assessments (EA).


<R05>
Sec. 10010.16  When to prepare.

    (a) An EA will be prepared for all actions, except those categories 
of action excluded from documentation or addressed adequately by a 
previous environmental document, or for those actions for which a 
decision has already been made to prepare an EIS. The purpose of such an 
EA is to allow the responsible official to determine whether to prepare 
an EIS.
    (b) In addition, an EA may be prepared on any action at any time in 
order to assist in planning and decision making.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.17  Public involvement.

    (a) The public may be involved in the EA process when appropriate. 
Public notification will be made of the availability of an EA document 
(40 CFR 1506.6).
    (b) The scoping process may be applied to an EA (40 CFR 1501.7).


<R05>
Sec. 10010.18  Content.

    (a) At a minimum, an EA will include brief discussions of the need 
for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E) of 
NEPA, of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and such 
alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons consulted (40 CFR 
1508.9(b)).
    (b) In addition, an EA may be expanded to more fully describe the 
proposal and a broader range of alternatives if this facilitates 
planning and decision making.
    (c) The level of detail and depth of impact analysis should normally 
be limited to that needed to determine whether there are significant 
environmental effects.
    (d) An EA will contain objective and credible analyses which support 
its environmental impact conclusions. It will not, in and of itself, 
conclude whether or not an EIS will be prepared. This conclusion will be 
made upon review of the EA by the responsible official and documented in 
either a NOI or FONSI.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.19  Format.

    (a) An EA may be prepared in any format useful to facilitate 
planning and decision making.
    (b) An EA may be combined with any other planning or decision making 
document; however, that portion which analyzes the environmental impacts 
of the proposal and alternatives will be clearly and separately 
identified and not spread throughout or interwoven into other sections 
of the document.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.20  Adoption.

    (a) An EA prepared for a proposal before the Commission by another 
agency, entity or person, including an applicant, may be adopted if, 
upon independent evaluation by the responsible Commission official, it 
is found to comply with this part and relevant provisions of the CEQ 
regulations.
    (b) When appropriate and efficient, a responsible Commission 
official may augment such an EA when it is essentially, but not 
entirely, in compliance in order to make it so.
    (c) If an EA or augmented EA is adopted, the responsible Commission 
official must prepare his/her own NOI or FONSI which also acknowledges 
the origin of the EA and takes full responsibility for its scope and 
content.

[[Page 924]]


<R04>
               Subpart D--Environmental Impact Statements


<R05>
Sec. 10010.21  Purpose.

    This subpart provides supplemental instructions for implementing 
those portions of the CEQ regulations pertaining to environmental impact 
statements (EIS).


<R05>
Sec. 10010.22  Statutory requirements.

    NEPA requires that an EIS be prepared by the responsible Federal 
official. This official is normally the lowest-level official who has 
overall responsibility for formulating, reviewing, or proposing an 
action or, alternatively, has been delegated the authority or 
responsibility to develop, approve, or adopt a proposal or action. 
Preparation at this level will ensure that the NEPA process will be 
incorporated into the planning process and that the EIS will accompany 
the proposal through existing review processes.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.23  Timing.

    (a) The feasibility analysis (go/no-go) stage, at which time an EIS 
is to be completed, is to be interpreted as the stage prior to the first 
point of major commitment to the proposal.
    (b) An EIS need not be commenced until an application is essentially 
complete; e.g., any required environmental information is submitted, any 
consultation required with other agencies has been conducted, and any 
required advance funding is paid by the applicant or other appropriate 
party.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.24  Page limits.

    An EIS should be as brief as possible and still convey the required 
information. Normally this should be accomplished in less than 150 
pages, though documents of up to 300 pages are acceptable for more 
comprehensive issues. Where the text of an EIS for a complex proposal or 
group of proposals appears to require more than the normally prescribed 
limit of 300 pages, the Commission will ensure that the length of such 
statements is no greater than necessary to comply with NEPA, the CEQ 
regulations, and this part.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.25  Supplemental environmental impact statements.

    (a) Supplement Environmental Impact Statements (SEIS) are only 
required if such changes in the proposed action or alternatives, new 
circumstances, or resultant significant effects are not adequately 
analyzed in the previously prepared EIS.
    (b) The Commission will consult with the Office of the Solicitor 
prior to proposing to CEQ to prepare a final supplement without 
preparing an intervening draft.
    (c) If, after a Record of Decision has been executed based on a 
final EIS, a described proposal is further refined or modified and if 
there are only minor changes in effects or they are still within the 
scope of the earlier EIS, an EA and FONSI may be prepared for subsequent 
decisions rather than a SEIS. As identified in Sec. 10010.61(b)(1)(i), 
changes having no potential for significant environmental impact are 
categorically excluded from environmental documentation requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.26  Format.

    (a) Proposed departures from the standard format described in the 
CEQ regulations and this part must be approved by the Executive 
Director.
    (b) The section listing the preparers of the EIS will also include 
other sources of information, including a bibliography or list of cited 
references, when appropriate.
    (c) The section listing the distribution of the EIS will also 
briefly describe the consultation and public involvement processes 
utilized in planning the proposal and in preparing the EIS, if this 
information is not discussed elsewhere in the document.
    (d) If CEQ's standard format is not used or if the EIS is combined 
with another planning or decision making document, the section which 
analyzes the environmental consequences of the proposal and its 
alternatives will be clearly and separately identified and not 
interwoven into other portions of or spread throughout the document.

[[Page 925]]


<R05>
Sec. 10010.27  Cover sheet.

    The cover sheet will indicate whether the EIS intended to serve any 
other environmental review or consultation requirements pursuant to 40 
CFR 1502.25.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.28  Summary.

    The emphasis in the summary should be on those considerations, 
controversies, and issues which significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.29  Purpose and need.

    The purpose and need section may introduce a number of factors, 
including economic and technical considerations and Commission statutory 
missions, which may be outside the scope of the EIS. Care should be 
taken to insure an objective presentation and not a justification.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.30  Alternatives including the proposed action.

    (a) As a general rule, the following guidance will apply:
    (1) For internally initiated proposals; i.e., for those cases where 
the Commission conducts or controls the planning process, both the draft 
and final EIS shall identify the Commission's proposed action, or 
preferred alternative.
    (2) For externally initiated proposals; i.e., for those cases where 
the Commission is reacting to an application or similar request, the 
draft and final EIS shall identify the applicant's proposed action and 
the Commission's preferred alternative unless another law prohibits such 
an expression.
    (3) Proposed departures from this guidance must be approved by the 
Executive Director and the Office of the Solicitor.
    (b) Mitigation measures to offset adverse effects of the proposed 
action or its alternatives are not necessarily independent of these 
actions and should be incorporated into and analyzed as a part of the 
proposal and appropriate alternatives. Where appropriate, major 
mitigation measures may be identified and analyzed as separate 
alternatives in and of themselves where the environmental consequences 
are distinct and significant enough to warrant separate evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.31  Appendix.

    If an EIS is intended to serve other environmental review or 
consultation requirements pursuant to 40 CFR 1502.25, any more detailed 
information needed to comply with these requirements may be included as 
an appendix.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.32  Tiering.

    An environmental document prepared by or for the Commission may 
incorporate by reference, either in part or in its entirety, an earlier 
environmental impact statement or environmental assessment when the 
subject matter of the earlier document is directly applicable. The 
Commission may also choose to prepare, or cause to have prepared, a 
broad environmental document to cover an entire program or, 
alternatively, a series of projects within a distinct geographic area, 
with the intent of later undertaking project-specific documentation and 
``tiering'' to the more general statement or assessment.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.33  Incorporation by reference of material into NEPA documents.

    Citations of specific topics will include the pertinent page 
numbers. All literature references will be listed in the bibliography.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.34  Incomplete or unavailable information.

    The references to overall costs in 40 CFR 1502.22 of the CEQ 
regulations are not limited to market costs, but may also include other 
costs such as social costs due to delay.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.35  Methodology and scientific accuracy.

    Conclusions about environmental effects will be preceded by an 
analysis that supports that conclusion unless explicit reference by 
footnote is made to other supporting documentation that is readily 
available to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.36  Environmental review and consultation requirements.

    (a) The Commission will maintain a list of applicable environmental 
review and consultation requirements pursuant to other federal or state 
laws and regulations and will make this available to interested parties.

[[Page 926]]

    (b) If the EIS is intended to serve as the vehicle to fully or 
partially comply with the requirements of other federal or state laws 
and regulations, the associated analyses, studies, or surveys will be 
identified as such and discussed in the text of the EIS and the cover 
sheet will so indicate. Any supporting analyses or reports to the NEPA 
documents will be incorporated by reference or included as an appendix 
and shall be sent to reviewing agencies as appropriate in accordance 
with applicable regulations or procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.37  Inviting comments.

    (a) Comments from State agencies will be requested through 
procedures established by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order 
12372, and may be requested from local agencies through these procedures 
to the extent that they include the affected local jurisdictions.
    (b) When the proposed action may affect the environment of an Indian 
reservation, comments will be requested from the Indian tribe through 
the tribal governing body, unless the tribal governing body has 
designated an alternate review process.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.38  Response to comments.

    (a) Preparation of a final EIS need not be delayed in those cases 
where a Federal agency, from which comments are required to be obtained 
(40 CFR 1503.1(a)(l)), does not comment within the prescribed time 
period. Informal attempts will be made to determine the status of any 
such comments and every reasonable attempt should be made to include the 
comments and a response in the final EIS.
    (b) When other commentors are late, their comments should be 
included in the final EIS to the extent practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.39  Elimination of duplication with state and local procedures.

    The Commission will incorporate in its appropriate program 
regulations provisions for the preparation of an EIS by a State agency 
to the extent authorized in section 102(2)(D) of NEPA.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.40  Combining documents.

    Incorporating documentation requirements of other environmental 
regulations into an EIS is both acceptable and desirable. If the EIS is 
combined with another planning or decision making document, the section 
which analyzes the environmental consequences of the proposal and its 
alternatives will be clearly and separately identified and not 
interwoven into other portions of or spread throughout the document.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.41  Commission responsibility.

    A Commission sponsored environmental document may be prepared by the 
Commission, a joint-lead agency, a contractor selected or approved by 
the Commission, or, when appropriate, a cooperating agency. Regardless, 
the Commission has the responsibility to independently evaluate and draw 
appropriate conclusions. Following the Commission's preparation or 
independent evaluation of and assumption of responsibility for an 
environmental document, an applicant may print it provided the applicant 
is bearing the cost of the document pursuant to other laws.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.42  Public involvement.

    The Commission will adhere to CEQ requirements regarding the use of 
public notices, public meetings, public review of NEPA documents, and 
other techniques to ensure that the public has ample opportunity to 
provide input into the proceedings and to ensure that the Commission 
will give due consideration to this input.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.43  Further guidance.

    The Commission may provide further guidance concerning NEPA pursuant 
to its organizational responsibilities and through supplemental 
directives.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.44  Proposals for legislation.

    (a) When appropriate, the Commission shall identify in the annual 
submittal to the Office of Management and Budget of the Commission's 
proposed legislative program any requirements for and the status of any 
environmental documents.
    (b) When required, the Commission shall ensure that a legislative 
EIS is

[[Page 927]]

included as a part of the formal transmittal of a legislative proposal 
to the Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.45  Time periods.

    (a) The minimum review period for a draft EIS will be sixty (60) 
days from the date of transmittal to the Environmental Protection 
Agency.
    (b) The Commission will be responsible for consulting with the 
Environmental Protection Agency and/or CEQ about any proposed reductions 
in time periods or any extensions of time periods proposed by those 
agencies.


<R04>
               Subpart E--Relationship to Decision-Making


<R05>
Sec. 10010.46  Purpose.

    This subpart provides supplementary instructions for implementing 
those portions of the CEQ regulations pertaining to decision-making.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.47  Pre-decision referrals to CEQ.

    (a) Upon receipt of advice that another Federal agency intends to 
refer a Commission matter to CEQ, the Commission will immediately meet 
with that Federal agency to attempt to resolve the issues raised.
    (b) Upon any referral of a Commission matter to CEQ by another 
Federal agency, the Executive Director will be responsible for 
coordinating the Commission's position.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.48  Decision-making procedures.

    (a) Procedures by which the Commission makes decisions are specified 
in 43 CFR part 10000.
    (b) The Commission will incorporate in its formal decision-making 
procedures provisions for consideration of environmental factors and 
relevant environmental documents. The major decision points for 
principal programs likely to have significant environmental effects will 
be clearly identified.
    (c) Relevant environmental documents, including supplements, will be 
included as part of the record in formal rule making or adjudicatory 
proceedings.
    (d) Relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will 
accompany proposals through existing review processes so that Commission 
officials use them in making decisions.
    (e) The decision-maker will consider the environmental impacts of 
the entire range of alternatives described in any relevant environmental 
document; the range of these alternatives must encompass the actual 
alternatives considered by the decision-maker.


<R05>
Sec. 10010.49  Record of decision.

<R05>
Sec. 10010.61  Actions subject to categorical exclusion.

    (a) General categorical exclusions. The following actions are

the affected public and essentially the existing use will be continued.
    (2) Resource management:
    (i) Research, inventory and information collection activities 
directly related to the conservation of fish and

facilities and improvements (i.e. structures, roads), including 
renovations and replacements which result in no or only minor changes in 
the capacity, use or purpose of the affected facilities.

structures or improvements are required, or the addition of buried 
lines.
    (iii) The issuance or reissuance of rights-of-way and special use 
approvals for Commission-managed land or land acquired with Commission 
funds that result in no or negligible environmental effects.
    (iv) The reissuance of grazing or agricultural use approvals for 
Commission-managed land or land acquired with Commission funds which do 
not increase the level of use nor continue a level of use that has 
resulted in adverse environmental effects.
    (4) Funding for activities by others:
    (i) Planning grants or other funding for planning activities and the 
administrative determination that plans were prepared in accordance with 
prescribed standards. However, when the plan is submitted to the 
Commission for implementation, the program proposed by the plan is 
subject to the NEPA process.
    (ii) Grants or other funding for categorically excluded actions 
listed in paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section.

water, or facilities to water districts, recreation agencies, fish and 
wildlife agencies, or other entities where the anticipated operation and 
maintenance activities are agreed to in a contract or a memorandum of
