              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2010), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (1) To preside at all meetings and sessions of the Commission.
    (2) To represent the Commission in all matters relating to 
legislation and legislative reports; however, any other Commissioner may 
present his own or minority views or supplemental reports.
    (3) To represent the Commission in all matters requiring conferences 
or communications with other governmental officers, departments or 
agencies.
    (4) To coordinate and organize the work of the Commission in such a 
manner as to promote prompt and efficient disposition of all matters 
within the jurisdiction of the Commission.
    (b) The Commission will, in the case of a vacancy in the Office of 
the Chairman of the Commission, or in the absence or inability of the 
Chairman to serve, temporarily designate one of its members to act as

[[Page 8]]

designation has been eliminated or corrected.

[32 FR 10569, July 19, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 0.5  General description of Commission organization and operations.

    (a) Principal staff units. The Commission is assisted in the 
performance of its responsibilities by its staff, which is divided into 
the following principal units:
    (1) Office of Managing Director.
    (2) Office of Engineering and Technology.
    (3) Office of General Counsel.
    (4) Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis.
    (5) Office of Media Relations.
    (6) Office of Legislative Affairs.
    (7) Office of Inspector General.
    (8) Office of Communications Business Opportunities.
    (9) Office of Administrative Law Judges.
    (10) Office of Workplace Diversity
    (11) Wireline Competition Bureau.
    (12) Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.
    (13) International Bureau.
    (14) Media Bureau.
    (15) Enforcement Bureau.
    (16) Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau.
    (17) Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau.
    (b) Staff responsibilities and functions. The organization and 
functions of these major staff units are described in detail in 
Sec. Sec. 0.11 through 0.151. The defense and emergency preparedness 
functions of the Commission are set forth separately, beginning at Sec. 
0.181. For a complete description of staff functions, reference should 
be made to those provisions. (See also the U.S. Government Organization 
Manual, which contains a chart showing the Commission's organization, 
the names of the members and principal staff officers of the Commission, 
and other information concerning the Commission.)
    (c) Delegations of authority to the staff. Pursuant to section 5(c) 
of the Communications Act, the Commission has delegated authority to its 
staff to act on matters which are minor or routine or settled in nature 
and those in which immediate action may be necessary. See subpart B of 
this part. Actions taken under delegated authority are subject to review 
by the Commission, on its own motion or on an application for review 
filed by a person aggrieved by the action. Except for the possibility of 
review, actions taken under delegated authority have the same force and 
effect as actions taken by the Commission. The delegation of authority 
to a staff officer, however, does not mean that he will exercise that 
authority in all matters subject to the delegation. In non-hearing 
matters, the staff is at liberty to refer any matter at any stage to the 
Commission for action, upon concluding that it involves matters 
warranting the Commission's consideration, and the Commission may 
instruct the staff to do so.
    (d) Commission action. Matters requiring Commission action, or 
warranting its consideration, are dealt with by the Commission at 
regular monthly meetings, or at special meetings called to consider a 
particular matter. Meetings are normally held at the principal offices 
of the Commission in the District of Columbia, but may be held elsewhere 
in the United States. In appropriate circumstances, Commission action 
may be taken between meetings ``by circulation'', which involves the 
submission of a document to each of the Commissioners for his approval.
    (e) Compliance with Federal financial management requirements. Any 
Bureau or Office recommending Commission action that may affect agency 
compliance with Federal financial management requirements must confer 
with the Office of Managing Director. Such items will indicate the 
position of the Managing Director when forwarded to the Commission. Any 
Bureau or Office taking action under delegated authority that may affect 
agency compliance with Federal financial management requirements must 
confer with the Office of the Managing Director before taking action.

Sec. 0.186  Emergency Relocation Board.

    (a) As specified in the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan 
and consistent with the exercise of the War Emergency Powers of the 
President as set forth in section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended, if the full Commission or a quorum thereof is unable to act, 
an Emergency Relocation Board will be convened at the Commission's 
Headquarters or other relocation site designated to serve as Primary FCC 
Staff to perform the functions of the Commission. Relocation may be 
required to accommodate a variety of emergency scenarios. Examples 
include scenarios in which FCC headquarters is unavailable or 
uninhabitable; or many, if not all, agencies must evacuate the immediate 
Washington, DC, area. The FCC's Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) 
includes the deliberate and pre-planned movement of selected key 
principals and supporting staff to a relocation facility. As an example, 
a sudden emergency, such as a fire or hazardous materials incident, may 
require the evacuation of FCC headquarters with little or no advance 
notice, but for only a short duration. Alternatively, an emergency so 
severe that FCC headquarters is rendered unusable and likely will be for 
a period long enough to significantly impact normal operations, may 
require COOP implementation. Nothing in this subsection shall be 
construed to diminish the authority of the Commission or its staff to 
perform functions of the Commission at the Commission's headquarters or 
other relocation site using existing authority provided for elsewhere in 
this Chapter.
    (b) The Board shall comprise such Commissioners as may be present 
(including Commissioners available through electronic communications or 
telephone) and able to act. In the absence of the Chairman, the 
Commissioner present with the longest seniority in office will serve as 
acting Chairman. If no Commissioner is present and able to act, the 
person designated as next most senior official in the Commission's 
Continuity of Operations Plan will head the Board.

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 0.201  General provisions.

    (a) There are three basic categories of delegations made by the 
Commission pursuant to section 5(c) of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended:
    (1) Delegations to act in non-hearing matters and proceedings. The 
great bulk of delegations in this category are made to bureau chiefs and 
other members of the Commission's staff. This category also includes 
delegations to individual commissioners and to boards or committees of 
commissioners.
    (2) Delegations to rule on interlocutory matters in hearing 
proceedings. Delegations in this category are made to the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge.

    Note to paragraph (a)(2): Interlocutory matters which are not 
delegated to the Chief Administrative Law Judge are ruled on by

[[Page 30]]

the presiding officer by virtue of the authority vested in him to 
control the course and conduct of the hearing. This authority stems from 
section 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act and section 409 of the 
Communications Act rather than from delegations of authority made 
pursuant to section 5(c) of the Communications Act. (See Sec. Sec. 
0.218 and 0.341.).

    (3) Delegations to review an initial decision. Delegations in this 
category are made to individual commissioners, to panels of 
commissioners.
    (b) Delegations are arranged in this subpart under headings denoting 
the person, panel, or board to whom authority has been delegated, rather 
than by the categories listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Procedures pertaining to the filing and disposition of 
interlocutory pleadings in hearing proceedings are set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 1.291 through 1.298 of this chapter. Procedures pertaining to 
appeals from rulings of the presiding officer are set forth in Sec. 
1.301. Procedures pertaining to reconsideration of the presiding 
officer's rulings are set forth in Sec. 1.303. Procedures pertaining to 
reconsideration and review of actions taken pursuant to delegated 
authority are set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.101, 1.102, 1.104, 1.106, 1.113, 
1.115, and 1.117. Procedures pertaining to exceptions to initial 
decisions are set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.276-1.279.
    (d) The Commission, by vote of a majority of the members then 
holding office, may delegate its functions either by rule or by order, 
and may at any time amend, modify, or rescind any such rule or order.
    (1) Functions of a continuing or recurring nature are delegated by 
rule. The rule is published in the Federal Register and is included in 
this subpart.
    (2) Functions pertaining to a particular matter or proceeding are 
delegated by order. The order is published in the Federal Register and 
associated with the record of that matter or proceeding, but neither the 
order nor any reference to the delegation made thereby is included in 
this subpart.

Sec. 0.203  Authority of person, panel, or board to which functions are delegated.

shall, with respect to such functions, have all the jurisdiction, 
powers, and authority conferred by law upon the Commission, and shall be 
subject to the same duties and obligations.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 1.102 of this chapter, any action 
taken pursuant to delegated authority shall have the same force and 
effect and shall be made, evidenced, and enforced in the same manner as 
actions of the Commission.

official (or group of officials) to whom authority is delegated in this 
subpart is authorized to issue orders (including rulings, decisions, or 
other action documents) pursuant to such authority and to enter into 
general correspondence concerning any matter for which he is responsible 
under this subpart or subpart A of this part.
    (b) Authority of subordinate officials. Authority delegated to any 
official to issue orders or to enter into correspondence under paragraph 
(a) of this section may be exercised by that official or by appropriate 
subordinate officials acting for him.
    (c) Signature. (1) Other orders made by a committee, board or panel 
identify the body and are signed by the Secretary.
    (2) Upon signing an order, the Secretary affixes the Commission's 
seal.
    (3) General correspondence by a committee or board is signed by the

[32 FR 10570, July 19, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 0.406  The rules and regulations.

    Persons having business with the Commission should familiarize 
themselves with those portions of its rules and regulations pertinent to 
such business. All of the rules have been published and are readily 
available. See Sec. Sec. 0.411(b), 0.412, and 0.415. For the benefit of 
those who are not familiar with the rules, there is set forth in this 
section a brief description of their format and contents.
    (a) Format. The rules are set forth in the Code of Federal 
Regulations as chapter I of title 47. Chapter I is divided into parts 
numbered from 0-99. Each part, in turn, is divided into numbered 
sections. To allow for the addition of new parts and sections in logical 
sequence, without extensive renumbering, parts and sections are not 
always numbered consecutively. Thus, for example, part 2 is followed by 
part 5, and Sec. 1.8 is followed by Sec. 1.10; in this case, parts 3 
and 4 and Sec. 1.9 have been reserved for future use. In numbering 
sections, the number before the period is the part number; and the 
number after the period locates the section within that part. Thus, for 
example, Sec. 1.1 is the first section of part 1 and Sec. 5.1 is the 
first section in part 5. Except in the case of accounting regulations 
(parts 31-35), the period should not be read as a decimal point; thus, 
Sec. 1.511 is not located between Sec. Sec. 1.51 and 1.52 but at a 
much later point in the rules. In citing the Code of Federal 
Regulations, the citation, 47 CFR 5.1, for example, is to Sec. 5.1 (in 
part 5) of chapter I of title 47 of the Code, and permits the exact 
location of that rule. No citation to other rule units (e.g., subpart or 
chapter) is needed.
    (b) Contents. Parts 0-19 of the rules have been reserved for 
provisions of a general nature. Parts 20-69 of this chapter have been 
reserved for provisions pertaining to common carriers. Parts 20-29 and 
80-109 of this chapter have been reserved for provisions pertaining to 
the wireless telecommunications services. In the rules pertaining to 
common carriers, parts 20-25 and 80-99 of this chapter pertain to the 
use of radio; In the rules pertaining to common carriers, parts 21, 23, 
and 25 of this chapter pertain to the use of radio; parts 31-66 of this 
chapter pertain primarily to telephone and telegraph companies. Persons 
having business with the Commission will find it useful to consult one 
or more of the following parts containing provisions of a general nature 
in addition to the rules of the radio or wire communication service in 
which they are interested:
    (1) Part 0, Commission organization. Part 0 describes the structure 
and functions of the Commission, lists delegations of authority to the 
staff, and sets forth information designed to assist those desiring to 
obtain information

[[Page 48]]

from, or to do business with, the Commission. This part is designed, 
among other things, to meet certain of the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, as amended.
    (2) Part 1 of this chapter, practice and procedure. Part 1, subpart 
A, of this chapter contains the general rules of practice and procedure. 
Except as expressly provided to the contrary, these rules are applicable 
in all Commission proceedings and should be of interest to all persons 
having business with the Commission. Part 1, subpart A of this chapter 
also contains certain other miscellaneous provisions. Part 1, subpart B, 
of this chapter contains the procedures applicable in formal hearing 
proceedings (see Sec. 1.201 of this chapter). Part 1, subpart C, of 
this chapter contains the procedures followed in making or revising the 
rule or regulations. Part 1, subpart D, of this chapter contains rules 
applicable to applications for licenses in the Broadcast Radio Services, 
including the forms to be used, the filing requirements, the procedures 
for processing and acting upon such applications, and certain other 
matters. Part 1, subpart E, of this chapter contains general rules and 
procedures applicable to common carriers. Part 1, subpart F, of this 
chapter contain rules applicable to applications for licenses in the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau services, including the forms to be 
used, the filing requirements, the procedures for processing and acting 
on such applications, and certain other matters. Part 1, subpart F, of 
this chapter contains rules applicable to applications for licenses in 
the Private Radio Services, including the forms to be used, the filing 
requirements, the procedures for processing and acting on such 
applications, and certain other matters. Part 1, subpart G, of this 
chapter contains rules pertaining to the application processing fees 
established by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1985 (Pub. L. 99-272, 100 Stat. 82 (1986)) and also contains rules 
pertaining to the regulatory fees established by the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66, 107 Stat. 397 (1993)). Part 
1, subpart H, of this chapter, concerning ex parte presentations, sets 
forth standards governing communications with commission personnel in 
hearing proceedings and contested application proceedings. Part 1, 
subparts G and H, of this chapter will be of interest to all regulatees, 
and part 1, subpart H, of this chapter will, in addition, be of interest 
to all persons involved in hearing proceedings.
    (3) Part 2, frequency allocations and radio treaty matters; general 
rules and regulations. Part 2 will be of interest to all persons 
interested in the use of radio. It contains definitions of technical 
terms used in the rules and regulations; provisions governing the

<R05>
Sec. 0.409  Commission policy on private printing of FCC forms.

    The Commission has established a policy regarding the printing of 
blank FCC forms by private companies if they elect to do so as a matter 
of expediency and convenience to their clients or consumers. The policy 
is as follows:
    (a) Blank FCC forms may be reproduced by private companies at their 
own expense provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) Use a printing process resulting in a product that is at least 
comparable in quality to the original document, without change to the 
page size, image size, configuration of pages, folds or perforations, 
and matching as closely as possible the paper weight, paper color and 
ink color.
    (2) Delete in its entirety any and all U.S. Government Printing 
Office (GPO) indicia that may appear in the margin(s).
    (3) If the printer wishes to identify a foreign country in which the 
forms are printed, a marginal notation must be added stating ``No U.S. 
Government funds were used to print this document.''
    (4) Do not add to the form any other symbol, word or phrase that 
might be construed as personalizing the form or advertising on it.
    (5) Except as specified above, do not delete from or add to any part 
of the form, or attach anything thereto.
    (6) Assure that the form being reproduced is an edition currently 
acceptable by the Commission, which will endeavor to keep the public 
advised of revisions to its forms, but cannot assume responsibility to 
the extent of eliminating any element of risk against the use of 
obsolete forms.
    (b) These guidelines do not apply to forms which respondents may 
wish to reproduce as completed facsimiles on automated equipment to 
satisfy application or report requirements. Requests for permission to 
submit such forms to the Commission should be addressed to the Office of 
Managing Director.

Sec. 0.411  General reference materials.

    The following reference materials are available in many libraries 
and may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402:
    (a) Statutory materials. Laws pertaining to communications are 
contained in Title 47 of the United States Code. Laws enacted since the 
printing of the last supplement to the Code are printed individually as 
slip laws, and these are compiled chronologically in the United States 
Statutes at Large. The Acts of Congress from 1910-62 pertaining to radio 
have been compiled in a single volume, Radio Laws of the United States 
(1962 ed.). See Sec. Sec. 0.405 and 0.414.
    (b) Regulatory materials--(1) The Code of Federal Regulations. The 
rules and regulations of the Commission are contained in chapter I of 
title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Chapter I is divided into 
the following four subchapters, which may be purchased separately: 
Subchapter A--General; Subchapter B--Common Carrier Services; Subchapter 
C--Broadcast Radio Services; and Subchapter D--Private Radio Services. 
Most persons will find that they need subchapter A, containing the 
general rules, and one of the other volumes, depending upon their area 
of interest. These four volumes are revised annually to reflect changes 
in the rules. See Sec. Sec. 0.406, 0.412, and 0.415. The Code of 
Federal Regulations is fully indexed and contains numerous finding aids. 
See 1 CFR appendix C.
    (2) The Federal Register. As rules are adopted, amended, or 
repealed, the changes are published in the Federal Register, which is 
published daily except on legal holidays. Notices of proposed rule 
making, other rule making documents, statements of general policy, 
interpretations of general applicability, and other Commission documents 
having general applicability and legal effect are also published in the 
Federal Register. Summaries of the full Notices of proposed rule making

[[Page 58]]

and other rule making decisions adopted by the Commission constitute 
rulemaking documents for purposes of Federal Register publication. The 
Federal Register is fully indexed and contains numerous findings aids.

www.fcc.gov/foia/.


<R05>
Sec. 0.442  Disclosure to other Federal government agencies of information submitted to the Commission in confidence.

    (a) The disclosure of records to other Federal government agencies 
is generally governed by the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3510, 
rather than the Freedom of Information Act. The acceptance of materials 
in confidence under Sec. 0.457 or Sec. 0.459, or any other statute, 
rule or Commission order, does not preclude their disclosure to other 
federal agencies.
    (b) Information submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant 
to Sec. 0.457(c)(2) and (3), (d) and (g) or Sec. 0.459, or any other 
statute, rule or order, may be disclosed to other agencies of the 
Federal government upon request or upon the Commission's own motion, 
provided:
    (1) Specific Commission assurances against such disclosure have not 
been given;
    (2) The other agency has established a legitimate need for the 
information;
    (3) Disclosure is made subject to the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 
3510(b); and
    (4) Disclosure is not prohibited by the Privacy Act or other 
provisions of law.
    (c) The Commission's staff may give assurances against disclosure of 
information to other Federal agencies only with the prior written 
approval of the General Counsel. In no event will assurance against 
disclosure to other agencies be given in advance of submission of the 
information to the Commission if submission is required by statute or by 
the provisions of this chapter; but the notice provisions of paragraph 
(d) of this section will apply to such required submissions.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section, a party who furnished records to the Commission with a request 
for confidential treatment, see Sec. 0.459, will be notified at the 
time that the request for disclosure is submitted and will be afforded 
ten calendar days in which to submit an opposition to disclosure. This 
notification may be made either individually or by public notice.
    (2) If the agency requesting the records provides in writing to the 
satisfaction of the Commission that notice to the party who furnished 
the records to the Commission will interfere unduly with its law 
enforcement, national security or homeland defense activities and 
further states that it will notify that party of the Commission's 
disclosure once the potential for such interference is eliminated, the 
Commission will not give notice of disclosure.
    (3) A party who furnished records to the Commission in confidence 
will not be afforded prior notice when the disclosure is made to the 
Comptroller General of the United States, in the Government 
Accountability Office. Such a party will instead be notified of 
disclosure of the records to the Comptroller General either individually 
or by public notice.
    (4) If disclosure is opposed and the Commission decides to make the 
records available to the other agency, the party who furnished the 
records to the Commission will be afforded ten calendar days from the 
date of the ruling to move for a judicial stay of the Commission's 
action. If the party does not move for stay within this period, the 
records will be disclosed.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, nothing 
in this section is intended to govern disclosure of information to 
Congress or the Comptroller General.


<R05>
Sec. 0.445  Publication, availability and use of opinions, orders, 

policy statements, interpretations, administrative manuals, and staff instructions.

    (a) Adjudicatory opinions and orders of the Commission, or its staff 
acting on delegated authority, are sent to the parties by mail, delivery 
service, or e-mail, unless the Commission determines that individual 
delivery would be unduly burdensome and instead issues a public notice 
of its decision. As

[[Page 61]]

part of the record, these documents are generally available for 
inspection in accordance with Sec. 0.453 and Sec. 0.455. In addition, 
many adjudicatory orders and opinions are available on the Commission's 
Web site, http://www.fcc.gov. In appropriate circumstances, the 
Commission may redact the copy made available to the public in order to 
protect information not routinely available to the public under Sec. 
0.457, which is treated confidentially pursuant to a request under Sec. 
0.459, or which is confidential pursuant to other statutes, regulations 
or orders.
    (b) Texts adopted by the Commission or a member of its staff on 
delegated authority and released through the Office of Media Relations 
are published in the FCC Record. Older materials of this nature are 
available in the FCC Reports. In the event that such older materials are 
not published in the FCC Reports, reference should be made to the 
Federal Register or Pike and Fischer Communications Regulation.
    (c) All rulemaking documents or summaries thereof are published in 
the Federal Register and are available on the Commission's Web site. The 
complete text of the Commission decision also is released by the 
Commission and is available for inspection and copying during normal 
business hours in the Office of Media Relations, the Reference 
Information Center, via the Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), or 
as otherwise specified in the rulemaking document published in the 
Federal Register. The complete texts of rulemaking decisions may also be 
purchased from the Commission's copy contractor.
    (d) Formal policy statements and interpretations designed to have 
general applicability are published in the Federal Register, the FCC 
Record, FCC Reports, or Pike and Fischer Communications Regulation. 
Commission decisions and other Commission documents not entitled formal 
policy statements or interpretations may contain substantive 
interpretations and statements regarding policy, and these are published 
as part of the document in the FCC Record, FCC Reports or Pike and 
Fischer Communications Regulation. General statements regarding policy 
and interpretations furnished to individuals, in correspondence or 
otherwise, are not ordinarily published.
    (e) If the documents described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section are published in the Federal Register, the FCC Record, FCC 
Reports, or Pike and Fischer Communications Regulation, they are 
indexed, and they may be relied upon, used or cited as precedent by the 
Commission or private parties in any manner. If they are not so 
published, they may not be relied upon, used or cited as precedent, 
except against persons who have actual notice of the document in 
question or by such persons against the Commission. No person is 
expected to comply with any requirement or policy of the Commission 
unless he or she has actual notice of that requirement or policy or a 
document stating it has been published as provided in this paragraph. 
Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be construed as precluding a 
reference to a recent document that is pending publication.
    (f) Subparts A and B of this part describe the functions of the 
staff and list the matters on which authority has been delegated to the 
staff. All general instructions to the staff and limitations upon its 
authority are set forth in those subparts or in decisions of the 
Commission published in the Federal Register. Instructions to the staff 
in particular matters or cases are privileged and/or protected and are 
not published or made available for public inspection.
    (g) To the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion 
of personal privacy, or to prevent disclosure of information required or 
authorized to be withheld by another statute, the Commission may delete 
identifying details or confidential information when it makes available 
or publishes any document described in this section. The justification 
for any such deletion will be fully explained in a preamble to the 
document.


<R05>
Sec. 0.451  Inspection of records: Generally.

    (a) Records which are routinely available for public inspection. 
Sections 0.453 and 0.455 list those Commission records which are 
routinely available for public inspection and the places at which

[[Page 62]]

those records may be inspected. Procedures governing requests for 
inspection of such records are set out in Sec. 0.460.
    (b) Records which are not routinely available for public inspection. 
Records which are not listed in Sec. 0.453 or Sec. 0.455 are not 
routinely available for public inspection. Such records fall into two 
categories.
    (1) The first category consists of those records or kinds of records 
listed in Sec. 0.457 and of particular records withheld from public 
inspection under Sec. 0.459. The Commission has determined that there 
is a statutory basis for withholding these records from public 
inspection. In some cases, the Commission is prohibited from permitting 
the inspection of records. In other cases, the records are the property 
of another agency, and the Commission has no authority to permit their 
inspection. In still other cases, the Commission is authorized, for 
reason of policy, to withhold records from inspection, but is not 
required to do so.
    (2) The second category consists of records that are not listed in 
Sec. 0.453, Sec. 0.455, or Sec. 0.457 and have not been withheld from 
inspection under Sec. 0.459. In some cases, these records have not been 
identified for listing. In other cases (e.g., the general correspondence 
files), the Commission is unable to determine either that all records in 
a class should be routinely available for inspection or that all records 
in that class should not be routinely available for inspection, and 
individualized determination is required.
    (3) Procedures governing requests for inspection of these records 
are set forth in Sec. 0.461.
    (4) Procedures governing demands by competent authority for 
inspection of these records are set forth in Sec. 0.463.
    (5) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 0.461 and 0.463, or pursuant to 
Sec. 19.735-203 of this chapter, no officer or employee of the 
Commission shall permit the inspection of records which are not 
routinely available for public inspection under Sec. 0.453 or Sec. 
0.455, or disclose information contained therein.
    (c) Copies. Section 0.465 applies to requests for copies of 
Commission records which are routinely available for public inspection 
under Sec. 0.453 and Sec. 0.455 and those which are made available for 
inspection under Sec. 0.461. Sections 0.467 and 0.465(c)(3) apply to 
requests for certified copies of Commission records.
    (d) Search and copying fees. Section 0.465(c)(2) prescribes the per 
page fee for copying records made available for inspection under Sec. 
0.460 or Sec. 0.461. Section 0.466 prescribes fees to cover the expense 
of searching for and reviewing records made available for inspection 
under Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 0.461. Review of initial fee determinations 
under Sec. Sec. 0.467 through 0.470 and initial fee reduction or waiver 
determinations under Sec. 0.470(e) may be sought under Sec. 0.461(j).

    Note to paragraph (d): The Commission may require advance payment 
pursuant to Sec. 0.469 before releasing documents.

<R05>
Sec. 0.457  Records not routinely available for public inspection.

    The records listed in this section are not routinely available for 
public inspection pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b). The records are listed in 
this section by category, according to the statutory basis for 
withholding those records from inspection; under each category, if 
appropriate, the underlying policy considerations affecting the 
withholding and disclosure of records in that category are briefly 
outlined. Except where the records are not the property of the 
Commission or where the disclosure of those records is prohibited by 
law, the Commission will entertain requests from members of the public 
under Sec. 0.461 for permission to inspect particular records withheld 
from inspection under the provisions of this section, and will weigh the 
policy considerations favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited 
for permitting inspection in the light of the facts of the particular 
case. In making such requests, there may be more than one basis for 
withholding particular records from inspection. The listing of records 
by category is not intended to imply the contrary but is solely for the 
information and assistance of persons making such requests. Requests to 
inspect or copy the transcripts, recordings or minutes of closed agency 
meetings will be considered under Sec. 0.607 rather than under the 
provisions of this section.
    (a) Materials that are specifically authorized under criteria 
established by Executive Order (E.O.) to be kept secret in the interest 
of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly 
classified pursuant to such Executive Order, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1). (1) 
Classified materials and information will not be made available for 
public inspection, including materials classified under E.O. 10450, 
``Security Requirements for Government Employees''; E.O. 10501, as 
amended, ``Safeguarding Official Information in the Interests of the 
Defense of the United States''; and E.O. 12958, ``Classified National 
Security Information,'' or any other executive order concerning the 
classification of records. See also 47 U.S.C. 154(j).
    (2) Materials referred to another Federal agency for classification 
will not be disclosed while such a determination is pending.
    (b) Materials that are related solely to the internal personnel 
rules and practices of the Commission, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2). (1) Materials 
related solely to internal management matters, including minutes of 
Commission actions on such matters (see paragraph (f) of this section).
    (2) Materials relating to the negotiation of contracts.
    (c) Materials that are specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b, 
provided that such statute either requires that the materials be 
withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on 
the issue, or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers 
to particular types of materials to be withheld). The Commission is 
authorized under the following statutory provisions to withhold 
materials from public inspection.
    (1) Section 4(j) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 154(j), 
provides, in part, that, ``The Commission is authorized to withhold 
publication of records

[[Page 66]]

or proceedings containing secret information affecting the national 
defense.'' Pursuant to that provision, it has been determined that the 
following materials should be withheld from public inspection (see also 
paragraph (a) of this section):
    (i) Maps showing the exact location of submarine cables.
    (ii) Minutes of Commission actions on classified matters.
    (iii) Maps of nation-wide point-to-point microwave networks.
    (2) Under section 213 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 213(f), 
the Commission is authorized to order, with the reasons therefor, that 
records and data pertaining to the valuation of the property of common 
carriers and furnished to the Commission by the carriers pursuant to the 
provisions of that section, shall not be available for public 
inspection. If such an order has been issued, the data and records will 
be withheld from public inspection, except under the provisions of Sec. 
0.461. Normally, however, such data and information is available for 
inspection.
    (3) Under sec. 412 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 412, the 
Commission may withhold from public inspection certain contracts, 
agreements and arrangements between common carriers relating to foreign 
wire or radio communication. Any person may file a petition requesting 
that such materials be withheld from public inspection. To support such 
action, the petition must show that the contract, agreement or 
arrangement relates to foreign wire or radio communications; that its 
publication would place American communication companies at a 
disadvantage in meeting the competition of foreign communication 
companies; and that the public interest would be served by keeping its 
terms confidential. If the Commission orders that such materials be kept 
confidential, they will be made available for inspection only under the 
provisions of Sec. 0.461.
    (4) Section 605 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 605(a), 
provides, in part, that, ``no person not being authorized by the sender 
shall intercept any communication [by wire or radio] and divulge or 
publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning 
of such intercepted communications to any person.'' In executing its 
responsibilities, the Commission regularly monitors radio transmissions. 
Except as required for the enforcement of the communications laws, 
treaties and the provisions of this chapter, or as authorized in sec. 
605, the Commission is prohibited from divulging information obtained in 
the course of these monitoring activities; and such information, and 
materials relating thereto, will not be made available for public 
inspection.
    (5) Section 1905 of the federal criminal code, the Trade Secrets 
Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of certain 
confidential information. See paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 
19.735-203 of this chapter.
    (d) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from any person and privileged or confidential--categories of materials 
not routinely available for public inspection, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 18 
U.S.C. 1905. (1) The materials listed in this paragraph have been 
accepted, or are being accepted, by the Commission on a confidential 
basis pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). To the extent indicated in each 
case, the materials are not routinely available for public inspection. 
If the protection afforded is sufficient, it is unnecessary for persons 
submitting such materials to submit therewith a request for non-
disclosure pursuant to Sec. 0.459. A persuasive showing as to the 
reasons for inspection will be required in requests submitted under 
Sec. 0.461 for inspection of such materials.
    (i) Financial reports submitted by radio or television licensees.
    (ii) Applications for equipment authorizations (type acceptance, 
type approval, certification, or advance approval of subscription 
television systems), and materials relating to such applications, are 
not routinely available for public inspection prior to the effective 
date of the authorization. The effective date of the authorization will, 
upon request, be deferred to a date no earlier than that specified by 
the applicant. Following the effective date of the authorization, the 
application and related materials (including technical specifications 
and test measurements) will be made available for inspection upon 
request (see Sec. 0.460). Portions of

[[Page 67]]

applications for equipment certification of scanning receivers and 
related materials will not be made available for inspection.
    (iii) Information submitted in connection with audits, 
investigations and examination of records pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 220.
    (iv) Programming contracts between programmers and multichannel 
video programming distributors.
    (v) The rates, terms and conditions in any agreement between a U.S. 
carrier and a foreign carrier that govern the settlement of U.S. 
international traffic, including the method for allocating return 
traffic, if the U.S. international route is exempt from the 
international settlements policy under Sec. 43.51(e)(3) of this 
chapter.
    (vi) Outage reports filed under Part 4 of this chapter.
    (vii) The following records, relating to coordination of satellite 
systems pursuant to procedures codified in the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations:
    (A) Records of communications between the Commission and the ITU 
related to the international coordination process, and
    (B) Documents prepared in connection with coordination, 
notification, and recording of frequency assignments and Plan 
modifications, including but not limited to minutes of meetings, 
supporting exhibits, supporting correspondence, and documents and 
correspondence prepared in connection with operator-to-operator 
arrangements.

    Note to paragraph (d): The content of the communications described 
in paragraph (d)(1)(vii)(A) of this section is in some circumstances 
separately available through the ITU's publication process, or through 
records available in connection with the Commission's licensing 
procedures.

    (2) Unless the materials to be submitted are listed in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section and the protection thereby afforded is adequate, 
any person who submits materials which he or she wishes withheld from 
public inspection under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) must submit a request for 
non-disclosure pursuant to Sec. 0.459. If it is shown in the request 
that the materials contain trade secrets or privileged or confidential 
commercial, financial or technical data, the materials will not be made 
routinely available for inspection; and a persuasive showing as to the 
reasons for inspection will be required in requests for inspection 
submitted under Sec. 0.461. In the absence of a request for non-
disclosure, the Commission may, in the unusual instance, determine on 
its own motion that the materials should not be routinely available for 
public inspection.
    (e) Interagency and intra-agency memoranda or letters, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(5). Interagency and intra-agency memoranda or letters and the 
work papers of members of the Commission or its staff will not be made 
available for public inspection, except in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 0.461. Normally such papers are privileged 
and not available to private parties through the discovery process, 
since their disclosure would tend to restrain the commitment of ideas to 
writing, would tend to inhibit communication among Government personnel, 
and would, in some cases, involve premature disclosure of their 
contents.
    (f) Personnel, medical and other files whose disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(6). Under E.O. 10561, the Commission maintains an Official 
Personnel Folder for each of its employees. Such folders are under the 
jurisdiction and control, and are a part of the records, of the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management. Except as provided in the rules of the 
Office of Personnel Management (5 CFR 293.311), such folders will not be 
made available for public inspection by the Commission. In addition, 
other records of the Commission containing private, personal or 
financial information concerning particular employees and Commission 
contractors will be withheld from public inspection.
    (g) Under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7), records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, to the extent that production of such records:
    (1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (2) Would deprive a person of a right to fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication;

[[Page 68]]

    (3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source;
    (5) Would disclose investigative techniques or procedures or would 
disclose investigative guidelines if such disclosure could reasonably be 
expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (6) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.


<R05>
Sec. 0.458  Nonpublic information.

    Any person regulated by or practicing before the Commission coming 
into possession of written nonpublic information (including written 
material transmitted in electronic form) as described in Sec. 19.735-
203(a) of this chapter under circumstances where it appears that its 
release was inadvertent or otherwise unauthorized shall be obligated to 
and shall promptly return the information to the Commission's Office of 
Inspector General without further distribution or use. See 47 CFR 
19.735-203.


<R05>
Sec. 0.459  Requests that materials or information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public inspection.

    (a)(1) Any person submitting information or materials to the 
Commission may submit therewith a request that such information not be 
made routinely available for public inspection. (If the materials are 
specifically listed in Sec. 0.457, such a request is unnecessary.) A 
copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the 
materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If 
feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically 
separated from any materials to which the request does not apply; if 
this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request 
applies shall be identified. In the latter circumstance, where 
confidential treatment is sought only for a portion of a document, the 
person submitting the document shall submit a redacted version for the 
public file.
    (2) Comments and other materials may not be submitted by means of 
the Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) with a request 
for confidential treatment under this section.
    (3) The Commission may use abbreviated means for indicating that the 
submitter of a record seeks confidential treatment, such as a checkbox 
enabling the submitter to indicate that the record is confidential. 
However, upon receipt of a request for inspection of such records 
pursuant to Sec. 0.461, the submitter will be notified of such request 
pursuant to Sec. 0.461(d)(3) and will be requested to justify the 
confidential treatment of the record, as set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 0.459(a)(3), each such request shall 
contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from 
inspection (see Sec. 0.457) and of the facts upon which those records 
are based, including:
    (1) Identification of the specific information for which 
confidential treatment is sought;
    (2) Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the 
information was submitted or a description of the circumstances giving 
rise to the submission;
    (3) Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial 
or financial, or contains a trade secret or is privileged;
    (4) Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a 
service that is subject to competition;
    (5) Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in 
substantial competitive harm;
    (6) Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to 
prevent unauthorized disclosure;
    (7) Identification of whether the information is available to the 
public and the extent of any previous disclosure of the information to 
third parties;
    (8) Justification of the period during which the submitting party 
asserts that material should not be available for public disclosure; and
    (9) Any other information that the party seeking confidential 
treatment believes may be useful in assessing whether its request for 
confidentiality should be granted.
    (c) Casual requests (including simply stamping pages 
``confidential'') which

[[Page 69]]

do not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section will not be considered.
    (d)(1) If a response in opposition to a confidentiality request is 
filed, the party requesting confidentiality may file a reply within ten 
business days. All responses or replies filed under this paragraph must 
be served on all parties.
    (2) Requests which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section will be acted upon by the appropriate custodian 
of records (see Sec. 0.461(d)(1)), who is directed to grant the request 
if it demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that non-
disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. If the request for confidentiality is 
granted, the ruling will be placed in the public file in lieu of the 
materials withheld from public inspection.
    (3) The Commission may defer acting on requests that materials or 
information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public 
inspection until a request for inspection has been made pursuant to 
Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 0.461. The information will be accorded 
confidential treatment, as provided for in Sec. 0.459(g) and Sec. 
0.461, until the Commission acts on the confidentiality request and all 
subsequent appeal and stay proceedings have been exhausted.
    (e) If the materials are submitted voluntarily (i.e., absent any 
requirement by statute, regulation, or the Commission), the person 
submitting them may request the Commission to return the materials 
without consideration if the request for confidentiality should be 
denied. In that event, the materials will ordinarily be returned (e.g., 
an application will be returned if it cannot be considered on a 
confidential basis). Only in the unusual instance where the public 
interest so requires will the materials be made available for public 
inspection. However, no materials submitted with a request for 
confidentiality will be returned if a request for inspection has been 
filed under Sec. 0.461. If submission of the materials is required by 
the Commission and the request for confidentiality is denied, the 
materials will be made available for public inspection once the period 
for review of the denial has passed.
    (f) If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the Commission 
assumes no obligation to consider the need for non-disclosure but, in 
the unusual instance, may determine on its own motion that the materials 
should be withheld from public inspection. See Sec. 0.457(g).
    (g) If a request for confidentiality is denied, the person who 
submitted the request may, within ten business days, file an application 
for review by the Commission. If the application for review is denied, 
the person who submitted the request will be afforded ten business days 
in which to seek a judicial stay of the ruling. If these periods expire 
without action by the person who submitted the request, the materials 
will be returned to the person who submitted them or will be placed in a 
public file. Notice of denial and of the time for seeking review or a 
judicial stay will be given by telephone, with follow-up notice in 
writing. The first day to be counted in computing the time periods 
established in this paragraph is the day after the date of oral notice. 
Materials will be accorded confidential treatment, as provided in Sec. 
0.459(g) and Sec. 0.461, until the Commission acts on any timely 
applications for review of an order denying a request for 
confidentiality, and until a court acts on any timely motion for stay of 
such an order denying confidential treatment.
    (h) If the request for confidentiality is granted, the status of the 
materials is the same as that of materials listed in Sec. 0.457. Any 
person wishing to inspect them may submit a request for inspection under 
Sec. 0.461.
    (i) Third party owners of materials submitted to the Commission by 
another party may participate in the proceeding resolving the 
confidentiality of the materials.

Sec. 0.460  Requests for inspection of records which are routinely available for public inspection.

    (a) Sections 0.453 and 0.455 list those Commission records which are 
routinely available for public inspection and the places at which those 
records may be inspected. Subject to the limitations set out in this 
section, a person

[[Page 70]]

who wants to inspect such records need only appear at the specified 
location and ask to see the records. Many such records also are 
available through the Commission's Web site, located at http://
www.fcc.gov and the Commission's electronic reading room, located on its 
Web site at http://www.fcc.gov/foia/e-room.html. Commission documents 
listed in Sec. 0.416 and Sec. 0.445 are published in the FCC Record, 
and many such documents or summaries thereof are also published in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) A person who wishes to inspect the records must appear at the 
specified location during the office hours of the Commission and must 
inspect the records at that location. (Procedures governing requests for 
copies are set out in Sec. 0.465.) However, arrangements may be made in 
advance, by telephone or by correspondence, to make the records 
available for inspection on a particular date, and there are many 
circumstances in which such advance arrangements will save 
inconvenience. If the request is for a large number of documents, for 
example, a delay in collecting them is predictable. Current records may 
be in use by the staff when the request is made. Older records may have 
been forwarded to another location for storage.
    (c) The records in question must be reasonably described by the 
person requesting them so as to permit their location by staff 
personnel. The information needed to locate the records will vary, 
depending on the records requested. Advice concerning the kind of 
information needed to locate particular records will be furnished in 
advance upon request. Members of the public will not be given access to 
the area in which records are kept and will not be permitted to search 
the files.
    (d) If it appears that there will be an appreciable delay in 
locating or producing the records (as where a large number of documents 
is the subject of a single request or where an extended search for a 
document appears to be necessary), the requester may be directed to 
submit or confirm the request in writing in appropriate circumstances.
    (e)(1) Written requests shall be directed to the Commission's copy 
contractor pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. 0.465. Requests 
shall be captioned ``Request For Inspection Of Records,'' shall be 
dated, shall list the mailing address, telephone number (if any) of the 
person making the request, and the e-mail address (if any) and for each 
document requested, shall set out all information known to the person 
making the request which would be helpful in identifying and locating 
the document. Written requests shall, in addition, specify the maximum 
search fee the person making the request is prepared to pay (see Sec. 
0.467).
    (2) Written requests shall be delivered or mailed directly to the 
Commission's copy contractor (see Sec. 0.465(a)).
    (f) When a written request is received by the copy contractor, it 
will be date-stamped.
    (g) All requests limited to records listed in Sec. 0.453 and Sec. 
0.455 will be granted, subject to paragraph (k) of this section. 
Requests for records listed in those sections shall not be combined with 
requests for other records.
    (h) The records will be produced for inspection at the earliest 
possible time.
    (i) Records shall be inspected within 7 days after notice is given 
that they have been located and are available for inspection. After that 
period, they will be returned to storage and additional charges may be 
imposed for again producing them.
    (j) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the 
following provisions apply to the reports filed with the Commission 
pursuant to 5 CFR Parts 2634 and 3902.
    (1) Such reports shall not be obtained or used:
    (i) For any unlawful purpose;
    (ii) For any commercial purpose, other than by news and 
communications media for dissemination to the general public;
    (iii) For determining or establishing the credit rating of any 
individual; or
    (iv) For use, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation of money 
for any political, charitable, or other purpose.
    (2) Such reports may not be made available to any person nor may any 
copy thereof be provided to any person except upon a written application 
by such person stating:

[[Page 71]]

    (i) That person's name, occupation and address;
    (ii) The name and address of any other person or organization on 
whose behalf the inspection or copying is requested; and
    (iii) That such person is aware of the prohibitions on the obtaining 
or use of the report. Further, any such application for inspection shall 
be made available to the public throughout the period during which the 
report itself is made available to the public.

(Secs. 4, 303, 307, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082, 1083; 47 U.S.C. 
154, 303, 397; 18 U.S.C. 207(j))


<R05>
Sec. 0.461  Requests for inspection of materials not routinely available for public inspection.

    Any person desiring to inspect Commission records that are not 
listed in Sec. 0.453 or Sec. 0.455 shall file a request for inspection 
meeting the requirements of this section. The FOIA Public Liaison is 
available to assist persons seeking records under this section. See 
Sec. 0.441(a).
    (a)(1) Records include:
    (i) Any information that would be an agency record subject to the 
requirements of the Freedom of Information Act when maintained by the 
Commission in any format, including an electronic format; and
    (ii) Any information maintained for the Commission by an entity 
under Government contract, for purposes of records management.
    (2) The records in question must be reasonably described by the 
person requesting them, so as to permit their location by staff 
personnel with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, a 
request should include specific information about each record sought, 
such as the title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the 
record. Requests should also specify the date or time period for the 
records sought. The custodian of records sought may contact the 
requester to obtain further information about the records sought to 
assist in locating them.
    (3) The person requesting records under this section may specify the 
form or format of the records to be produced provided that the records 
may be made readily reproducible in the requested form or format.
    (b)(1) Requests shall be captioned ``Freedom of Information Act 
Request,'' shall be dated, shall list the telephone number (if any), 
street address, and e-mail address (if any) of the person making the 
request, and should reasonably describe, for each document requested 
(see Sec. 0.461(a)(1)), all information known to the person making the 
request that would be helpful in identifying and locating the document.
    (2) The request shall, in addition, specify the maximum search fee 
the person making the request is prepared to pay or a request for waiver 
or reduction of fees if the requester is eligible (see Sec. 0.470(e)). 
By filing a FOIA request, the requester agrees to pay all applicable 
fees charged under Sec. 0.467, unless the person making the request 
seeks a waiver of fees (see Sec. 0.470(e)), in which case the 
Commission will rule on the waiver request before proceeding with the 
search.
    (c) If the records are of the kinds listed in Sec. 0.457 or if they 
have been withheld from inspection under Sec. 0.459, the request shall, 
in addition, contain a statement of the reasons for inspection and the 
facts in support thereof. In the case of other materials, no such 
statement need accompany the request, but the custodian of the records 
may require the submission of such a statement if he or she determines 
that the materials in question may lawfully be withheld from inspection.
    (d)(1) Requests shall be
    (i) Delivered or mailed to the Managing Director, FCC, 445--12th 
Street, SW., Room 1-A836, Washington, DC 20554;
    (ii) Sent by e-mail to foia@fcc.gov;
    (iii) Filed electronically though the Internet at http://
www.fcc.gov/foia/#reqform; or
    (iv) Sent by facsimile to (202) 418-2826 or (202) 418-0521. If the 
request is filed by mail or facsimile, an original and two copies of the 
request shall be submitted. If the request is enclosed in an envelope, 
the envelope shall be marked, ``Freedom of Information Act Request.''
    (2) For purposes of this section, the custodian of the records is 
the Chief of the Bureau or Office where the records

[[Page 72]]

are located. The Chief of the Bureau or Office may designate an 
appropriate person to act on a FOIA request.
    (3) If the request is for materials submitted to the Commission by 
third parties and not open to routine public inspection under Sec. 
0.457(d), Sec. 0.459, or another Commission rule or order, or if a 
request for confidentiality is pending pursuant to Sec. 0.459, or if 
the custodian of records has reason to believe that the information may 
contain confidential commercial information, one copy of the request 
will be provided by the custodian of the records (see Sec. 0.461(e)) to 
the person who originally submitted the materials to the Commission. If 
there are many persons who originally submitted the records and are 
entitled to notice under this paragraph, the custodian of records may 
use a public notice to notify the submitters of the request for 
inspection. The submitter or submitters will be given ten calendar days 
to respond to the FOIA request. See Sec. 0.459(d)(1). If a submitter 
has any objection to disclosure, he or she is required to submit a 
detailed written statement specifying all grounds for withholding any 
portion of the information (see Sec. 0.459). This response shall be 
served on the party seeking to inspect the records. The requester may 
submit a reply within ten business days unless a different period is 
specified by the custodian of records. The reply shall be served on all 
parties that filed a response. In the event that a submitter fails to 
respond within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to 
have no objection to disclosure of the information.

    Note to paragraph (d)(3): Under the ex parte rules, Sec. 
1.1206(a)(7) of this chapter, a proceeding involving a FOIA request is a 
permit-but-disclose proceeding, but is subject to the special service 
rules in this paragraph. We also note that while the FOIA request itself 
is a permit-but-disclose proceeding, a pleading in a FOIA proceeding may 
also constitute a presentation in another proceeding if it addresses the 
merits of that proceeding.

    (e)(1) When the request is received by the Managing Director, it 
will be assigned to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Control 
Office, where it will be date-stamped and assigned to the appropriate 
custodian of the records. A FOIA request is then considered properly 
received. This will occur no later than ten calendar days after the 
request is first received by the agency.
    (2)(i) Except for the purpose of making a determination regarding 
expedited processing under paragraph (h) of this section, the time for 
processing a request for inspection of records will be tolled
    (A) While the custodian of records seeks reasonable clarification of 
the request;
    (B) Until clarification with the requester of issues regarding fee 
assessment occurs, including:
    (1) While there is an unresolved fee waiver issue pending under 
Sec. 0.470(e), unless the requester has provided a written statement 
agreeing to pay some or all of the fees pending the outcome of the 
waiver question;
    (2) Following the denial of a fee waiver, unless the requester had 
provided a written statement agreeing to pay the fees if the fee waiver 
was denied;
    (3) Where advance payment is required pursuant to Sec. 0.469 and 
has not been made.
    (ii) Only one Commission request for information shall be deemed to 
toll the time for processing a request for inspection of records under 
Sec. 0.461(e)(2)(i)(A). Such request must be made no later than ten 
calendar days after a request is properly received by the custodian of 
records under Sec. 0.461(e)(1).
    (3) The FOIA Control Office will send an acknowledgement to the 
requester notifying the requester of the control number assigned to the 
request, the due date of the response, and the telephone contact number 
(202-418-0440) to be used by the requester to obtain the status of the 
request. Requesters may also obtain the status of an FOIA request via e-
mail at foia@fcc.gov.
    (4) Multiple FOIA requests by the same or different FOIA requesters 
may be consolidated for disposition. See also Sec. 0.470(b)(2).
    (f) Requests for inspection of records will be acted on as follows 
by the custodian of the records.
    (1) If the Commission is prohibited from disclosing the records in 
question, the request for inspection will be denied with a statement 
setting forth the specific grounds for denial.

[[Page 73]]

    (2)(i) If records in the possession of the Commission are the 
property of another agency, the request will be referred to that agency 
and the person who submitted the request will be so advised, with the 
reasons for referral.
    (ii) If it is determined that the FOIA request seeks only records of 
another agency or department, the FOIA requester will be so informed by 
the FOIA Control Officer and will be directed to the correct agency or 
department.
    (3) If it is determined that the Commission does not have authority 
to withhold the records from public inspection, the request will be 
granted.
    (4) If it is determined that the Commission does have authority to 
withhold the records from public inspection, the considerations favoring 
disclosure and non-disclosure will be weighed in light of the facts 
presented, and the request will be granted, either conditionally or 
unconditionally, or denied.
    (5) If there is a statutory basis for withholding part of a document 
from inspection, that part will be deleted and the remainder will be 
made available for inspection. Records disclosed in part shall be marked 
or annotated to show the amount of information deleted unless doing so 
would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The 
location of the information deleted and the exemption under which the 
deletion is made also shall be indicated on the record, if technically 
feasible.
    (6) In locating and recovering records responsive to an FOIA 
request, only those records within the Commission's possession and 
control as of the date of its receipt of the request shall be 
considered.
    (g)(1) The custodian of the records will make every effort to act on 
the request within twenty business days after it is received and date-
stamped by the FOIA Control Office.However, if a request for 
clarification has been made under Sec. 0.461(e)(2)(i)(A) or an issue is 
outstanding regarding the payment of fees for processing the FOIA 
request is pending under Sec. 0.461(e)(2)(i)(B), the counting of time 
will start upon resolution of these requests. If it is not possible to 
locate the records and to determine whether they should be made 
available for inspection within twenty business days, the custodian may, 
in any of the following circumstances, extend the time for action by up 
to ten business days:
    (i) It is necessary to search for and collect the requested records 
from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request.
    (ii) It is necessary to search for, collect and appropriately 
examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are 
demanded in a single request; or
    (iii) It is necessary to consult with another agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two 
or more components of the Commission having substantial subject matter 
interest therein.
    (2) The custodian of the records will notify the requester in 
writing of any extension of time exercised pursuant to paragraph (g) of 
this section. The custodian of the records may also call the requester 
to extend the time provided a subsequent written confirmation is 
provided. If it is not possible to locate the records and make the 
determination within the extended period, the person or persons who made 
the request will be provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the 
request so that it may be processed within the extended time limit, or 
an opportunity to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the 
request or a modified request, and asked to consent to an extension or 
further extension. If the requester agrees to an extension, the 
custodian of the records will confirm the agreement in a letter or e-
mail specifying the length of the agreed-upon extension. If he or she 
does not agree to an extension, the request will be denied, on the 
grounds that the custodian has not been able to locate the records and/
or to make the determination within the period for a ruling mandated by 
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. In that event, the 
custodian will continue to search for and/or assess the records and will 
advise the person who made the request of further developments; but that 
person may file an application for review by

[[Page 74]]

the Commission. When action is taken by the custodian of the records, 
written notice of the action will be given. Records will be made 
available with the written notice of action or as soon thereafter as is 
feasible.
    (3) If the custodian of the records grants a request for inspection 
of records submitted to the Commission in confidence under Sec. 
0.457(d), Sec. 0.459, or some other Commission rule or order, the 
custodian of the records will give the submitter written notice of the 
decision and of the submitter's right to seek review pursuant to Sec. 
0.461(i).
    (h)(1) Requesters who seek expedited processing of FOIA requests 
shall submit such requests, along with their FOIA requests, to the 
Managing Director, as described in Sec. 0.461(d). If the request is 
enclosed in an envelope, the envelope shall be marked ``Request for 
Expedited Proceeding--FOIA Request.'' An original and two copies of the 
request for expedition shall be submitted, but only one copy is 
necessary if submitted by e-mail or by the Internet. When the request is 
received by the Managing Director, it, and the accompanying FOIA 
request, will be assigned to the FOIA Control Office, where it will be 
date-stamped and assigned to the custodian of records.
    (2) Expedited processing shall be granted to a requester 
demonstrating a compelling need that is certified by the requester to be 
true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.
    (3) For purposes of this section, compelling need means--
    (i) That failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis 
could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information, there is an urgency to inform the public 
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
    (4)(i) Notice of the determination whether to grant expedited 
processing shall be provided to the requester by the custodian of 
records within ten calendar days after receipt of the request by the 
FOIA Control Office. Once the determination has been made to grant 
expedited processing, the custodian shall process the FOIA request as 
soon as practicable.
    (ii) If a request for expedited processing is denied, the person 
seeking expedited processing may file an application for review within 
five business days after the date of the written denial. The application 
for review and the envelope containing it (if any) shall be captioned 
``Review of FOIA Expedited Proceeding Request.'' The application for 
review shall be delivered or mailed to the General Counsel. (For general 
procedures relating to applications for review, see Sec. 1.115 of this 
chapter.) The Commission shall act expeditiously on the application for 
review, and shall notify the custodian of records and the requester of 
the disposition of such an application for review.
    (i)(1) If a request for inspection of records submitted to the 
Commission in confidence under Sec. 0.457(d), Sec. 0.459, or another 
Commission rule or order is granted in whole or in part, an application 
for review may be filed by the person who submitted the records to the 
Commission, by a third party owner of the records or by a person with a 
personal privacy interest in the records, or by the person who filed the 
request for inspection of records within the ten business days after the 
date of the written ruling. The application for review and the envelope 
containing it (if any) shall be captioned ``Review of Freedom of 
Information Action.'' The application for review shall be filed within 
ten business days after the date of the written ruling, shall be 
delivered or mailed to the General Counsel, and shall be served on the 
person who filed the request for inspection of records and any other 
parties to the proceeding. The person who filed the request for 
inspection of records may respond to the application for review within 
ten business days after it is filed.
    (2) The first day to be counted in computing the time period for 
filing the application for review is the day after the date of the 
written ruling. If an application for review is not filed within this 
period, the records will be produced for inspection.
    (3) If an application for review is denied, the person filing the 
application

[[Page 75]]

for review will be notified in writing and advised of his or her rights.
    (4) If an application for review filed by the person who submitted, 
owns, or has a personal privacy interest in the records to the 
Commission is denied, or if the records are made available on review 
which were not initially made available, the person will be afforded ten 
business days from the date of the written ruling in which to move for a 
judicial stay of the Commission's action. The first day to be counted in 
computing the time period for seeking a judicial stay is the day after 
the date of the written ruling. If a motion for stay is not made within 
this period, the records will be produced for inspection.
    (j) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, an 
application for review of an initial action on a request for inspection 
of records, a fee determination (see Sec. 0.467 through Sec. 0.470), 
or a fee reduction or waiver decision (see Sec. 0.470(e)) may be filed 
only by the person who made the request. The application shall be filed 
within 30 calendar days after the date of the written ruling by the 
custodian of records. The application for review and the envelope (if 
any) shall be captioned, ``Review of Freedom of Information Action.'' 
The application shall be delivered or mailed to the General Counsel. If 
the proceeding involves records subject to confidential treatment under 
Sec. 0.457 or Sec. 0.459, or involves a person with an interest as 
described in Sec. 0.461(i), the application for review shall be served 
on such persons. That person may file a response within ten business 
days after the application for review is filed. If the records are made 
available for review, the person who submitted them to the Commission 
will be afforded ten business days after the date of the written ruling 
to seek a judicial stay. See paragraph (i) of this section. The first 
day to be counted in computing the time period for filing the 
application for review or seeking a judicial stay is the day after the 
date of the written ruling.

    Note to paragraphs (i) and (j): The General Counsel may review 
applications for review with the custodian of records and attempt to 
informally resolve outstanding issues with the consent of the requester. 
For general procedures relating to applications for review, see Sec. 
1.115 of this chapter.

    (k)(1)(i) The Commission will make every effort to act on an 
application for review of an action on a request for inspection of 
records within twenty business days after it is filed. In the following 
circumstances and to the extent time has not been extended under 
paragraphs (g)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of Sec. 0.461(g) of this section, 
the Commission may extend the time for acting on the application for 
review up to ten business days. (The total period of extensions taken 
under this paragraph and under paragraph (g) of this section without the 
consent of the person who submitted the request shall not exceed ten 
business days.):
    (A) It is necessary to search for and collect the requested records 
from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (B) It is necessary to search for, collect and appropriately examine 
a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded 
in a single request; or
    (C) It is necessary to consult with another agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or 
more components of the Commission having substantial subject matter 
interest therein.
    (ii) If these circumstances are not present, the person who made the 
request may be asked to consent to an extension or further extension. If 
the requester or person who made the request agrees to an extension, the 
General Counsel will confirm the agreement in a letter specifying the 
length of the agreed-upon extension. If the requestor or person who made 
the request does not agree to an extension, the Commission will continue 
to search for and/or assess the records and will advise the person who 
made the request of further developments; but that person may file a 
complaint in an appropriate United States district court.
    (2) The Commission may at its discretion or upon request consolidate 
for consideration related applications for review filed under Sec. 
0.461(i) or Sec. 0.461(j).
    (l)(1) Subject to the application for review and judicial stay 
provisions of

[[Page 76]]

paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section, if the request is granted, the 
records will be produced for inspection at the earliest possible time.
    (2) If a request for inspection of records becomes the subject of an 
action for judicial review before the custodian of records has acted on 
the request, or before the Commission has acted on an application for 
review, the Commission may continue to consider the request for 
production of records.
    (m) Staff orders and letters ruling on requests for inspection are 
signed by the official (or officials) who give final approval of their 
contents. Decisions of the Commission ruling on applications for review 
will set forth the names of the Commissioners participating in the 
decision.
    (n) Records shall be inspected within seven days after notice is 
given that they have been located and are available for inspection. 
After that period, they will be returned to storage, and additional 
charges may be imposed for again producing them.


<R05>
Sec. 0.463  Disclosure of Commission records and information in legal proceedings in which the Commission is a non-party.

    (a) This section sets forth procedures to be followed with respect 
to the production or disclosure of any material within the custody and 
control of the Commission, any information relating to such material, or 
any information acquired by any person while employed by the Commission 
as part of the person's official duties or because of the person's 
official status.
    (b) In the event that a demand is made by a court or other competent 
authority outside the Commission for the production of records or 
testimony (e.g., a subpoena, order, or other demand), the General 
Counsel shall promptly be advised of such demand, the nature of the 
records or testimony sought, and all other relevant facts and 
circumstances. The General Counsel, in consultation with the Managing 
Director, will thereupon issue such instructions as he or she may deem 
advisable consistent with this subpart.
    (c) A party in a court or administrative legal proceeding in which 
the Commission is a non-party who wishes to obtain records or testimony 
from the Commission shall submit a written request to the General 
Counsel. Such request must be accompanied by a statement setting forth 
the nature of the proceeding (including any relevant supporting 
documentation, e.g., a copy of the Complaint), the relevance of the 
records or testimony to the proceeding (including a proffer concerning 
the anticipated scope and duration of the testimony), a showing that 
other evidence reasonably suited to the requester's needs is not 
available from any other source (including a request submitted pursuant 
to Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 0.461 of the Commission's rules), and any other 
information that may be relevant to the Commission's consideration of 
the request for records or testimony. The purpose of the foregoing 
requirements is to assist the General Counsel in making an informed 
decision regarding whether the production of records or the testimony 
should be authorized.
    (d) In deciding whether to authorize the release of records or to 
permit the testimony of present or former Commission personnel, the 
General Counsel, in consultation with the Managing Director, shall 
consider the following factors:
    (1) Whether the request or demand would involve the Commission in 
issues or controversies unrelated to the Commission's mission;
    (2) Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome;
    (3) Whether the time and money of the Commission and/or the United 
States would be used for private purposes;
    (4) The extent to which the time of employees for conducting 
official business would be compromised;
    (5) Whether the public might misconstrue variances between personal 
opinions of employees and Commission policy;
    (6) Whether the request or demand demonstrates that the records or 
testimony sought are relevant and material to the underlying proceeding, 
unavailable from other sources, and whether the request is reasonable in 
its scope;
    (7) Whether, if the request or demand were granted, the number of 
similar requests would have a cumulative effect

on the expenditure of Commission resources;
    (8) Whether the requestor has agreed to pay search and review fees 
as set forth in Sec. 0.467 of this subpart;
    (9) Whether disclosure of the records or the testimony sought would 
otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances; and
    (10) Any other factor that is appropriate.
    (e) Among those demands and requests in response to which compliance 
will not ordinarily be authorized are those with respect to which any of 
the following factors exist:
    (1) Disclosure of the records or the testimony would violate a 
statute, Executive Order, rule, or regulation;
    (2) The integrity of the administrative and deliberative processes 
of the Commission would be compromised;
    (3) Disclosure of the records or the testimony would not be 
appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in 
which the demand arose;
    (4) Disclosure of the records, including release in camera, or the 
testimony, is not appropriate or required under the relevant substantive 
law concerning privilege;
    (5) Disclosure of the records, except when in camera and necessary 
to assert a claim of privilege, or of the testimony, would reveal 
information properly classified or other matters exempt from 
unrestricted disclosure; or
    (6) Disclosure of the records or the testimony could interfere with 
ongoing Commission enforcement proceedings or other legal or 
administrative proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the 
identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, or 
disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential commercial or financial 
information.
    (f) The General Counsel, following consultation with the Managing 
Director and any relevant Commission Bureau or Office, is authorized to 
approve non-privileged testimony by a present or former employee of the 
Commission or the production of non-privileged records in response to a 
valid demand issued by competent legal authority, or a request for 
records or testimony received under this section, and to assert 
governmental privileges on behalf of the Commission in litigation that 
may be associated with any such demand or request.
    (g) Any employee or former employee of the Commission who receives a 
demand for records of the Commission or testimony regarding the records 
or activities of the Commission shall promptly notify the General 
Counsel so that the General Counsel may take appropriate steps to 
protect the Commission's rights.

<R05>
Sec. 0.465  Request for copies of materials which are available, or made available, for public inspection.

    (a) The Commission awards a contract to a commercial duplication 
firm to make copies of Commission records and offer them for sale to the 
public. In addition to the charge for copying, the contractor may charge 
a search fee for locating and retrieving the requested documents from 
the Commission's files.

    Note to paragraph (a): The name, address, telephone number, and 
schedule of fees for the current copy contractor are published at the 
time of contract award of renewal in a public notice and periodically 
thereafter. Current information is available at http://www.fcc.gov/foia 
and http://www.fcc.gov/cgb. Questions regarding this information should 
be directed to the Reference Information Center of the Consumer and 
Governmental Affairs Bureau at 202-418-0270.

    (b) Audio or video recordings or transcripts of Commission 
proceedings are available to the public through the Commission's current 
copy contractor. In some cases, only some of these formats may be 
available.
    (c)(1) Contractual arrangements which have been entered into with 
commercial firms, as described in this section, do not in any way limit 
the right of the public to inspect Commission records or to retrieve 
whatever information may be desired. Coin-operated and debit card copy 
machines are available for use by the public.
    (2) The Commission has reserved the right to make copies of its 
records for its own use or for the use of other agencies of the U.S. 
Government. When

[[Page 78]]

it serves the regulatory or financial interests of the U.S. Government, 
the Commission will make and furnish copies of its records free of 
charge. In other circumstances, however, if it should be necessary for 
the Commission to make and furnish copies of its records for the use of 
others, the fee for this service shall be ten cents ($0.10) per page or 
$5 per computer disk in addition to charges for staff time as provided 
in Sec. 0.467. For copies prepared with other media, such as computer 
tapes, microfiche, videotape, the charge will be the actual direct cost 
including operator time. Requests for copying should be accompanied by a 
statement specifying the maximum copying fee the person making the 
request is prepared to pay. If the Commission estimates that copying 
charges are likely to exceed the greater of $25 or the amount which the 
requester has indicated that he/she is prepared to pay, then it shall 
notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees. Such a notice 
shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with Commission 
personnel with the object of revising or clarifying the request.

    Note to paragraph (c)(2): The criterion considered in acting on a 
waiver request is whether ``waiver or reduction of the fee is in the 
public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as 
primarily benefiting the general public.'' 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A). A 
request for a waiver or reduction of fees will be decided by the General 
Counsel as set forth in Sec. 0.470(e).

    (3) Certified Documents. Copies of documents which are available or 
made available, for inspection under Sec. 0.451 through Sec. 0.465, 
will be prepared and certified, under seal, by the Secretary or his or 
her designee. Requests shall be in writing, specifying the exact 
documents, the number of copies desired, and the date on which they will 
be required. The request shall allow a reasonable time for the 
preparation and certification of copies. The fee for preparing copies 
shall be the same as that charged by the Commission as described in 
Sec. 0.465(c)(2). The fee for certification shall be $10 for each 
document.
    (d)(1) Computer maintained databases produced by the Commission and 
available to the public may be obtained from the FCC's Web site at 
http://www.fcc.gov or if unavailable on the Commission's Web site, from 
the copy contractor.

    Note to paragraph (d)(1): The Commission awards a contract to 
provide the public with access to FCC databases from the copy 
contractor. See note to paragraph (a) of this section.

    (2) Copies of computer generated data stored as paper printouts or 
electronic media and available to the public may also be obtained from 
the Commission's copy contractor (see paragraph (a) of this section).
    (3) Copies of computer source programs and associated documentation 
produced by the Commission and available to the public may be obtained 
from the Office of the Managing Director.
    (e) This section does not apply to records available on the 
Commission's Web site, http://www.fcc.gov, or printed publications which 
may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents or private firms 
(see Sec. 0.411 through Sec. 0.420), nor does it apply to application 
forms or information bulletins, which are prepared for the use and 
information of the public and are available upon request (see Sec. 
0.421 and Sec. 0.423) or on the Commission's Web site, http://
www.fcc.gov/formpage.html.
    (f) Anyone requesting copies of documents pursuant to this section 
may either come in person to the Commission (see Sec. 0.461) or request 
that the copy contractor fulfill the request. If a request goes directly 
to the contractor, the requester will be charged by the contractor 
pursuant to the price list set forth in the latest contract.


<R05>
Sec. 0.466  Definitions.

    (a) For the purpose of Sec. 0.467 and Sec. 0.468, the following 
definitions shall apply:
    (1) The term direct costs means those expenditures which the 
Commission actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in case 
of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA 
request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the 
work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus twenty percent of that 
rate to cover benefits), and the

[[Page 79]]

cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs 
are overhead expenses, such as costs of space, and heating or lighting 
the facility in which the records are stored.
    (2) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material contained within documents. Such activity 
should be distinguished, however, from ``review'' of material in order 
to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section).
    (3) The term review refers to the process of examining documents 
located in response to a commercial use request (see paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section) to determine whether any portion of a document located is 
exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any documents for 
disclosure, e.g., performing such functions that are necessary to excise 
them or otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time 
spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application 
of FOIA exemptions.
    (4) The term commercial use request refers to a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial interests of the requester. In determining whether a 
requester properly falls within this category, the Commission shall 
determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. 
Where the Commission has reasonable cause to question the use to which a 
requester will put the documents sought, or where that use is not clear 
from the request itself, the Commission shall seek additional 
clarification before assigning the request to a specific category. The 
dissemination of records by a representation of the news media (see 
Sec. 0.466(a)(7)) shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.
    (5) The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of professional education and an 
institution of vocational education, which operates a program or 
programs of scholarly research.
    (6) The term non-commercial scientific institution refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is 
referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of 
which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (7) The term representative of the news media refers to any person 
or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of 
the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a 
distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this clause, 
the term news means information that is about current events or that 
would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media 
entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at 
large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify 
as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase 
or subscription by, or free distribution to, the general public. These 
examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery 
evolve (for example, the adoption of electronic dissemination of 
newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media 
shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist 
shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist 
can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that 
entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the 
entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an 
expectation; the Commission may also consider the past publication 
record of the requester in making such a determination. See 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(4)(A)(ii).
    (8) The term all other requester refers to any person not within the 
definitions in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(7) of this paragraph.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 0.467  Search and review fees.

    (a)(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, an hourly fee 
shall be charged for recovery of the full, allowable direct costs of 
searching for and reviewing records requested under Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 
0.461, unless such fees are reduced or waived pursuant to Sec. 0.470. 
The

[[Page 80]]

fee is based on the pay grade level of the FCC's employee(s) who 
conduct(s) the search or review, or the actual hourly rate of FCC 
contractors or other non-FCC personnel who conduct a search.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1): The fees for FCC employees will be 
modified periodically to correspond with modifications in the rate of 
pay approved by Congress and any such modifications will be announced by 
public notice and will be posted on the Commission's Web site, http://
www.fcc.gov/foia/#feeschedule.

    (2) The fees specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are 
computed at Step 5 of each grade level based on the General Schedule and 
include twenty percent for personnel benefits. Search and review fees 
will be assessed in \1/4\ hour increments.
    (b) Search fees may be assessed for time spent searching, even if 
the Commission fails to locate responsive records or if any records 
located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (c) The Commission shall charge only for the initial review, i.e., 
the review undertaken initially when the Commission analyzes the 
applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record. The 
Commission shall not charge for review at the appeal level of an 
exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records 
withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not 
to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other 
exemptions not previously considered. The costs of such a subsequent 
review, under these circumstances, are properly assessable.
    (d) The fee charged will not exceed an amount based on the time 
typically required to locate records of the kind requested.
    (e)(1) If the Commission estimates that search charges are likely to 
exceed the greater of $25 or the amount which the requester indicated 
he/she is prepared to pay, then it shall notify the requester of the 
estimated amount of fees. Such a notice shall offer the requester the 
opportunity to confer with Commission personnel with the object of 
revising or clarifying the request. See Sec. 0.465(c)(2) and Sec. 
470(d).
    (2) The time for processing a request for inspection shall be tolled 
while conferring with the requester about his or her willingness to pay 
the fees required to process the request. See Sec. 0.461(e).
    (f) When the search has been completed, the custodian of the records 
will give notice of the charges incurred to the person who made the 
request.
    (g) The fee shall be paid to the Financial Management Division, 
Office of Managing Director, or as otherwise directed by the Commission.
    (h) Records shall be inspected within seven days after notice is 
given that they have been located and are available for inspection. See 
Sec. 0.461(n). After that period, they will be returned to storage, and 
additional charges may be imposed for again producing them.


<R05>
Sec. 0.468  Interest.

    Interest shall be charged those requesters who fail to pay the fees 
charged. The agency will begin assessing interest charges on the amount 
billed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing 
was sent. The date on which the payment is received by the agency will 
determine whether and how much interest is due. The interest shall be 
set at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.


<R05>
Sec. 0.469  Advance payments.

    (a) The Commission may not require advance payment of estimated FOIA 
fees except as provided in paragraph (b) or where the Commission 
estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be 
required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00 and the requester has no 
history of payment. Where allowable charges are likely to exceed $250.00 
and the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees the 
Commission may notify the requester of the estimated cost and obtain 
satisfactory assurance of full payment. Notification that fees may 
exceed $250.00 is not, however, a prerequisite for collecting fees above 
that amount.
    (b) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in 
a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), the 
Commission may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus 
any applicable interest as provided in Sec. 0.468, and to make an 
advance payment of the full amount

[[Page 81]]

of the estimated fee before the Commission begins to process a new 
request or a pending request from that requester.
    (c) When the Commission acts under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the administrative time limits prescribed in Sec. Sec. 0.461(g) and (k) 
(i.e., twenty business days from receipt of initial requests and twenty 
business days from receipt of appeals from initial denials, plus 
permissible extensions of these time limits (see Sec. 0.461(g)(1)(i) 
through (iii) and Sec. 0.461(k)(1)(i) through (iii)) will begin only 
after the agency has received the fee payments described in this 
section. See Sec. Sec. 0.461(e)(2)(ii) and 0.467(e)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 0.470  Assessment of fees.

    (a)(1) Commercial use requesters. (i) When the Commission receives a 
request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that 
recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing and duplicating 
the records sought pursuant to Sec. Sec. 0.466 and 0.467, above.
    (ii) Commercial use requesters shall not be assessed search fees if 
the Commission fails to comply with the time limits under Sec. 
0.461(g)(1), if no unusual or exceptional circumstances (Sec. 
0.461(g)(1)(i) through (iii)) apply to the processing of the request.
    (2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters 
and requesters who are representatives of the news media. (i) The 
Commission shall provide documents to requesters in these categories for 
the cost of reproduction only, pursuant to Sec. 0.465 above, excluding 
reproduction charges for the first 100 pages, provided however, that 
requesters who are representatives of the news media shall be entitled 
to a reduced assessment of charges only when the request is for the 
purpose of distributing information.
    (ii) Educational requesters or requesters who are representatives of 
the news media shall not be assessed fees for the cost of reproduction 
if the Commission fails to comply with the time limits under Sec. 
0.461(g)(1), if no unusual or exceptional circumstances (Sec. 
0.461(g)(1)(i) through (iii)) apply to the processing of the request.
    (3) All other requesters. (i) The Commission shall charge requesters 
who do not fit into any of the categories above fees which cover the 
full, reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records 
that are responsive to the request, pursuant to Sec. 0.465 and Sec. 
0.467, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two 
hours of search time shall be furnished without charge.
    (ii) All other requesters shall not be assessed search fees if the 
Commission fails to comply with the time limits under Sec. 0.461(g)(1), 
if no unusual or exceptional circumstances (Sec. 0.461(g)(1)(i) through 
(iii)) apply to the processing of the request.
    (b)(1) The 100 page restriction on assessment of reproduction fees 
in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section refers to 100 paper 
copies of a standard size, which will normally be ``8\1/2\ x 11'' or 
``11 x 14,'' or microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or 100 
pages of computer printout.
    (2) When the agency reasonably believes that a requester or group of 
requesters is attempting to segregate a request into a series of 
separate individual requests for the purpose of evading the assessment 
of fees, the agency will aggregate any such requests and assess charges 
accordingly.
    (c) When a requester believes he or she is entitled to a reduced fee 
assessment pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, or 
a waiver pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the requester must 
include, in his or her original FOIA request, a statement explaining 
with specificity, the reasons demonstrating that he or she qualifies for 
a reduced fee or a fee waiver. Included in this statement should be a 
certification that the information will not be used to further the 
commercial interests of the requester.

    Note to paragraph (c): Anyone requesting a reduced fee or a fee 
waiver must submit the request directly to the Commission and not to the 
contractor who will provide documents only at the contract price.

    (d) If the Commission reasonably believes that a commercial interest 
exists, based on the information provided pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the requester shall be so notified and given an additional 
ten business

[[Page 82]]

days to provide further information to justify receiving a reduced fee. 
See Sec. 0.467(e)(2). During this time period, the materials will be 
available for inspection to the extent that the time period exceeds the 
time period for responding to FOIA requests, as appropriate.
    (e)(1) Copying, search and review charges shall be waived or reduced 
by the General Counsel when ``disclosure of the information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the government 
and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' 5 
U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Simply repeating the fee waiver language of 
section 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) is not a sufficient basis to obtain a fee 
waiver.
    (2) The criteria used to determine whether disclosure is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the government 
include:
    (i) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the 
operations or activities of the government;
    (ii) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an 
understanding of government operations or activities; and
    (iii) Whether disclosure of the requested information will 
contribute to public understanding as opposed to the individual 
understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested 
persons.
    (3) The criteria used to determine whether disclosure is primarily 
in the commercial interest of the requester include:
    (i) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be 
furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so
    (ii) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of 
the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public 
interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial 
interest of the requester.
    (4) This request for fee reduction or waiver must accompany the 
initial request for records and will be decided under the same 
procedures used for record requests.
    (5) If no fees or de minimis fees would result from processing a 
FOIA request and a fee waiver or reduction has been sought, the General 
Counsel will not reach a determination on the waiver or reduction 
request.
    (f) Whenever the total fee calculated under this section is $15 or 
less, no fee will be charged.
    (g) Review of initial fee determinations under Sec. 0.467 through 
Sec. 0.470 and initial fee reduction or waiver determinations under 
Sec. 0.470(e) may be sought under Sec. 0.461(j).

Sec. 0.501  General.

    Executive Order 12356 requires that information relating to national 
security be protected against unauthorized disclosure as long as 
required by national security considerations. The Order also provides 
that all information classified under Executive Order 12356 or 
predecessor orders be subject to a review for declassification upon 
receipt of a request made by a United States citizen or permanent 
resident alien, a Federal agency, or a state or local government.


<R05>
Sec. 0.502  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes the procedures to be followed in submitting 
requests, processing such requests, appeals taken from denials of 
declassification requests and fees and charges.


<R05>
Sec. 0.503  Submission of requests for mandatory declassification review.

    (a) Requests for mandatory review of national security information 
shall be in writing, addressed to the Managing Director, and reasonably 
describe the information sought with sufficient particularity to enable 
Commission personnel to identify the documents containing that 
information and be reasonable in scope.
    (b) When the request is for information originally classified by the 
Commission, the Managing Director shall assign the request to the 
appropriate bureau or office for action.
    (c) Requests related to information, either derivatively classified 
by the Commission or originally classified by another agency, shall be 
forwarded, together with a copy of the record, to the originating 
agency. The transmittal may contain a recommendation for action.


<R05>
Sec. 0.504  Processing requests for declassification.

    (a) Responses to mandatory declassification review requests shall be 
governed by the amount of search and review time required to process the 
request. A final determination shall be made within one year from the 
date of receipt of the request, except in unusual circumstances.
    (b) Upon a determination by the bureau or office that the requested 
material originally classified by the Commission no longer warrants 
protection, it shall be declassified and made available to the 
requester, unless withholding is otherwise authorized under law.
    (c) If the information may not be declassified or released in whole 
or in part, the requester shall be notified as to the reasons for the 
denial, given notice of the right to appeal the denial to the 
Classification Review Committee, and given notice that such an appeal 
must be filed within 60 days of the date of denial in order to be 
considered.
    (d) The Commission's Classification Review Committee, consisting of 
the Managing Director (Chairman), the General Counsel or his designee, 
and the Chief, Internal Review and Security Division, shall have 
authority to act, within 30 days, upon all appeals regarding denials of 
requests for mandatory declassification of Commission-originated 
classifications. The Committee shall be authorized to overrule previous 
determinations in whole or in part when, in its judgment, continued 
classification is no longer required. If the Committee determines that 
continued classification is required under the criteria of the Order, 
the requester shall be promptly notified and advised that an application 
for review may be filed with the Commission pursuant to 47 CFR 1.115.


<R05>
Sec. 0.505  Fees and charges.

    (a) The Commission has designated a contractor to make copies of 
Commission records and offer them for sale (See Sec. 0.465).
    (b) An hourly fee is charged for recovery of the direct costs of 
searching for requested documents (See Sec. 0.466).


<R05>
Sec. 0.506  FOIA and Privacy Act requests.

    Requests for declassification that are submitted under the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, (See Sec. 
0.461), of the Privacy Act of 1974, (See Sec. 0.554) shall be processed 
in accordance with the provisions of those Acts.

<R05>
Sec. 0.553  New uses of information.

    Before establishing a new routine use of a system of records, the 
Commission will publish a notice in the Federal Register of its 
intention to do so, and

[[Page 86]]

will provide at least 30 days for public comment on such use. The notice 
will contain:
    (a) The name of the system of records for which the new routine use 
is to be established;
    (b) The authority for the system;
    (c) The categories of records maintained;
    (d) The proposed routine use(s); and
    (e) The categories of recipients for each proposed routine use.


<R05>
Sec. 0.554  Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records in a system of records.

    (a) Upon request, the Commission will notify individuals as to 
whether it maintains information about them in a system of records and, 
subject to the provisons of Sec. 0.555(b), will disclose the substance 
of such information to that individual. In order to properly request 
notification or access to record information, reference must be made to 
the Notice described in Sec. 0.552. A table of contents, which is 
alphabetized by bureau or office, precedes the system descriptions and 
allows members of the public to easily identify record systems of 
interest to them. An individual may inquire into information contained 
in any or all systems of records described in the Notice. However, each 
inquiry shall be limited to information from systems located within a 
single bureau or office and shall be addressed to that bureau or office.
    (b) Reasonable identification is required of all individuals making 
requests pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in order to assure 
that disclosure of any information is made to the proper person.
    (1) Individuals who choose to register a request for information in 
person may verify their identity by showing any two of the following: 
social security card; drivers license; employee identification card; 
medicare card; birth certificate; bank credit card; or other positive 
means of identification. Documents incorporating a picture and/or 
signature of the individual shall be produced if possible. If an 
individual cannot provide suitable documentation for identification, 
that individual will be required to sign an identity statement 
stipulating that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to 
records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a 
fine of up to $5,000.

    Note: An individual's refusal to disclose his social security number 
shall not constitute cause in and of itself, for denial of a request.

    (2) All requests for record information sent by mail shall be signed 
by the requestor and shall include his printed name, current address and 
telephone number (if any). Commission officials receiving such requests 
will attempt to verify the identity of the requestor by comparing his or 
her signature to those in the record. If the record contains no 
signatures and if positive identification cannot be made on the basis of 
other information submitted, the requestor will be required to sign an 
identity statement and stipulate that knowingly or willfully seeking or 
obtaining access to records about another person under false pretense is 
punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.
    (3) If positive identification cannot be made on the basis of the 
information submitted, and if data in the record is so sensitive that 
unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual 
to whom the record pertains, the Commission reserves the right to deny 
access to the record pending the production of additional more 
satisfactory evidence of identity.

    Note: The Commission will require verification of identity only 
where it has determined that knowledge of the existence of record 
information or its substance is not subject to the public disclosure 
requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as 
amended.

    (c) All requests for notification of the existence of record 
information or for access to such information shall be delivered to the 
business address of the system manager responsible for the system of 
records in question, except that requests relating to official personnel 
records shall be addressed to the Associate Managing Director--Personnel 
Management. Such addresses can be found in the Federal Register Notice 
described in Sec. 0.552.
    (d) A written acknowledgement of receipt of a request for 
notification and/

[[Page 87]]

or access will be provided within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal public holidays) to the individual making the request. Such an 
acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional information 
needed to locate a record. A search of all systems of records identified 
in the individual's request will be made to determine if any records 
pertaining to the individual are contained therein, and the individual 
will be notified of the search results as soon as the search has been 
completed. Normally, a request will be processed and the individual 
notified of the search results within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal holidays) from the date the inquiry is received. 
However, in some cases, as where records have to be recalled from 
Federal Record Centers, notification may be delayed. If it is determined 
that a record pertaining to the individual making the request does 
exist, the notification will state approximately when the record will be 
available for personal review. No separate acknowledgement is required 
if the request can be processed and the individual notified of the 
search results within the ten-day period.

(Secs. 4(i) and 303(n), Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47

<R05>
Sec. 0.555  Disclosure of record information to individuals.

    (a) Individuals having been notified that the Commission maintains a 
record pertaining to them in a system of records may request access to 
such record in one of three ways: by in person inspection at the system 
location; by transfer of the record to a nearer location; or by mail.
    (1) Individuals who wish to review their records at the system 
location must do so during regular Commission business hours (8:00 a.m.-
4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday). For personal and administrative 
convenience, individuals are urged to arrange to review a record by 
appointment. Preferences as to specific dates and times can be made by 
writing or calling the system manager responsible for the system of 
records in question at least two days in advance of the desired 
appointment date, and by providing a telephone number where the 
individual can be reached during the day in case the appointment must be 
changed. Verification of identity is required as in Sec. 0.554(b)(1) 
before access will be granted an individual appearing in person. 
Individuals may be accompanied by a person of his or her own choosing 
when reviewing a record. However, in such cases, a written statement 
authorizing discussion of their record in the presence of a Commission 
representative having physical custody of the records.
    (2) Individuals may request that a record be transferred to a 
Commission field office or installation in the vicinity of his or her 
home and that access be granted at that location. The addresses of 
Commission field offices are listed in Sec. 0.121. A request to 
transfer records must specify the exact location where the records 
should be sent and a telephone number to call when the information is 
available for review at the field location. Paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section regarding personal appointments, verification of identity 
accompanying persons, and disclosure of original records applies equally 
to this paragraph.
    (3) Individuals may request that copies of records be sent directly 
to them. In such cases, individuals must verify their identity as Sec. 
0.554(b)(2) and provide an accurate return address. Records shall be 
sent only to that address.
    (b) The disclosure of record information under this section is 
subject to the following limitations:
    (1) Records containing medical information pertaining to an 
individual are subject to individual access under this section unless, 
in the judgment of the system manager having custody of the records 
after consultation with a medical doctor, access to such record 
information could have an adverse impact on the individual. In such 
cases, a copy of the record will be delivered to a medical doctor named 
by the individual.
    (2) Classified material, investigative material compiled for law 
enforcement purposes, investigatory material compiled solely for 
determining suitability

[[Page 88]]

for Federal employment or access to classified information, and certain 
testing or examination material shall be removed from the records to the 
extent permitted in the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552(a). Section 
0.561 of this subpart sets forth the systems of records maintained by 
the Commission which are either totally or partially exempt from 
disclosure under this subparagraph.
    (c) No fee will be imposed if the number of pages of records 
requested is 25 or less. Requests involving more than 25 pages shall be 
submitted to the duplicating contractor (see Sec. 0.456(a)).
    (d) The provisions of this section in no way give an individual the 
right to access any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a 
civil action or proceeding.
    (e) In the event that a determination is made denying an individual 
access to records pertaining to that individual for any reason, such 
individual may either:
    (1) Seek administrative review of the adverse determination. Such a 
request shall be in writing and should be addressed to the system 
manager who made the initial decision. In addition, the request for 
review shall state specifically why the initial decision should be 
reversed.
    (2) Seek judicial relief in the district courts of the United States 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(B) of the Act.

(Secs. 4(i) and 303(n), Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47

<R05>
Sec. 0.556  Request to correct or amend records.

    (a) An individual may request the amendment of information contained 
in their record. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the 
request to amend should be submitted in writing to the system manager 
responsible for the records. Requests to amend the official personnel 
records of active FCC employees should be submitted to the Associate 
Managing Director--Human Resources Management, 445 12th Street, SW., 
Washington, D.C. 20554. Requests to amend official personnel records of 
former FCC employees should be sent to the Assistant Director for Work 
Force Information, Compliance and Investigations Group, Office of 
Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20415. Any 
request to amend should contain as a minimum:
    (1) The identity verification information required by Sec. 
0.554(b)(2) and the information needed to locate the record as required 
by Sec. 0.554(a).
    (2) A brief description of the item or items of information to be 
amended; and
    (3) The reason for the requested change.
    (b) A written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend a 
record will be provided within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal public holidays) to the individual requesting the amendment. 
Such an acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional 
information needed to make a determination. There will be no 
acknowledgement if the request can be reviewed, processed, and the 
individual notified of compliance or denial within the 10 day period.
    (c) The responsible system manager, or in the case of official 
personnel records of active FCC employees, the Associate Managing 
Director--Personnel Management, shall (normally within 30 days) take one 
of the following actions regarding a request to amend:
    (1) If the system manager agrees that an amendment to the record is 
warranted, the system manager shall:
    (i) So advise the individual in writing;
    (ii) Correct the record in compliance with the individual's request; 
and
    (iii) If an accounting of disclosures has been made, advise all 
previous recipients of the fact that the record has been corrected and 
of the substance of the correction.
    (2) If the system manager, after an initial review, does not agree 
that all or any portion of the record merits amendment, the system 
manager shall:
    (i) Notify the individual in writing of such refusal to amend and 
the reasons therefore;

[[Page 89]]

    (ii) Advise the individual that further administrative review of the 
initial decision by the full Commission may be sought pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 0.557. (In cases where the request to 
amend involves official personnel records, review is available 
exclusively from the Assistant Director for Work Force Information, 
Compliance and Investigations Group, Office of Personnel Management, 
Washington, DC 20415; and
    (iii) Inform the individual of the procedures for requesting 
Commission review pursuant to Sec. 0.557.
    (d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the 
system manager shall assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or 
completeness of the record in light of each data element placed into 
controversy and the use of the record in making decisions that could 
possibly affect the individual. Moreover, the system manager shall 
ajudge the merits of any request to delete information based on whether 
or not the information in controversy is both relevant and necessary to 
accomplish a statutory purpose required of the Commission by law or 
executive order of the President.

(Secs. 4(i) and 303(n), Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47

<R05>
Sec. 0.557  Administrative review of an initial decision not to amend a record.

    (a) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the determination not 
to amend a record consistent with their request to seek further 
administrative review by the full Commisison. Such a request shall be in 
writing and should be addressed to either the system manager who made 
the initial adverse decision, or, in the case of official personnel 
records of active FCC employees, to the Assistant Director for Work 
Force Information, Compliance and Investigations Group, Office of 
Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415. Any request for 
administrative review must:
    (1) Clearly identify the questions presented for review (e.g., 
whether the record information in question is, in fact, accurate; 
whether information subject to a request to delete is relevant and 
necessary to the purpose for which it is maintained);
    (2) Specify with particularity why the decision reached by the 
system manager is erroneous or inequitable; and
    (3) Clearly state how the record should be amended or corrected.
    (b) The Commission shall conduct an independent review of the record 
in controversy using the standards of review set out in Sec. 0.556(d). 
It may seek such additional information as is necessary to make its 
determination. Final administrative review shall be completed not later 
than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) 
from the date on which the individual requests such review unless the 
Chairman determines that a fair and equitable review cannot be made 
within the 30 day period. In such event, the individual will be informed 
in writing of the reasons for the delay and the approximate date on 
which the review is expected to be completed.
    (c) If upon review of the record in controversy the Commission 
agrees with the individual that the requested amendment is warranted, 
the Commission will proceed in accordance with Sec. 0.556(c)(1) (i) 
through (iii).
    (d) If after the review, the Commission also refuses to amend the 
record as requested, it shall:
    (1) Notify the individual in writing of its refusal and the reasons 
therefore;
    (2) Advise the individual that a concise statement of the reasons 
for disagreeing with the decision of the Commisison may be filed;
    (3) Inform the individual:
    (i) That such a statement should be signed and addressed to the 
system manager having custody of the record in question;
    (ii) That the statement will be made available to any one to whom 
the record is subsequently disclosed together with, at the Commission's 
discretion, a summary of its reasons for refusing to amend the record; 
and
    (iii) That prior recipients of the record will be provided a copy of 
the statement of dispute to the extent that

[[Page 90]]

an accounting of such disclosures is maintained; and
    (4) Advise the individual that judicial review of the Commisison's 
decision not to amend the record in any district court of the United 
States is available.

Sec. 0.601  Definitions.

    For purposes of this section:
    (a) The term agency means:
    (1) The Commission,
    (2) A board of Commissioners (see Sec. 0.212),
    (3) The Telecommunications Committee (see Sec. 0.215), and
    (4) Any other group of Commissioners hereafter established by the 
Commission on a continuing or ad hoc basis and authorized to act on 
behalf of the Commission.
    (b) The term meeting means the deliberations among a quorum of the 
Commission, a Board of Commissioners, or a quorum of a committee of 
Commissioners, where such deliberations determine or result in the joint 
conduct or disposition of official agency business, except that the term 
does not include deliberations to decide whether to announce a meeting 
with less than seven days notice, or whether a meeting should be open or 
closed. (The term includes conference telephone calls, but does not 
include the separate consideration of Commission business by 
Commissioners.) For purposes of this subpart each item on the agenda of 
a meeting is considered a meeting or a portion of a meeting.

<R05>
Sec. 0.602  Open meetings.

    (a) All meetings shall be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 0.603, every portion of every 
meeting shall be open to public observation. Observation does not 
include participation or disruptive conduct by observers, and persons 
engaging in such conduct will be removed from the meeting.
    (c) The right of the public to observe open meetings does not alter 
those rules in this chapter which relate to the filing of motions, 
pleadings, or other documents. Unless such pleadings conform to the 
other procedural requirements of this chapter, pleadings based upon 
comments or discussions at open meetings, as a general rule, will not 
become part of the official record, will receive no consideration, and 
no further action by the Commission will be taken thereon.
    (d) Deliberations, discussions, comments or observations made during 
the course of open meetings do not themselves constitute action of the 
Commission. Comments made by Commissioners may be advanced for purposes 
of discussion and may not reflect the ultimate position of a 
Commissioner.

<R05>
Sec. 0.603  Bases for closing a meeting to the public.

    Except where the agency finds that the public interest requires 
otherwise, an agency or advisory committee meeting may be closed to the 
public, and information pertaining to such meetings which would 
otherwise be disclosed to the public under Sec. 0.605 may be withheld, 
if the agency determines

[[Page 92]]

that an open meeting or the disclosure of such information is likely to:
    (a) Disclose matters that: (1) Are specifically authorized under 
criteria established by executive order to be kept secret in the 
interest of national defense or foreign policy, and (2) are in fact 
properly classified pursuant to such executive order (see Sec. 
0.457(a));
    (b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency (see Sec. 0.457(b));
    (c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure, by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552). 
Provided, That such statute (1) requires that the matters be withheld 
from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, 
or (2) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld (see Sec. 0.457(c));
    (d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential (see Sec. 
0.457(d));
    (e) Involve accusing any person of a crime or formally censuring any 
person;
    (f) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (see Sec. 
0.457(f));
    (g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such 
records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or 
information would (1) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (2) 
deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication, (3) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, (4) disclose the identity of a confidential source, and, in the 
case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source, (5) disclose investigative 
techniques and procedures, or (6) endanger the life or physical safety 
of law enforcement personnel;
    (h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions;
    (i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency 
action, except where the agency has already disclosed to the public the 
content or nature of the disclosed action, or where the agency is 
required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to 
taking final agency action on such proposal; or
    (j) Specifically concern the agency's issuance of a subpoena, or the 
agency's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a 
foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the 
initiation, conduct, or disposition by the agency of a particular case 
of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures specified in 5 
U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after 
opportunity for hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 0.605  Procedures for announcing meetings.

    (a) Notice of all open and closed meetings will be given.
    (b) The meeting notice will be submitted for publication in the 
Federal Register on or before the date on which the announcement is 
made. Copies will be available in the Press and News Media Division on 
the day the announcement is made. Copies will also be attached to ``FCC 
Actions Alert'', which is mailed to certain individuals and groups who 
have demonstrated an interest in representing the public in Commission 
proceedings.
    (c)(1) If the agency staff determines that a meeting should be open 
to the public, it will, at least one week prior to the meeting, announce 
in writing the time, place and subject matter of the meeting, that it is 
to be open to the public, and the name and phone number of the Chief, 
Press and News Media Division, who has been designated to respond to 
requests for information about the meeting.
    (2) If the staff determines that a meeting should be closed to the 
public, it will refer the matter to the General Counsel, who will 
certify that there is

[[Page 93]]

(or is not) a legal basis for closing the meeting to the public. 
Following action by the General Counsel, the matter may be referred to 
the agency for a vote on the question of closing the meeting (See Sec. 
0.606).
    (d)(1) If the question of closing a meeting is considered by the 
agency but no vote is taken, the agency will, at least one week prior to 
the meeting, announce in writing the time, place and subject matter of 
the meeting, that it is to be open to the public, and the name and phone 
number of the Chief, Press and News Media Division.
    (2) If a vote is taken, the agency will, in the same announcement 
and within one day after the vote, make public the vote of each 
participating Commissioner.
    (3) If the vote is to close the meeting, the agency will also, in 
that announcement, set out a full written explanation of its action, 
including the applicable provision(s) of Sec. 0.603, and a list of 
persons expected to attend the meeting, including Commission personnel, 
together with their affiliations. The Commissioners, their assistants, 
the General Counsel, the Executive Director, the Chief, Press and News 
Media Division, and the Secretary are expected to attend all Commission 
meetings. The appropriate Bureau or Office Chief and Division Chief are 
expected to attend meetings which relate to their responsibilities (see 
subpart A of this part).
    (4) If a meeting is closed, the agency may omit from the 
announcement information usually included, if and to the extent that it 
finds that disclosure would be likely to have any of the consequences 
listed in Sec. 0.603.
    (e) If the prompt and orderly conduct of agency business requires 
that a meeting be held less than one week after the announcement of the 
meeting, or before that announcement, the agency will issue the 
announcement at the earliest practicable time. In addition to other 
information, the announcement will contain the vote of each member of 
the agency who participated in the decision to give less than seven days 
notice, and the particular reason for that decision.
    (f) If, after announcement of a meeting, the time or place of the 
meeting is changed or the meeting is cancelled, the agency will announce 
the change at the earliest practicable time.
    (g) If the subject matter or the determination to open or close a 
meeting is changed, the agency will publicly announce the change and the 
vote of each member at the earliest practicable time. The announcement 
will contain a finding that agency business requires the change and that 
no earlier announcement of the change was possible.

<R05>
Sec. 0.606  Procedures for closing a meeting to the public.

    (a) For every meeting closed under Sec. 0.603, the General Counsel 
will certify that there is a legal basis for closing the meeting to the 
public and will state each relevant provision of Sec. 0.603. The staff 
of the agency will refer the matter to the General Counsel for 
certification before it is referred to the agency for a vote on closing 
the meeting. Certifications will be retained in a public file in the 
Office of the Secretary.
    (b) The agency will vote on the question of closing a meeting.
    (1) If a member of the agency requests that a vote be taken;
    (2) If the staff recommends that a meeting be closed and one member 
of the agency requests that a vote be taken; or
    (3) If a person whose interests may be directly affected by a 
meeting requests the agency to close the meeting for any of the reasons 
listed in Sec. 0.603 (e), (f) or (g), or if any person requests that a 
closed meeting be opened, and a member of the agency requests that a 
vote be taken. (Such requests may be filed with the Secretary at any 
time prior to the meeting and should briefly state the reason(s) for 
opening or closing the meeting. To assure that they reach the Commission 
for consideration prior to the meeting, they should be submitted at the 
earliest practicable time and should be called specifically to the 
attention of the Secretary--in person or by telephone. It will be 
helpful if copies of the request are furnished to the

[[Page 94]]

members of the agency and the General Counsel. The filing of a request 
shall not stay the holding of a meeting.)
    (c) A meeting will be closed to the public pursuant to Sec. 0.603 
only by vote of a majority of the entire membership of the agency. The 
vote of each participating Commissioner will be recorded. No 
Commissioner may vote by proxy.
    (d) A separate vote will be taken before any meeting is closed to 
the public and before any information is withheld from the meeting 
notice. However, a single vote may be taken with respect to a series of 
meetings proposed to be closed to the public, and with respect to 
information concerning such series of meetings (a vote on each question, 
if both are presented), if each meeting involves the same particular 
matters and is scheduled to be held no later than 30 days after the 
first meeting in the series.
    (e) Less than seven days notice may be given only by majority vote 
of the entire membership of the agency.
    (f) The subject matter or the determination to open or close a 
meeting will be changed only if a majority of the entire membership of 
the agency determines by recorded vote that agency business so requires 
and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible.

[42 FR 12867, Mar. 7, 1977, as amended at 71 FR 15618, Mar. 29, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 0.607  Transcript, recording or minutes; availability to the public.

    (a) The agency will maintain a complete transcript or electronic 
recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting 
closed to the public, except that in a meeting closed pursuant to 
paragraph (h) or (j) of Sec. 0.603, the agency may maintain minutes in 
lieu of a transcript or recording. Such minutes shall fully and clearly 
describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate 
summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a 
description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of 
any roll call vote. All documents considered in connection with any item 
will be identified in the minutes.
    (b) A public file of transcripts (or minutes) of closed meetings 
will be maintained in the Office of the Secretary. The transcript of a 
meeting will be placed in that file if, after the meeting, the 
responsible Bureau or Office Chief determines, in light of the 
discussion, that the meeting could have been open to the public or that 
the reason for withholding information concerning the matters discussed 
no longer pertains. Transcripts placed in the public file are available 
for inspection under Sec. 0.460. Other transcripts, and separable 
portions thereof which do not contain information properly withheld 
under Sec. 0.603, may be made available for inspection under Sec. 
0.461. When a transcript, or portion thereof, is made available for 
inspection under Sec. 0.461, it will be placed in the public file. 
Copies of transcripts may be obtained from the duplicating contractor 
pursuant to Sec. 0.465(a). There will be no search or transcription 
fee. Requests for inspection or copies of transcripts shall specify the 
date of the meeting, the name of the agenda and the agenda item number; 
this information will appear in the notice of the meeting. Pursuant to 
Sec. 0.465(c)(3), the Commission will make copies of the transcript 
available directly, free of charge, if it serves the financial or 
regulatory interests of the United States.
    (c) The Commission will maintain a copy of the transcript or minutes 
for a period of at least two years after the meeting, or until at least 
one year after conclusion of the proceeding to which the meeting 
relates, whichever occurs later.
    (d) The Commissioner presiding at the meeting will prepare a 
statement setting out the time and place of the meeting, the names of 
persons other than Commission personnel who were present at the meeting, 
and the names of Commission personnel who participated in the 
discussion. These statements will be retained in a public file in the 
Minute and Rules Branch, Office of the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 0.701  Intergovernmental Advisory Committee.

    (a) Purpose and term of operations. The Intergovernmental Advisory 
Committee (IAC) is established to facilitate intergovernmental 
communication between municipal, county, state and tribal governments 
and the Federal Communications Commission. The IAC will commence 
operations with its first meeting convened under this section and is 
authorized to undertake its mission for a period of two years from that 
date. At his discretion, the Chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission may extend the IAC's term of operations for an additional two 
years, for which new members will be appointed as set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section. Pursuant to Section 204(b) of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1534(b), the IAC is not subject to, and is 
not required to follow, the procedures set forth in the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act. 5 U.S.C., App. 2 (1988).
    (b) Membership. The IAC will be composed of the following 15 members 
(or their designated employees): Four elected municipal officials (city 
mayors and city council members); two elected county officials (county 
commissioners or council members); one elected or appointed local 
government attorney; one elected state executive (governor or lieutenant 
governor); three elected state legislators; one elected or appointed 
public utilities or public service commissioner; and three elected or 
appointed Native American tribal representatives. The Chairman of the 
Commission will appoint members through an application process initiated 
by a Public Notice, and will select a Chairman and a Vice Chairman to 
lead the IAC. The Chairman of the Commission will also appoint members 
to fill any vacancies and may replace an IAC member, at his discretion, 
using the appointment process. Members of the IAC are responsible for 
travel and other incidental expenses incurred while on IAC business and 
will not be reimbursed by the Commission for such expenses.
    (c) Location and frequency of meetings. The IAC will meet in 
Washington, DC four times a year. Members must attend a minimum of fifty 
percent of the IAC's yearly meetings and may be removed by the Chairman 
of the IAC for failure to comply with this requirement.
    (d) Participation in IAC meetings. Participation at IAC meetings 
will be limited to IAC members or employees designated by IAC members to 
act on their behalf. Members unable to attend an IAC meeting should 
notify the IAC Chairman a reasonable time in advance of the meeting and 
provide the name of the employee designated on their behalf. With the 
exception of Commission staff and individuals or groups having business 
before the IAC, no other persons may attend or participate in an IAC 
meeting.
    (e) Commission support and oversight. The Chairman of the 
Commission, or Commissioner designated by the Chairman for such purpose, 
will serve as a liaison between the IAC and the Commission and provide 
general oversight for its activities. The IAC will also communicate 
directly with the Chief, Consumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau, 
concerning logistical assistance and staff support, and such other 
matters as are warranted.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1  Proceedings before the Commission.

    The Commission may on its own motion or petition of any interested 
party hold such proceedings as it may deem necessary from time to time 
in connection with the investigation of any matter which it has power to 
investigate under the law, or for the purpose of obtaining information 
necessary or helpful in the determination of its policies, the carrying 
out of its duties or the formulation or amendment of its rules and 
regulations. For such purposes it may subpena witnesses and require the 
production of evidence. Procedures to be followed by the Commission 
shall, unless specifically prescribed in this part, be such as in the 
opinion of the Commission will best serve the purposes of such 
proceedings.

(Sec. 403, 48 Stat. 1094; 47 U.S.C. 403)


<R05>
Sec. 1.2  Declaratory rulings.

    The Commission may, in accordance with section 5(d) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, on motion or on its own motion issue a 
declaratory ruling terminating a controversy or removing uncertainty.

(5 U.S.C. 554)

[[Page 105]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.3  Suspension, amendment, or waiver of rules.

    The provisions of this chapter may be suspended, revoked, amended, 
or waived for good cause shown, in whole or in part, at any time by the 
Commission, subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure 
Act and the provisions of this chapter. Any provision of the rules may 
be waived by the Commission on its own motion or on petition if good 
cause therefor is shown.

    Cross Reference: See subpart C of this part for practice and 
procedure involving rulemaking.


<R05>
Sec. 1.4  Computation of time.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this rule section is to detail the 
method for computing the amount of time within which persons or entities 
must act in response to deadlines established by the Commission. It also 
applies to computation of time for seeking both reconsideration and 
judicial review of Commission decisions.
    (b) General Rule--Computation of Beginning Date When Action is 
Initiated by Commission or Staff. Unless otherwise provided, the first 
day to be counted when a period of time begins with an action taken by 
the Commission, an Administrative Law Judge or by members of the 
Commission or its staff pursuant to delegated authority is the day after 
the day on which public notice of that action is given. See Sec. 1.4(b) 
(1)-(5) of this section. Unless otherwise provided, all Rules measuring 
time from the date of the issuance of a Commission document entitled 
``Public Notice'' shall be calculated in accordance with this section. 
See Sec. 1.4(b)(4) of this section for a description of the ``Public 
Notice'' document. Unless otherwise provided in Sec. 1.4 (g) and (h) of 
this section, it is immaterial whether the first day is a ``holiday.'' 
For purposes of this section, the term public notice means the date of 
any of the following events: See Sec. 1.4(e)(1) of this section for 
definition of ``holiday.''
    (1) For all documents in notice and comment and non-notice and 
comment rulemaking proceedings required by the Administrative Procedure 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, 553, to be published in the Federal Register, 
including summaries thereof, the date of publication in the Federal 
Register.

    Note to paragraph (b)(1): Licensing and other adjudicatory decisions 
with respect to specific parties that may be associated with or 
contained in rulemaking documents are governed by the provisions of 
Sec. 1.4(b)(2).
    Example 1: A document in a Commission rule making proceeding is 
published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, May 6, 1987. Public 
notice commences on Wednesday, May 6, 1987. The first day to be counted 
in computing the beginning date of a period of time for action in 
response to the document is Thursday, May 7, 1987, the ``day after the 
day'' of public notice.
    Example 2: Section 1.429(e) provides that when a petition for 
reconsideration is timely filed in proper form, public notice of its 
filing is published in the Federal Register. Section 1.429(f) provides 
that oppositions to a petition for reconsideration shall be filed within 
15 days after public notice of the petition's filing in the Federal 
Register. Public notice of the filing of a petition for reconsideration 
is published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, June 10, 1987. For 
purposes of computing the filing period for an opposition, the first day 
to be counted is Thursday, June 11, 1987, which is the day after the 
date of public notice. Therefore, oppositions to the reconsideration 
petition must be filed by Thursday, June 25, 1987, 15 days later.

    (2) For non-rulemaking documents released by the Commission or 
staff, including the Commission's section 271 determinations, 47 U.S.C. 
271, the release date.

    Example 3: The Chief, Mass Media Bureau, adopts an order on 
Thursday, April 2, 1987. The text of that order is not released to the 
public until Friday, April 3, 1987. Public notice of this decision is 
given on Friday, April 3, 1987. Saturday, April 4, 1987, is the first 
day to be counted in computing filing periods.

    (3) For rule makings of particular applicability, if the rule making 
document is to be published in the Federal Register and the Commission 
so states in its decision, the date of public notice will commence on 
the day of the Federal Register publication date. If the decision fails 
to specify Federal Register publication, the date of public notice will 
commence on the release date, even if the document is subsequently 
published in the Federal Register. See Declaratory Ruling, 51 FR 23059 
(June 25, 1986).


[[Page 106]]


    Example 4: An order establishing an investigation of a tariff, and 
designating issues to be resolved in the investigation, is released on 
Wednesday, April 1, 1987, and is published in the Federal Register on 
Friday, April 10, 1987. If the decision itself specifies Federal 
Register publication, the date of public notice is Friday, April 10, 
1987. If this decision does not specify Federal Register publication, 
public notice occurs on Wednesday, April 1, 1987, and the first day to 
be counted in computing filing periods is Thursday, April 2, 1987.

    (4) If the full text of an action document is not to be released by 
the Commission, but a descriptive document entitled ``Public Notice'' 
describing the action is released, the date on which the descriptive 
``Public Notice'' is released.

    Example 5: At a public meeting the Commission considers an 
uncontested application to transfer control of a broadcast station. The 
Commission grants the application and does not plan to issue a full text 
of its decision on the uncontested matter. Five days after the meeting, 
a descriptive ``Public Notice'' announcing the action is publicly 
released. The date of public notice commences on the day of the release 
date.
    Example 6: A Public Notice of petitions for rule making filed with 
the Commission is released on Wednesday, September 2, 1987; public 
notice of these petitions is given on September 2, 1987. The first day 
to be counted in computing filing times is Thursday, September 3, 1987.

    (5) If a document is neither published in the Federal Register nor 
released, and if a descriptive document entitled ``Public Notice'' is 
not released, the date appearing on the document sent (e.g., mailed, 
telegraphed, etc.) to persons affected by the action.

    Example 7: A Bureau grants a license to an applicant, or issues a 
waiver for non-conforming operation to an existing licensee, and no 
``Public Notice'' announcing the action is released. The date of public 
notice commences on the day appearing on the license mailed to the 
applicant or appearing on the face of the letter granting the waiver 
mailed to the licensee.

    (c) General Rule--Computation of Beginning Date When Action is 
Initiated by Act, Event or Default. Commission procedures frequently 
require the computation of a period of time where the period begins with 
the occurrence of an act, event or default and terminates a specific 
number of days thereafter. Unless otherwise provided, the first day to 
be counted when a period of time begins with the occurrence of an act, 
event or default is the day after the day on which the act, event or 
default occurs.

    Example 8: Commission Rule Sec. 21.39(d) requires the filing of an 
application requesting consent to involuntary assignment or control of 
the permit or license within thirty days after the occurrence of the 
death or legal disability of the licensee or permittee. If a licensee 
passes away on Sunday, March 1, 1987, the first day to be counted 
pursuant to Sec. 1.4(c) is the day after the act or event. Therefore, 
Monday, March 2, 1987, is the first day of the thirty day period 
specified in Sec. 21.39(d).

    (d) General Rule--Computation of Terminal Date. Unless otherwise 
provided, when computing a period of time the last day of such period of 
time is included in the computation, and any action required must be 
taken on or before that day.

    Example 9: Paragraph 1.4(b)(1) of this section provides that 
``public notice'' in a notice and comment rule making proceeding begins 
on the day of Federal Register publication. Paragraph 1.4(b) of this 
section provides that the first day to be counted in computing a 
terminal date is the ``day after the day'' on which public notice 
occurs. Therefore, if the commission allows or requires an action to be 
taken 20 days after public notice in the Federal Register, the first day 
to be counted is the day after the date of the Federal Register 
publication. Accordingly, if the Federal Register document is published 
on Thursday, July 23, 1987, public notice is given on Thursday, July 23, 
and the first day to be counted in computing a 20 day period is Friday, 
July 24, 1987. The 20th day or terminal date upon which action must be 
taken is Wednesday, August 12, 1987.

    (e) Definitions for purposes of this section:
    (1) The term holiday means Saturday, Sunday, officially recognized 
Federal legal holidays and any other day on which the Commission's 
offices are closed and not reopened prior to 5:30 p.m. For example, a 
regularly scheduled Commission business day may become a holiday if its 
offices are closed prior to 5:30 p.m. due to adverse weather, emergency 
or other closing.

    Note: As of August 1987, officially recognized Federal legal 
holidays are New Year's Day, January 1; Martin Luther King's Birthday, 
third Monday in January; Washington's

[[Page 107]]

Birthday, third Monday in February; Memorial Day, last Monday in May; 
Independence Day, July 4; Labor Day, first Monday in September; Columbus 
Day, second Monday in October; Veterans Day, November 11; Thanksgiving 
Day, fourth Thursday in November; Christmas Day, December 25. If a legal 
holiday falls on Saturday or Sunday, the holiday is taken, respectively, 
on the preceding Friday or the following Monday. In addition, January 
20, (Inauguration Day) following a Presidential election year is a legal 
holiday in the metropolitan Washington, DC area. If Inauguration Day 
falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a legal holiday. See 5 
U.S.C. 6103; Executive Order No. 11582, 36 FR 2957 (Feb. 11, 1971). The 
determination of a ``holiday'' will apply only to the specific 
Commission location(s) designated as on ``holiday'' on that particular 
day.

    (2) The term business day means all days, including days when the 
Commission opens later than the time specified in Rule Sec. 0.403, 
which are not ``holidays'' as defined above.
    (3) The term filing period means the number of days allowed or 
prescribed by statute, rule, order, notice or other Commission action 
for filing any document with the Commission. It does not include any 
additional days allowed for filing any document pursuant to paragraphs 
(g), (h) and (j) of this section.
    (4) The term filing date means the date upon which a document must 
be filed after all computations of time authorized by this section have 
been made.
    (f) Except as provided in Sec. 0.401(b) of this chapter, all 
petitions, pleadings, tariffs or other documents not required to be 
accompanied by a fee and which are hand-delivered must be tendered for 
filing in complete form, as directed by the Rules, with the Office of 
the Secretary before 7 p.m., at 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20554. The Secretary will determine whether a tendered document meets 
the pre-7:00 p.m. deadline. Documents filed electronically pursuant to 
Sec. 1.49(f) must be received by the Commission's electronic filing 
system before midnight. Applications, attachments and pleadings filed 
electronically in the Universal Licensing System (ULS) pursuant to Sec. 
1.939(b) must be received before midnight on the filing date. Media 
Bureau applications and reports filed electronically pursuant to Sec. 
73.3500 of this chapter must be received by the electronic filing system 
before midnight on the filing date.
    (g) Unless otherwise provided (e.g., Sec. Sec. 1.773 and 
76.1502(e)(1) of this chapter), if the filing period is less than 7 
days, intermediate holidays shall not be counted in determining the 
filing date.

    Example 10: A reply is required to be filed within 5 days after the 
filing of an opposition in a license application proceeding. The 
opposition is filed on Wednesday, June 10, 1987. The first day to be 
counted in computing the 5 day time period is Thursday, June 11, 1987. 
Saturday and Sunday are not counted because they are holidays. The 
document must be filed with the Commission on or before the following 
Wednesday, June 17, 1987.

    (h) If a document is required to be served upon other parties by 
statute or Commission regulation and the document is in fact served by 
mail (see Sec. 1.47(f)), and the filing period for a response is 10 
days or less, an additional 3 days (excluding holidays) will be allowed 
to all parties in the proceeding for filing a response. This paragraph 
(h) shall not apply to documents filed pursuant to Sec. 1.89, Sec. 
1.120(d), Sec. 1.315(b) or Sec. 1.316. For purposes of this paragraph 
(h) service by facsimile or by electronic means shall be deemed 
equivalent to hand delivery.

    Example 11: A reply to an opposition for a petition for 
reconsideration must be filed within 7 days after the opposition is 
filed. 47 CFR 1.106(h). The rules require that the opposition be served 
on the person seeking reconsideration. 47 CFR 1.106(g). If the 
opposition is served on the party seeking reconsideration by mail and 
the opposition is filed with the Commission on Monday, November 9, 1987, 
the first day to be counted is Tuesday, November 10, 1987 (the day after 
the day on which the event occurred, Sec. 1.4(c)), and the seventh day 
is Monday, November 16. An additional 3 days (excluding holidays) is 
then added at the end of the 7 day period, and the reply must be filed 
no later than Thursday, November 19, 1987.
    Example 12: Assume that oppositions to a petition in a particular 
proceeding are due 10 days after the petition is filed and must be 
served on the parties to the proceeding. If the petition is filed on 
October 28, 1993, the last day of the filing period for oppositions is 
Sunday, November 7. If service is made by mail, the opposition is due 
three days after November 7, or Wednesday, November 10.

    (i) If both paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section are applicable, 
make the

[[Page 108]]

paragraph (g) computation before the paragraph (h) computation.

    Example 13: Section 1.45(b) requires the filing of replies to 
oppositions within five days after the time for filing oppositions has 
expired. If an opposition has been filed on the last day of the filing 
period (Friday, July 10, 1987), and was served on the replying party by 
mail, Sec. 1.4(i) of this section specifies that the paragraph (g) 
computation should be made before the paragraph (h) computation. 
Therefore, since the specified filing period is less than seven days, 
paragraph (g) is applied first. The first day of the filing period is 
Monday, July 13, 1987, and Friday, July 17, 1987 is the fifth day (the 
intervening weekend was not counted). Paragraph (h) is then applied to 
add three days for mailing (excluding holidays). That period begins on 
Monday, July 20, 1987. Therefore, Wednesday, July 22, 1987, is the date 
by which replies must be filed, since the intervening weekend is again 
not counted.

    (j) Unless otherwise provided (e.g. Sec. 76.1502(e) of this 
chapter) if, after making all the computations provided for in this 
section, the filing date falls on a holiday, the document shall be filed 
on the next business day. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

    Example 14: The filing date falls on Friday, December 25, 1987. The 
document is required to be filed on the next business day, which is 
Monday, December 28, 1987.

    (k) Where specific provisions of part 1 conflict with this section, 
those specific provisions of part 1 are controlling. See, 
e.g.,Sec. Sec. 1.45(d), 1.773(a)(3) and 1.773(b)(2). Additionally, 
where Sec. 76.1502(e) of this chapter conflicts with this section, 
those specific provisions of Sec. 76.1502 are controlling. See e.g. 47 
CFR 76.1502(e).

Sec. 1.5  Mailing address furnished by licensee.

    (a) Each licensee shall furnish the Commission with an address to be 
used by the Commission in serving documents or directing correspondence 
to that licensee. Unless any licensee advises the Commission to the 
contrary, the address contained in the licensee's most recent 
application will be used by the Commission for this purpose.
    (b) The licensee is responsible for making any arrangements which 
may be necessary in his particular circumstances to assure that 
Commission documents or correspondence delivered to this address will 
promptly reach him or some person authorized by him to act in his 
behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6  Availability of station logs and records for Commission inspection.

    (a) Station records and logs shall be made available for inspection 
or duplication at the request of the Commission or its representative. 
Such logs or records may be removed from the licensee's possession by a 
Commission representative or, upon request, shall be mailed by the 
licensee to the Commission by either registered mail, return receipt 
requested, or certified mail, return receipt requested. The return 
receipt shall be retained by the licensee as part of the station records 
until such records or logs are returned to the licensee. A receipt shall 
be furnished when the logs or records are removed from the licensee's 
possession by a Commission representative and this receipt shall be 
retained by the licensee as part of the station records until such 
records or logs are returned to the licensee. When the Commission has no 
further need for such records or logs, they shall be returned to the 
licensee. The provisions of this rule shall apply solely to those 
station logs and records which are required to be maintained by the 
provisions of this chapter.
    (b) Where records or logs are maintained as the official records of 
a recognized law enforcement agency and the removal of the records from 
the possession of the law enforcement agency will hinder its law 
enforcement activities, such records will not be removed pursuant to 
this section if the chief of the law enforcement agency promptly 
certifies in writing to the Federal Communications Commission that 
removal of the logs or records will hinder law enforcement activities of 
the agency, stating insofar as feasible the basis for his decision and 
the date when it can reasonably be expected

[[Page 109]]

that such records will be released to the Federal Communications 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1.7  Documents are filed upon receipt.

    Unless otherwise provided in this Title, by Public Notice, or by 
decision of the Commission or of the Commission's staff acting on 
delegated authority, pleadings and other documents are considered to be

Sec. 1.13  Filing of petitions for review and notices of appeals of Commission orders.

    (a)(1) This section pertains to each party filing a petition for 
review in any United States court of appeals of a Commission Order, 
pursuant to section 402(a) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 402(a), 
and 28 U.S.C. 2342(l), that wishes to avail itself of procedures 
established for selection of a court in the case of multiple appeals, 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2112(a). Each such party shall, within ten days 
after the issuance of that order, file with the General Counsel in the 
Office of General Counsel, Room 8-A741, 445 12th Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20554, a copy of its petition for review as filed and 
date-stamped by the court of appeals within which it was filed. Such 
copies of petitions for review must be filed by 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time 
on the tenth day of the filing period. A stamp indicating the time and 
date received by the Office of General Counsel will constitute proof of 
filing. Upon receipt of any copies of petitions for review, the 
Commission shall follow the procedures established in section 28 U.S.C. 
2112(a) to determine the court in which to file the record in that case.
    (2) Computation of time of the ten-day period for filing copies of 
petitions for review of a Commission order shall be governed by Rule 26 
of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The date of issuance of a 
Commission order for purposes of filing copies of petitions for review 
shall be the date of public notice as defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of the 
Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.4(b).
    (b) Copies of notices of appeals filed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 402(b) 
shall be served upon the General Counsel.

    Note: For administrative efficiency, the Commission requests that 
any petitioner seeking judicial review of Commission actions pursuant to 
47 U.S.C. 402(a) serve a copy of its petition on the General Counsel 
regardless of whether it wishes to avail itself of the procedures for 
multiple appeals set forth in 47 U.S.C. 2112(a).

Sec. 1.24  Censure, suspension, or disbarment of attorneys.

    (a) The Commission may censure, suspend, or disbar any person who 
has practiced, is practicing or holding himself out as entitled to 
practice before it if it finds that such person:
    (1) Does not possess the qualifications required by Sec. 1.23;
    (2) Has failed to conform to standards of ethical conduct required 
of practitioners at the bar of any court of which he is a member;
    (3) Is lacking in character or professional integrity; and/or
    (4) Displays toward the Commission or any of its hearing officers 
conduct which, if displayed toward any court of the United States or any 
of its Territories or the District of Columbia, would be cause for 
censure, suspension, or disbarment.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, before any 
member of the bar of the Commission shall be censured, suspended, or 
disbarred, charges shall be preferred by the Commission against such 
practitioner, and he or she shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard 
thereon.
    (c) Upon receipt of official notice from any authority having power 
to suspend or disbar an attorney in the practice of law within any 
state, territory, or the District of Columbia which demonstrates that an 
attorney practicing before the Commission is subject to an order of 
final suspension (not merely temporary suspension pending further 
action) or disbarment by such authority, the Commission may, without any 
preliminary hearing, enter an order temporarily suspending the attorney 
from practice before it pending final disposition of a disciplinary 
proceeding brought pursuant to Sec. 1.24(a)(2), which shall afford such 
attorney an opportunity to be heard and directing the attorney to show 
cause within thirty days from the date of said order why identical 
discipline should not be imposed against such attorney by the 
Commission.
    (d) Allegations of attorney misconduct in Commission proceedings 
shall be referred under seal to the Office of General Counsel. Pending 
action by the General Counsel, the decision maker may proceed with the 
merits of the matter but in its decision may make findings concerning 
the attorney's conduct only if necessary to resolve questions concerning 
an applicant and may not reach any conclusions regarding the ethical 
ramifications of the attorney's conduct. The General Counsel will 
determine if the allegations are substantial, and, if so, shall 
immediately notify the attorney and direct him or her to respond to the 
allegations. No notice will be provided to other parties to the 
proceeding. The General Counsel will then determine what further 
measures are necessary to protect the integrity of the Commission's 
administrative process, including but not limited to one or more of the 
following:
    (1) Recommending to the Commission the institution of a proceeding 
under paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) Referring the matter to the appropriate State, territorial, or 
District of Columbia bar; or
    (3) Consulting with the Department of Justice.

the provisions of this chapter to serve any document upon any person, 
service shall (in the absence of specific provisions in this chapter to 
the contrary) be made in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) Where any person is required to serve any document filed with 
the Commission, service shall be made by that person or by his 
representative on or before the day on which the document is filed.
    (c) Commission counsel who formally participate in any proceeding 
shall be served in the same manner as other persons who participate in 
that proceeding. The filing of a document with the Commission does not 
constitute service upon Commission counsel.
    (d) Except in formal complaint proceedings against common carriers 
under Sec. Sec. 1.720 through 1.736, documents may be served upon a 
party, his attorney, or other duly constituted agent by delivering a 
copy or by mailing a copy to the last known address. See Sec. 1.736. 
Documents that are required to be served must be served in paper form, 
even if documents are filed in electronic form with the Commission, 
unless the party to be served agrees to accept service in some other 
form.
    (e) Delivery of a copy pursuant to this section means handing it to 
the party, his attorney, or other duly constituted agent; or leaving it 
with the clerk or other person in charge of the

[[Page 115]]

office of the person being served; or, if there is no one in charge of 
such office, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or, if such 
office is closed or the person to be served has no office, leaving it at 
his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable 
age and discretion then residing therein.
    (f) Service by mail is complete upon mailing.
    (g) Proof of service, as provided in this section, shall be filed 
before action is taken. The proof of service shall show the time and 
manner of service, and may be by written acknowledgement of service, by 
certificate of the person effecting the service, or by other proof 
satisfactory to the Commission. Failure to make proof of service will 
not affect the validity of the service. The Commission may allow the 
proof to be amended or supplied at any time, unless to do so would 
result in material prejudice to a party.
    (h) Every common carrier and interconnected VoIP provider, as 
defined in Sec. 54.5 of this chapter, that is subject to the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall designate an agent in the 
District of Columbia, and may designate additional agents if it so 
chooses, upon whom service of all notices, process, orders, decisions, 
and requirements of the Commission may be made for and on behalf of such 
carrier or interconnected VoIP provider in any proceeding before the 
Commission. Such designation shall include, for both the carrier or 
interconnected VoIP provider and its designated agents, a name, business 
address, telephone or voicemail number, facsimile number, and, if 
available, Internet e-mail address. Such carrier or interconnected VoIP 
provider shall additionally list any other names by which it is known or 
under which it does business, and, if the carrier or interconnected VoIP 
provider is an affiliated company, the parent, holding, or management 
company. Within thirty (30) days of the commencement of provision of 
service, such carrier or interconnected VoIP provider shall file such 
information with the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes 
Resolution Division. Such carriers and interconnected VoIP providers may 
file a hard copy of the relevant portion of the Telecommunications 
Reporting Worksheet, as delineated by the Commission in the Federal 
Register, to satisfy this requirement. Each Telecommunications Reporting 
Worksheet filed annually by a common carrier or interconnected VoIP 
provider must contain a name, business address, telephone or voicemail 
number, facsimile number, and, if available, Internet e-mail address for 
its designated agents, regardless of whether such information has been 
revised since the previous filing. Carriers and interconnected VoIP 
providers must notify the Commission within one week of any changes in 
their designation information by filing revised portions of the 
Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet with the Chief of the Enforcement 
Bureau's Market Disputes Resolution Division. A paper copy of this 
designation list shall be maintained in the Office of the Secretary of 
the Commission. Service of any notice, process, orders, decisions or 
requirements of the Commission may be made upon such carrier or 
interconnected VoIP provider by leaving a copy thereof with such 
designated agent at his office or usual place of residence. If such 
carrier or interconnected VoIP provider fails to designate such an 
agent, service of any notice or other process in any proceeding before 
the Commission, or of any order, decision, or requirement of the 
Commission, may be made by posting such notice, process, order, 
requirement, or decision in the Office of the Secretary of the 
Commission.

Sec. 1.48  Length of pleadings.

    (a) Affidavits, statements, tables of contents and summaries of 
filings, and other materials which are submitted with and factually 
support a pleading are not counted in determining the

[[Page 116]]

length of the pleading. If other materials are submitted with a 
pleading, they will be counted in determining its length; and if the 
length of the pleadings, as so computed, is greater than permitted by 
the provisions of this chapter, the pleading will be returned without 
consideration.
    (b) It is the policy of the Commission that requests for permission 
to file pleadings in excess of the length prescribed by the provisions 
of this chapter shall not be routinely granted. Where the filing period 
is 10 days or less, the request shall be made within 2 business days 
after the period begins to run. Where the period is more than 10 days, 
the request shall be filed at least 10 days before the filing date. (See 
Sec. 1.4.) If a timely request is made, the pleading need not be filed 
earlier than 2 business days after the Commission acts upon the request.

Sec. 1.49  Specifications as to pleadings and documents.

    (a) All pleadings and documents filed in paper form in any 
Commission proceeding shall be typewritten or prepared by mechanical 
processing methods, and shall be filed on A4 (21 cm. x 29.7 cm.) or on 
8\1/2\ x 11 inch (21.6 cm. x 27.9 cm.) paper with the margins set so 
that the printed material does not exceed 6 \1/2\ x 9\1/2\ inches (16.5 
cm. x 24.1 cm.). The printed material may be in any typeface of at least 
12-point (0.42333 cm. or \12/72\<gr-thn-eq>) in height. The body of the 
text must be double spaced with a minimum distance of \7/32\ of an inch 
(0.5556 cm.) between each line of text. Footnotes and long, indented 
quotations may be single spaced, but must be in type that is 12-point or 
larger in height, with at least \1/16\ of an inch (0.158 cm.) between 
each line of text. Counsel are cautioned against employing extended 
single spaced passages or excessive footnotes to evade prescribed 
pleading lengths. If single-spaced passages or footnotes are used in 
this manner the pleading will, at the discretion of the Commission, 
either be rejected as unacceptable for filing or dismissed with leave to 
be refiled in proper form. Pleadings may be printed on both sides of the 
paper. Pleadings that use only one side of the paper shall be stapled, 
or otherwise bound, in the upper left-hand corner; those using both 
sides of the paper shall be stapled twice, or otherwise bound, along the 
left-hand margin so that it opens like a book. The foregoing shall not 
apply to printed briefs specifically requested by the Commission, 
official publications, charted or maps, original documents (or 
admissible copies thereof) offered as exhibits, specially prepared 
exhibits, or if otherwise specifically provided. All copies shall be 
clearly legible.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all 
pleadings and documents filed with the Commission, the length of which 
as computed under this chapter exceeds ten pages, shall include, as part 
of the pleading or document, a table of contents with page references.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all 
pleadings and documents filed with the Commission, the length of which 
filings as computed under this chapter exceeds ten pages, shall include, 
as part of the pleading or document, a summary of the filing, suitably 
paragraphed, which should be a succinct, but accurate and clear 
condensation of the substance of the filing. It should not be a mere 
repetition of the headings under which the filing is arranged. For 
pleadings and documents exceeding ten but not twenty-five pages in 
length, the summary should seldom exceed one and never two pages; for 
pleadings and documents exceeding twenty-five pages in length, the 
summary should seldom exceed two and never five pages.
    (d) The requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall 
not apply to:
    (1) Interrogatories or answers to interrogatories, and depositions;
    (2) FCC forms or applications;
    (3) Transcripts;
    (4) Contracts and reports;
    (5) Letters; or
    (6) Hearing exhibits, and exhibits or appendicies accompanying any 
document or pleading submitted to the Commission.
    (e) Petitions, pleadings, and other documents associated with 
licensing matters in the Wireless Radio Services

[[Page 117]]

may be filed electronically in ULS. See Sec. 22.6 for specifications.
    (f)(1) In the following types of proceedings, all pleadings, 
including permissible ex parte submissions, notices of ex parte 
presentations, comments, reply comments, and petitions for 
reconsideration and replies thereto, may be filed in electronic format:
    (i) General rulemaking proceedings other than broadcast allotment 
proceedings;
    (ii) Notice of inquiry proceedings;
    (iii) Petition for rulemaking proceedings (except broadcast 
allotment proceedings); and
    (iv) Petition for forbearance proceedings.
    (2) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and any 
prescribed pleading lengths, the length of any document filed in 
electronic form shall be equal to the length of the document if printed 
out and formatted according to the specifications of paragraph (a) of 
this section, or shall be no more that 250 words per page.

    Note: The table of contents and the summary pages shall not be 
included in complying with any page limitation requirements as set forth 
by Commission rule.

and regulations, the number of copies of pleadings, briefs, and other 
papers to be filed is as follows:
    (a) In hearing proceedings, the following number of copies shall be 
filed:

6 copies shall be filed.
    (2) If the paper filed relates to matters to be acted on by the 
Commission, an original and 14 copies shall be filed.
    (3) If more than one person presided (is presiding) at the hearing 
an additional copy shall be filed for each such additional person.
    (b) In rulemaking proceedings which have not been designated for 
hearing, see section 1.419 of this chapter.
    (c) In matters other than rule making and hearing cases, the 
following number of copies shall be filed:
    (1) If the paper filed relates to matters to be acted on by the 
Commission, an original and 4 copies shall be filed. If the matter 
relates to Part 22 of the rules, see Sec. 22.6.
    (2) If the paper filed related to matters to be acted on by staff 
officials under delegated authority, an original and 4 copies shall be 
filed. If the matter relates to Part 22 of the rules, see Sec. 22.6.
    (d) Where statute or regulation provides for service by the 
Commission of papers filed with the Commission, an additional copy of 
such papers shall be filed for each person to be served.
    (e) The parties to any proceeding may, on notice, be required to 
file additional copies of any or all filings made in that proceeding.
    (f) For application and licensing matters involving the Wireless 
Radio Services, pleadings, briefs or other documents may be filed 
electronically in ULS, or if filed manually, one original and one copy 
of a pleading, brief or other document must be filed.
    (g) Participants that file pleadings, briefs or other documents 
electronically in ULS need only submit one copy, so long as the 
submission conforms to any procedural or filing requirements established 
for formal electronic comments. (see Sec. 1.49)
    (h) Pleadings, briefs or other documents filed electronically in ULS 
by a party represented by an attorney shall include the name, street 
address, and

[[Page 118]]

telephone number of at least one attorney of record. Parties not 
represented by an attorney that file electronically in ULS shall provide 
their name, street address, and telephone number.

Sec. 1.52  Subscription and verification.

    The original of all petitions, motions, pleadings, briefs, and other 
documents filed by any party represented by counsel shall be signed by 
at least one attorney of record in his individual name, whose address 
shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall 
sign and verify the document and state his address. Either the original 
document, the electronic reproduction of such original document 
containing the facsimile signature of the attorney or represented party, 
or, in the case of matters in the Wireless Radio Services, an electronic 
filing via ULS is acceptable for filing. If a facsimile or electronic 
reproduction of such original document is filed, the signatory shall 
retain the original until the Commission's decision is final and no 
longer subject to judicial review. If pursuant to Sec. 1.429(h) a 
document is filed electronically, a signature will be considered any 
symbol executed or adopted by the party with the intent that such symbol 
be a signature, including symbols formed by computer-generated 
electronic impulses. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule 
or statute, documents signed by the attorney for a party need not be 
verified or accompanied by affidavit. The signature or electronic 
reproduction thereof by an attorney constitutes a certificate by him 
that he has read the document; that to the best of his knowledge, 
information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it 
is not interposed for delay. If the original of a document is not signed 
or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this section, or an 
electronic reproduction does not contain a facsimile signature, it may 
be stricken as sham and false, and the matter may proceed as though the 
document had not been filed. An attorney may be subjected to appropriate 
disciplinary action, pursuant to Sec. 1.24, for a willful violation of 
this section or if scandalous or indecent matter is inserted.

Sec. 1.53  Separate pleadings for petitions for forbearance.

    In order to be considered as a petition for forbearance subject to 
the one-year deadline set forth in 47 U.S.C. 160(c), any petition 
requesting that the Commission exercise its forbearance authority under 
47 U.S.C. 160 shall be filed as a separate pleading and shall be 
identified in the caption of such pleading as a petition for forbearance 
under 47 U.S.C. 160(c). Any request which is not in compliance with this 
rule is deemed not to constitute a petition pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 
160(c), and is not subject to the deadline set forth therein.

[65 FR 7460, Feb. 15, 2000]


<R05>

must identify any proceeding pending before the Commission in which the 
petitioner has requested, or otherwise taken a position regarding, 
relief that is identical to, or comparable to, the relief sought in the 
forbearance petition. Alternatively, the petition must declare that the 
petitioner has not, in a pending proceeding, requested or otherwise

                     General Application Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 1.61  Procedures for handling applications requiring special aeronautical study.

    (a) Antenna Structure Registration is conducted by the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau as follows:
    (1) Each antenna structure owner that must notify the FAA of 
proposed construction using FAA Form 7460-1 shall, upon proposing new or 
modified construction, register that antenna structure with the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau using FCC Form 854.
    (2) If an Environmental Assessment is required under Sec. 1.1307, 
the Bureau will address the environmental concerns prior to processing 
the registration.
    (3) If a final FAA determination of ``no hazard'' is not submitted 
along with FCC Form 854, processing of the registration may be delayed 
or disapproved.
    (4) If the owner of the antenna structure cannot file FCC Form 854 
because it is subject to a denial of Federal benefits under the Anti-
Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. 862, the first licensee authorized to 
locate on the structure must register the structure using FCC Form 854, 
and provide a copy of the Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 854R) 
to the owner. The owner remains responsible for providing a copy of FCC 
Form 854R to all tenant licensees on the structure and for posting the 
registration number as required by Sec. 17.4(g) of this chapter.
    (5) Upon receipt of FCC Form 854, and attached final FAA 
determination of ``no hazard,'' the Bureau prescribes antenna structure 
painting and/or lighting specifications or other conditions in 
accordance with the FAA airspace recommendation and returns a completed 
Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 854R) to the registrant. If the 
proposed structure is disapproved the registrant is so advised.
    (b) Each operating Bureau or Office examines the applications for 
Commission authorization for which it is responsible to ensure 
compliance with FAA notification procedures as well as Commission 
Antenna Structure Registration as follows:

[[Page 121]]

    (1) If Antenna Structure Registration is required, the operating 
Bureau reviews the application for the Antenna Structure Registration 
Number and proceeds as follows:
    (i) If the application contains the Antenna Structure Registration 
Number or if the applicant seeks a Cellular or PCS system authorization, 
the operating Bureau processes the application.
    (ii) If the application does not contain the Antenna Structure 
Registration Number, but the structure owner has already filed FCC Form 
854, the operating Bureau places the application on hold until 
Registration can be confirmed, so long as the owner exhibits due 
diligence in filing.
    (iii) If the application does not contain the Antenna Structure 
Registration Number, and the structure owner has not filed FCC Form 854, 
the operating Bureau notifies the applicant that FCC Form 854 must be 
filed and places the application on hold until Registration can be 
confirmed, so long as the owner exhibits due diligence in filing.
    (2) If Antenna Structure Registration is not required, the operating 
Bureau processes the application.
    (c) Where one or more antenna farm areas have been designated for a 
community or communities (see Sec. 17.9 of this chapter), an 
application proposing the erection of an antenna structure over 1,000 
feet in height above ground to serve such community or communities will 
not be accepted for filing unless:
    (1) It is proposed to locate the antenna structure in a designated 
antenna farm area, or
    (2) It is accompanied by a statement from the Federal Aviation 
Administration that the proposed structure will not constitute a menace 
to air navigation, or
    (3) It is accompanied by a request for waiver setting forth reasons 
sufficient, if true, to justify such a waiver.

    Note: By Commission Order (FCC 65-455), 30 FR 7419, June 5, 1965, 
the Commission issued the following policy statement concerning the 
height of radio and television antenna towers:
``We have concluded that this objective can best be achieved by adopting 
the following policy: Applications for antenna towers higher than 2,000 
feet above ground will be presumed to be inconsistent with the public 
interest, and the applicant will have a burden of overcoming that strong 
presumption. The applicant must accompany its application with a 
detailed showing directed to meeting this burden. Only in the 
exceptional case, where the Commission concludes that a clear and 
compelling showing has been made that there are public interest reasons 
requiring a tower higher than 2,000 feet above ground, and after the 
parties have complied with applicable FAA procedures, and full 
Commission coordination with FAA on the question of menace to air 
navigation, will a grant be made. Applicants and parties in interest 
will, of course, be afforded their statutory hearing rights.''

Sec. 1.62  Operation pending action on renewal application.

    (a)(1) Where there is pending before the Commission at the time of 
expiration of license any proper and timely application for renewal of 
license with respect to any activity of a continuing nature, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 9(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act, such license shall continue in effect without further 
action by the Commission until such time as the Commission shall make a 
final determination with respect to the renewal application. No 
operation by any licensee under this section shall be construed as a 
finding by the Commission that the operation will serve the public 
interest, convenience, or necessity, nor shall such operation in any way 
affect or limit the action of the Commission with respect to any pending 
application or proceeding.
    (2) A licensee operating by virtue of this paragraph shall, after 
the date of expiration specified in the license, post, in addition to 
the original license, any acknowledgment received from the Commission 
that the renewal application has been accepted for filing or a signed 
copy of the application for renewal of license which has been submitted 
by the licensee, or in services other than broadcast and common carrier, 
a statement certifying that the licensee has mailed or filed a renewal 
application, specifying the date of mailing or filing.

[[Page 122]]

    (b) Where there is pending before the Commission at the time of 
expiration of license any proper and timely application for renewal or 
extension of the term of a license with respect to any activity not of a 
continuing nature, the Commission may in its discretion grant a 
temporary extension of such license pending determination of such 
application. No such temporary extension shall be construed as a finding 
by the Commission that the operation of any radio station thereunder 
will serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity beyond the 
express terms of such temporary extension of license, nor shall such 
temporary extension in any way affect or limit the action of the 
Commission with respect to any pending application or proceeding.
    (c) Except where an instrument of authorization clearly states on 
its face that it relates to an activity not of a continuing nature, or 
where the non-continuing nature is otherwise clearly apparent upon the 
face of the authorization, all licenses issued by the Commission shall 
be deemed to be related to an activity of a continuing nature.

Sec. 1.65  Substantial and significant changes in information furnished by applicants to the Commission.

    (a) Each applicant is responsible for the continuing accuracy and 
completeness of information furnished in a pending application or in 
Commission proceedings involving a pending application. Except as 
otherwise required by rules applicable to particular types of 
applications, whenever the information furnished in the pending 
application is no longer substantially accurate and complete in all 
significant respects, the applicant shall as promptly as possible and in 
any event within 30 days, unless good cause is shown, amend or request 
the amendment of the application so as to furnish such additional or 
corrected information as may be appropriate. Except as otherwise 
required by rules applicable to particular types of applications, 
whenever there has been a substantial change as to any other matter 
which may be of decisional significance in a Commission proceeding 
involving the pending application, the applicant shall as promptly as 
possible and in any event within 30 days, unless good cause is shown, 
submit a statement furnishing such additional or corrected information 
as may be appropriate, which shall be served upon parties of record in 
accordance with Sec. 1.47. Where the matter is before any court for 
review, statements and requests to amend shall in addition be served 
upon the Commission's General Counsel. For the purposes of this section, 
an application is ``pending'' before the Commission from the time it is 
accepted for filing by the Commission until a Commission grant or denial 
of the application is no longer subject to reconsideration by the 
Commission or to review by any court.
    (b) Applications in broadcast services subject to competitive 
bidding will be subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.2105(b), 
73.5002 and 73.3522 of this chapter regarding the modification of their 
applications.
    (c) All broadcast permittees and licensees must report annually to 
the Commission any adverse finding or adverse final action taken by any 
court or administrative body that involves conduct bearing on the 
permittee's or licensee's character qualifications and that would be 
reportable in connection with an application for renewal as reflected in 
the renewal form. If a report is required by this paragraph(s), it shall 
be filed on the anniversary of the date that the licensee's renewal 
application is required to be filed, except that licensees owning 
multiple stations with different anniversary dates need file only one 
report per year on the anniversary of their choice, provided that their 
reports are not more than one year apart. Permittees and licensees bear 
the obligation to make diligent, good faith efforts to become 
knowledgeable of any such reportable adjudicated misconduct.

    Note: The terms adverse finding and adverse final action as used in 
paragraph (c) of this section include adjudications made by an ultimate 
trier of fact, whether a government agency or court, but do not include 
factual determinations which are subject to review de novo unless the 
time for taking such review has expired under the relevant procedural 
rules. The pendency of an appeal of an adverse finding or adverse final 
action does

[[Page 123]]

not relieve a permittee or licensee from its obligation to report the 
finding or action.

Sec. 1.68  Action on application for license to cover construction permit.

    (a) An application for license by the lawful holder of a 
construction permit will be granted without hearing where the 
Commission, upon examination of such application, finds that all the 
terms, conditions, and obligations set forth in the application and 
permit have been fully met, and that no cause or circumstance arising or 
first coming to the knowledge of the Commission since the granting of 
the permit would, in the judgment of the Commission, make the operation 
of such station against the public interest.
    (b) In the event the Commission is unable to make the findings in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will designate the 
application for hearing upon specified issues.

                        Miscellaneous Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.80  Forfeiture proceedings.

    (a) Persons against whom and violations for which a forfeiture may 
be assessed. A forfeiture penalty may be assessed against any person 
found to have:
    (1) Willfully or repeatedly failed to comply substantially with the 
terms and conditions of any license, permit, certificate, or other 
instrument of authorization issued by the Commission;
    (2) Willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any of the 
provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended; or of any 
rule, regulation or order issued by the Commission under that Act or 
under any treaty, convention, or other agreement to which the United 
States is a party and which is binding on the United States;
    (3) Violated any provision of section 317(c) or 508(a) of the 
Communications Act; or
    (4) Violated any provision of section 1304, 1343, or 1464 of Title 
18, United States Code.


A forfeiture penalty assessed under this section is in addition to any 
other

[[Page 124]]

penalty provided for by the Communications Act, except that the 
penalties provided for in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this 
section shall not apply to conduct which is subject to a forfeiture 
penalty under sections 202(c), 203(e), 205(b), 214(d), 219(b), 220(d), 
223(b), 362(a), 362(b), 386(a), 386(b), 503(b), 506, and 634 of the 
Communications Act. The remaining provisions of this section are 
applicable to such conduct.
    (b) Limits on the amount of forfeiture assessed. (1) If the violator 
is a broadcast station licensee or permittee, a cable television 
operator, or an applicant for any broadcast or cable television operator 
license, permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization 
issued by the Commission, except as otherwise noted in this paragraph, 
the forfeiture penalty under this section shall not exceed $37,500 for 
each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that the 
amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of 
$375,000 for any single act or failure to act described in paragraph (a) 
of this section. There is no limit on forfeiture assessments for EEO 
violations by cable operators that occur after notification by the 
Commission of a potential violation. See section 634(f)(2) of the 
Communications Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this section, if 
the violator is a broadcast station licensee or permittee or an 
applicant for any broadcast license, permit, certificate, or other 
instrument of authorization issued by the Commission, and if the 
violator is determined by the Commission to have broadcast obscene, 
indecent, or profane material, the forfeiture penalty under this section 
shall not exceed $325,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing 
violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation 
shall not exceed a total of $3,000,000 for any single act or failure to 
act described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) If the violator is a common carrier subject to the provisions of 
the Communications Act or an applicant for any common carrier license, 
permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization issued by the 
Commission, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this 
section shall not exceed $150,000 for each violation or each day of a 
continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing 
violation shall not exceed a total of $1,500,000 for any single act or 
failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) In any case not covered in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this 
section shall not exceed $16,000 for each violation or each day of a 
continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing 
violation shall not exceed a total of $112,500 for any single act or 
failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) Factors considered in determining the amount of the forfeiture 
penalty. In determining the amount of the forfeiture penalty, the 
Commission or its designee will take into account the nature, 
circumstances, extent and gravity of the violations and, with respect to 
the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, 
ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.

    Note to paragraph (b)(4):

                  Guidelines for Assessing Forfeitures

    The Commission and its staff may use these guidelines in particular 
cases. The Commission and its staff retain the discretion to issue a 
higher or lower forfeiture than provided in the guidelines, to issue no 
forfeiture at all, or to apply alternative or additional sanctions as 
permitted by the statute. The forfeiture ceiling per violation or per 
day for a continuing violation stated in section 503 of the 
Communications Act and the Commission's rules are described in Sec. 
1.80(b)(5)(iii). These statutory maxima became effective September 2, 
2008. Forfeitures issued under other sections of the Act are dealt with 
separately in section III of this note.

       Section II. Adjustment Criteria for Section 503 Forfeitures

                       Upward Adjustment Criteria

    (1) Egregious misconduct.
    (2) Ability to pay/relative disincentive.
    (3) Intentional violation.
    (4) Substantial harm.
    (5) Prior violations of any FCC requirements.
    (6) Substantial economic gain.
    (7) Repeated or continuous violation.

                      Downward Adjustment Criteria

    (1) Minor violation.
    (2) Good faith or voluntary disclosure.
    (3) History of overall compliance.
    (4) Inability to pay.

   Section III. Non-Section 503 Forfeitures That Are Affected by the 
                       Downward Adjustment Factors

    Unlike section 503 of the Act, which establishes maximum forfeiture 
amounts, other sections of the Act, with one exception, state prescribed 
amounts of forfeitures for violations of the relevant section. These 
amounts are then subject to mitigation or remission under section 504 of 
the Act. The one exception is section 223 of the Act, which provides a 
maximum forfeiture per day. For convenience, the Commission will treat 
this amount as if it were a prescribed base amount, subject to downward 
adjustments. The following amounts are adjusted for inflation pursuant 
to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), 28 U.S.C. 2461. 
These non-section 503 forfeitures may be adjusted downward using the 
``Downward Adjustment Criteria'' shown for section 503 forfeitures in 
section II of this note.

    (5) Inflation adjustments to the maximum forfeiture amount. (i) 
Pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-
134 (110 Stat. 1321-358), which amends the Federal Civil Monetary 
Penalty Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Public Law 101-410 (104 Stat. 
890; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note), the statutory maximum amount of a forfeiture 
penalty assessed under this section shall be adjusted for inflation at 
least once every four years using the method specified in the statute. 
This is to be done by determining the `cost-of-living adjustment', which 
is the percentage (if any) by which the CPI for June of the preceding 
year exceeds the CPI for June of the year the forfeiture amount was last 
set or adjusted. The inflation adjustment is determined by multiplying 
the cost-of-living adjustment by the statutory maximum amount. Round off 
this result using the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. Add 
the rounded result to the statutory maximum forfeiture penalty amount. 
The sum is the statutory maximum amount, adjusted for inflation.
    (ii) The rounding rules are as follows:
    (A) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $10 if the penalty is 
from $0 to $100;
    (B) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $100 if the penalty is 
from $101 to $1,000;
    (C) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $1,000 if the penalty 
is from $1,001 to $10,000;
    (D) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $5,000 if the penalty 
is from $10,001 to $100,000;
    (E) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $10,000 if the penalty 
is from $100,001 to $200,000; or
    (F) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $25,000 if the penalty 
is over $200,001.
    (iii) The application of the inflation adjustments required by the 
DCIA, 28 U.S.C. 2461, results in the following adjusted statutory 
maximum forfeitures authorized by the Communications Act:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Limits on the time when a proceeding may be initiated. (1) In 
the case of a broadcast station, no forfeiture penalty shall be imposed 
if the violation occurred more than 1 year prior to the issuance of the 
appropriate notice or prior to the date of commencement of the current 
license term, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this paragraph, 
``date of commencement of the current license term'' means the date of 
commencement of the last term of license for which the licensee has been 
granted a license by the Commission. A separate license term shall not 
be deemed to have commenced as a result of continuing a license in 
effect under section 307(c) pending decision on an application for 
renewal of the license.
    (2) In the case of a forfeiture imposed against a carrier under 
sections 202(c), 203(e), and 220(d), no forfeiture will be imposed if 
the violation occurred more than 5 years prior to the issuance of a 
notice of apparent liability.
    (3) In all other cases, no penalty shall be imposed if the violation 
occurred more than 1 year prior to the date on which the appropriate 
notice is issued.
    (d) Preliminary procedure in some cases; citations. No forfeiture 
penalty shall be imposed upon any person under this section, if such 
person does not hold a license, permit, certificate, or other

[[Page 127]]

authorization issued by the Commission, and if such person is not an 
applicant for a license, permit, certificate, or other authorization 
issued by the Commission, unless, prior to the issuance of the 
appropriate notice, such person: (1) Is sent a citation reciting the 
violation charged; (2) is given a reasonable opportunity (usually 30 
days) to request a personal interview with a Commission official, at the 
field office which is nearest to such person's place of residence; and 
(3) subsequently engages in conduct of the type described in the 
citation. However, a forfeiture penalty may be imposed, if such person 
is engaged in (and the violation relates to) activities for which a 
license, permit, certificate, or other authorization is required or if 
such person is a cable television operator, or in the case of violations 
of section 303(q), if the person involved is a nonlicensee tower owner 
who has previously received notice of the obligations imposed by section 
303(q) from the Commission or the permittee or licensee who uses that 
tower. Paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the issuance of 
citations. When the requirements of this paragraph have been satisfied 
with respect to a particular violation by a particular person, a 
forfeiture penalty may be imposed upon such person for conduct of the 
type described in the citation without issuance of an additional 
citation.
    (e) Alternative procedures. In the discretion of the Commission, a 
forfeiture proceeding may be initiated either: (1) By issuing a notice 
of apparent liability, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, 
or (2) a notice of opportunity for hearing, in accordance with paragraph 
(g).
    (f) Notice of apparent liability. Before imposing a forfeiture 
penalty under the provisions of this paragraph, the Commission or its 
designee will issue a written notice of apparent liability.
    (1) Content of notice. The notice of apparent liability will:
    (i) Identify each specific provision, term, or condition of any act, 
rule, regulation, order, treaty, convention, or other agreement, 
license, permit, certificate, or instrument of authorization which the 
respondent has apparently violated or with which he has failed to 
comply,
    (ii) Set forth the nature of the act or omission charged against the 
respondent and the facts upon which such charge is based,
    (iii) State the date(s) on which such conduct occurred, and
    (iv) Specify the amount of the apparent forfeiture penalty.
    (2) Delivery. The notice of apparent liability will be sent to the 
respondent, by certified mail, at his last known address (see Sec. 
1.5).
    (3) Response. The respondent will be afforded a reasonable period of 
time (usually 30 days from the date of the notice) to show, in writing, 
why a forfeiture penalty should not be imposed or should be reduced, or 
to pay the forfeiture. Any showing as to why the forfeiture should not 
be imposed or should be reduced shall include a detailed factual 
statement and such documentation and affidavits as may be pertinent.
    (4) Forfeiture order. If the proposed forfeiture penalty is not paid 
in full in response to the notice of apparent liability, the Commission, 
upon considering all relevant information available to it, will issue an 
order canceling or reducing the proposed forfeiture or requiring that it 
be paid in full and stating the date by which the forfeiture must be 
paid.
    (5) Judicial enforcement of forfeiture order. If the forfeiture is 
not paid, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice for 
collection under section 504(a) of the Communications Act.
    (g) Notice of opportunity for hearing. The procedures set out in 
this paragraph will ordinarily be followed only when a hearing is being 
held for some reason other than the assessment of a forfeiture (such as, 
to determine whether a renewal application should be granted) and a 
forfeiture is to be considered as an alternative or in addition to any 
other Commission action. However, these procedures may be followed 
whenever the Commission, in its discretion, determines that they will 
better serve the ends of justice.
    (1) Before imposing a forfeiture penalty under the provisions of 
this paragraph, the Commission will issue a notice of opportunity for 
hearing. The

[[Page 128]]

hearing will be a full evidentiary hearing before an administrative law 
judge, conducted under procedures set out in subpart B of this part, 
including procedures for appeal and review of initial decisions. A final 
Commission order assessing a forfeiture under the provisions of this 
paragraph is subject to judicial review under section 402(a) of the 
Communications Act.
    (2) If, after a forfeiture penalty is imposed and not appealed or 
after a court enters final judgment in favor of the Commission, the 
forfeiture is not paid, the Commission will refer the matter to the 
Department of Justice for collection. In an action to recover the 
forfeiture, the validity and appropriateness of the order imposing the 
forfeiture are not subject to review.
    (3) Where the possible assessment of a forfeiture is an issue in a 
hearing case to determine which pending application should be granted, 
and the applicant facing a potential forfeiture is dismissed pursuant to 
a settlement agreement or otherwise, and the presiding judge has not 
made a determination on the forfeiture issue, the order of dismissal 
shall be forwarded to the attention of the full Commission. Within the 
time provided by Sec. 1.117, the Commission may, on its own motion, 
proceed with a determination of whether a forfeiture against the 
dismissing applicant is warranted. If the Commission so proceeds, it 
will provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity to respond to 
the forfeiture issue (see paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and make a 
determination under the procedures outlined in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (h) Payment. The forfeiture should be paid by check or money order 
drawn to the order of the Federal Communications Commission. The 
Commission does not accept responsibility for cash payments sent through 
the mails. The check or money order should be mailed to: Federal 
Communications Commission, P.O. Box 979088, St. Louis, MO 63197-9000.
    (i) Remission and mitigation. In its discretion, the Commission, or 
its designee, may remit or reduce any forfeiture imposed under this 
section. After issuance of a forfeiture order, any request that it do so 
shall be submitted as a petition for reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 
1.106.
    (j) Effective date. Amendments to paragraph (b) of this section 
implementing Pub. L. No. 101-239 are effective December 19, 1989.

Sec. 1.85  Suspension of operator licenses.

    Whenever grounds exist for suspension of an operator license, as 
provided in Sec. 303(m) of the Communications Act, the Chief of the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, with respect to amateur and 
commercial radio operator licenses, may issue an order suspending the 
operator license. No order of suspension of any operator's license shall 
take effect until 15 days' notice in writing of the cause for the 
proposed suspension has been given to the operator licensee, who may 
make written application to the Commission at any time within the said 
15 days for a hearing upon such order. The notice to the operator 
licensee shall not be effective until actually received by him, and from 
that time he shall have 15 days in which to mail the said application. 
In

[[Page 129]]

the event that physical conditions prevent mailing of the application 
before the expiration of the 15-day period, the application shall then 
be mailed as soon as possible thereafter, accompanied by a satisfactory 
explanation of the delay. Upon receipt by the Commission of such 
application for hearing, said order of suspension shall be designated 
for hearing by the Chief, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and said 
suspension shall be held in abeyance until the conclusion of the 
hearing. Upon the conclusion of said hearing, the Commission may affirm, 
modify, or revoke said order of suspension. If the license is ordered 
suspended, the operator shall send his operator license to the Licensing 
and Technical Analysis Branch, Public Safety and Private Wireless 
Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, in Washington, DC, on or 
before the effective date of the order, or, if the effective date has 
passed at the time notice is received, the license shall be sent to the 
Commission forthwith.

Sec. 1.87  Modification of license or construction permit on motion of the Commission.

    (a) Whenever it appears that a station license or construction 
permit should be modified, the Commission shall notify the licensee or 
permittee in writing of the proposed action and reasons therefor, and 
afford the licensee or permittee at least thirty days to protest such 
proposed order of modification, except that, where safety of life or 
property is involved, the Commission may by order provide a shorter 
period of time.
    (b) The notification required in paragraph (a) of this section may 
be effectuated by a notice of proposed rule making in regard to a 
modification or addition of an FM or television channel to the Table of 
Allotments (Sec. Sec. 73.202 and 73.504) or Table of Assignments (Sec. 
73.606). The Commission shall send a copy of any such notice of proposed 
rule making to the affected licensee or permittee by certified mail, 
return receipt requested.
    (c) Any other licensee or permittee who believes that its license or 
permit would be modified by the proposed action may also protest the 
proposed action before its effective date.
    (d) Any protest filed pursuant to this section shall be subject to 
the requirements of section 309 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, for petitions to deny.
    (e) In any case where a hearing is conducted pursuant to the 
provisions of this section, both the burden of proceeding with the 
introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the 
Commission except that, with respect to any issue that pertains to the 
question of whether the proposed action would modify the license or 
permit of a person filing a protest pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, such burdens shall be as described by the Commission.
    (f) In order to utilize the right to a hearing and the opportunity 
to appear and give evidence upon the issues specified in any hearing 
order, the licensee or permittee, in person or by attorney, shall, 
within the period of time as may be specified in the hearing order, file 
with the Commission a written statement stating that he or she will 
appear at the hearing and present evidence on the matters specified in 
the hearing order.
    (g) The right to file a protest or have a hearing shall, unless good 
cause is shown in a petition to be filed not later than 5 days before 
the lapse of time specified in paragraph (a) or (f) of this section, be 
deemed waived:
    (1) In case of failure to timely file the protest as required by 
paragraph (a) of this section or a written statement as required by 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) In case of filing a written statement provided for in paragraph 
(f) of this section but failing to appear at the hearing, either in 
person or by counsel.
    (h) Where the right to file a protest or have a hearing is waived, 
the licensee or permittee will be deemed to have consented to the 
modification as proposed and a final decision may be issued by the 
Commission accordingly. Irrespective of any waiver as provided for in 
paragraph (g) of this section or failure by the licensee or permittee to 
raise a substantial and material question of fact concerning the 
proposed

[[Page 130]]

modification in his protest, the Commission may, on its own motion, 
designate the proposed modification for hearing in accordance with this 
section.
    (i) Any order of modification issued pursuant to this section shall 
include a statement of the findings and the grounds and reasons 
therefor, shall specify the effective date of the modification, and 
shall be served on the licensee or permittee.

Sec. 1.88  Predesignation pleading procedure.

    In cases where an investigation is being conducted by the Commission 
in connection with the operation of a broadcast station or a pending 
application for renewal of a broadcast license, the licensee may file a 
written statement to the Commission setting forth its views regarding 
the matters under investigation; the staff, in its discretion, may in 
writing, advise such licensee of the general nature of the 
investigation, and advise the licensee of its opportunity to submit such 
a statement to the staff. Any filing by the licensee will be forwarded 
to the Commission in conjunction with any staff memorandum recommending 
that the Commission take action as a result of the invesigation. Nothing 
in this rule shall supersede the application of our ex parte rules to 
situations described in Sec. 1.1203 of these rules.

Sec. 1.89  Notice of violations.

    (a) Except in cases of willfulness or those in which public health, 
interest, or safety requires otherwise, any person who holds a license, 
permit or other authorization appearing to have violated any provision 
of the Communications Act or any provision of this chapter will, before 
revocation, suspension, or cease and desist proceedings are instituted, 
be served with a written notice calling these facts to his or her 
attention and requesting a statement concerning the matter. FCC Form 793 
may be used for this purpose. The Notice of Violation may be combined 
with a Notice of Apparent Liability to Monetary Forfeiture. In such 
event, notwithstanding the Notice of Violation, the provisions of Sec. 
1.80 apply and not those of Sec. 1.89.
    (b) Within 10 days from receipt of notice or such other period as 
may be specified, the recipient shall send a written answer, in 
duplicate, directly to the Commission office originating the official 
notice. If an answer cannot be sent or an acknowledgment cannot be made 
within such 10-day period by reason of illness or other unavoidable 
circumstance, acknowledgment and answer shall be made at the earliest 
practicable date with a satisfactory explanation of the delay.
    (c) The answer to each notice shall be complete in itself and shall 
not be abbreviated by reference to other communications or answers to 
other notices. In every instance the answer shall contain a statement of 
action taken to correct the condition or omission complained of and to 
preclude its recurrence. In addition:
    (1) If the notice relates to violations that may be due to the 
physical or electrical characteristics of transmitting apparatus and any 
new apparatus is to be installed, the answer shall state the date such 
apparatus was ordered, the name of the manufacturer, and the promised 
date of delivery. If the installation of such apparatus requires a 
construction permit, the file number of the application shall be given, 
or if a file number has not been assigned by the Commission, such 
identification shall be given as will permit ready identification of the 
application.
    (2) If the notice of violation relates to lack of attention to or 
improper operation of the transmitter, the name and license number of 
the operator in charge (where applicable) shall be given.

Sec. 1.91  Revocation and/or cease and desist proceedings; hearings.

    (a) If it appears that a station license or construction permit 
should be revoked and/or that a cease and desist order should be issued, 
the Commission will issue an order directing the person to show cause 
why an order of revocation and/or a cease and desist order, as

[[Page 131]]

the facts may warrant, should not be issued.
    (b) An order to show cause why an order of revocation and/or a cease 
and desist order should not be issued will contain a statement of the 
matters with respect to which the Commission is inquiring and will call 
upon the person to whom it is directed (the respondent) to appear before 
the Commission at a hearing, at a time and place stated in the order, 
but not less than thirty days after the receipt of such order, and given 
evidence upon the matters specified in the order to show cause. However, 
if safety of life or property is involved, the order to show cause may 
specify a hearing date less than thirty days from the receipt of such 
order.
    (c) To avail himself of such opportunity for hearing, the 
respondent, personally or by his attorney, shall file with the 
Commission, within thirty days of the service of the order or such 
shorter period as may be specified therein, a written appearance stating 
that he will appear at the hearing and present evidence on the matters 
specified in the order. The Commission in its discretion may accept a 
late appearance. However, an appearance tendered after the specified 
time has expired will not be accepted unless accompanied by a petition 
stating with particularity the facts and reasons relied on to justify 
such late filing. Such petition for acceptance of late appearance will 
be granted only if the Commission determines that the facts and reasons 
stated therein constitute good cause for failure to file on time.
    (d) Hearings on the matters specified in such orders to show cause 
shall accord with the practice and procedure prescribed in this subpart 
and subpart B of this part, with the following exceptions: (1) In all 
such revocation and/or cease and desist hearings, the burden of 
proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof 
shall be upon the Commission; and (2) the Commission may specify in a 
show cause order, when the circumstances of the proceeding require 
expedition, a time less than that prescribed in Sec. Sec. 1.276 and 
1.277 within which the initial decision in the proceeding shall become 
effective, exceptions to such initial decision must be filed, parties 
must file requests for oral argument, and parties must file notice of 
intention to participate in oral argument.
    (e) Correction of or promise to correct the conditions or matters 
complained of in a show cause order shall not preclude the issuance of a 
cease and desist order. Corrections or promises to correct the 
conditions or matters complained of, and the past record of the 
licensee, may, however, be considered in determining whether a 
revocation and/or a cease and desist order should be issued.
    (f) Any order of revocation and/or cease and desist order issued 
after hearing pursuant to this section shall include a statement of 
findings and the grounds therefor, shall specify the effective date of 
the order, and shall be served on the person to whom such order is 
directed.

Sec. 1.92  Revocation and/or cease and desist proceedings; after waiver of hearing.

    (a) After the issuance of an order to show cause, pursuant to Sec. 
1.91, calling upon a person to appear at a hearing before the 
Commission, the occurrence of any one of the following events or 
circumstances will constitute a waiver of such hearing and the 
proceeding thereafter will be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (1) The respondent fails to file a timely written appearance as 
prescribed in Sec. 1.91(c) indicating that he will appear at a hearing 
and present evidence on the matters specified in the order.
    (2) The respondent, having filed a timely written appearance as 
prescribed in Sec. 1.91(c), fails in fact to appear in person or by his 
attorney at the time and place of the duly scheduled hearing.
    (3) The respondent files with the Commission, within the time 
specified for a written appearance in Sec. 1.91(c), a written statement 
expressly waiving his rights to a hearing.
    (b) When a hearing is waived under the provisions of paragraph (a) 
(1) or (3)

[[Page 132]]

of this section, a written statement signed by the respondent denying or 
seeking to mitigate or justify the circumstances or conduct complained 
of in the order to show cause may be submitted within the time specified 
in Sec. 1.91(c). The Commission in its discretion may accept a late 
statement. However, a statement tendered after the specified time has 
expired will not be accepted unless accompanied by a petition stating 
with particularity the facts and reasons relied on to justify such late 
filing. Such petitions for acceptance of a late statement will be 
granted only if the Commission determines that the facts and reasons 
stated therein constitute good cause for failure to file on time.
    (c) Whenever a hearing is waived by the occurrence of any of the 
events or circumstances listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge (or the presiding officer if one has been 
designated) shall, at the earliest practicable date, issue an order 
reciting the events or circumstances constituting a waiver of hearing, 
terminating the hearing proceeding, and certifying the case to the 
Commission. Such order shall be served upon the respondent.
    (d) After a hearing proceeding has been terminated pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission will act upon the matters 
specified in the order to show cause in the regular course of business. 
The Commission will determine on the basis of all the information 
available to it from any source, including such further proceedings as 
may be warranted, if a revocation order and/or a cease and desist order 
should issue, and if so, will issue such order. Otherwise, the 
Commission will issue an order dismissing the proceeding. All orders 
specified in this paragraph will include a statement of the findings of 
the Commission and the grounds and reasons therefor, will specify the 
effective date thereof, and will be served upon the respondent.
    (e) Corrections or promise to correct the conditions or matters 
complained of in a show cause order shall not preclude the issuance of a 
cease and desist order. Corrections or promises to correct the 
conditions or matters complained of, and the past record of the 
licensee, may, however, be considered in determining whether a 
revocation and/or a cease and desist order should be issued.

Sec. 1.93  Consent orders.

    (a) As used in this subpart, a ``consent order'' is a formal decree 
accepting an agreement between a party to an adjudicatory hearing 
proceeding held to determine whether that party has violated statutes or 
Commission rules or policies and the appropriate operating Bureau, with 
regard to such party's future compliance with such statutes, rules or 
policies, and disposing of all issues on which the proceeding was 
designated for hearing. The order is issued by the officer designated to 
preside at the hearing or (if no officer has been designated) by the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge.
    (b) Where the interests of timely enforcement or compliance, the 
nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit, the 
Commission, by its operating Bureaus, may negotiate a consent order with 
a party to secure future compliance with the law in exchange for prompt 
disposition of a matter subject to administrative adjudicative 
proceedings. Consent orders may not be negotiated with respect to 
matters which involve a party's basic statutory qualifications to hold a 
license (see 47 U.S.C. 308 and 309).

<R05>
Sec. 1.94  Consent order procedures.

    (a) Negotiations leading to a consent order may be initiated by the 
operating Bureau or by a party whose possible violations are issues in 
the proceeding. Negotiations may be initiated at any time after 
designation of a proceeding for hearing. If negotiations are initiated 
the presiding officer shall be notified. Parties shall be prepared at 
the initial prehearing conference to state whether they are at that time 
willing to enter negotiations. See Sec. 1.248(c)(7). If either party is 
unwilling to enter negotiations, the hearing proceeding

[[Page 133]]

shall proceed. If the parties agree to enter negotiations, they will be 
afforded an appropriate opportunity to negotiate before the hearing is 
commenced.
    (b) Other parties to the proceeding are entitled, but are not 
required, to participate in the negotiations, and may join in any 
agreement which is reached.
    (c) Every agreement shall contain the following:
    (1) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;
    (2) A waiver of the usual procedures for preparation and review of 
an initial decision;
    (3) A waiver of the right of judicial review or otherwise to 
challenge or contest the validity of the consent order;
    (4) A statement that the designation order may be used in construing 
the consent order;
    (5) A statement that the agreement shall become a part of the record 
of the proceeding only if the consent order is signed by the presiding 
officer and the time for review has passed without rejection of the 
order by the Commission;
    (6) A statement that the agreement is for purposes of settlement 
only and that its signing does not constitute an admission by any party 
of any violation of law, rules or policy (see 18 U.S.C. 6002); and
    (7) A draft order for signature of the presiding officer resolving 
by consent, and for the future, all issues specified in the designation 
order.
    (d) If agreement is reached, it shall be submitted to the presiding 
officer or Chief Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, who shall 
either sign the order, reject the agreement, or suggest to the parties 
that negotiations continue on such portion of the agreement as he 
considers unsatisfactory or on matters not reached in the agreement. If 
he rejects the agreement, the hearing shall proceed. If he suggests 
further negotiations, the hearing will proceed or negotiations will 
continue, depending on the wishes of parties to the agreement. If he 
signs the consent order, he shall close the record.
    (e) Any party to the proceeding who has not joined in any agreement 
which is reached may appeal the consent order under Sec. 1.302, and the 
Commission may review the agreement on its own motion under the 
provisions of that section. If the Commission rejects the consent order, 
the proceeding will be remanded for further proceedings. If the 
Commission does not reject the consent order, it shall be entered in the 
record as a final order and is subject to judicial review on the 
initiative only of parties to the proceeding who did not join in the 
agreement. The Commission may revise the agreement and consent order. In 
that event, private parties to the agreement may either accept the 
revision or withdraw from the agreement. If the party whose possible 
violations are issues in the proceeding withdraws from the agreement, 
the consent order will not be issued or made a part of the record, and 
the proceeding will be remanded for further proceedings.
    (f) The provisions of this section shall not alter any existing 
procedure for informal settlement of any matter prior to designation for 
hearing (see, e.g., 47 U.S.C. 208) or for summary decision after 
designation for hearing.
    (g) Consent orders, pleadings relating thereto, and Commission 
orders with respect thereto shall be served on parties to the 
proceeding. Public notice will be given of orders issued by an 
administrative law judge, the Chief Administrative Law Judge, or the 
Commission. Negotiating papers constitute work product, are available to 
parties participating in negotiations, but are not routinely available 
for public inspection.

resulting in the consent order if all of the issues in that proceeding 
had been decided against the consenting party and to any further 
sanctions for violation noted as agreed upon in the consent order. The 
Commission shall have the burden of showing that the consent order has 
been violated in some (but not in every) respect. Violation of the 
consent order and the sanctions to be

imposed shall be the only issues considered in a proceeding concerning

Sec. 1.103  Effective dates of Commission actions; finality of Commission actions.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified by law or Commission rule (e.g. 
Sec. Sec. 1.102 and 1.427), the effective date of any Commission action 
shall be the date of public notice of such action as that latter date is 
defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules: Provided, That the Commission 
may, on its own motion or on motion by any party, designate an effective 
date that is either earlier or later in time than the date of public 
notice of such action. The designation of an earlier or later effective 
date shall have no effect on any pleading periods.
    (b) Notwithstanding any determinations made under paragraph (a) of 
this section, Commission action shall be deemed final, for purposes of 
seeking reconsideration at the Commission or judicial review, on the 
date of public

<R05>
Sec. 1.104  Preserving the right of review; deferred consideration of application for review.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to all final actions taken 
pursuant to delegated authority, including final actions taken by 
members of the Commission's staff on nonhearing matters. They do not 
apply to interlocutory actions of the Chief Administrative Law Judge in 
hearing proceedings, or to hearing designation orders issued under 
delegated authority. See Sec. Sec. 0.351, 1.106(a) and 1.115(e).
    (b) Any person desiring Commission consideration of a final action 
taken pursuant to delegated authority shall file either a petition for 
reconsideration or an application for review (but not both) within 30 
days from the date of public notice of such action, as that date is 
defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules. The petition for reconsideration 
will be acted on by the designated authority or referred by such 
authority to the Commission: Provided, That a petition for 
reconsideration of an order designating a matter for hearing will in all 
cases be referred to the Commission. The application for review will in 
all cases be acted upon by the Commission.

    Note: In those cases where the Commission does not intend to release 
a document containing the full text of its action, it will state that 
fact in the public notice announcing its action.

    (c) If in any matter one party files a petition for reconsideration 
and a second party files an application for review, the Commission will 
withhold action on the application for review until final action has 
been taken on the petition for reconsideration.
    (d) Any person who has filed a petition for reconsideration may file 
an application for review within 30 days from the date of public notice 
of such action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules. 
If a petition for reconsideration has been filed, any person who has 
filed an application for review may: (1) Withdraw his application for 
review, or (2) substitute an amended application therefor.

    Note: In those cases where the Commission does not intend to release 
a document containing the full text of its action, it will state that 
fact in the public notice announcing its action.

<R05>
Sec. 1.106  Petitions for reconsideration.

    (a)(1) Petitions requesting reconsideration of a final Commission 
action will be acted on by the Commission. Petitions requesting 
reconsideration of other final actions taken pursuant to delegated 
authority will be acted on by the designated authority or referred by 
such authority to the Commission. A petition for reconsideration of an 
order designating a case for hearing will be entertained if, and insofar 
as, the petition relates to an adverse ruling with respect to 
petitioner's participation in the proceeding. Petitions for 
reconsideration of other interlocutory actions will not be entertained. 
(For provisions governing reconsideration of Commission action in notice 
and comment rule making proceedings, see Sec. 1.429. This Sec. 1.106 
does not govern reconsideration of such actions.)
    (2) Within the period allowed for filing a petition for 
reconsideration, any party to the proceeding may request the presiding 
officer to certify to the Commission the question as to whether, on 
policy in effect at the time of designation or adopted since 
designation, and undisputed facts, a hearing should be held. If the 
presiding officer finds that there is substantial doubt, on established 
policy and undisputed facts, that a hearing should be held, he will 
certify the policy question to the Commission with a statement to that 
effect. No appeal may be filed from an order denying such a request. See 
also, Sec. Sec. 1.229 and 1.251.
    (b)(1) Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, any party to the proceeding, or any other person whose 
interests are adversely affected by any action taken by

[[Page 136]]

the Commission or by the designated authority, may file a petition 
requesting reconsideration of the action taken. If the petition is filed 
by a person who is not a party to the proceeding, it shall state with 
particularity the manner in which the person's interests are adversely 
affected by the action taken, and shall show good reason why it was not 
possible for him to participate in the earlier stages of the proceeding.
    (2) Where the Commission has denied an application for review, a 
petition for reconsideration will be entertained only if one or more of 
the following circumstances is present:
    (i) The petition relies on facts which relate to events which have 
occurred or circumstances which have changed since the last opportunity 
to present such matters; or
    (ii) The petition relies on facts unknown to petitioner until after 
his last opportunity to present such matters which could not, through 
the exercise of ordinary diligence, have been learned prior to such 
opportunity.
    (3) A petition for reconsideration of an order denying an 
application for review which fails to rely on new facts or changed 
circumstances may be dismissed by the staff as repetitious.
    (c) A petition for reconsideration which relies on facts not 
previously presented to the Commission or to the designated authority 
may be granted only under the following circumstances:
    (1) The facts fall within one or more of the categories set forth in 
Sec. 1.106(b)(2); or
    (2) The Commission or the designated authority determines that 
consideration of the facts relied on is required in the public interest.
    (d)(1) The petition shall state with particularity the respects in 
which petitioner believes the action taken by the Commission or the 
designated authority should be changed. The petition shall state 
specifically the form or relief sought and, subject to this requirement, 
may contain alternative requests.
    (2) The petition for reconsideration shall also, where appropriate, 
cite the findings of fact and/or conclusions of law which petitioner 
believes to be erroneous, and shall state with particularity the 
respects in which he believes such findings and conclusions should be 
changed. The petition may request that additional findings of fact and 
conclusions of law be made.
    (e) Where a petition for reconsideration is based upon a claim of 
electrical interference, under appropriate rules in this chapter, to an 
existing station or a station for which a construction permit is 
outstanding, such petition, in addition to meeting the other 
requirements of this section, must be accompanied by an affidavit of a 
qualified radio engineer. Such affidavit shall show, either by following 
the procedures set forth in this chapter for determining interference in 
the absence of measurements, or by actual measurements made in 
accordance with the methods prescribed in this chapter, that electrical 
interference will be caused to the station within its normally protected 
contour.
    (f) The petition for reconsideration and any supplement thereto 
shall be filed within 30 days from the date of public notice of the 
final Commission action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of 
these rules, and shall be served upon parties to the proceeding. The 
petition for reconsideration shall not exceed 25 double spaced 
typewritten pages. No supplement or addition to a petition for 
reconsideration which has not been acted upon by the Commission or by 
the designated authority, filed after expiration of the 30 day period, 
will be considered except upon leave granted upon a separate pleading 
for leave to file, which shall state the grounds therefor.
    (g) Oppositions to a petition for reconsideration shall be filed 
within 10 days after the petition is filed, and shall be served upon 
petitioner and parties to the proceeding. Oppositions shall not exceed 
25 double spaced typewritten pages.
    (h) Petitioner may reply to oppositions within seven days after the 
last day for filing oppositions, and any such reply shall be served upon 
parties to the proceeding. Replies shall not exceed 10 double spaced 
typewritten pages, and shall be limited to matters raised in the 
opposition.

[[Page 137]]

    (i) Petitions for reconsideration, oppositions, and replies shall 
conform to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.49, 1.51, and 1.52 and shall 
be submitted to the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, D.C., 20554.
    (j) The Commission or designated authority may grant the petition 
for reconsideration in whole or in part or may deny the petition. Its 
order will contain a concise statement of the reasons for the action 
taken. Where the petition for reconsideration relates to an instrument 
of authorization granted without hearing, the Commission or designated 
authority will take such action within 90 days after the petition is 
filed.
    (k)(1) If the Commission or the designated authority grants the 
petition for reconsideration in whole or in part, it may, in its 
decision:
    (i) Simultaneously reverse or modify the order from which 
reconsideration is sought;
    (ii) Remand the matter to a bureau or other Commission personnel for 
such further proceedings, including rehearing, as may be appropriate; or
    (iii) Order such other proceedings as may be necessary or 
appropriate.
    (2) If the Commission or designated authority initiates further 
proceedings, a ruling on the merits of the matter will be deferred 
pending completion of such proceedings. Following completion of such 
further proceedings, the Commission or designated authority may affirm, 
reverse, or modify its original order, or it may set aside the order and 
remand the matter for such further proceedings, including rehearing, as 
may be appropriate.
    (3) Any order disposing of a petition for reconsideration which 
reverses or modifies the original order is subject to the same 
provisions with respect to reconsideration as the original order. In no 
event, however, shall a ruling which denies a petition for 
reconsideration be considered a modification of the original order. A 
petition for reconsideration of an order which has been previously 
denied on reconsideration may be dismissed by the staff as repetitious.

    Note: For purposes of this section, the word ``order'' refers to 
that portion of its action wherein the Commission announces its 
judgment. This should be distinguished from the ``memorandum opinion'' 
or other material which often accompany and explain the order.

    (l) No evidence other than newly discovered evidence, evidence which 
has become available only since the original taking of evidence, or 
evidence which the Commission or the designated authority believes 
should have been taken in the original proceeding shall be taken on any 
rehearing ordered pursuant to the provisions of this section.
    (m) The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a condition 
precedent to judicial review of any action taken by the Commission or by 
the designated authority, except where the person seeking such review 
was not a party to the proceeding resulting in the action, or relies on 
questions of fact or law upon which the Commission or designated 
authority has been afforded no opportunity to pass. (See Sec. 
1.115(c).) Persons in those categories who meet the requirements of this 
section may qualify to seek judicial review by filing a petition for 
reconsideration.
    (n) Without special order of the Commission, the filing of a 
petition for reconsideration shall not excuse any person from complying 
with or obeying any decision, order, or requirement of the Commission, 
or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof. 
However, upon good cause shown, the Commission will stay the 
effectiveness of its order or requirement pending a decision on the 
petition for reconsideration. (This paragraph applies only to actions of 
the Commission en banc. For provisions applicable to actions under 
delegated authority, see Sec. 1.102.)
    (o) Petitions for reconsideration of licensing actions, as well as 
oppositions and replies thereto, that are filed with respect to the 
Wireless Radio Services, may be filed electronically via ULS.

    The Commission may, on its own motion, set aside any action made or 
taken by it within 30 days from the date of public notice of such 
action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules.

(Secs. 4, 303, 307, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082, 1083; 47 U.S.C.

Sec. 1.110  Partial grants; rejection and designation for hearing.

    Where the Commission without a hearing grants any application in 
part, or with any privileges, terms, or conditions other than those 
requested, or subject to any interference that may result to a station 
if designated application or applications are subsequently granted, the 
action of the Commission shall be considered as a grant of such 
application unless the applicant shall, within 30 days from the date on 
which such grant is made or from its effective date if a later date is 
specified, file with the Commission a written request rejecting the 
grant as made. Upon receipt of such request, the Commission will vacate 
its original action upon the application and set the application for 
hearing in the same manner as other applications are set for hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1.113  Action modified or set aside by person, panel, or board.

    (a) Within 30 days after public notice has been given of any action 
taken pursuant to delegated authority, the person, panel, or board 
taking the action may modify or set it aside on its own motion.
    (b) Within 60 days after notice of any sanction imposed under 
delegated authority has been served on the person affected, the person, 
panel, or board which imposed the sanction may modify or set it aside on 
its own motion.
    (c) Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review shall 
be directed to the actions as thus modified, and the time for filing 
such pleadings shall be computed from the date upon which public notice 
of the modified action is given or notice of the modified sanction is 
served on the person affected.


<R05>
Sec. 1.115  Application for review of action taken pursuant to delegated authority.

    (a) Any person aggrieved by any action taken pursuant to delegated 
authority may file an application requesting review of that action by 
the Commission. Any person filing an application for review who has not 
previously participated in the proceeding shall include with his 
application a statement describing with particularity the manner in 
which he is aggrieved by the action taken and showing good reason why it 
was not possible for him to participate in the earlier stages of the 
proceeding. Any application for review which fails to make an adequate 
showing in this respect will be dismissed.
    (b)(1) The application for review shall concisely and plainly state 
the questions presented for review with reference, where appropriate, to 
the findings of fact or conclusions of law.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the 
application for review shall specify with particularity, from among the 
following, the factor(s) which warrant Commission consideration of the 
questions presented:
    (i) The action taken pursuant to delegated authority is in conflict 
with statute, regulation, case precedent, or established Commission 
policy.
    (ii) The action involves a question of law or policy which has not 
previously been resolved by the Commission.
    (iii) The action involves application of a precedent or policy which 
should be overturned or revised.
    (iv) An erroneous finding as to an important or material question of 
fact.
    (v) Prejudicial procedural error.
    (3) The application for review shall state with particularity the 
respects in which the action taken by the designated authority should be 
changed.
    (4) The application for review shall state the form of relief sought 
and, subject to this requirement, may contain alternative requests.
    (c) No application for review will be granted if it relies on 
questions of fact

[[Page 139]]

or law upon which the designated authority has been afforded no 
opportunity to pass.

    Note: Subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.106, new questions of 
fact or law may be presented to the designated authority in a petition 
for reconsideration.

    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
application for review and any supplemental thereto shall be filed 
within 30 days of public notice of such action, as that date is defined 
in section 1.4(b). Opposition to the application shall be filed within 
15 days after the application for review is filed. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, replies to oppositions shall be filed 
within 10 days after the opposition is filed and shall be limited to 
matters raised in the opposition.
    (e)(1) Applications for review of interlocutory rulings made by the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge (see Sec. 0.351) shall be deferred until 
the time when exceptions are filed unless the Chief Judge certifies the 
matter to the Commission for review. A matter shall be certified to the 
Commission only if the Chief Judge determines that it presents a new or 
novel question of law or policy and that the ruling is such that error 
would be likely to require remand should the appeal be deferred and 
raised as an exception. The request to certify the matter to the 
Commission shall be filed within 5 days after the ruling is made. The 
application for review shall be filed within 5 days after the order 
certifying the matter to the Commission is released or such ruling is 
made. Oppositions shall be filed within 5 days after the application is 
filed. Replies to oppositions shall be filed only if they are requested 
by the Commission. Replies (if allowed) shall be filed within 5 days 
after they are requested. A ruling certifying or not certifying a matter 
to the Commission is final: Provided, however, That the Commission may, 
on its own motion, dismiss the application for review on the ground that 
objections to the ruling should be deferred and raised as an exception.
    (2) The failure to file an application for review of an 
interlocutory ruling made by the Chief Administrative Law Judge or the 
denial of such application by the Commission, shall not preclude any 
party entitled to file exceptions to the initial decision from 
requesting review of the ruling at the time when exceptions are filed. 
Such requests will be considered in the same manner as exceptions are 
considered.
    (3) Applications for review of a hearing designation order issued 
under delegated authority shall be deferred until exceptions to the 
initial decision in the case are filed, unless the presiding 
Administrative Law Judge certifies such an application for review to the 
Commission. A matter shall be certified to the Commission only if the 
presiding Administrative Law Judge determines that the matter involves a 
controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for 
difference of opinion and that immediate consideration of the question 
would materially expedite the ultimate resolution of the litigation. A 
ruling refusing to certify a matter to the Commission is not appealable. 
In addition, the Commission may dismiss, without stating reasons, an 
application for review that has been certified, and direct that the 
objections to the hearing designation order be deferred and raised when 
exceptions in the initial decision in the case are filed. A request to 
certify a matter to the Commission shall be filed with the presiding 
Administrative Law Judge within 5 days after the designation order is 
released. Any application for review authorized by the Administrative 
Law Judge shall be filed within 5 days after the order certifying the 
matter to the Commission is released or such a ruling is made. 
Oppositions shall be filed within 5 days after the application for 
review is filed. Replies to oppositions shall be filed only if they are 
requested by the Commission. Replies (if allowed) shall be filed within 
5 days after they are requested.
    (4) Applications for review of final staff decisions issued on 
delegated authority in formal complaint proceedings on the Enforcement 
Bureau's Accelerated Docket (see, e.g., Sec. 1.730) shall be filed 
within 15 days of public notice of the decision, as that date is defined 
in Sec. 1.4(b). These applications for review oppositions and replies 
in Accelerated Docket proceedings shall

[[Page 140]]

be served on parties to the proceeding by hand or facsimile 
transmission.
    (f) Applications for review, oppositions, and replies shall conform 
to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.49, 1.51, and 1.52, and shall be 
submitted to the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC 20554. Except as provided below, applications for review 
and oppositions thereto shall not exceed 25 double-space typewritten 
pages. Applications for review of interlocutory actions in hearing 
proceedings (including designation orders) and oppositions thereto shall 
not exceed 5 double-spaced typewritten pages. When permitted (see 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section), reply pleadings shall not exceed 5 
double-spaced typewritten pages. The application for review shall be 
served upon the parties to the proceeding. Oppositions to the 
application for review shall be served on the person seeking review and 
on parties to the proceeding. When permitted (see paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section), replies to the opposition(s) to the application for 
review shall be served on the person(s) opposing the application for 
review and on parties to the proceeding.
    (g) The Commission may grant the application for review in whole or 
in part, or it may deny the application with or without specifying 
reasons therefor. A petition requesting reconsideration of a ruling 
which denies an application for review will be entertained only if one 
or more of the following circumstances is present:
    (1) The petition relies on facts which related to events which have 
occurred or circumstances which have changed since the last opportunity 
to present such matters; or
    (2) The petition relies on facts unknown to petitioner until after 
his last opportunity to present such matters which could not, through 
the exercise of ordinary diligence, have been learned prior to such 
opportunity.
    (h)(1) If the Commission grants the application for review in whole 
or in part, it may, in its decision:
    (i) Simultaneously reverse or modify the order from which review is 
sought;
    (ii) Remand the matter to the designated authority for 
reconsideration in accordance with its instructions, and, if an 
evidentiary hearing has been held, the remand may be to the person(s) 
who conducted the hearing; or
    (iii) Order such other proceedings, including briefs and oral 
argument, as may be necessary or appropriate.
    (2) In the event the Commission orders further proceedings, it may 
stay the effect of the order from which review is sought. (See Sec. 
1.102.) Following the completion of such further proceedings the 
Commission may affirm, reverse or modify the order from which review is 
sought, or it may set aside the order and remand the matter to the 
designated authority for reconsideration in accordance with its 
instructions. If an evidentiary hearing has been held, the Commission 
may remand the matter to the person(s) who conducted the hearing for 
rehearing on such issues and in accordance with such instructions as may 
be appropriate.

    Note: For purposes of this section, the word ``order'' refers to 
that portion of its action wherein the Commission announces its 
judgment. This should be distinguished from the ``memorandum opinion'' 
or other material which often accompany and explain the order.

    (i) An order of the Commission which reverses or modifies the action 
taken pursuant to delegated authority is subject to the same provisions 
with respect to reconsideration as an original order of the Commission. 
In no event, however, shall a ruling which denies an application for 
review be considered a modification of the action taken pursuant to 
delegated authority.
    (j) No evidence other than newly discovered evidence, evidence which 
has become available only since the original taking of evidence, or 
evidence which the Commission believes should have been taken in the 
original proceeding shall be taken on any rehearing ordered pursuant to 
the provisions of this section.
    (k) The filing of an application for review shall be a condition 
precedent to

[[Page 141]]

judicial review of any action taken pursuant to delegated authority.

Sec. 1.117  Review on motion of the Commission.

    (a) Within 40 days after public notice is given of any action taken 
pursuant to delegated authority, the Commission may on its own motion 
order the record of the proceeding before it for review.
    (b) If the Commission reviews the proceeding on its own motion, it 
may order such further procedure as may be useful to it in its review of 
the action taken pursuant to delegated authority.
    (c) With or without such further procedure, the Commission may 
either affirm, reverse, modify, or set aside the action taken, or remand 
the proceeding to the designated authority for reconsideration in 
accordance with its instructions. If an evidentiary hearing has been 
held, the Commission may remand the proceeding to the person(s) who 
conducted the hearing for rehearing on such issues and in accordance 
with such instructions as may be appropriate. An order of the Commission 
which reverses or modifies the action taken pursuant to delegated 
authority, or remands the matter for further proceedings, is subject to 
the same provisions with respect to reconsideration as an original 
action of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1.120  Protests of grants without hearing.

    (a) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any 
application: (1) Filed on or after December 12, 1960; (2) filed before 
December 12, 1960, but substantially amended (as defined in the 
applicable provisions of this chapter) on or after that date; or (3) 
filed before December 12, 1960, and not thereafter substantially 
amended, but with respect to which the rules in this chapter provide an 
opportunity for petitions to deny to be filed under section 309 of the 
Communications Act, as amended. See Sec. Sec. 1.580 and 1.962.
    (b) Where any instrument of authorization for a radio station, other 
than a license pursuant to a construction permit, has been granted 
without a hearing, any party in interest may file a protest directed to 
such grant and request a hearing on the application granted. Such 
protest shall be signed by the protestant and subscribed to under oath. 
Such protest must be filed with the Commission within 30 days after 
release of the document containing the full text of such action, or in 
case such a document is not released, after release of a ``Public 
Notice'' announcing the action in question and must separately set 
forth:
    (1) Such allegations of fact as will show the protestant to be a 
party in interest, i.e., a person aggrieved or whose interests are 
adversely affected by the Commission's authorization, protest of which 
is sought. Each such allegation of fact shall be separately stated.
    (2) Facts indicating the reasons why the grant was improperly made 
or would otherwise not be in the public interest. Each such reason shall 
be separately stated, and facts in support thereof shall be specified in 
detail and shall not include general non-specific conclusory arguments 
and allegations.
    (3) The specific issues upon which protestant wishes a hearing to be 
held, which issues must relate directly to a matter specified with 
particularity as part of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Arguments and citations of authority may be set forth in a brief 
accompanying the protest but must be excluded from the protest itself.
    (d) Oppositions to protests and briefs in support thereof shall 
contain all material, including that pertinent to the determination 
referred to in paragraph (i) of this section, deemed appropriate to the 
Commission's resolution of the protest. Such oppositions and supporting 
briefs must be filed within 10 days after the filing of such protest, 
and any replies to such oppositions must be filed within 5 days after 
the filing of the oppositions.
    (e) Protests, oppositions, and replies shall be filed with the 
Commission in

[[Page 142]]

original and 14 copies and shall be accompanied by proof of service upon 
the grantee or the protestant, as the case may be, and/or their 
respective attorneys.
    (f) The Commission may upon consideration of a protest direct either 
the protestant or grantee or both to submit further statements of fact 
under oath relating to the matters raised in the protest.
    (g) Within 30 days from the date of the filing of the protest, the 
Commission will enter findings as to whether such protest meets the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section. If 
the Commission finds that one of these requirements is not met, it will 
dismiss the protest. If the Commission finds that these requirements are 
met, it will designate the application in question for hearing. As to 
issues which the Commission believes present no grounds for setting 
aside the grant, even if the facts alleged were to be proven, the 
Commission may designate such issues for oral argument only. The other 
issues will be designated for evidentiary hearing except that the 
Commission may redraft the issues in accordance with the facts or 
substantive matters alleged in the protest and may also specify such 
additional issues as it deems desirable. In any evidentiary hearing 
subsequently held upon issues specified by the Commission, upon its own 
initiative or adopted by it, both the burden of proceeding with the 
introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the 
grantee. With respect to issues resulting from facts set forth in the 
protest and not adopted or specified by the Commission on its own 
motion, both the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence 
and the burden of proof shall be upon the protestant.
    (h) The procedure in such protest hearing shall be governed by the 
provisions of subpart B of this part, except as otherwise provided in 
this section.
    (i) Pending hearing and decision, the effective date of the 
Commission's action to which protest is made shall be postponed to the 
effective date of the Commission's decision after hearing, unless the 
authorization involved is necessary to the maintenance or conduct of an 
existing service or unless the Commission affirmatively finds that the 
public interest requires that the grant remain in effect, in which event 
the Commission shall authorize the applicant to utilize the facilities 
or authorization in question pending the Commission's decision after 
hearing.

                         Participants and Issues


<R05>
Sec. 1.221  Notice of hearing; appearances.

    (a) Upon designation of an application for hearing, the Commission 
issues an order containing the following:
    (1) A statement as to the reasons for the Commission's action.
    (2) A statement as to the matters of fact and law involved, and the 
issues upon which the application will be heard.
    (3) A statement as to the time, place, and nature of the hearing. 
(If the time and place are not specified, the order will indicate that 
the time and place will be specified at a later date.)
    (4) A statement as to the legal authority and jurisdiction under 
which the hearing is to be held.
    (b) The order designating an application for hearing is mailed to 
the applicant by the Reference Information Center of the Consumer and 
Governmental Affairs Bureau and this order or a summary thereof is 
published in the Federal Register. Reasonable notice of hearing will be 
given to the parties in all proceedings; and, whenever possible, the 
Commission will give at least 60 days notice of comparative hearings.
    (c) In order to avail himself of the opportunity to be heard, the 
applicant, in person or by his attorney, shall, within 20 days of the 
mailing of the notice of designation for hearing by the Reference 
Information Center of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, file 
with the Commission, in triplicate, a written appearance stating

[[Page 144]]

that he will appear of the date fixed for hearing and present evidence 
on the issues specified in the order. Where an applicant fails to file 
such a written appearance within the time specified, or has not filed 
prior to the expiration of that time a petition to dismiss without 
prejudice, or a petition to accept, for good cause shown, such written 
appearance beyond expiration of said 20 days, the application will be 
dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute.
    (d) The Commission will on its own motion name as parties to the 
hearing any person found to be a party in interest.
    (e) In order to avail himself of the opportunity to be heard, any 
person named as a party pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall, 
within 20 days of the mailing of the notice of his designation as a 
party, file with the Commission, in person or by attorney, a written 
appearance in triplicate, stating that he will appear at the hearing. 
Any person so named who fails to file this written statement within the 
time specified, shall, unless good cause for such failure is shown, 
forfeit his hearing rights.
    (f)(1) A fee must accompany each written appearance filed with the 
Commission in certain cases designated for hearing. See subpart G, part 
1 for the amount due. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section, the fee must accompany each written appearance at the time of 
its filing and must be in conformance with the requirements of subpart G 
of the rules. A written appearance that does not contain the proper fee, 
or is not accompanied by a deferral request as per Sec. 1.1115 of the 
rules, shall be dismissed and returned to the applicant by the fee 
processing staff. The presiding judge will be notified of this action 
and may dismiss the applicant with prejudice for failure to prosecute if 
the written appearance is not resubmitted with the correct fee within 
the original 20 day filing period.

    Note: If the parties file a settlement agreement prior to filing the 
Notice of Appearance or simultaneously with it, the hearing fee need not 
accompany the Notice of Appearance. In filing the Notice of Appearance, 
the applicant should clearly indicate that a settlement agreement has 
been filed. (The fact that there are ongoing negotiations that may lead 
to a settlement does not affect the requirement to pay the fee.) If a 
settlement agreement is not effectuated, the Presiding Judge will 
require immediate payment of the fee.

    (2) When a fee is required to accompany a written appearance as 
described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the written appearance 
must also contain FCC Registration Number (FRN) in conformance with 
subpart W of this part. The presiding judge will notify the party filing 
the appearance of the omitted FRN and dismiss the applicant with 
prejudice for failure to prosecute if the written appearance is not 
resubmitted with the FRN within ten (10) business days of the date of 
notification.
    (g) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving applicants for 
new facilities, where the hearing fee was paid before designation of the 
applications for hearing as required by the Public Notice described at 
Sec. 73.3571(c), Sec. 73.3572(d), or Sec. 73.3573(g) of this chapter, 
a hearing fee payment should not be made with the filing of the Notice 
of Appearance.

Sec. 1.223  Petitions to intervene.

    (a) Where, in cases involving applications for construction permits 
and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, the 
Commission has failed to notify and name as a party to the hearing any 
person who qualifies as a party in interest, such person may acquire the 
status of a party by filing, under oath and not more than 30 days after 
the publication in the Federal Register of the hearing issues or any 
substantial amendment thereto, a petition for intervention showing the 
basis of its interest. Where such person's interest is based upon a 
claim that a grant of the application would cause objectionable 
interference under applicable provisions of this chapter to such person 
as a licensee or permittee of an existing or authorized station, the 
petition to intervene must be accompanied

[[Page 145]]

by an affidavit of a qualified radio engineer which shall show, either 
by following the procedures prescribed in this chapter for determining 
interference in the absence of measurements or by actual measurements 
made in accordance with the methods prescribed in this chapter, the 
extent of such interference. Where the person's status as a party in 
interest is established, the petition to intervene will be granted.
    (b) Any other person desiring to participate as a party in any 
hearing may file a petition for leave to intervene not later than 30 
days after the publication in the Federal Register of the full text or a 
summary of the order designating an application for hearing or any 
substantial amendment thereto. The petition must set forth the interest 
of petitioner in the proceedings, must show how such petitioner's 
participation will assist the Commission in the determination of the 
issues in question, must set forth any proposed issues in addition to 
those already designated for hearing, and must be accompanied by the 
affidavit of a person with knowledge as to the facts set forth in the 
petition. The presiding officer, in his discretion, may grant or deny 
such petition or may permit intervention by such persons limited to a 
particular stage of the proceeding.
    (c) Any person desiring to file a petition for leave to intervene 
later than 30 days after the publication in the Federal Register of the 
full text or a summary of the order designating an application for 
hearing or any substantial amendment thereto shall set forth the 
interest of petitioner in the proceeding, show how such petitioner's 
participation will assist the Commission in the determination of the 
issues in question, must set forth any proposed issues in addition to 
those already designated for hearing, and must set forth reasons why it 
was not possible to file a petition within the time prescribed by 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Such petition shall be 
accompanied by the affidavit of a person with knowledge of the facts set 
forth in the petition, and where petitioner claims that a grant of the 
application would cause objectionable interference under applicable 
provisions of this chapter, the petition to intervene must be 
accompanied by the affidavit of a qualified radio engineer showing the 
extent of such alleged interference according to the methods prescribed 
in paragraph (a) of this section. If, in the opinion of the presiding 
officer, good cause is shown for the delay in filing, he may in his 
discretion grant such petition or may permit intervention limited to 
particular issues or to a particular stage of the proceeding.

Sec. 1.224  Motion to proceed in forma pauperis.

    (a) A motion to proceed in forma pauperis may be filed by an 
individual, a corporation, and unincorporated entity, an association or 
other similar group, if the moving party is either of the following:
    (1) A respondent in a revocation proceeding, or a renewal applicant, 
who cannot carry on his livelihood without the radio license at stake in 
the proceeding; or
    (2) An intervenor in a hearing proceeding who is in a position to 
introduce testimony which is of probable decisional significance, on a 
matter of substantial public interest importance, which cannot, or 
apparently will not, be introduced by other parties to the proceeding, 
and who is not seeking personal financial gain.
    (b) In the case of a licensee, the motion to proceed in forma 
pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show 
that the moving party is eligible under paragraph (a) of this section 
and that he cannot, because of his poverty, pay the expenses of 
litigation and still be able to provide himself and his dependents with 
the necessities of life. Such allegations of fact shall be supported by 
affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The 
information submitted shall detail the income and assets of the 
individual and his financial obligations and responsibilities, and shall 
contain an estimate of the cost of participation in

[[Page 146]]

the proceeding. Personal financial information may be submitted to the 
presiding officer in confidence.
    (c)(1) In the case of an individual intervenor, the motion to 
proceed in forma pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact 
sufficient to show that he is eligible under paragraph (a) of this 
section and that he has dedicated financial resources to sustain his 
participation which are reasonable in light of his personal resources 
and other demands upon them but are inadequate for effective 
participation in the proceeding. Such allegations of fact shall be 
supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge 
thereof. The information submitted shall detail the income and assets of 
the individual and his immediate family and his financial obligations 
and responsibilities, and shall contain an estimate of the cost of 
participation. Personal financial information may be submitted to the 
presiding officer in confidence.
    (2) In the case of an intervening group, the motion to proceed in 
forma pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to 
show that the moving party is eligible under paragraph (a) of this 
section and that it cannot pay the expenses of litigation and still be 
able to carry out the activities and purposes for which it was 
organized. Such allegations of fact shall be supported by affidavit of 
the President and Treasurer of the group, and/or by other persons having 
personal knowledge thereof. The information submitted shall include a 
copy of the corporate charter or other documents that describe the 
activities and purposes of the organization; a current balance sheet and 
profit and loss statement; facts showing, under all the circumstances, 
that it would not be reasonable to expect added resources of individuals 
composing the group to be pooled to meet the expenses of participating 
in the proceeding; and an estimate of the cost of participation. 
Personal financial information pertaining to members of the group may be 
submitted to the presiding officer in confidence.
    (d) If the motion is granted, the presiding officer may direct that 
a free copy of the transcript of testimony be made available to the 
moving party and may relax the rules of procedure in any manner which 
will ease his financial burden, is fair to other parties to the 
proceeding, and does not involve the payment of appropriated funds to a 
party.

<R05>
Sec. 1.225  Participation by non-parties; consideration of communications.

    (a) Any person who wishes to appear and give evidence on any matter 
and who so advises the Secretary, will be notified by the Secretary if 
that matter is designated for hearing. In the case of requests bearing 
more than one signature, notice of hearing will be given to the person 
first signing unless the request indicates that such notice should be 
sent to someone other than such person.
    (b) No person shall be precluded from giving any relevant, material, 
and competent testimony at a hearing because he lacks a sufficient 
interest to justify his intervention as a party in the matter.
    (c) When a hearing is held, no communication will be considered in 
determining the merits of any matter unless it has been received into 
evidence. The admissibility of any communication shall be governed by 
the applicable rules of evidence, and no communication shall be 
admissible on the basis of a stipulation unless Commission counsel as 
well as counsel for all of the parties shall join in such stipulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.227  Consolidations.

    (a) The Commission, upon motion or upon its own motion, will, where 
such action will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to 
the ends of justice, consolidate for hearing:
    (1) Any cases which involve the same applicant or involve 
substantially the same issues, or
    (2) Any applications which present conflicting claims, except where 
a random selection process is used.
    (b)(1) In broadcast cases, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section, and except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1601, et seq., 
no application will be consolidated for hearing with a previously filed 
application or applications unless such application, or such

[[Page 147]]

application as amended, if amended so as to require a new file number, 
is substantially complete and tendered for filing by the close of 
business on the day preceding the day designated by Public Notice as the 
day any one of the previously filed applications is available and ready 
for processing.
    (2) In other than broadcast, common carrier, and safety and special 
radio services cases, any application that is mutually exclusive with 
another application or applications already designated for hearing will 
be consolidated for hearing with such other application or applications 
only if the later application in question has been filed within 5 days 
after public notice has been given in the Federal Register of the 
Commission's order which first designated for hearing the prior 
application or applications with which such application is in conflict.
    (3) Common carrier cases: (i) General rule. Where an application is 
mutually exclusive with a previously filed application, the second 
application will be entitled to comparative consideration with the first 
or entitled to be included in a random selection process, only if the 
second has been properly filed at least one day before the Commission 
takes action on the first application. Specifically, the later filed 
application must have been received by the Commission, in a condition 
acceptable for filing, before the close of business on the day prior to 
the grant date or designation date of the earlier filed application.
    (ii) Domestic public fixed and public mobile. See Rule Sec. 21.31 
of this chapter for the requirements as to mutually exclusive 
applications. See also Rule Sec. 21.23 of this chapter for the 
requirements as to amendments of applications.
    (iii) Public coast stations (Maritime mobile service). See paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section.
    (4) This paragraph applies when mutually exclusive applications 
subject to section 309(b) of the Communications Act and not subject to 
competitive bidding procedures pursuant to Sec. 1.2102 of this chapter 
are filed in the Private Radio Services, or when there are more such 
applications for initial licenses than can be accommodated on available 
frequencies. Except for applications filed under part 101, subparts H 
and O, Private Operational Fixed Microwave Service, and applications for 
high seas public coast stations (see Sec. Sec. 80.122(b)(1) (first 
sentence), 80.357, 80.361, 80.363(a)(2), 80.371(a), (b), and (d), and 
Sec. 80.374 of this chapter) mutual exclusivity will occur if the later 
application or applications are received by the Commission's offices in 
Gettysburg, PA (or St. Louis, Missouri for applications requiring the 
fees set forth at part 1, subpart G of the rules) in a condition 
acceptable for filing within 30 days after the release date of public 
notice listing the first prior filed application (with which subsequent 
applications are in conflict) as having been accepted for filing or 
within such other period as specified by the Commission. For 
applications in the Private Operational Fixed Microwave Service, mutual 
exclusivity will occur if two or more acceptable applications that are 
in conflict are filed on the same day. Applications for high seas public 
coast stations will be processed on a first come, first served basis, 
with the first acceptable application cutting off the filing rights of 
subsequent, conflicting applications. Applications for high seas public 
coast stations received on the same day will be treated as 
simultaneously filed and, if granting more than one would result in 
harmful interference, must be resolved through settlement or technical 
amendment.
    (5) Any mutually exclusive application filed after the date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this 
section will be dismissed without prejudice and will be eligible for 
refiling only after a final decision is rendered by the Commission with 
respect to the prior application or applications or after such 
application or applications are dismissed or removed from the hearing 
docket.
    (6) An application which is mutually exclusive with an application 
for renewal of license of a broadcast station filed on or before May 1, 
1995 will be designated for comparative hearing with such license 
renewal application

[[Page 148]]

if it is substantially complete and tendered for filing no later than 
the date prescribed in Sec. 73.3516(e).

Sec. 1.229  Motions to enlarge, change, or delete issues.

    (a) A motion to enlarge, change or delete the issues may be filed by 
any party to a hearing. Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this 
section, such motions must be filed within 15 days after the full text 
or a summary of the order designating the case for hearing has been 
published in the Federal Register.
    (b)(1) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving applicants for 
only new facilities, such motions shall be filed within 30 days of the 
release of the designation order, except that persons not named as 
parties to the proceeding in the designation order may file such motions 
with their petitions to intervene up to 30 days after publication of the 
full text or a summary of the designation order in the Federal Register. 
(See Sec. 1.223 of this part).
    (2) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving renewal 
applicants, such motions shall be filed within 30 days after publication 
of the full text or a summary of the designation order in the Federal 
Register.
    (3) Any person desiring to file a motion to modify the issues after 
the expiration of periods specified in paragraphs (a), (b)(1), and 
(b)(2), of this section, shall set forth the reason why it was not 
possible to file the motion within the prescribed period. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the motion will be granted 
only if good cause is shown for the delay in filing. Motions for 
modifications of issues which are based on new facts or newly discovered 
facts shall be filed within 15 days after such facts are discovered by 
the moving party.
    (c) In the absence of good cause for late filing of a motion to 
modify the issues, the motion to enlarge will be considered fully on its 
merits if (and only if) initial examination of the motion demonstrates 
that it raises a question of probable decisional significance and such 
substantial public interest importance as to warrant consideration in 
spite of its untimely filing.
    (d) Such motions, opposition thereto, and replies to oppositions 
shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to support the 
action requested. Such allegations of fact, except for those of which 
official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavits of a 
person or persons having personal knowledge thereof. The failure to file 
an opposition or a reply will not necessarily be construed as an 
admission of any fact or argument contained in a pleading.
    (e) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving applicants for 
only new facilities, in addition to the showing with respect to the 
requested issue modification described in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the party requesting the enlargement of issues against an applicant in 
the proceeding shall identify those documents the moving party wishes to 
have produced and any other discovery procedures the moving party wishes 
to employ in the event the requested issue is added to the proceeding.
    (1) In the event the motion to enlarge issues is granted, the 
Commission or delegated authority acting on the motion will also rule on 
the additional discovery requests, and, if granted, such additional 
discovery will be scheduled to be completed within 30 days of the action 
on the motion.
    (2) The moving party may file supplemental discovery requests on the 
basis of information provided in responsive pleadings or discovered as a 
result of initial discovery on the enlarged issue. The grant or denial 
of any such supplemental requests and the timing of the completion of 
such supplemental discovery are subject to the discretion of the 
presiding judge.
    (3) The 30-day time limit for completion of discovery on enlarged 
issues shall not apply where the persons subject to such additional 
discovery are not parties to the proceeding. In such case, additional 
time will be required to afford such persons adequate notice

[[Page 149]]

of the discovery procedures being employed.
    (f) In any case in which the presiding judge or the Commission 
grants a motion to enlarge the issues to inquire into allegations that 
an applicant made misrepresentations to the Commission or engaged in 
other misconduct during the application process, the enlarged issues 
include notice that, after hearings on the enlarged issue and upon a 
finding that the alleged misconduct occurred and warrants such penalty, 
in addition to or in lieu of denying the application, the applicant may 
be liable for a forfeiture of up to the maximum statutory amount. See 47 
U.S.C. 503(b)(2)(A).

<R05>
Sec. 1.244  Designation of a settlement judge.

    (a) In broadcast comparative cases involving applicants for only new 
facilities, the applicants may request the appointment of a settlement 
judge to facilitate the resolution of the case by settlement.
    (b) Where all applicants in the case agree that such procedures may 
be beneficial, such requests may be filed with the presiding judge no 
later than 15 days prior to the date scheduled by the presiding judge 
for the commencement of hearings. The presiding judge shall suspend the 
procedural dates in the case and forward the request to the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge for action.
    (c) If, in the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge, it 
appears that the appointment of a settlement judge will facilitate the 
settlement of the case, the Chief Judge will appoint a ``neutral'' as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 581 and 583(a) to act as the settlement judge.
    (1) The parties may request the appointment of a settlement judge of

[[Page 150]]

their own choosing so long as that person is a ``neutral'' as defined in 
5 U.S.C. 581.
    (2) The appointment of a settlement judge in a particular case is 
subject to the approval of all the applicants in the proceeding. See 5 
U.S.C. 583(b).
    (3) The Commission's Administrative Law Judges are eligible to act 
as settlement judges, except that an Administrative Law Judge will not 
be appointed as a settlement judge in any case in which the 
Administrative Law Judge also acts as the presiding officer.
    (4) Other members of the Commission's staff who qualify as neutrals 
may be appointed as settlement judges, except that staff members whose 
duties include drafting, review, and/or recommendations in adjudicatory 
matters pending before the Commission shall not be appointed as 
settlement judges.
    (d) The settlement judge shall have the authority to require 
applicants to submit their Standardized Integration Statements and/or 
their written direct cases for review. The settlement judge may also 
meet with the applicants and/or their counsel, individually and/or at 
joint conferences, to discuss their cases and the cases of their 
competitors. All such meetings will be off-the-record, and the 
settlement judge may express an opinion as to the relative comparative 
standing of the applicants and recommend possible means to resolve the 
proceeding by settlement. The proceedings before the settlement judge 
shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of 5 U.S.C. 574. 
Moreover, no statements, offers of settlement, representations or 
concessions of the parties or opinions expressed by the settlement judge 
will be admissible as evidence in any Commission licensing proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1.245  Disqualification of presiding officer.

    (a) In the event that a presiding officer deems himself disqualified 
and desires to withdraw from the case, he shall notify the Commission of 
his withdrawal at least 7 days prior to the date set for hearing.
    (b) Any party may request the presiding officer to withdraw on the 
grounds of personal bias or other disqualification.
    (1) The person seeking disqualification shall file with the 
presiding officer an affidavit setting forth in detail the facts alleged 
to constitute grounds for disqualification. Such affidavit shall be 
filed not later than 5 days before the commencement of the hearing 
unless, for good cause shown, additional time is necessary.
    (2) The presiding officer may file a response to the affidavit; and 
if he believes himself not disqualified, shall so rule and proceed with 
the hearing.
    (3) The person seeking disqualification may appeal a ruling of 
disqualification, and, in that event, shall do so at the time the ruling 
is made. Unless an appeal of the ruling is filed at this time, the right 
to request withdrawal of the presiding officer shall be deemed waived.
    (4) If an appeal of the ruling is filed, the presiding officer shall 
certify the question, together with the affidavit and any response filed 
in connection therewith, to the Commission. The hearing shall be 
suspended pending a ruling on the question by the Commission.
    (5) The Commission may rule on the question without hearing, or it 
may require testimony or argument on the issues raised.
    (6) The affidavit, response, testimony or argument thereon, and the 
Commission's decision shall be part of the record in the case.

                          Prehearing Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 1.246  Admission of facts and genuineness of documents.

    (a) Within 20 days after the time for filing a notice of appearance 
has expired; or within 20 days after the release of an order adding 
parties to the proceeding (see Sec. Sec. 1.223 and 1.227) or changing 
the issues (see Sec. 1.229); or within such shorter or longer time as 
the presiding officer may allow on motion or notice, a party may serve 
upon any other party a written request for the admission by the latter 
of the

[[Page 151]]

genuineness of any relevant documents identified in and exhibited by a 
clear copy with the request or of the truth of any relevant matters of 
fact set forth in the request.
    (b) Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be 
deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request, not 
less than 10 days after service thereof, or within such shorter or 
longer time as the presiding officer may allow on motion or notice, the 
party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting 
the admission either: (1) A sworn statement denying specifically the 
matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail 
the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny those matters, or (2) 
written objections on the ground that some or all of the requested 
admissions are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise 
improper in whole or in part. If written objections to a part of the 
request are made, the remainder of the request shall be answered within 
the period designated in the request. A denial shall fairly meet the 
substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that 
a party deny only a part or a qualification of a matter of which an 
admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and 
deny only the remainder.
    (c) A copy of the request and of any answer shall be served by the 
party filing on all other parties to the proceeding and upon the 
presiding officer.
    (d) Written objections to the requested admissions may be ruled upon 
by the presiding officer without additional pleadings.

Sec. 1.248  Prehearing conferences; hearing conferences.

    (a) The Commission, on its own initiative or at the request of any 
party, may direct the parties or their attorneys to appear at a 
specified time and place for a conference prior to a hearing, or to 
submit suggestions in writing, for the purpose of considering, among 
other things, the matters set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. 
The initial prehearing conference shall be scheduled 30 days after the 
effective date of the order designating a case for hearing, unless good 
cause is shown for scheduling such conference at a later date.
    (b)(1) The presiding officer (or the Commission or a panel of 
commissioners in a case over which it presides), on his own initiative 
or at the request of any party, may direct the parties or their 
attorneys to appear at a specified time and place for a conference prior 
to or during the course of a hearing, or to submit suggestions in 
writing, for the purpose of considering any of the matters set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section. The initial prehearing conference shall 
be scheduled 30 days after the effective date of the order designating a 
case for hearing, unless good cause is shown for scheduling such 
conference at a later date.
    (2) Except as circumstances otherwise require, the presiding officer 
shall allow a reasonable period prior to commencement of the hearing for 
the orderly completion of all prehearing procedures, including 
discovery, and for the submission and disposition of all prehearing 
motions. Where the circumstances so warrant, the presiding officer 
shall, promptly after the hearing is ordered, call a preliminary 
prehearing conference, to inquire into the use of available procedures 
contemplated by the parties and the time required for their completion, 
to formulate a schedule for their completion, and to set a date for 
commencement of the hearing.
    (c) In conferences held, or in suggestions submitted, pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the following matters, among 
others, may be considered:
    (1) The necessity or desirability of simplification, clarification, 
amplification, or limitation of the issues;
    (2) The admission of facts and of the genuineness of documents (see 
Sec. 1.246), and the possibility of stipulating with respect to facts;
    (3) The procedure at the hearing;
    (4) The limitation of the number of witnesses;
    (5) In cases arising under Title II of the Communications Act, the 
necessity

[[Page 152]]

or desirability of amending the pleadings and offers of settlement or 
proposals of adjustment; and
    (6) In cases involving comparative broadcast applications:
    (i) Narrowing the issues or the areas of inquiry and proof at the 
hearing;
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Reports and letters relating to surveys or contacts;
    (iv) Assumptions regarding the availability of equipment;
    (v) Network programming;
    (vi) Assumptions regarding the availability of networks proposed;
    (vii) Offers of letters in general;
    (viii) The method of handling evidence relating to the past 
cooperation of existing stations owned and/or operated by the applicants 
with organizations in the area;
    (ix) Proof of contracts, agreements, or understandings reduced to 
writing;
    (x) Stipulations;
    (xi) Need for depositions;
    (xii) The numbering of exhibits;
    (xiii) The order or offer of proof with relationship to docket 
number;
    (xiv) The date for the formal hearing; and
    (xv) Such other matters as may expedite the conduct of the hearing.
    (7) In proceedings in which consent agreements may be negotiated 
(see Sec. 1.93), the parties shall be prepared to state at the initial 
prehearing conference whether they are at that time willing to enter 
negotiations leading to a consent agreement.
    (d) This paragraph applies to broadcast proceedings only.
    (1) At the prehearing conference prescribed by this section, the 
parties to the proceeding shall be prepared to discuss the advisability 
of reducing any or all phases of their affirmative direct cases to 
written form.
    (2) In hearings involving applications for new, improved and changed 
facilities and in comparative hearings involving only applications for 
new facilities, where it appears that it will contribute significantly 
to the disposition of the proceeding for the parties to submit all or 
any portion of their affirmative direct cases in writing, the presiding 
officer may, in his discretion, require them to do so.
    (3) In other broadcast proceedings, where it appears that it will 
contribute significantly to the disposition of the proceeding for the 
parties to submit all or any portion of their affirmative direct cases 
in writing, it is the policy of the Commission to encourage them to do 
so. However, the phase or phases of the proceeding to be submitted in 
writing, the dates for the exchange of the written material, and other 
limitations upon the effect of adopting the written case procedure (such 
as whether material ruled out as incompetent may be restored by other 
competent testimony) is to be left to agreement of the parties as 
approved by the presiding officer.
    (4) In broadcast comparative cases involving applicants for only new 
facilities, oral testimony and cross examination will be permitted only 
where, in the discretion of the presiding judge, material issues of 
decisional fact cannot be resolved without oral evidentiary hearing 
procedures or the public interest otherwise requires oral evidentiary 
proceedings.
    (e) An official transcript of all conferences shall be made.
    (f) The presiding officer may, upon the written request of a party 
or parties, approve the use of a speakerphone as a means of attendance 
at a prehearing conference if such use is found to conduce to the proper 
dispatch of business and the ends of justice.

Sec. 1.249  Prehearing statement.

    Immediately upon convening the formal hearing in any proceeding, the 
presiding officer shall enter upon the record a statement reciting all

approved by him, and any special rules which he may deem necessary to 
govern the course of the proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1.251  Summary decision.

    (a)(1) Any party to an adjudicatory proceeding may move for summary 
decision of all or any of the issues set for hearing. The motion shall 
be filed at least 20 days prior to the date set for commencement of the 
hearing. The party filing the motion may not rest upon mere allegations 
or denials but must show, by affidavit or by other materials subject to 
consideration by the presiding officer, that there is no genuine issue 
of material fact for determination at the hearing.
    (2) With the permission of the presiding officer, or upon his 
invitation, a motion for summary decision may be filed at any time 
before or after the commencement of the hearing. No appeal from an order 
granting or denying a request for permission to file a motion for 
summary decision shall be allowed. If the presiding officer authorizes a 
motion for summary decision after the commencement of the hearing, 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on those issues which 
the moving party believes can be resolved shall be attached to the 
motion, and any other party may file findings of fact and conclusions of 
law as an attachment to pleadings filed by him pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Within 14 days after a motion for summary decision is filed, any 
other party to the proceeding may file an opposition or a countermotion 
for summary decision. A party opposing the motion may not rest upon mere 
allegations or denials but must show, by affidavit or by other materials 
subject to consideration by the presiding officer, that there is a 
genuine issue of material fact for determination at the hearing, that he 
cannot, for good cause, present by affidavit or otherwise facts 
essential to justify his opposition, or that summary decision is 
otherwise inappropriate.
    (c) Affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show 
affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters 
stated therein.
    (d) The presiding officer may, in his discretion, set the matter for 
argument and call for the submission of proposed findings, conclusions, 
briefs or memoranda of law. The presiding officer, giving appropriate 
weight to the nature of the proceeding, the issue or issues, the proof, 
and to the need for cross-examination, may grant a motion for summary 
decision to the extent that the pleadings, affidavits, materials 
obtained by discovery or otherwise, admissions, or matters officially 
noticed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and 
that a party is otherwise entitled to summary decision. If it appears 
from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot, for 
good cause shown, present by affidavit or otherwise facts essential to 
justify his opposition, the presiding officer may deny the motion, may 
order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to 
be had, or make such other order as is just.
    (e) If all of the issues (or a dispositive issue) are determined on 
a motion for summary decision no hearing (or further hearing) will be 
held. The presiding officer will issue a Summary Decision, which is 
subject to appeal or review in the same manner as an Initial Decision. 
See Sec. Sec. 1.271 through 1.282. If some of the issues only 
(including no dispositive issue) are decided on a motion for summary 
decision, or if the motion is denied, the presiding officer will issue a 
memorandum opinion and order, interlocutory in character, and the 
hearing will proceed on the remaining issues. Appeal from interlocutory 
rulings is governed by Sec. 1.301.
    (f) The presiding officer may take any action deemed necessary to 
assure that summary decision procedures are not abused. He may rule in 
advance of a motion that the proceeding is not appropriate for summary 
decision, and may take such other measures as are necessary to prevent 
any unwarranted delay.

[[Page 154]]

    (1) Should it appear to the satisfaction of the presiding officer 
that a motion for summary decision has been presented in bad faith or 
solely for the purpose of delay, or that such a motion is patently 
frivolous, he will enter a determination to that effect upon the record.
    (2) If, on making such determination, the presiding officer 
concludes that the facts warrant disciplinary action against an 
attorney, he will certify the matter to the Commission with his findings 
and recommendations, for consideration under Sec. 1.24.
    (3) If, on making such determination, the presiding officer 
concludes that the facts warrant a finding of bad faith on the part of a 
party to the proceeding, he will certify the matter to the Commission, 
with his findings and recommendations, for a determination as to whether 
the facts warrant addition of an issue as to the character 
qualifications of that party.

    (a) The Commission will specify the day on which and the place at 
which any hearing is to commence.
    (b) The presiding officer will specify the days on which subsequent 
hearing sessions are to be held.
    (c) If the Commission specifies that a hearing is to commence in the 
District of Columbia, it shall be moved therefrom only by order of the 
Commission.
    (d) If the Commission specifies that a hearing is to commence at a 
field location, all appropriate proceedings will be completed at such 
location before the hearing is moved therefrom. When such proceedings 
are completed, the presiding officer may move the hearing from the field 
location specified to another appropriate field location or to the 
District of Columbia.

Sec. 1.254  Nature of the hearing; burden of proof.

    Any hearing upon an application shall be a full hearing in which the 
applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to 
participate but in which both the burden of proceeding with the 
introduction of evidence upon any issue specified by the Commission, as 
well as the burden of proof upon all such issues, shall be upon the 
applicant except as otherwise provided in the order of designation.

    (a) At hearings on a formal complaint or petition or in a proceeding 
for any instrument of authorization which the Commission is empowered to 
issue, the complainant, petitioner, or applicant, as the case may be, 
shall, unless the Commission otherwise orders, open and close. At 
hearings on protests, the protestant opens and closes the proceedings in 
case the issues are not specifically adopted by the Commission; 
otherwise the grantee does so. At hearings on orders to show cause, to 
cease and desist, to revoke or modify a station license under sections 
312 and 316 of the Communications Act, or other like proceedings 
instituted by the Commission, the Commission shall open and close.
    (b) At all hearings under Title II of the Communications Act, other 
than hearings on formal complaints, petitions, or applications, the 
respondent shall open and close unless otherwise specified by the 
Commission.
    (c) In all other cases, the Commission or presiding officer shall 
designate the order of presentation. Intervenors shall follow the party 
in whose behalf intervention is made, and in all cases where the 
intervention is not in support of an original party, the Commission or 
presiding officer shall designate at what stage such intervenors shall 
be heard.

Sec. 1.258  Closing of the hearing.

    The record of hearing shall be closed by an announcement to that 
effect at the hearing by the presiding officer when the taking of 
testimony has been concluded. In the discretion of the presiding 
officer, the record may be closed as of a future specified date in order 
to permit the admission into the record of exhibits to be prepared: 
Provided, The parties to the proceeding stipulate on

[[Page 155]]

the record that they waive the opportunity to cross-examine or present 
evidence with respect to such exhibits. The record in any hearing which 
has been adjourned may not be closed by such officer prior to the day on 
which the hearing is to resume, except upon 10 days' notice to all 
parties to the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1.260  Certification of transcript.

    After the close of the hearing, the complete transcript of 
testimony, together with all exhibits, shall be certified as to identity 
by the presiding officer and filed in the Office of the Secretary. 
Notice of such certification shall be served on all parties to the 
proceedings.

notice of certification of the transcript, any party to the proceeding 
may file with the presiding officer a motion requesting the correction 
of the transcript, which motion shall be accompanied by proof of service 
thereof upon all other parties to the proceeding. Within 5 days after 
the filing of such a motion, other parties may file a pleading in 
support of or in opposition to such motion. Thereafter, the presiding 
officer shall, by order, specify the corrections to be made in the 
transcript, and a copy of the order shall be served upon all parties and 
made a part of the record. The presiding officer, on his own initiative, 
may specify corrections to be made in the transcript on 5 days' notice.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263  Proposed findings and conclusions.

    (a) Each party to the proceeding may file proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions, briefs, or memoranda of law: Provided, however, That 
the presiding officer may direct any party other than Commission counsel 
to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions, briefs, or memoranda 
of law. Such proposed findings of fact, conclusions, briefs, and 
memoranda of law shall be filed within 20 days after the record is 
closed, unless additional time is allowed.
    (b) All pleadings and other papers filed pursuant to this section 
shall be accompanied by proof of service thereof upon all other counsel 
in the proceeding; if a party is not represented by counsel, proof of 
service upon such party shall be made.
    (c) In the absence of a showing of good cause therefor, the failure 
to file proposed findings of fact, conclusions, briefs, or memoranda of 
law, when directed to do so, may be deemed a waiver of the right to 
participate further in the proceeding.

(5 U.S.C. 557)


<R05>
Sec. 1.264  Contents of findings of fact and conclusions.

    Proposed findings of fact shall be set forth in serially numbered 
paragraphs and shall set out in detail and with particularity all basic 
evidentiary facts developed on the record (with appropriate citations to 
the transcript of record or exhibit relied on for each evidentiary fact) 
supporting the conclusions proposed by the party filing same. Proposed 
conclusions shall be separately stated. Proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions submitted by a person other than an applicant may be limited 
to those issues in connection with the hearing which affect the 
interests of such person.

Sec. 1.267  Initial and recommended decisions.

    (a) Except as provided in this paragraph, in Sec. Sec. 1.94, 1.251 
and 1.274, or where the proceeding is terminated on motion (see Sec. 
1.302), the presiding officer shall prepare an initial (or recommended) 
decision, which shall be transmitted to the Secretary of the Commission. 
In the case of rate making proceedings conducted under sections 201-205 
of the Communications Act, the presumption shall be that the presiding 
officer shall prepare an initial or recommended decision. The Secretary 
will make the decision public immediately and file it in the docket of 
the case.
    (b) Each initial and recommended decision shall contain findings of 
fact and

[[Page 156]]

conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon all the 
material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record; 
each initial decision shall also contain the appropriate rule or order, 
and the sanction, relief or denial thereof; and each recommended 
decision shall contain recommendations as to what disposition of the 
case should be made by the Commission. Each initial decision will show 
the date upon which it will become effective in accordance with the 
rules in this part in the absence of exceptions, appeal, or review.
    (c) The authority of the Presiding Officer over the proceedings 
shall cease when he has filed his Initial or Recommended Decision, or if 
it is a case in which he is to file no decision, when he has certified 
the case for decision: Provided, however, That he shall retain limited 
jurisdiction over the proceeding for the purpose of effecting 
certification of the transcript and corrections to the transcript, as 
provided in Sec. Sec. 1.260 and 1.261, respectively, and for the 
purpose of ruling initially on applications for awards of fees and 
expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

                           Review Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.271  Delegation of review function.

    The Commission may direct, by order or rule, that its review 
function in a case or category of cases be performed by a commissioner, 
or a panel of commissioners, in which event the commissioner or panel 
shall exercise the authority and perform the functions which would 
otherwise have been performed by the Commission under Sec. Sec. 1.273 
through 1.282.

    Note: To provide for an orderly completion of cases, exceptions and 
related pleadings filed after March 1, 1996, shall be directed to the 
Commission and will not be acted upon by the Review Board.

[62 FR 4171, Jan. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.273  Waiver of initial or recommended decision.

    At the conclusion of the hearing or within 20 days thereafter, all 
parties to the proceeding may agree to waive an initial or recommended 
decision, and may request that the Commission issue a final decision or 
order in the case. If the Commission has directed that its review 
function in the case be performed by a commissioner, a panel of 
commissioners, the request shall be directed to the appropriate review 
authority. The Commission or such review authority may in its discretion 
grant the request, in whole or in part, if such action will best conduce 
to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.

[28 FR 12425, Nov. 22, 1963, as amended at 62 FR 4171, Jan. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.274  Certification of the record to the Commission for initial or final decision.

    (a) Where the presiding officer is available to the Commission, and 
where the Commission finds upon the record that due and timely execution 
of its functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires, the 
Commission may direct that the record in a pending proceeding be 
certified to it for initial or final decision. Unless the Commission 
finds that due and timely execution of its functions imperatively and 
unavoidably requires that no recommended decision be issued, the 
presiding officer will prepare and file a recommended decision, which 
will be released with the Commission's initial or final decision.
    (b) Where the presiding officer becomes unavailable to the 
Commission after the taking of testimony has been concluded, the 
Commission may direct that the record in a pending proceeding be 
certified to it for initial or final decision. In that event, the record 
shall be certified to the Commission by the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge.
    (c)(1) Where the presiding officer becomes unavailable to the 
Commission after the taking of evidence has commenced but before it has 
been concluded, the Commission may order a rehearing before another 
presiding officer designated in accordance with Sec. 1.241.

[[Page 157]]

    (2) Upon a finding that due and timely execution of its functions 
imperatively and unavoidably so requires, the Commission may (as an 
alternative) order that the hearing be continued by another presiding 
officer designated in accordance with Sec. 1.241 or by the Commission 
itself. In that event, the officer continuing the hearing shall, upon 
completion of the hearing, certify the proceeding to the Commission for 
an initial or final decision. Unless the Commission finds upon the 
record that due and timely execution of its functions imperatively and 
unavoidably requires that no recommended decision be issued, the officer 
continuing the hearing shall prepare and file a recommended decision to 
be released with the Commission's initial or final decision. If all the 
parties expressly consent, and if the Commission does not order 
otherwise, the officer continuing the hearing may prepare an initial 
decision.

(Sec. 409, 48 Stat. 1096, as amended; 47 U.S.C. 409)


<R05>
Sec. 1.276  Appeal and review of initial decision.

    (a)(1) Within 30 days after the date on which public release of the 
full text of an initial decision is made, or such other time as the 
Commission may specify, any of the parties may appeal to the Commission 
by filing exceptions to the initial decision, and such decision shall 
not become effective and shall then be reviewed by the Commission, 
whether or not such exceptions may thereafter be withdrawn. It is the 
Commission's policy that extensions of time for filing exceptions shall 
not be routinely granted.
    (2) Exceptions shall be consolidated with the argument in a 
supporting brief and shall not be submitted separately. As used in this 
subpart, the term exceptions means the document consolidating the 
exceptions and supporting brief. The brief shall contain (i) a table of 
contents, (ii) a table of citations, (iii) a concise statement of the 
case, (iv) a statement of the questions of law presented, and (v) the 
argument, presenting clearly the points of fact and law relied upon in 
support of the position taken on each question, with specific reference 
to the record and all legal or other materials relied on.
    (b) The Commission may on its own initiative provide, by order 
adopted not later than 20 days after the time for filing exceptions 
expires, that an initial decision shall not become final, and that it 
shall be further reviewed or considered by the Commission.
    (c) In any case in which an initial decision is subject to review in 
accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Commission 
may, on its own initiative or upon appropriate requests by a party, take 
any one or more of the following actions:
    (1) Hear oral argument on the exceptions;
    (2) Require the filing of briefs;
    (3) Prior to or after oral argument or the filing of exceptions or 
briefs, reopen the record and/or remand the proceedings to the presiding 
officer to take further testimony or evidence;
    (4) Prior to or after oral argument or the filing of exceptions or 
briefs, remand the proceedings to the presiding officer to make further 
findings or conclusions; and
    (5) Prior to or after oral argument or the filing of exceptions or 
briefs, issue, or cause to be issued by the presiding officer, a 
supplemental initial decision.
    (d) No initial decision shall become effective before 50 days after 
public release of the full text thereof is made unless otherwise ordered 
by the Commission. The timely filing of exceptions, the further review 
or consideration of an initial decision on the Commission's initiative, 
or the taking of action by the Commission under paragraph (c) of this 
section shall stay the effectiveness of the initial decision until the 
Commission's review thereof has been completed. If the effective date of 
an initial decision falls within any further time allowed for the filing 
of exceptions, it shall be postponed automatically until 30 days after 
time for filing exceptions has expired.
    (e) If no exceptions are filed, and the Commission has not ordered 
the review of an initial decision on its initiative, or has not taken 
action under paragraph (c) of this section, the initial decision shall 
become effective, an appropriate notation to that effect shall be 
entered in the docket of the case, and

[[Page 158]]

a ``Public Notice'' thereof shall be given by the Commission. The 
provisions of Sec. 1.108 shall not apply to such public notices.
    (f) When any party fails to file exceptions within the specified 
time to an initial decision which proposes to deny its application, such 
party shall be deemed to have no interest in further prosecution of its 
application, and its application may be dismissed with prejudice for 
failure to prosecute.

[28 FR 12425, Nov. 22, 1963, as amended at 41 FR 14873, Apr. 8, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 1.277  Exceptions; oral arguments.

    (a) The consolidated supporting brief and exceptions to the initial 
decision (see Sec. 1.276(a)(2)), including rulings upon motions or 
objections, shall point out with particularity alleged material errors 
in the decision or ruling and shall contain specific references to the 
page or pages of the transcript of hearing, exhibit or order if any on 
which the exception is based. Any objection not saved by exception filed 
pursuant to this section is waived.
    (b) Within the period of time allowed in Sec. 1.276(a) for the 
filing of exceptions, any party may file a brief in support of an 
initial decision, in whole or in part, which may contain exceptions and 
which shall be similar in form to the brief in support of exceptions 
(see Sec. 1.276(a)(2)).
    (c) Except by special permission, the consolidated brief and 
exceptions will not be accepted if the exceptions and argument exceed 25 
double-spaced typewritten pages in length. (The table of contents and 
table of citations are not counted in the 25 page limit; however, all 
other contents of and attachments to the brief are counted.) Within 10 
days, or such other time as the Commission or delegated authority may 
specify, after the time for filing exceptions has expired, any other 
party may file a reply brief, which shall not exceed 25 double spaced 
typewritten pages and shall contain a table of contents and a table of 
citations. If exceptions have been filed, any party may request oral 
argument not later than five days after the time for filing replies to 
the exceptions has expired. The Commission or delegated authority, in 
its discretion, will grant oral argument by order only in cases where 
such oral presentations will assist in the resolution of the issues 
presented. Within five days after release of an order designating an 
initial decision for oral argument, as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, any party who wishes to participate in oral argument shall file 
a written notice of intention to appear and participate in oral 
argument. Failure to file a written notice shall constitute a waiver of 
the opportunity to participate.
    (d) Each order scheduling a case for oral argument will contain the 
allotment of time for each party for oral argument before the 
Commission. The Commission will grant, in its discretion, upon good 
cause shown, an extension of such time upon petition by a party, which 
petition must be filed within 5 days after issuance of said order for 
oral argument.
    (e) Within 10 days after a transcript of oral argument has been 
filed in the Office of the Secretary, any party who participated in the 
oral argument may file with the Commission a motion requesting 
correction of the transcript, which motion shall be accompanied by proof 
of service thereof upon all other parties who participated in the oral 
argument. Within 5 days after the filing of such a motion, other parties 
may file a pleading in support of or in opposition to such motion. 
Thereafter, the officer who presided at the oral argument shall, by 
order, specify the corrections to be made in the transcript, and a copy 
of the order shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. The 
officer who presided at the oral argument may, on his own initiative, by 
order, specify corrections to be made in the transcript on 5 days notice 
of the proposed corrections to all parties who participated in the oral 
argument.
    (f) Any commissioner who is not present at oral argument and who is 
otherwise authorized to participate in a final decision may participate 
in

[[Page 159]]

making that decision after reading the transcript of oral argument.

    Upon review of any initial decision, the Commission may, in its 
discretion, limit the issues to be reviewed to those findings and 
conclusions to which exceptions have been filed, or to those findings 
and conclusions specified in the Commission's order of review issued 
pursuant to Sec. 1.276(b).

Sec. 1.282  Final decision of the Commission.

    (a) After opportunity has been afforded for the filing of proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions, exceptions, supporting statements, 
briefs, and for the holding of oral argument as provided in this 
subpart, the Commission will issue a final decision in each case in 
which an initial decision has not become final.
    (b) The final decision shall contain:
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions, as well as the reasons or 
basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law or discretion 
presented on the record;
    (2) Rulings on each relevant and material exception filed; the 
Commission will deny irrelevant exceptions, or those which are not of 
decisional significance, without a specific statement of reasons 
prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (3) The appropriate rule or oder and the sanction, relief or denial 
thereof.

        Appeal and Reconsideration of Presiding Officer's Ruling


<R05>
Sec. 1.301  Appeal from presiding officer's interlocutory ruling; effective date of ruling.

    (a) Interlocutory rulings which are appealable as a matter of right. 
Rulings listed in this paragraph are appealable as a matter of right. An 
appeal from such a ruling may not be deferred and raised as an exception 
to the initial decision.
    (1) If the presiding officer's ruling denies or terminates the right 
of any person to participate as a party to a hearing proceeding, such 
person, as a matter of right, may file an appeal from that ruling.
    (2) If the presiding officer's ruling requires testimony or the 
production of documents, over objection based on a claim of privilege, 
the ruling on the claim of privilege is appealable as a matter of right.
    (3) If the presiding officer's ruling denies a motion to disqualify 
the presiding judge, the ruling is appealable as a matter of right.
    (4) Rulings granting a joint request filed under Sec. 1.525 without 
terminating the proceeding are appealable by any party as a matter of 
right.
    (5) A ruling removing counsel from the hearing is appealable as a 
matter of right, by counsel on his own behalf or

[[Page 161]]

by his client. (In the event of such ruling, the presiding officer will 
adjourn the hearing for such period as is reasonably necessary for the 
client to secure new counsel and for counsel to familiarize himself with 
the case).
    (b) Other interlocutory rulings. Except as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section, appeals from interlocutory rulings of the presiding 
officer shall be filed only if allowed by the presiding officer. Any 
party desiring to file an appeal shall first file a request for 
permission to file appeal. The request shall be filed within 5 days 
after the order is released or (if no written order) after the ruling is 
made. Pleadings responsive to the request shall be filed only if they 
are requested by the presiding officer. The request shall contain a 
showing that the appeal presents a new or novel question of law or 
policy and that the ruling is such that error would be likely to require 
remand should the appeal be deferred and raised as an exception. The 
presiding officer shall determine whether the showing is such as to 
justify an interlocutory appeal and, in accordance with his 
determination, will either allow or disallow the appeal or modify the 
ruling. If the presiding officer allows or disallows the appeal, his 
ruling is final: Provided, however, That the Commission may, on its own 
motion, dismiss an appeal allowed by the presiding officer on the ground 
that objection to the ruling should be deferred and raised as an 
exception. In the discretion of the presiding officer, the request for 
permission to file appeal may be made orally, on the record of the 
proceeding. The request may be disposed of orally.
    (1) If an appeal is not allowed, or is dismissed by the Commission, 
or if permission to file an appeal is not requested, objection to the 
ruling may be raised on review of the initial decision.
    (2) If an appeal is allowed and is considered on its merits, the 
disposition on appeal is final. Objection to the ruling or to the action 
on appeal may not be raised on review of the initial decision.
    (3) If the presiding officer modifies the ruling, any party 
adversely affected by the modified ruling may file a request for 
permission to file appeal, pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
    (c) Procedures, effective date. (1) Unless the presiding officer 
orders otherwise, rulings made by him shall be effective when the order 
is released or (if no written order) when the ruling is made. The 
Commission may stay the effect of any ruling which comes before it for 
consideration on appeal.
    (2) Appeals filed under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed 
within 5 days after the order is released or (if no written order) after 
the ruling is made. Appeals filed under paragraph (b) of this section 
shall be filed within 5 days after the appeal is allowed.
    (3) The appeal shall conform with the specifications set out in 
Sec. 1.49 and shall be subscribed and verified as provided in Sec. 
1.52.
    (4) The appeal shall be served on parties to the proceeding (see 
Sec. Sec. 1.47 and 1.211), and shall be filed with the Secretary, 
Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554.
    (5) The appeal shall not exceed 5 double-spaced typewritten pages.
    (6) Appeals are acted on by the Commission.
    (7) Oppositions and replies shall be served and filed in the same 
manner as appeals and shall be served on appellant if he is not a party 
to the proceeding. Oppositions shall be filed within 5 days after the 
appeal is filed. Replies shall not be permitted, unless the Commission 
specifically requests them. Oppositions shall not exceed 5 double-spaced

               The Discovery and Preservation of Evidence

    Authority: Sections 1.311 through 1.325 are issued under secs. 4, 
303, 409, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082, 1096; 47 U.S.C. 154, 303, 
409, 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 1.311  General.

    Sections 1.311 through 1.325 provide for taking the deposition of 
any person (including a party), for interrogatories to parties, and for 
orders to parties relating to the production of documents and things and 
for entry upon real property. These procedures may be used for the 
discovery of relevant facts, for the production and preservation of 
evidence for use at the hearing, or for both purposes.
    (a) Applicability. For purposes of discovery, these proecdures may 
be used in any case of adjudication (as defined in the Administrative 
Procedure Act) which has been designated for hearing. For the 
preservation of evidence, they may be used in any case which has been 
designated for hearing and is conducted under the provisions of this 
subpart (see Sec. 1.201).
    (b) Scope of examination. Persons and parties may be examined 
regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the hearing 
issues, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition 
and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the 
identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts. It 
is not ground for objection to use of these procedures that the 
testimony will be inadmissible at the hearing if the testimony sought 
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible 
evidence. The use of these procedures against the Commission is subject 
to the following additional limitations:
    (1) The informer's privilege shall encompass information which may 
lead to the disclosure of an informer's identity.
    (2) Commission personnel may not be questioned by deposition for the 
purposes of discovery except on special order of the Commission, but may 
be questioned by written interrogatories under Sec. 1.323. 
Interrogatories shall be served on the appropriate Bureau Chief (see 
Sec. 1.21(b)). They will be answered and signed by those personnel with 
knowledge of the facts. The answers will be served by the Secretary of 
the Commission upon parties to the proceeding.
    (3) Commission records are not subject to discovery under Sec. 
1.325. The inspection of Commission records is governed by the Freedom 
of Information Act, as amended, and by Sec. Sec. 0.451

[[Page 163]]

through 0.467 of this chapter. Commission employees may be questioned by 
written interrogatories regarding the existence, nature, description, 
custody, condition and location of Commission records, but may not be 
questioned concerning their contents unless the records are available 
(or are made available) for inspection under Sec. Sec. 0.451 through 
0.467. See Sec. 0.451(b)(5) of this chapter.
    (4) Subject to paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, 
Commission personnel may be questioned generally by written 
interrogatories regarding the existence, description, nature, custody, 
condition and location of relevant documents and things and regarding 
the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts, 
and may otherwise only be examined regarding facts of the case as to 
which they have direct personal knowledge.
    (c) Schedule for use of the procedures. (1) In comparative broadcast 
proceedings involving applicants for only new facilities, discovery 
commences with the release of the hearing designation order, and, in 
routine cases, the discovery phase of the proceeding will be conducted 
in a manner intended to conclude that portion of the case within 90 days 
of the release of the designation order.
    (2) In all other proceedings, except as provided by special order of 
the presiding officer, discovery may be initiated before or after the 
prehearing conference provided for in Sec. 1.248 of this part.
    (3) In all proceedings, the presiding officer may at any time order 
the parties or their attorneys to appear at a conference to consider the 
proper use of these procedures, the time to be allowed for such use, 
and/or to hear agrument and render a ruling on disputes that arise under 
these rules.
    (d) Who shall act. Actions provided for in Sec. Sec. 1.311 through 
1.325 will, in most cases, be taken by the officer designated to preside 
at the hearing (see Sec. 1.241). If the proceeding, or a particular 
matter to which the action relates, is before the Commission, a 
commissioner or panel of commissioners, or the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge, the action will be taken by such officer or body. The term 
presiding officer, as used in Sec. Sec. 1.311 through 1.325 shall be 
understood to refer to the appropriate officer or body. See Sec. Sec. 
0.341, 0.351, 0.365, and 1.271 of this chapter.
    (e) Stipulations regarding the taking of depositions. If all of the 
parties so stipulate in writing and if there is no interference to the 
conduct of the proceeding, depositions may be taken before any person, 
at any time (subject to the limitation below) or place, upon any notice 
and in any manner, and when so taken may be used like other depositions. 
An original and one copy of the stipulation shall be filed with the 
Secretary of the Commission, and a copy of the stipulation shall be 
served on the presiding officer, at least 3 days before the scheduled 
taking of the deposition.

<R05>
Sec. 1.313  Protective orders.

    The use of the procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.311 through 
1.325 of this part is subject to control by the presiding officer, who 
may issue any order consistent with the provisions of those sections 
which is appropriate and just for the purpose of protecting parties and 
deponents or of providing for the proper conduct of the proceeding. 
Whenever doing so would be conducive to the efficient and expeditious 
conduct of the proceeding, the presiding officer may convene a 
conference to hear argument and issue a ruling on any disputes that may 
arise under these rules. The ruling, whether written or delivered on the 
record at a conference, may specify any measures, including the 
following to assure proper conduct of the proceeding or to protect any 
party or deponent from annoyance, expense, embarassment or oppression:
    (a) That depositions shall not be taken or that interrogatories 
shall not be answered.
    (b) That certain matters shall not be inquired into.
    (c) That the scope of the examination or interrogatories shall be 
limited to certain matters.
    (d) That depositions may be taken only at some designated time or 
place,

[[Page 164]]

or before an officer, other than that stated in the notice.
    (e) That depositions may be taken only by written interrogatories or 
only upon oral examination.
    (f) That, after being sealed, the deposition shall be opened only by 
order of the presiding officer.

Sec. 1.318  The taking of depositions.

    (a) Persons before whom depositions may be taken. Depositions shall 
be taken before any judge of any court of the United States; any U.S. 
Commissioner; any clerk of a district court; any chancellor, justice or 
judge of a supreme or superior court; the mayor or chief magistrate of a 
city; any judge of a county court, or court of common

[[Page 166]]

pleas of any of the United States; any notary public, not being of 
counsel or attorney to any party, nor interested in the event of the 
proceeding; or presiding officers, as provided in Sec. 1.243.
    (b) Attendance of witnesses. The attendance of witnesses at the 
taking of depositions may be compelled by the use of subpena as provided 
in Sec. Sec. 1.331 through 1.340.
    (c) Oath; transcript. The officer before whom the deposition is to 
be taken shall administer an oath or affirmation to the witness and 
shall personally, or by someone acting under his direction and in his 
presence record the testimony of the witness. The testimony may be taken 
stenographically or, upon approval by the presiding officer, testimony 
may be taken through the use of telephonically or electronically 
recorded methods, including videotape. In the event these latter methods 
are used for the deposition, the parties may agree to the waiver of the 
provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) as appropriate and as approved by 
the presiding officer.
    (d) Examination. (1) In the taking of depositions upon oral 
examination, the parties may proceed with examination and cross-
examination of deponents as permitted at the hearing. In lieu of 
participating in the oral examination, parties served with the notice to 
take depositions may transmit written interrogatories to the officer 
designated in the notice, who shall propound them to the witness and 
record the answers verbatim.
    (2) In the taking of depositions upon written interrogatories, the 
party who served the original interrogatories shall transmit copies of 
all interrogatories to the officer designated in the notice, who shall 
propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim.
    (e) Submission of deposition to witness; changes; signing. When the 
testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition of each witness shall be 
submitted to him for examination and shall be read to or by him, unless 
such examination and reading are waiver by the witness and by the 
parties. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to 
make shall be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a 
statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The 
deposition shall then be signed by the witness, unless the parties by 
stipulation waive the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, 
or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the 
officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, 
the illness or absence of the witness, or of his refusal to sign, 
together with the reason (if any) given therefor; and the deposition may 
then be used as fully as though signed, unless upon a motion to 
suppress, the presiding officer holds that the reason given for the 
refusal to sign requires rejection of the deposition in whole or in 
part.
    (f) Certification of deposition and filing by officer; copies. The 
officer shall certify on the deposition that the witness was duly sworn 
by him, that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by 
the witness, and that said officer is not of counsel or attorney to 
either of the parties, nor interested in the event of the proceeding or 
investigation. He shall then securely seal the deposition in an envelope 
endorsed with the title of the action and marked ``Deposition of (here 
insert name of witness)'' and shall promptly send the original and two 
copies of the deposition and of all exhibits, together with the notice 
and any interrogatories received by him, by certified mail to the 
Secretary of the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 1.319  Objections to the taking of depositions.

    (a) Objections to be made by motion prior to the taking of 
depositions. If there is objection to the substance of any interrogatory 
or to examination on any matter clearly covered by the notice to take 
depositions, the objection shall be made in a motion opposing the taking 
of depositions or in a motion to limit or suppress the interrogatory as 
provided in Sec. Sec. 1.315(b) and 1.316(d) and shall not be made at 
the taking of the deposition.
    (b) Objections to be made at the taking of depositions. Errors and 
irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking 
the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers,

[[Page 167]]

in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of 
any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly 
presented, are waived unless reasonable objection thereto is made at the 
taking of the deposition. If such objection is made, counsel shall, if 
possible, agree upon the measures required to obviate, remove, or cure 
such errors. The measures agreed upon shall be taken. If agreement 
cannot be reached, the objection shall be noted on the deposition by the 
officer taking it, and the testimony objected to shall be taken subject 
to the objection.
    (c) Additional objections which may be made at the taking of 
depositions. Objection may be made at the taking of depositions on the 
ground of relevancy or privilege, if the notice to take depositions does 
not clearly indicate that the witness is to be examined on the matters 
to which the objection relates. See paragraph (a) of this section. 
Objection may also be made on the ground that the examination is being 
conducted in such manner as to unreasonably annoy, embarrass, or oppress 
a deponent or party.
    (1) When there is objection to a line of questioning, as permitted 
by this paragraph, counsel shall, if possible, reach agreement among 
themselves regarding the proper limits of the examination.
    (2) If counsel cannot agree on the proper limits of the examination 
the taking of depositions shall continue on matters not objected to and 
counsel shall, within 24 hours, either jointly or individually, 
telegraph statements of their positions to the presiding officer, 
together with the telephone numbers at which they and the officer taking 
the depositions can be reached, or shall otherwise jointly confer with 
the presiding officer. If individual statements are submitted, copies 
shall be provided to all counsel participating in the taking of 
depositions.
    (3) The presiding officer shall promptly rule upon the question 
presented or take such other action as may be appropriate under Sec. 
1.313, and shall give notice of his ruling, by telephone, to counsel who 
submitted statements and to the officer taking the depositions. The 
presiding officer shall thereafter reduce his ruling to writing.
    (4) The taking of depositions shall continue in accordance with the 
presiding officer's ruling. Such rulings are not subject to appeal.

[33 FR 463, Jan. 12, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 1.321  Use of depositions at the hearing.

    (a) No inference concerning the admissibility of a deposition in 
evidence shall be drawn because of favorable action on the notice to 
take depositions.
    (b) Except as provided in this paragraph and in Sec. 1.319, 
objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any 
deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the 
exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and 
testifying.
    (1) Objections to the competency of a witness, or the competency, 
relevancy or materiality of testimony are waived by failure to make them 
before or during the taking of depositions if (and only if) the ground 
of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if 
presented at that time.
    (2) Objection on the ground of privilege is waived by failure to 
make it before or during the taking of depositions.
    (c) A party shall not be deemed to make a person his own witness for 
any purpose by taking his deposition. The introduction in evidence of 
the deposition or any part thereof for any purpose other than that of 
contradicting or impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness 
of the party introducing the deposition, but this shall not apply to the 
use by an adverse party of a deposition as described in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section. At the hearing any party may rebut any relevant 
evidence contained in a deposition whether introduced by him or by any 
other party.
    (d) At the hearing (or in a pleading), any part or all of a 
deposition, so far as admissible, may be used against any party who was 
present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due 
notice thereof, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:

[[Page 168]]

    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness.
    (2) The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time of 
taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent of a 
public or private corporation, partnership or association which is a 
party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.
    (3) To the extent that the affirmative direct case of a party is 
made in writing pursuant to Sec. 1.248(d), the deposition of any 
witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any 
purpose, provided the witness is made available for cross-examination. 
In all cases, the deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may 
be used by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer finds: (i) 
That the witness is dead; or (ii) that the witness is out of the United 
States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured 
by the party offering the deposition; or (iii) that the witness is 
unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or 
imprisonment; or (iv) upon application and notice, that such exceptional 
circumstances exist as to make it desirable in the interest of justice 
and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of 
witnesses orally in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
an adverse party may require him to introduce all of it which is 
relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other 
parts.
    (5) Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use 
depositions previously taken; and, when an action in any hearing has 
been dismissed and another action involving the same subject matter is 
afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or 
successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in 
the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken 
therefor.

Sec. 1.323  Interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Interrogatories. Any party may serve upon any other party 
written interrogatories to be answered in writing by the party served 
or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a 
partnership or association, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish 
such information as is available to the party. A copy of the 
interrogatories shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. An 
original and three copies of the interrogatories, answers, and all 
related pleadings shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission. A 
copy of the interrogatories, answers and all related pleadings shall be 
served on the presiding officer.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided in a protective order, the number 
of interrogatories or sets of interrogatories is not limited.
    (2) Except as provided in such an order, interrogatories may be 
served after a deposition has been taken, and a deposition may be sought 
after interrogatories have been answered.
    (b) Answers and objections. Each interrogatory shall be answered 
separately and fully in writing under oath or affirmation, unless it is 
objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in 
lieu of an answer. The answers shall be signed by the person making 
them, and the objections by the attorney making them. The party upon 
whom the interrogatories were served shall serve a copy of the answers 
and objections upon all parties to the proceeding within 14 days after 
service of the interrogatories, or within such shorter or longer period 
as the presiding officer may allow. Answers may be used in the same 
manner as depositions of a party (see Sec. 1.321(d)).
    (c) Motion to compel an answer. Any party to the proceeding may, 
within 7 days, move for an order with respect to any objection or other 
failure to answer an interrogatory. For purposes of this paragraph, an 
evasive or incomplete answer is a failure to answer; and if the motion 
is based on the assertion that the answer is evasive or incomplete, it 
shall contain a statement as to the scope and detail of an answer which 
would be considered responsive and complete. The party upon whom the 
interrogatories were served may

[[Page 169]]

file a response within 7 days after the motion is filed, to which he may 
append an answer or an amended answer. Additional pleadings should not 
be submitted and will not be considered.
    (d) Action by the presiding officer. If the presiding officer 
determines that an objection is not justified, he shall order that the 
answer be served. If an interrogatory has not been answered, the 
presiding officer may rule that the right to object has been waived and 
may order that an answer be served. If an answer does not comply fully 
with the requirements of this section, the presiding officer may order 
that an amended answer be served, may specify the scope and detail of 
the matters to be covered by the amended answer, and may specify any 
appropriate procedural consequences (including adverse findings of fact 
and dismissal with prejudice) which will follow from the failure to make 
a full and responsive answer. If a full and responsive answer is not 
made, the presiding officer may issue an order invoking any of the 
procedural consequences specified in the order to compel an answer.
    (e) Appeal. As order to compel an answer is not subject to appeal.

    Authority: Sections 1.331 and 1.333 through 1.340 are issued under 
sec. 409, 48 Stat. 1096; 47 U.S.C. 409.


<R05>
Sec. 1.331  Who may sign and issue.

    Subpenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and 
subpenas requiring the production of any books, papers, schedules of 
charges, contracts, agreements, and documents relating to any matter 
under investigation or hearing, may be signed and issued as follows:
    (a) Hearings before the Commission en banc, an individual 
commissioner, or a panel of commissioners: By any commissioner 
participating in the conduct of the hearing.
    (b) Hearings before an administrative law judge: By the 
administrative law judge or, in his absence, by the Chief Administrative 
Law Judge.


<R05>
Sec. 1.333  Requests for issuance of subpena.

    (a) Unless submitted on the record while a hearing is in progress, 
requests for a subpena ad testificandum shall be submitted in writing.
    (b) Requests for a subpena duces tecum shall be submitted in 
writing, duly subscribed and verified, and shall specify with 
particularity the books, papers, and documents desired and the facts 
expected to be proved thereby. Where the subpena duces tecum request is 
directed to a nonparty to the proceeding, the presiding officer may 
issue the same, upon request, without an accompanying subpena to enforce 
a notice to take depositions, provided for in paragraph (e) of this 
section, where it appears that the testimony of said person is not 
required in connection with the subpena duces tecum.
    (c) All requests for subpenas shall be supported by a showing of the 
general relevance and materiality of the evidence sought.
    (d) Requests for subpenas shall be submitted in triplicate, but need 
not be served on the parties to the proceeding.
    (e) Requests for issuance of a subpena ad testificandum to enforce a 
notice to take depositions shall be submitted in writing. Such requests 
may be submitted with the notice or at a later date. The request shall 
not be granted until the period for the filing of motions opposing the 
taking of depositions has expired or, if a motion has been filed, until 
that motion has been acted on. Regardless of the time when the subpena 
request is submitted, it need not be accompanied by a showing that 
relevant and material evidence will be adduced, but merely that the 
person will be examined regarding a nonprivileged matter which is 
relevant to the hearing issues. The subpena request may ask that a 
subpena duces tecum be contemporaneously issued commanding the person to 
whom it is directed to produce designated books, papers, documents, or 
tangible things which constitute or contain evidence relating to any of 
the matters within the scope of the examination permitted by Sec. 
1.311(b) but in that event the subpena request will be subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1.313 and paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Requests for issuance of a subpena duces tecum to enforce an 
order for the production of documents and things for inspection and 
copying under Sec. 1.325 may be submitted with the motion requesting 
the issuance of such an order. Regardless of the time when the subpena 
request is submitted, it need not be accompanied by a showing that 
relevant and material evidence will be adduced, but merely that the 
documents and things to be examined contain nonprivileged matter which 
is relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding.

directed on the subpena, to the official before whom the person named in 
the subpena is required to appear.
    (d) The ``Duplicate'' copy of the subpena shall be served upon the 
person named therein and retained by him. This copy should be presented 
in support of any claim for witness fees or mileage allowances for 
testimony on behalf of the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 1.354  Documents containing matter not material.

    If material and relevant matter offered in evidence is embraced in a 
document containing other matter not material or relevant, and not

presiding officer, the original document, together with true copies of 
such material and relevant matter taken therefrom, as it is desired to

material and relevant.


<R05>

as to be readily identified, and may be received in evidence by

authenticated by the seal of his office.


<R05>
Sec. 1.360  Proof of lack of record.

    The absence of an official record or entry of a specified tenor in 
an official record may be evidenced by a written statement signed by an 
officer, or by his deputy, who would have custody of the official 
record, if it existed, that after diligent search no record or entry of 
a specified tenor is found to exist in the records of his office, 
accompanied by a certificate as provided in Sec. 1.359. Such statement

office contain no such record or entry.


<R05>
Sec. 1.361  Other proof of official record.

<R05>
Sec. 1.407  Action on petitions.

    If the Commission determines that the petition discloses sufficient 
reasons in support of the action requested to justify the institution of 
a rulemaking proceeding, and notice and public procedure thereon are 
required or deemed desirable by the Commission, an appropriate notice of 
proposed rule making will be issued. In those cases where notice and 
public procedure thereon are not required, the Commission may issue a 
final order amending the rules. In all other cases the petition for rule 
making will be denied and the petitioner will be notified of the 
Commission's action with the grounds therefor.

Sec. 1.412  Notice of proposed rulemaking.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
prior notice of proposed rulemaking will be given.
    (1) Notice is ordinarily given by publication of a ``Notice of 
Proposed Rule Making'' in the Federal Register. A summary of the full 
decision adopted by the Commission constitutes a ``Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking'' for purposes of Federal Register publication.
    (2) If all persons subject to the proposed rules are named, the 
proposal may (in lieu of publication) be personally served upon those 
persons.
    (3) If all persons subject to the proposed rules are named and have 
actual notice of the proposal as a matter of law, further prior notice 
of proposed rulemaking is not required.
    (b) Rule changes (including adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule 
or rules) relating to the following matters will ordinarily be adopted 
without prior notice:
    (1) Any military, naval, or foreign affairs function of the United 
States.
    (2) Any matter relating to Commission management or personnel or to 
public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.

[[Page 177]]

    (3) Interpretative rules.
    (4) General statements of policy.
    (5) Rules of Commission organization, procedure, or practice.
    (c) Rule changes may in addition be adopted without prior notice in 
any situation in which the Commission for good cause finds that notice 
and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest. The finding of good cause and a statement of the basis 
for that finding are in such situations published with the rule changes.
    (d) In addition to the notice provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Commission, before prescribing any requirements as to 
accounts, records, or memoranda to be kept by carriers, will notify the 
appropriate State agencies having jurisdiction over any carrier involved 
of the proposed requirements.

rulemaking proceeding through submission of written data, views, or 
arguments, with or without opportunity to present the same orally in any 
manner.
    (b) A reasonable time will be provided for submission of comments in

to the original comments, and the time provided will be specified in the 
notice of proposed rulemaking.
    (d) No additional comments may be filed unless specifically 
requested or authorized by the Commission.

    Note: In some (but not all) rulemaking proceedings, interested 
persons may also communicate with the Commission and its staff on an ex 
parte basis, provided certain procedures are followed. See Sec. Sec. 
1.420 and 1.1200 et seq. See also ---- FCC 2d ---- (1980) (i.e., this 
order).

    (e) For time limits for filing motions for extension of time for

<R05>
Sec. 1.419  Form of comments and replies; number of copies.

    (a) Comments, replies, and other documents filed in a rulemaking

Bureau...........................................................      2
Reference Information Center.....................................      1
                                                                  ------

      Total......................................................     10
 

    However, members of the general public who wish to express their 
interest by participating informally in a rulemaking proceeding may do 
so by

[[Page 178]]

submitting an original and one copy of their comments, without regard to 
form, provided only that the Docket Number is specified in the heading. 
Informal comments filed after close of the reply comment period, or, if 
on reconsideration, the reconsideration reply comment period, should be 
labeled ``ex parte'' pursuant to section 1.1206(a) of this chapter. 
Letters submitted to Commissioners or Commission staff will be treated 
in the same way as informal comments, as set forth above. Also such 
informal participants who wish the responsible members of the staff and 
the Commissioners to have personal copies may file an additional 7 
copies. The distribution of such copies shall be as follows:

Commissioners....................................................      5
Secretary........................................................      2
Bureau...........................................................      2
                                                                  ------
      Total......................................................      9
 

    (c) Any person desiring to file identical documents in more than one 
docketed rulemaking proceeding shall furnish the Commission two 
additional copies of any such document for each additional docket. This 
requirement does not apply if the proceedings have been consolidated.
    (d) Participants that file comments and replies in electronic form 
need only submit one copy of those comments, so long as the submission 
conforms to any procedural or filing requirements established for formal 
electronic comments.
    (e) Comments and replies and other documents filed in electronic 
form by a party represented by an attorney shall include the name and 
mailing address of at least one attorney of record. Parties not 
represented by an attorney that file comments and replies and other

<R05>
Sec. 1.420  Additional procedures in proceedings for amendment of the FM or TV Tables of Allotments, or for amendment of certain FM assignments.

    (a) Comments filed in proceedings for amendment of the FM Table of 
Allotments (Sec. 73.202 of this chapter) or the Television Table of 
Allotments (Sec. 73.606 of this chapter) which are initiated on a 
petition for rule making shall be served on petitioner by the person who 
files the comments.
    (b) Reply comments filed in proceedings for amendment of the FM or 
Television Tables of Allotments shall be served on the person(s) who 
filed the comments to which the reply is directed.
    (c) Such comments and reply comments shall be accompanied by a 
certificate of service.
    (d) Counterproposals shall be advanced in initial comments only and 
will not be considered if they are advanced in reply comments.
    (e) An original and 4 copies of all petitions for rulemaking, 
comments, reply comments, and other pleadings shall be filed with the 
Commission.
    (f) Petitions for reconsideration and responsive pleadings shall be 
served on parties to the proceeding and on any licensee or permittee 
whose authorization may be modified to specify operation on a different 
channel, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of service.
    (g) The Commission may modify the license or permit of a UHF TV 
station to a VHF channel in the same community in the course of the rule 
making proceeding to amend Sec. 73.606(b), or it may modify the license 
or permit of an FM station to another class of channel through notice 
and comment procedures, if any of the following conditions are met:
    (1) There is no other timely filed expression of interest, or
    (2) If another interest in the proposed channel is timely filed, an 
additional equivalent class of channel is also allotted, assigned or 
available for application.

    Note to Paragraph (g): In certain situations, a licensee or 
permittee may seek an

[[Page 179]]

adjacent, intermediate frequency or co-channel upgrade by application. 
See Sec. 73.203(b) of this chapter.

    (h) Where licensees (or permittees) of television broadcast stations 
jointly petition to amend Sec. 73.606(b) and to exchange channels, and 
where one of the licensees (or permittees) operates on a commercial 
channel while the other operates on a reserved noncommercial educational 
channel within the same band, and the stations serve substantially the 
same market, then the Commission may amend Sec. 73.606(b) and modify 
the licenses (or permits) of the petitioners to specify operation on the 
appropriate channels upon a finding that such action will promote the 
public interest, convenience, and necessity.

    Note 1 to paragraph (h): Licensees and permittees operating Class A 
FM stations who seek to upgrade their facilities to Class B1, B, C3, C2, 
C1, or C on Channel 221, and whose proposed 1 mV/m signal contours would 
overlap the Grade B contour of a television station operating on Channel 
6 must meet a particularly heavy burden by demonstrating that grants of 
their upgrade requests are in the public interest. In this regard, the 
Commission will examine the record in rule making proceedings to 
determine the availability of existing and potential non-commercial 
education service.

    (i) In the course of the rule making proceeding to amend Sec. 
73.202(b) or Sec. 73.606(b), the Commission may modify the license or 
permit of an FM or television broadcast station to specify a new 
community of license where the amended allotment would be mutually 
exclusive with the licensee's or permittee's present assignment.
    (j) Whenever an expression of interest in applying for, 
constructing, and operating a station has been filed in a proceeding to 
amend the FM or TV Table of Allotments, and the filing party seeks to 
dismiss or withdraw the expression of interest, either unilaterally or 
in exchange for financial consideration, that party must file with the 
Commission a request for approval of the dismissal or withdrawal, a copy 
of any written agreement related to the dismissal or withdrawal, and an 
affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the party withdrawing its interest 
nor its principals has received or will receive any money or other 
consideration in excess of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange 
for the dismissal or withdrawal of the expression of interest;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the dismissal or 
withdrawal of the expression of interest.
    (5) In addition, within 5 days of a party's request for approval, 
each remaining party to any written or oral agreement must submit an 
affidavit setting forth:
    (i) A certification that neither it nor its principals has paid or 
will pay money or other consideration in excess of the legitimate and 
prudent expenses of the party withdrawing its expression of interest; 
and
    (ii) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the dismissal or 
withdrawal of the expression of interest.

    Note to Sec. 1.420: The reclassification of a Class C station in 
accordance with the procedure set forth in Note 4 to Sec. 73.3573 may 
be initiated through the filing of an original petition for amendment of 
the FM Table of Allotments. The Commission will notify the affected 
Class C station licensee of the proposed reclassification by issuing a 
notice of proposed rule making, except that where a triggering petition 
proposes an amendment or amendments to the FM Table of Allotments in 
addition to the proposed reclassification, the Commission will issue an 
order to show cause as set forth in Note 4 to Sec. 73.3573, and a 
notice of proposed rule making will be issued only after the 
reclassification issue is resolved. Triggering petitions will be 
dismissed upon the filing, rather than the grant, of an acceptable 
construction permit application to increase antenna height to at least 
451 meters HAAT by a subject Class C station.

Sec. 1.425  Commission action.

    The Commission will consider all relevant comments and material of 
record before taking final action in a rulemaking proceeding and will 
issue a decision incorporating its finding and a brief statement of the 
reasons therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 1.427  Effective date of rules.

    (a) Any rule issued by the Commission will be made effective not 
less than 30 days from the time it is published in the Federal Register 
except as otherwise specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) For good cause found and published with the rule, any rule 
issued by the Commission may be made effective within less than 30 days 
from the time it is published in the Federal Register. Rules involving 
any military, naval or foreign affairs function of the United States; 
matters relating to agency management or personnel, public property, 
loans, grants, benefits or contracts; rules granting or recognizing 
exemption or relieving restriction; rules of organization, procedure or 
practice; or interpretative rules; and statements of policy may be made 
effective without regard to the 30-day requirement.
    (c) In cases of alterations by the Commission in the required manner 
or form of keeping accounts by carriers, notice will be served upon 
affected carriers not less than 6 months prior to the effective date of 
such alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 1.429  Petition for reconsideration.

    (a) Any interested person may petition for reconsideration of a 
final action in a proceeding conducted under this subpart (see 
Sec. Sec. 1.407 and 1.425). Where the action was taken by the 
Commission, the petition will be acted on by the Commission. Where 
action was taken by a staff official under delegated authority, the 
petition may be acted on by the staff official or referred to the 
Commission for action.

    Note: The staff has been authorized to act on rulemaking proceedings 
described in Sec. 1.420 and is authorized to make editorial changes in 
the rules (see Sec. 0.231(d)).

    (b) A petition for reconsideration which relies on facts which have 
not previously been presented to the Commission will be granted only 
under the following circumstances:
    (1) The facts relied on relate to events which have occurred or 
circumstances which have changed since the last opportunity to present 
them to the Commission;
    (2) The facts relied on were unknown to petitioner until after his 
last opportunity to present them to the Commission, and he could not 
through the exercise of ordinary diligence have learned of the facts in 
question prior to such opportunity; or
    (3) The Commission determines that consideration of the facts relied 
on is required in the public interest.
    (c) The petition for reconsideration shall state with particularity 
the respects in which petitioner believes the action taken should be 
changed.
    (d) The petition for reconsideration and any supplement thereto 
shall be filed within 30 days from the date of public notice of such 
action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b). No supplement to a 
petition for reconsideration filed after expiration of the 30 day period 
will be considered, except upon leave granted pursuant to a separate 
pleading stating the grounds for acceptance of the supplement. The 
petition for reconsideration shall not exceed 25 double-spaced 
typewritten pages. See also Sec. 1.49(f).
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 1.420(f), petitions for 
reconsideration need not be served on parties to the proceeding. 
(However, where the number of parties

[[Page 181]]

is relatively small, the Commission encourages the service of petitions 
for reconsideration and other pleadings, and agreements among parties to 
exchange copies of pleadings. See also Sec. 1.47(d) regarding 
electronic service of documents.) When a petition for reconsideration is 
timely filed in proper form, public notice of its filing is published in 
the Federal Register. The time for filing oppositions to the petition 
runs from the date of public notice. See Sec. 1.4(b).
    (f) Oppositions to a petition for reconsideration shall be filed 
within 15 days after the date of public notice of the petition's filing 
and need be served only on the person who filed the petition. See also 
Sec. 1.49(d). Oppositions shall not exceed 25 double-spaced typewritten 
pages. See Sec. 1.49(f).
    (g) Replies to an opposition shall be filed within 10 days after the 
time for filing oppositions has expired and need be served only on the 
person who filed the opposition. Replies shall not exceed 10 double-
spaced typewritten pages. See also Sec. Sec. 1.49(d) and 1.49(f).
    (h) Petitions for reconsideration, oppositions and replies shall 
conform to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.49 and 1.52, except that 
they need not be verified. Except as provided in Sec. 1.420(e), an 
original and 11 copies shall be submitted to the Secretary, Federal 
Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554. Parties filing in 
electronic form need only submit one copy.
    (i) The Commission may grant the petition for reconsideration in 
whole or in part or may deny the petition. Its order will contain a 
concise statement of the reasons for the action taken. Any order 
disposing of a petition for reconsideration which modifies rules adopted 
by the original order is, to the extent of such modification, subject to 
reconsideration in the same manner as the original order. Except in such 
circumstance, a second petition for reconsideration may be dismissed by 
the staff as repetitious.
    (j) The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a condition 
precedent to judicial review of any action taken by the Commission, 
except where the person seeking such review was not a party to the 
proceeding resulting in the action or relies on questions of fact or law 
upon which the Commission has been afforded no opportunity to pass. 
Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, such a 
person may qualify to seek judicial review by filing a petition for 
reconsideration.
    (k) Without special order of the Commission, the filing of a 
petition for reconsideration shall not excuse any person from complying 
with any rule or operate in any manner to stay or postpone its 
enforcement. However, upon good cause shown, the Commission will stay 
the effective date of a rule pending a decision on a petition for 
reconsideration. See, however, Sec. 1.420(f).

    (a) The Commission may commence any proceeding within its 
jurisdiction against any common carrier by serving upon the carrier an 
order to show cause. The order shall contain a statement of the 
particulars and matters concerning which the Commission is inquiring and 
the reasons for such action, and will call upon the carrier to appear

shall specifically and completely respond to all allegations and matters 
contained in the show cause order.
    (c) All papers filed by a carrier in a proceeding under this section

                               Complaints


<R05>
Sec. 1.711  Formal or informal complaints.

    Complaints filed against carriers under section 208 of the 
Communications Act may be either formal or informal.

                           Informal Complaints


<R05>
Sec. 1.716  Form.

    An informal complaint shall be in writing and should contain: (a) 
The name, address and telephone number of the complaint, (b) the name of 
the carrier against which the complaint is made, (c) a complete 
statement of the facts tending to show that such carrier did or omitted 
to do anything in contravention of the Communications Act, and (d) the 
specific relief of satisfaction sought.

[51 FR 16039, Apr. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.717  Procedure.

    The Commission will forward informal complaints to the appropriate 
carrier for investigation. The carrier will, within such time as may be 
prescribed, advise the Commission in writing, with a copy to the 
complainant, of its satisfaction of the complaint or of its refusal or 
inability to do so. Where there are clear indications from the carrier's 
report or from other communications with the parties that the complaint 
has been satisfied, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider a 
complaint proceeding to be closed, without response to the complainant. 
In all other cases, the Commission will contact the complainant 
regarding its review and disposition of the matters raised. If the 
complainant is not satisfied by the carrier's response and the 
Commission's disposition, it may file a formal complaint in accordance 
with Sec. 1.721 of this part.

[51 FR 16039, Apr. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.718  Unsatisfied informal complaints; formal complaints relating back to the filing dates of informal complaints.

    When an informal complaint has not been satisfied pursuant to Sec. 
1.717, the complainant may file a formal complaint with this Commission 
in the form specified in Sec. 1.721. Such filing will be deemed to 
relate back to the filing date of the informal complaint: Provided, That 
the formal complaint: (a) Is filed within 6 months from the date of

[[Page 185]]

the carrier's report, (b) makes reference to the date of the informal 
complaint, and (c) is based on the same cause of action as the informal 
complaint. If no formal complaint is filed within the 6-month period, 
the complainant will be deemed to have abandoned the unsatisfied 
informal complaint.

[51 FR 16040, Apr. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.719  Informal complaints filed pursuant to section 258.

    (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.716 through 
1.718, the following procedures shall apply to complaints alleging that 
a carrier has violated section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, by making an unauthorized 
change of a subscriber's preferred carrier, as defined by Sec. 
64.1100(e) of this chapter.
    (b) Form. The complaint shall be in writing, and should contain: The 
complainant's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address (if the 
complainant has one); the name of both the allegedly unauthorized 
carrier, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(d) of this chapter, and authorized 
carrier, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(c) of this chapter; a complete 
statement of the facts (including any documentation) tending to show 
that such carrier engaged in an unauthorized change of the subscriber's 
preferred carrier; a statement of whether the complainant has paid any 
disputed charges to the allegedly unauthorized carrier; and the specific 
relief sought.
    (c) Procedure. The Commission will resolve slamming complaints under 
the definitions and procedures established in Sec. Sec. 64.1100 through 
64.1190 of this chapter. The Commission will issue a written (or 
electronic) order informing the complainant, the unauthorized carrier, 
and the authorized carrier of its finding, and ordering the appropriate 
remedy, if any, as defined by Sec. Sec. 64.1160 through 64.1170 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Unsatisfied Informal Complaints Involving Unauthorized Changes 
of a Subscriber's Preferred Carrier; Formal Complaints Relating Back to 
the Filing Dates of Informal Complaints. If the complainant is 
unsatisfied with the resolution of a complaint under this section, the 
complainant may file a formal complaint with the Commission in the form 
specified in Sec. 1.721. Such filing will be deemed to relate back to 
the filing date of the informal complaint filed under this section, so 
long as the informal complaint complied with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section and provided that: The formal complaint is 
filed within 45 days from the date an order resolving the informal 
complaint filed under this section is mailed or delivered electronically 
to the complainant; makes reference to both the informal complaint 
number assigned to and the initial date of filing the informal complaint 
filed under this section; and is based on the same cause of action as 
the informal complaint filed under this section. If no formal complaint 
is filed within the 45-day period, the complainant will be deemed to 
have abandoned its right to bring a formal complaint regarding the cause 
of action at issue.

                            Formal Complaints


<R05>
Sec. 1.720  General pleading requirements.

    Formal complaint proceedings are generally resolved on a written 
record consisting of a complaint, answer, and joint statement of 
stipulated facts, disputed facts and key legal issues, along with all 
associated affidavits, exhibits and other attachments. Commission 
proceedings may also require or permit other written submissions such as 
briefs, written interrogatories, and other supplementary documents or 
pleadings. Those formal complaint proceedings handled on the Enforcement 
Bureau's Accelerated Docket are subject to pleading and procedural rules 
that differ in some respects from the general rules for formal complaint 
proceedings.
    (a) Pleadings must be clear, concise, and explicit. All matters 
concerning a claim, defense or requested remedy, including damages, 
should be pleaded fully and with specificity.
    (b) Pleadings must contain facts which, if true, are sufficient to 
constitute a violation of the Act or Commission order or regulation, or 
a defense to such alleged violation.
    (c) Facts must be supported by relevant documentation or affidavit.

[[Page 186]]

    (d) Legal arguments must be supported by appropriate judicial, 
Commission, or statutory authority.
    (e) Opposing authorities must be distinguished.
    (f) Copies must be provided of all non-Commission authorities relied 
upon which are not routinely available in national reporting systems, 
such as unpublished decisions or slip opinions of courts or 
administrative agencies.
    (g) Parties are responsible for the continuing accuracy and 
completeness of all information and supporting authority furnished in a 
pending complaint proceeding. Information submitted, as well as relevant 
legal authorities, must be current and updated as necessary and in a 
timely manner at any time before a decision is rendered on the merits of 
the complaint.
    (h) Specific reference shall be made to any tariff provision relied 
on in support of a claim or defense. Copies of relevant tariffs or 
relevant portions of tariffs that are referred to or relied upon in a 
complaint, answer, or other pleading shall be appended to such 
complaint, answer, or other pleading.
    (i) All statements purporting to summarize or explain Commission 
orders or policies must cite, in standard legal form, the Commission 
ruling upon which such statements are based.
    (j) Pleadings shall identify the name, address, telephone number, 
and facsimile transmission number for either the filing party's attorney 
or, where a party is not represented by an attorney, the filing party.

[[Page 187]]

the dispute prior to the filing of the formal complaint. If no 
additional steps were taken, such certificate shall state the reason(s)

    (9) Whether a separate action has been filed with the Commission, 
any court, or other government agency that is based on the same claim or 
same set of facts, in whole or in part, or whether the complaint seeks 
prospective relief identical to the relief proposed or at issue in a 
notice-and-comment proceeding that is concurrently before the 
Commission;
    (10) An information designation containing:
    (i) The name, address, and position of each individual believed to 
have firsthand knowledge of the facts alleged with particularity in the 
complaint, along with a description of the facts within any such 
individual's knowledge;
    (ii) A description of all documents, data compilations and tangible 
things in the complainant's possession, custody, or control, that are 
relevant to the facts alleged with particularity in the complaint. Such

disseminated;
    (B) The author, preparer, or other source;

upon which the complainant relies or intends to rely to support the 
facts alleged and legal arguments made in the complaint;
    (12) A completed Formal Complaint Intake Form;
    (13) A declaration, under penalty of perjury, by the complainant or 
complainant's counsel describing the amount, method, and date of the 
complainant's payment of the filing fee required under Sec. 1.1106 and 
the complainant's 10-digit FCC Registration Number, if any;
    (14) A certificate of service; and
    (15) A FCC Registration Number is required under Part 1, Subpart W. 
Submission of a complaint without the FCC Registration Number as 
required by Part 1, subpart W will result in dismissal of the complaint.
    (b) The following format may be used in cases to which it is 
applicable, with such modifications as the circumstances may render 
necessary:

this section and Sec. 1.720, except that the requirements in Sec. Sec. 
1.720(b), 1.721(a)(4), (a) (5), (a)(8), (9), (a)(12), and (a)(13) shall 
not apply to such supplemental complaints;
    (2) In addition, supplemental complaints filed pursuant to Sec. 
1.722 shall contain a complete statement of facts which, if proven true, 
would support complainant's calculation of damages for each category of 
damages for which recovery is sought. All material facts must be 
supported, pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 1.720(c) and paragraph 
(a)(11) of this section, by relevant affidavits and other documentation. 
The statement of facts shall include a detailed explanation of the 
matters relied upon, including a full identification or description of 
the communications, transmissions, services, or other matters relevant 
to the calculation of damages and the nature of any injury allegedly 
sustained by the complainant. Assertions based on information and belief 
are expressly prohibited unless made in good faith and accompanied by an 
affidavit explaining the basis for the complainant's belief and why the 
complainant could not reasonably ascertain the facts from the defendant 
or any other source;
    (3) Supplemental complaints filed pursuant to Sec. 1.722 shall 
contain a certification that the complainant has, in good faith, 
discussed or attempted to discuss the possibility of settlement with 
respect to damages for which recovery is sought with each defendant

shall include a statement that, no later than 30 days after the release 
of the liability order, the complainant mailed a certified letter to the

the following listed exceptions:
    (i) The requirement in Sec. 1.720(c) and paragraphs (a)(5) and

Nevertheless, allegations of material fact, whether based on personal 
knowledge or information and belief, that cannot be supported by 
documentation remain subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.52.
    (ii) Complaints on the Accelerated Docket are not required to 
include proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and legal 
analysis relevant to the claims and arguments set forth in the 
complaint, as required in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. 
Nevertheless, complaints on the Accelerated Docket shall fully set out 
the facts and legal theories on which the complainant premises its 
claims.
    (iii) In light of the requirement for staff-supervised settlement 
negotiations in Sec. 1.730(b), complaints on the Accelerated Docket are 
not required to include a certification that the complainant has 
discussed or attempted to discuss the possibility of settlement

[[Page 189]]

with each defendant, as required in paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
    (iv) In light of the automatic document production required in Sec.

Sec. 1.722  Damages.

    (a) If a complainant wishes to recover damages, the complaint must 
contain a clear and unequivocal request for damages.
    (b) If a complainant wishes a determination of damages to be made in 
the same proceeding as the determinations of liability and prospective 
relief, the complaint must contain the allegations and information 
required by paragraph (h) of this section.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, in any proceeding 
to which no statutory deadline applies, if the Commission decides that a 
determination of damages would best be made in a proceeding that is 
separate from and subsequent to the proceeding in which the 
determinations of liability and prospective relief are made, the 
Commission may at any time order that the initial proceeding will 
determine only liability and prospective relief, and that a separate, 
subsequent proceeding initiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section will determine damages.
    (d) If a complainant wishes a determination of damages to be made in 
a proceeding that is separate from and subsequent to the proceeding in 
which the determinations of liability and prospective relief are made, 
the complainant must:
    (1) Comply with paragraph (a) of this section, and
    (2) State clearly and unequivocally that the complainant wishes a 
determination of damages to be made in a proceeding that is separate 
from and subsequent to the proceeding in which the determinations of 
liability and prospective relief will be made.
    (e) If a complainant proceeds pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, or if the Commission invokes its authority under paragraph (c) 
of this section, the complainant may initiate a separate proceeding to 
obtain a determination of damages by filing a supplemental complaint 
that complies with Sec. 1.721(e) and paragraph (h) of this section 
within sixty days after public notice (as defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of 
this chapter) of a decision that contains a finding of liability on the 
merits of the original complaint.
    (f) If a complainant files a supplemental complaint for damages in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the supplemental 
complaint shall be deemed, for statutory limitations purposes, to relate 
back to the date of the original complaint.
    (g) Where a complainant chooses to seek the recovery of damages upon 
a supplemental complaint in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (e) of this section, the Commission will resolve the separate, 
preceding liability

[[Page 190]]

complaint within any applicable complaint resolution deadlines contained 
in the Act.
    (h) In all cases in which recovery of damages is sought, it shall be 
the responsibility of the complainant to include, within either the 
complaint or supplemental complaint for damages filed in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section, either:
    (1) A computation of each and every category of damages for which 
recovery is sought, along with an identification of all relevant 
documents and materials or such other evidence to be used by the 
complainant to determine the amount of such damages; or
    (2) An explanation of:
    (i) The information not in the possession of the complaining party 
that is necessary to develop a detailed computation of damages;
    (ii) Why such information is unavailable to the complaining party;
    (iii) The factual basis the complainant has for believing that such 
evidence of; damages exists;
    (iv) A detailed outline of the methodology that would be used to 
create a computation of damages with such evidence.
    (i) Where a complainant files a supplemental complaint for damages 
in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the following 
procedures may apply:
    (1) Issues concerning the amount, if any, of damages may be either 
designated by the Enforcement Bureau for hearing before, or, if the 
parties agree, submitted for mediation to, a Commission Administrative 
Law Judge. Such Administrative Law Judge shall be chosen in the 
following manner:
    (i) By agreement of the parties and the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge; or
    (ii) In the absence of such agreement, the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge shall designate the Administrative Law Judge.
    (2) The Commission may, in its discretion, order the defendant 
either to post a bond for, or deposit into an interest bearing escrow 
account, a sum equal to the amount of damages which the Commission 
finds, upon preliminary investigation, is likely to be ordered after the 
issue of damages is fully litigated, or some lesser sum which may be 
appropriate, provided the Commission finds that the grant of this relief 
is favored on balance upon consideration of the following factors:
    (i) The complainant's potential irreparable injury in the absence of 
such deposit;
    (ii) The extent to which damages can be accurately calculated;
    (iii) The balance of the hardships between the complainant and the 
defendant; and
    (iv) Whether public interest considerations favor the posting of the 
bond or ordering of the deposit.
    (3) The Commission may, in its discretion, suspend ongoing damages 
proceedings for fourteen days, to provide the parties with a time within 
which to pursue settlement negotiations and/or alternative dispute 
resolution procedures.
    (4) The Commission may, in its discretion, end adjudication of 
damages with a determination of the sufficiency of a damages computation 
method or formula. No such method or formula shall contain a provision 
to offset any claim of the defendant against the complainant. The 
parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the exact 
amount of damages pursuant to the Commission-mandated method or formula. 
Within thirty days of the release date of the damages order, parties 
shall submit jointly to the Commission either:
    (i) A statement detailing the parties' agreement as to the amount of 
damages;
    (ii) A statement that the parties are continuing to negotiate in 
good faith and a request that the parties be given an extension of time 
to continue negotiations; or
    (iii) A statement detailing the bases for the continuing dispute and 
the reasons why no agreement can be reached.
    (j) Except where otherwise indicated, the rules governing initial 
formal complaint proceedings govern supplemental formal complaint 
proceedings, as well.

Sec. 1.723  Joinder of complainants and causes of action.

    (a) Two or more complainants may join in one complaint if their 
respective causes of action are against the same defendant and concern 
substantially the same facts and alleged violation of the Communications 
Act.
    (b) Two or more grounds of complaint involving the same principle, 
subject, or statement of facts may be included in one complaint, but 
should be separately stated and numbered.

<R05>
Sec. 1.724  Answers.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (k) of this section governing Accelerated 
Docket proceedings, any carrier upon which a copy of a formal complaint 
is served shall answer such complaint in the manner prescribed under 
this section within twenty days of service of the formal complaint by 
the complainant, unless otherwise directed by the Commission.
    (b) The answer shall advise the complainant and the Commission fully 
and completely of the nature of any defense, and shall respond 
specifically to all material allegations of the complaint. Every effort 
shall be made to narrow the issues in the answer. The defendant shall 
state concisely its defense to each claim asserted, admit or deny the 
averments on which the complainant relies, and state in detail the basis 
for admitting or denying such averment. General denials are prohibited. 
Denials based on information and belief are expressly prohibited unless 
made in good faith and accompanied by an affidavit explaining the basis 
for the defendant's belief and why the defendant could not reasonably 
ascertain the facts from the complainant or any other source. If the 
defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a 
belief as to the truth of an averment, the defendant shall so state and 
this has the effect of a denial. When a defendant intends in good faith 
to deny only part of an averment, the defendant shall specify so much of 
it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. The defendant may deny 
the allegations of the complaint as specific denials of either 
designated averments or paragraphs.
    (c) The answer shall contain proposed findings of fact, conclusions 
of law, and legal analysis relevant to the claims and arguments set 
forth in the answer.
    (d) Averments in a complaint or supplemental complaint filed 
pursuant to Sec. 1.722 are deemed to be admitted when not denied in the 
answer.
    (e) Affirmative defenses to allegations contained in the complaint 
shall be specifically captioned as such and presented separately from 
any denials made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) The answer shall include an information designation containing:
    (1) The name, address, and position of each individual believed to 
have firsthand knowledge of the facts alleged with particularity in the 
answer, along with a description of the facts within any such 
individual's knowledge;
    (2) A description of all documents, data compilations and tangible 
things in the defendant's possession, custody, or control, that are 
relevant to the facts alleged with particularity in the answer. Such 
description shall include for each document:
    (i) The date it was prepared, mailed, transmitted, or otherwise 
disseminated;
    (ii) The author, preparer, or other source;
    (iii) The recipient(s) or intended recipient(s);
    (iv) Its physical location; and
    (v) A description of its relevance to the matters in dispute.
    (3) A complete description of the manner in which the defendant 
identified all persons with information and designated all documents, 
data compilations and tangible things as being relevant to the dispute, 
including, but not limited to, identifying the individual(s) that 
conducted the information search and the criteria used to identify such 
persons, documents, data compilations, tangible things, and information;
    (g) The answer shall attach copies of all affidavits, documents, 
data compilations and tangible things in the defendant's possession, 
custody, or control, upon which the defendant relies or

[[Page 192]]

intends to rely to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in 
the answer.
    (h) The answer shall contain certification that the defendant has, 
in good faith, discussed or attempted to discuss, the possibility of 
settlement with the complainant prior to the filing of the formal 
complaint. Such certification shall include a brief summary of all steps 
taken to resolve the dispute prior to the filing of the formal 
complaint. If no such steps were taken, such certificate shall state the 
reason(s) why the defendant believed such steps would be fruitless;
    (i) Where the complaint is filed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B), 
the defendant shall clearly indicate its willingness to waive the 90-day 
resolution deadline contained within 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B), in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.736.
    (j) The defendant may petition the staff, pursuant to Sec. 1.3, for 
a waiver of any of the requirements of this section. Such waiver may be 
granted for good cause shown.
    (k) Accelerated Docket Proceedings. For the purpose of this 
paragraph (k), the term document also shall include data compilations 
and tangible things.
    (1) Any party named as a defendant in an Accelerated Docket formal 
complaint shall answer such complaint in the manner prescribed under 
this section within ten days of service of the complaint by the 
complainant, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. Except as set 
forth in this paragraph (k), answers in Accelerated Docket proceedings 
shall comply with the requirements of this section.
    (2) The requirement in Sec. 1.720(c) and paragraph (g) of this 
section that factual assertions be supported by affidavit shall not 
apply to answers in Accelerated Docket proceedings. Nevertheless, 
allegations of material fact, whether based on personal knowledge or 
information and belief, that cannot be supported by documentation remain 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.52.
    (3) Answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to include 
proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and legal analysis 
relevant to the defenses and arguments set forth in the answer, as 
required in paragraph (c) of this section. Nevertheless, answers on the 
Accelerated Docket shall fully set out the facts and legal theories on 
which the defendant premises its defenses.
    (4) In light of the requirement for staff-supervised settlement 
negotiations required in Sec. 1.730(b), answers on the Accelerated 
Docket are not required to include a certification that the defendant 
has discussed, or attempted to discuss, the possibility of settlement 
with the complainant, as required in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (5) As required in Sec. 1.729(i)(1), answers on the Accelerated 
Docket shall be accompanied, when served on complainants, by copies of 
documents, within the defendant's possession, custody or control, that 
are likely to bear significantly on the issues raised in the proceeding. 
Unless otherwise directed, these documents shall not be filed with the 
Commission. In light of this automatic document production requirement, 
answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to include a 
description of all relevant documents in the defendant's possession, 
custody or control, as required in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (6) Answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to provide 
the description, required in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, of the 
manner in which the defendant identified persons with knowledge of, and 
documents relevant to, the dispute.
    (7) In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the defendant, as required in 
Sec. 1.729(i)(1), shall serve, contemporaneously with its answer, the 
complainant(s) with copies of documents, within the defendant's 
possession, custody or control, that are likely to bear significantly on 
the issues raised in the complaint and/or the answer.

requirements of Sec. 1.724(e), a complainant may file and serve a reply 
containing statements of relevant, material facts and legal arguments 
that shall be responsive to only those specific factual allegations and 
legal arguments made by the defendant in support of its affirmative 
defenses. Replies which contain other allegations or arguments will not 
be accepted or considered by the Commission.
    (b) Failure to reply to an affirmative defense shall be deemed an 
admission of such affirmative defense and of any facts supporting such 
affirmative defense that are not specifically contradicted in the 
complaint.
    (c) The reply shall contain proposed findings of fact, conclusions 
of law, and legal analysis relevant to the claims and arguments set

the reply, along with a description of the facts within any such 
individual's knowledge.
    (2) A description of all documents, data compilations and tangible 
things in the complainant's possession, custody, or control that are

persons, documents, data compilations, tangible things, and information;
    (e) The reply shall attach copies of all affidavits, documents, data 
compilations and tangible things in the complainant's possession, 
custody, or control upon which the complainant relies or intends to rely 
to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in the reply.
    (f) The complainant may petition the staff, pursuant to Sec. 1.3, 
for a waiver of any of the requirements of this section. Such waiver may 
be granted for good cause shown.
    (g) Accelerated Docket Proceedings. For the purpose of this 
paragraph (g), the term document also shall include data compilations 
and tangible things.
    (1) The filing of a separate pleading to reply to affirmative 
defenses is not permitted in Accelerated Docket proceedings. 
Complainants in such proceedings may include, in the Sec. 1.733(i)(4) 
pre-status-conference filing, those statements that otherwise would have 
been the subject of a reply.
    (2) In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the failure to reply, in the 
pre-status-conference filing, to an affirmative defense shall be deemed 
an admission of such affirmative defense and of any facts supporting 
such affirmative defense that are not specifically contradicted in the 
complaint.
    (3) If a complainant replies to an affirmative defense in its Sec. 
1.733(i)(4), pre-status-conference filing, it shall include in that 
filing the information, required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
identifying individuals with firsthand knowledge of the facts alleged in 
the reply.
    (4) An Accelerated Docket complainant that replies to an affirmative 
defense in its Sec. 1.733(i)(4), pre-status-conference filing also 
shall serve on the

defendant, at the same time as that filing, those documents in the 
complainant's possession, custody or control that were not previously 
produced to the defendant and that are likely to bear significantly on 
the issues raised in the reply. Such a complainant is not required to 
comply with the remainder of the requirements in paragraphs (d) and (e) 
of this section.

Sec. 1.727  Motions.

    (a) A request to the Commission for an order shall be by written 
motion, stating with particularity the grounds and authority therefor, 
and setting forth the relief or order sought.
    (b) All dispositive motions shall contain proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions of law, with supporting legal analysis, relevant to the 
contents of the pleading. Motions to compel discovery must contain a 
certification by the moving party that a good faith attempt to resolve 
the dispute was made prior to filing the motion. All facts relied upon 
in motions must be supported by documentation or affidavits pursuant to 
the requirements of Sec. 1.720(c), except for those facts of which 
official notice may be taken.
    (c) The moving party shall provide a proposed order for adoption,

    (e) Oppositions to motions may be filed and served within five 
business days after the motion is filed and served and not after. 
Oppositions shall be limited to the specific issues and allegations 
contained in such motion; when a motion is incorporated in an answer to 
a complaint, the opposition to such motion shall not address any issues

Sec. 1.729  Discovery.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (i) of this section governing Accelerated 
Docket proceedings, a complainant may file with the Commission and serve 
on a defendant, concurrently with its complaint, a request for up to ten 
written interrogatories. A defendant may file with the Commission and 
serve on a complainant, during the period starting with the service of 
the complaint and ending with the service of its answer, a request for 
up to ten written interrogatories. A complainant may file with the 
Commission and serve on a defendant, within three calendar days of 
service of the defendant's answer, a request for up to five written 
interrogatories. Subparts of any interrogatory will be counted as 
separate interrogatories for purposes of compliance with this limit. 
Requests for interrogatories filed and served pursuant to this procedure 
may be used to seek discovery of any non-privileged matter that is 
relevant to the material facts in dispute in the pending proceeding, 
provided, however, that requests for interrogatories filed and served by 
a complainant after service of the defendant's answer shall be limited 
in scope to specific factual allegations made by the defendant in 
support of its affirmative defenses. This procedure may not be employed 
for the purpose of delay, harassment or obtaining information that is 
beyond the scope of permissible inquiry related to the material facts in 
dispute in the pending proceeding.
    (b) Requests for interrogatories filed and served pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section shall contain a listing of the 
interrogatories requested and an explanation of why the information 
sought in each interrogatory is both necessary to the resolution of the 
dispute and not available from any other source.
    (c) A responding party shall file with the Commission and serve on 
the propounding party any opposition and objections to the requests for 
interrogatories as follows:
    (1) By the defendant, within ten calendar days of service of the 
requests for interrogatories served simultaneously with the complaint 
and within five calendar days of the requests for interrogatories served 
following service of the answer;
    (2) By the complainant, within five calendar days of service of the 
requests for interrogatories; and
    (3) In no event less than three calendar days prior to the initial 
status conference as provided for in Sec. 1.733(a).
    (d) Commission staff will consider the requests for interrogatories, 
properly filed and served pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
along with any objections or oppositions thereto, properly filed and 
served pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, at the initial status 
conference, as provided for in Sec. 1.733(a)(5), and at that time 
determine the interrogatories, if any, to which parties shall respond, 
and set the schedule of such response.
    (e) The interrogatories ordered to be answered pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section are to be answered separately and fully in writing 
under oath or affirmation by the party served, or if such party is a 
public or private corporation or partnership or association, by any 
officer or agent who shall furnish such information as is available to 
the party. The answers shall be signed by the person making them. The 
answers shall be filed with the Commission and served on the propounding 
party.
    (f) A propounding party asserting that a responding party has 
provided an inadequate or insufficient response to Commission-ordered 
discovery request may file a motion to compel within ten days of the 
service of such response, or as otherwise directed by Commission staff, 
pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 1.727.
    (g) The Commission may, in its discretion, require parties to 
provide documents to the Commission in a scanned or other electronic 
format that provides:
    (1) Indexing by useful identifying information about the documents; 
and
    (2) Technology that allows staff to annotate the index so as to make 
the format an efficient means of reviewing the documents.
    (h) The Commission may allow additional discovery, including, but 
not

[[Page 196]]

limited to, document production, depositions and/or additional 
interrogatories. In its discretion, the Commission may modify the scope, 
means and scheduling of discovery in light of the needs of a particular 
case and the requirements of applicable statutory deadlines.
    (i) Discovery in Accelerated Docket proceedings. (1) Each party to 
an Accelerated Docket proceeding shall serve, with its initial pleading 
and with any reply statements in the pre-status-conference filing (see 
Sec. 1.726(g)(1)), copies of all documents in the possession, custody 
or control of the party that are likely to bear significantly on any 
claim or defense. For the purpose of this paragraph (i), document also 
shall include data compilations and tangible things. A document is 
likely to bear significantly on a claim or defense if it:
    (i) Appears likely to have an influence on, or affect the outcome 
of, a claim or defense;
    (ii) Reflects the relevant knowledge of persons who, if their 
potential testimony were known, might reasonably be expected to be 
deposed or called as a witness by any of the parties;
    (iii) Is something that competent counsel would consider reasonably 
necessary to prepare, evaluate or try a claim or defense; or
    (iv) Would not support the disclosing party's contentions.
    (2) In their Sec. 1.733(i)(4) pre-status-conference filings, 
parties to Accelerated Docket proceedings may request the production of 
additional documents. In their Sec. 1.733(i)(4) filings, parties may 
also seek leave to conduct a reasonable number of depositions, including 
depositions of expert witnesses, if any. When requesting additional 
discovery, each party shall be prepared at the status conference to 
justify its requests by identifying the specific issue or issues on 
which it expects to obtain evidence from each request.
    (3) Interrogatories shall not be routinely granted in Accelerated 
Docket proceedings. A party to an Accelerated Docket proceeding that 
prefers interrogatories to the other forms of available discovery, for 
reasons of convenience or expense, may seek leave in its Sec. 
1.733(i)(4) pre-status-conference filing to propound a limited number of 
interrogatories.
    (4) Expert Witnesses.
    (i) Any complainant in an Accelerated Docket proceeding that intends 
to rely on expert testimony for a purpose other than to rebut a 
defendant's expert evidence, shall identify its expert witnesses in the 
information designation required by Sec. 1.721(a)(10)(i). In its Sec. 
1.721(a)(10)(i) information designation, such a complainant shall also 
provide its expert statement. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4), an 
expert statement shall include a brief statement of the opinions to be 
expressed by the expert, the basis and reasons therefor and any data or 
other information that the witness considered in forming her opinions.
    (ii) Any defendant in an Accelerated Docket proceeding that intends 
to rely on expert testimony shall identify its expert witnesses in the 
information designation required by Sec. 1.724(f)(1). Such a defendant 
shall provide its expert statement with its Sec. 1.733(i)(4), pre-
status-conference filing.
    (iii) Any complainant in an Accelerated Docket proceeding that 
intends to rely on previously undisclosed expert testimony to rebut any 
portion of the defendant's case shall identify the expert and provide 
the appropriate expert statement at the initial status conference.
    (iv) Expert witnesses shall be subject to deposition in Accelerated 
Docket proceedings under the same rules and limitations applicable to 
fact witnesses.

Sec. 1.730  The Enforcement Bureau's Accelerated Docket.

    (a) Parties to formal complaint proceedings against common carriers 
within the responsibility of the Enforcement Bureau (see Sec. Sec. 
0.111, 0.311, 0.314 of this chapter) may request inclusion on the 
Bureau's Accelerated Docket. As set out in Sec. Sec. 1.720 through 
1.736, proceedings on the Accelerated Docket are subject to shorter 
pleading deadlines and certain other procedural rules that do not apply 
to other formal complaint proceedings before the Enforcement Bureau.

[[Page 197]]

    (b) Any party that contemplates filing a formal complaint may submit 
a request to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes 
Resolution Division, either by phone or in writing, seeking inclusion of 
its complaint, once filed, on the Accelerated Docket. In appropriate 
cases, Commission staff shall schedule and supervise pre-filing 
settlement negotiations between the parties to the dispute. If the 
parties do not resolve their dispute and the matter is accepted for 
handling on the Accelerated Docket, the complainant shall file its 
complaint with a letter stating that it has gained admission to the 
Accelerated Docket. When it files its complaint, such a complainant 
shall also serve a copy of its complaint on the Commission staff that 
supervised the pre-filing settlement discussions.
    (c) Within five days of receiving service of a complaint, any 
defendant in a formal complaint proceeding may submit by facsimile or 
hand delivery, to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes 
Resolution Division, a request seeking inclusion of its proceeding on 
the Accelerated Docket. Such a defendant contemporaneously shall 
transmit, in the same manner, a copy of its request to all parties to 
the proceeding. A defendant submitting such a request shall file and 
serve its answer in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 1.724(k), 
except that the defendant shall not be required to serve with its answer 
the automatic document production required by Sec. Sec. 1.724(k)(7) and 
1.729(i)(1). In proceedings accepted onto the Accelerated Docket at a 
defendant's request, the Commission staff will conduct supervised 
settlement discussions as appropriate. After accepting such a proceeding 
onto the Accelerated Docket, Commission staff will establish a schedule 
for the remainder of the proceeding, including the parties' Sec. 
1.729(i)(1) automatic production of documents.
    (d) During the thirty days following the effective date of these 
rules, any party to a pending formal complaint proceeding in which an 
answer has been filed or is past due may seek admission of the 
proceeding to the Accelerated Docket by submitting a request by 
facsimile or hand delivery to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's 
Market Disputes Resolution Division, with facsimile copies to all other 
parties to the proceeding by the same mode of transmission. If a pending 
proceeding is accepted onto the Accelerated Docket, Commission staff 
will conduct supervised settlement discussions if appropriate and 
establish a schedule for the remainder of the proceeding, including the 
parties' Sec. 1.729(i)(1) automatic production of documents if 
necessary.
    (e) In determining whether to admit a proceeding onto the 
Accelerated Docket, Commission staff may consider factors from the 
following, non-exclusive list:
    (1) Whether it appears that the parties to the dispute have 
exhausted the reasonable opportunities for settlement during the staff-
supervised settlement discussions.
    (2) Whether the expedited resolution of a particular dispute or 
category of disputes appears likely to advance competition in the 
telecommunications market.
    (3) Whether the issues in the proceeding appear suited for decision 
under the constraints of the Accelerated Docket. This factor may entail, 
inter alia, examination of the number of distinct issues raised in a 
proceeding, the likely complexity of the necessary discovery, and 
whether the complainant bifurcates any damages claims for decision in a 
separate proceeding. See Sec. 1.722(b).
    (4) Whether the complainant states a claim for violation of the Act, 
or Commission rule or order that falls within the Commission's 
jurisdiction.
    (5) Whether it appears that inclusion of a proceeding on the 
Accelerated Docket would be unfair to one party because of an 
overwhelming disparity in the parties' resources.
    (6) Such other factors as the Commission staff, within its 
substantial discretion, may deem appropriate and conducive to the prompt 
and fair adjudication of complaint proceedings.
    (f) If it appears at any time that a proceeding on the Accelerated 
Docket is no longer appropriate for such treatment, Commission staff may 
remove

[[Page 198]]

the matter from the Accelerated Docket either on its own motion or at 
the request of any party.
    (g) Minitrials.
    (1) In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the Commission may conduct a 
minitrial, or hearing-type proceeding, as an alternative to requiring 
that parties submit briefs in support of their cases. Minitrials 
typically will take place between 40 and 45 days after the filing of the 
complaint. A Commission Administrative Law Judge (``ALJ'') typically 
will preside at the minitrial, administer oaths to witnesses, and time 
the parties' presentation of their cases. In consultation with the 
Commission staff, the ALJ will rule on objections or procedural issues 
that may arise during the course of the minitrial.
    (2) Before a minitrial, each party will receive a specific time 
allotment in which it may present evidence and make argument during the 
minitrial. The ALJ or other Commission staff presiding at the minitrial 
will deduct from each party's time allotment any time that the party 
spends presenting either evidence or argument during the proceeding. The 
presiding official shall have broad discretion in determining any time 
penalty or deduction for a party who appears to be intentionally 
delaying either the proceeding or the presentation of another party's 
case. Within the limits imposed by its time allotment, a party may 
present evidence and argument in whatever manner or format it chooses, 
provided, however, that the submission of written testimony shall not be 
permitted.
    (3) Three days before a minitrial, each party to a proceeding shall 
serve on all other parties a copy of all exhibits that the party intends 
to introduce during the minitrial and a list of all witnesses, including 
expert witnesses, that the party may call during the minitrial. Service 
of this material shall be accomplished either by hand or by facsimile 
transmission. Objections to any exhibits or proposed witness testimony 
will be heard before the beginning of the minitrial.
    (4) No party will be permitted to call as a witness in a minitrial, 
or otherwise offer evidence from, an individual in that party's employ, 
unless the individual appears on the party's information designation 
(see Sec. Sec. 1.721(a)(10)(i) or 1.724(f)(1)) with a general 
description of the issues on which she will offer evidence. No party 
will be permitted to present expert evidence unless the party has 
complied fully with the expert-disclosure requirements of Sec. 
1.729(i)(4). The Commission may permit exceptions to the rules in this 
paragraph (g)(4) for good cause shown.
    (5) Two days before the beginning of the minitrial, parties shall 
file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. These submissions 
shall not exceed 40 pages per party. Within three days after the 
conclusion of the minitrial, parties may submit revised proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law to meet evidence introduced or 
arguments raised at the minitrial. These submissions shall not exceed 20 
pages per party.
    (6) The parties shall arrange for the stenographic transcription of 
minitrial proceedings so that transcripts are available and filed with 
the Commission no more than three days after the conclusion of the 
minitrial. Absent an agreement to the contrary, the cost of the 
transcript shall be shared equally between the parties to the 
proceeding.
    (h) Applications for review of staff decisions issued on delegated 
authority in Accelerated Docket proceedings shall comply with the filing 
and service requirements in Sec. 1.115(e)(4). In those Accelerated 
Docket proceedings which raise issues that may not be decided on 
delegated authority (see 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(1); 47 CFR 0.291(d)), the 
staff decision issued after the minitrial will be a recommended decision 
subject to adoption or modification by the Commission. Any party to the 
proceeding that seeks modification of the recommended decision may do so 
by filing comments challenging the decision within 15 days of its 
release by the Commission's Office of Media Relations. (Compare Sec. 
1.4(b)(2).) Opposition comments may be filed within 15 days of the 
comments challenging the decision; reply comments may be filed 10 days 
thereafter and shall be limited to issues raised in the opposition 
comments.
    (i) If no party files comments challenging the recommended decision, 
the

[[Page 199]]

Commission will issue its decision adopting or modifying the recommended 
decision within 45 days of its release. If parties to the proceeding 
file comments to the recommended decision, the Commission will issue its 
decision adopting or modifying the recommended decision within 30 days 
of the filing of the final comments.

Sec. 1.731  Confidentiality of information produced or exchanged by the parties.

    (a) Any materials generated in the course of a formal complaint 
proceeding may be designated as proprietary by that party if the party 
believes in good faith that the materials fall within an exemption to 
disclosure contained in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 
552(b) (1) through (9). Any party asserting confidentiality for such 
materials shall so indicate by clearly marking each page, or portion 
thereof, for which a proprietary designation is claimed. If a 
proprietary designation is challenged, the party claiming 
confidentiality shall have the burden of demonstrating, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that the material designated as 
proprietary falls under the standards for nondisclosure enunciated in 
the FOIA.
    (b) Materials marked as proprietary may be disclosed solely to the 
following persons, only for use in prosecuting or defending a party to 
the complaint action, and only to the extent necessary to assist in the 
prosecution or defense of the case:
    (1) Counsel of record representing the parties in the complaint 
action and any support personnel employed by such attorneys;
    (2) Officers or employees of the opposing party who are named by the 
opposing party as being directly involved in the prosecution or defense 
of the case;
    (3) Consultants or expert witnesses retained by the parties;
    (4) The Commission and its staff; and
    (5) Court reporters and stenographers in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of this section.
    (c) These individuals shall not disclose information designated as 
proprietary to any person who is not authorized under this section to 
receive such information, and shall not use the information in any 
activity or function other than the prosecution or defense in the case 
before the Commission. Each individual who is provided access to the 
information shall sign a notarized statement affirmatively stating that 
the individual has personally reviewed the Commission's rules and 
understands the limitations they impose on the signing party.
    (d) No copies of materials marked proprietary may be made except 
copies to be used by persons designated in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Each party shall maintain a log recording the number of copies 
made of all proprietary material and the persons to whom the copies have 
been provided.
    (e) Upon termination of a formal complaint proceeding, including all 
appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any 
proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received 
copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party. In 
addition, upon final termination of the complaint proceeding, any notes 
or other work product derived in whole or in part from the proprietary 
materials of an opposing or third party shall be destroyed.

<R05>
Sec. 1.732  Other required written submissions.

    (a) The Commission may, in its discretion, or upon a party's motion 
showing good cause, require the parties to file briefs summarizing the 
facts and issues presented in the pleadings and other record evidence.
    (b) Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, all briefs shall 
include all legal and factual claims and defenses previously set forth 
in the complaint, answer, or any other pleading submitted in the 
proceeding. Claims and defenses previously made but not reflected in the 
briefs will be deemed abandoned. The Commission may, in its discretion, 
limit the scope of any briefs to certain subjects or issues. A party 
shall attach to its brief copies of all documents, data compilations, 
tangible things, and affidavits upon which

[[Page 200]]

such party relies or intends to rely to support the facts alleged and 
legal arguments made in its brief and such brief shall contain a full 
explanation of how each attachment is relevant to the issues and matters 
in dispute. All such attachments to a brief shall be documents, data 
compilations or tangible things, or affidavits made by persons, that 
were identified by any party in its information designations filed 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1.721(a)(10)(i), (a)(10)(ii), 1.724(f)(1), 
(f)(2), and 1.726(d)(1), (d)(2). Any other supporting documentation or 
affidavits that is attached to a brief must be accompanied by a full 
explanation of the relevance of such materials and why such materials 
were not identified in the information designations. These briefs shall 
contain the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law which the 
filing party is urging the Commission to adopt, with specific citation 
to the record, and supporting relevant authority and analysis.
    (c) In cases in which discovery is not conducted, absent an order by 
the Commission that briefs be filed, parties may not submit briefs. If 
the Commission does authorize the filing of briefs in cases in which 
discovery is not conducted, briefs shall be filed concurrently by both 
the complainant and defendant at such time as designated by the 
Commission staff and in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (d) In cases in which discovery is conducted, briefs shall be filed 
concurrently by both the complainant and defendant at such time 
designated by the Commission staff.
    (e) Briefs containing information which is claimed by an opposing or 
third party to be proprietary under Sec. 1.731 shall be submitted to 
the Commission in confidence pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 0.459 
of this chapter and clearly marked ``Not for Public Inspection.'' An 
edited version removing all proprietary data shall also be filed with 
the Commission for inclusion in the public file. Edited versions shall 
be filed within five days from the date the unedited brief is submitted, 
and served on opposing parties.
    (f) Initial briefs shall be no longer than twenty-five pages. Reply 
briefs shall be no longer than ten pages. Either on its own motion or 
upon proper motion by a party, the Commission staff may establish other 
page limits for briefs.
    (g) The Commission may require the parties to submit any additional 
information it deems appropriate for a full, fair, and expeditious 
resolution of the proceeding, including affidavits and exhibits.
    (h) The parties shall submit a joint statement of stipulated facts, 
disputed facts, and key legal issues no later than two business days 
prior to the initial status conference, scheduled in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1.733(a).

<R05>
Sec. 1.733  Status conference.

    (a) In any complaint proceeding, the Commission may, in its 
discretion, direct the attorneys and/or the parties to appear before it 
for a status conference. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, and 
with the exception of Accelerated Docket proceedings, governed by 
paragraph (i) of this section, an initial status conference shall take 
place, at the time and place designated by the Commission staff, ten 
business days after the date the answer is due to be filed. A status 
conference may include discussion of:
    (1) Simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (2) The necessity for or desirability of additional pleadings or 
evidentiary submissions;
    (3) Obtaining admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties 
as to any or all of the matters in controversy;
    (4) Settlement of all or some of the matters in controversy by 
agreement of the parties;
    (5) Whether discovery is necessary and, if so, the scope, type and 
schedule for such discovery;
    (6) The schedule for the remainder of the case and the dates for any 
further status conferences; and
    (7) Such other matters that may aid in the disposition of the 
complaint.

[[Page 201]]

    (b)(1) Subject to paragraph (i) of this section governing 
Accelerated Docket proceedings, parties shall meet and confer prior to 
the initial status conference to discuss:
    (i) Settlement prospects;
    (ii) Discovery;
    (iii) Issues in dispute;
    (iv) Schedules for pleadings;
    (v) Joint statement of stipulated facts, disputed facts, and key 
legal issues; and
    (vi) In a 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B) proceeding, whether or not the 
parties agree to waive the 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B) 90-day resolution 
deadline.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (i) of this section governing Accelerated 
Docket proceedings, parties shall submit a joint statement of all 
proposals agreed to and disputes remaining as a result of such meeting 
to Commission staff at least two business days prior to the scheduled 
initial status conference.
    (c) In addition to the initial status conference referenced in 
paragraph (a) of this section, any party may also request that a 
conference be held at any time after the complaint has been filed.
    (d) During a status conference, the Commission staff may issue oral 
rulings pertaining to a variety of interlocutory matters relevant to the 
conduct of a formal complaint proceeding including, inter alia, 
procedural matters, discovery, and the submission of briefs or other 
evidentiary materials.
    (e) Parties may make, upon written notice to the Commission and all 
attending parties at least three business days prior to the status 
conference, an audio recording of the Commission staff's summary of its 
oral rulings. Alternatively, upon agreement among all attending parties 
and written notice to the Commission at least three business days prior 
to the status conference, the parties may make an audio recording of, or 
use a stenographer to transcribe, the oral presentations and exchanges 
between and among the participating parties, insofar as such 
communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the Commission 
staff, as well as the Commission staff's summary of its oral rulings. A 
complete transcript of any audio recording or stenographic transcription 
shall be filed with the Commission as part of the record, pursuant to 
the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The parties shall 
make all necessary arrangements for the use of a stenographer and the 
cost of transcription, absent agreement to the contrary, will be shared 
equally by all parties that agree to make the record of the status 
conference.
    (f) The parties in attendance, unless otherwise directed, shall 
either:
    (1) Submit a joint proposed order memorializing the oral rulings 
made during the conference to the Commission by 5:30 pm, Eastern Time, 
on the business day following the date of the status conference, or as 
otherwise directed by Commission staff. In the event the parties in 
attendance cannot reach agreement as to the rulings that were made, the 
joint proposed order shall include the rulings on which the parties 
agree, and each party's alternative proposed rulings for those rulings 
on which they cannot agree. Commission staff will review and make 
revisions, if necessary, prior to signing and filing the submission as 
part of the record. The proposed order shall be submitted both as hard 
copy and on computer disk in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 
1.734(d); or
    (2) Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, 
submit to the Commission by 5:30 pm., Eastern Time, on the third 
business day following the status conference or as otherwise directed by 
Commission staff either:
    (i) A transcript of the audio recording of the Commission staff's 
summary of its oral rulings;
    (ii) A transcript of the audio recording of the oral presentations 
and exchanges between and among the participating parties, insofar as 
such communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the 
Commission staff, and the Commission staff's summary of its oral 
rulings; or
    (iii) A stenographic transcript of the oral presentations and 
exchanges between and among the participating parties, insofar as such 
communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the Commission 
staff, and the Commission staff's summary of its oral rulings.

[[Page 202]]

    (g) Status conferences will be scheduled by the Commission staff at 
such time and place as it may designate to be conducted in person or by 
telephone conference call.
    (h) The failure of any attorney or party, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a waiver by 
that party and will not preclude the Commission staff from conferring 
with those parties and/or counsel present.
    (i) Accelerated Docket Proceedings. (1) In Accelerated Docket 
proceedings, the initial status conference will be held 10 days after 
the answer is due to be filed.
    (2) Prior to the initial status conference, the parties shall 
confer, either in person or by telephone, about:
    (i) Discovery to which they can agree;
    (ii) Facts to which they can stipulate; and
    (iii) Factual and legal issues in dispute.
    (3) Two days before the status conference, parties shall submit to 
Commission staff a joint statement of:
    (i) The agreements that they have reached with respect to discovery;
    (ii) The facts to which they have agreed to stipulate; and
    (iii) The disputed facts or legal issues of which they can agree to 
a joint statement.
    (4) Two days before the status conference, each party also shall 
submit to Commission staff a separate statement which shall include, as 
appropriate, the party's statement of the disputed facts and legal 
issues presented by the complaint proceeding and any additional 
discovery that the party seeks. A complainant that wishes to reply to a 
defendant's affirmative defense shall do so in its pre-status-conference 
filing. To the extent that this filing contains statements replying to 
an affirmative defense, the complainant shall include, and/or serve with 
the statement, the witness information and documents required in Sec. 
1.726(g)(3)-(4). A defendant that intends to rely on expert evidence 
shall include its expert statement in its pre-status conference filing. 
(See Sec. 1.729(i)(4)(ii).)

Sec. 1.734  Specifications as to pleadings, briefs, and other documents; subscription.

    (a) All papers filed in any formal complaint proceeding must be 
drawn in conformity with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.49 and 1.50.
    (b) All averments of claims or defenses in complaints and answers 
shall be made in numbered paragraphs. The contents of each paragraph 
shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of 
circumstances. Each claim founded on a separate transaction or 
occurrence and each affirmative defense shall be separately stated to 
facilitate the clear presentation of the matters set forth.
    (c) The original of all pleadings and other submissions filed by any 
party shall be signed by the party, or by the party's attorney. The 
signing party shall include in the document his or her address, 
telephone number, facsimile number and the date on which the document 
was signed. Copies should be conformed to the original. Unless 
specifically required by rule or statute, pleadings need not be 
verified. The signature of an attorney or party shall be a certificate 
that the attorney or party has read the pleading, motion, or other 
paper; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief 
formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is 
warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, 
modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed 
solely for purposes of delay or for any other improper purpose.
    (d) All proposed orders shall be submitted both as hard copies and 
on computer disk formatted to be compatible with the Commission's 
computer system and using the Commission's current wordprocessing 
software. Each disk should be submitted in ``read only'' mode. Each disk 
should be clearly labelled with the party's name, proceeding, type of 
pleading, and date of submission. Each disk should be accompanied by a 
cover letter. Parties who have submitted copies of tariffs or reports 
with their hard copies need not include such tariffs or reports on the 
disk. Upon showing of good cause, the

[[Page 203]]

Commission may waive the requirements of this paragraph.

Sec. 1.735  Copies; service; separate filings against multiple defendants.

    (a) Complaints may generally be brought against only one named 
carrier; such actions may not be brought against multiple defendants 
unless the defendant carriers are commonly owned or controlled, are 
alleged to have acted in concert, are alleged to be jointly liable to 
complainant, or the complaint concerns common questions of law or fact. 
Complaints may, however, be consolidated by the Commission for 
disposition.
    (b) The complainant shall file an original copy of the complaint, 
accompanied by the correct fee, in accordance with part 1, subpart G 
(see Sec. 1.1106) and, on the same day:
    (1) File three copies of the complaint with the Office of the 
Commission Secretary;
    (2) Serve two copies on the Market Disputes Resolution Division, 
Enforcement Bureau;
    (3) If the complaint is filed against a carrier concerning matters 
within the responsibility of the International Bureau (see Sec. 0.261 
of this chapter), serve a copy on the Chief, Policy Division, 
International Bureau; and
    (4) If a complaint is addressed against multiple defendants, pay a 
separate fee, in accordance with part 1, subpart G (see Sec. 1.1106), 
and file three copies of the complaint with the Office of the Commission 
Secretary for each additional defendant.
    (c) Generally, a separate file is set up for each defendant. An 
original plus two copies shall be filed of all pleadings and documents, 
other than the complaint, for each file number assigned.
    (d) The complainant shall serve the complaint by hand delivery on 
either the named defendant or one of the named defendant's registered 
agents for service of process on the same date that the complaint is 
filed with the Commission in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Upon receipt of the complaint by the Commission, the Commission 
shall promptly send, by facsimile transmission to each defendant named 
in the complaint, notice of the filing of the complaint. The Commission 
shall send, by regular U.S. mail delivery, to each defendant named in 
the complaint, a copy of the complaint. The Commission shall 
additionally send, by regular U.S. mail to all parties, a schedule 
detailing the date the answer will be due and the date, time and 
location of the initial status conference.
    (f) All subsequent pleadings and briefs filed in any formal 
complaint proceeding, as well as all letters, documents or other written 
submissions, shall be served by the filing party on the attorney of 
record for each party to the proceeding, or, where a party is not 
represented by an attorney, each party to the proceeding either by hand 
delivery, overnight delivery, or by facsimile transmission followed by 
regular U.S. mail delivery, together with a proof of such service in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.47(g). Service is deemed 
effective as follows:
    (1) Service by hand delivery that is delivered to the office of the 
recipient by 5:30 pm, local time of the recipient, on a business day 
will be deemed served that day. Service by hand delivery that is 
delivered to the office of the recipient after 5:30 pm, local time of 
the recipient, on a business day will be deemed served on the following 
business day;

    (a) Before designation for hearing. Any application not designated 
for hearing may be dismissed without prejudice at any time upon request 
of the applicant. An applicant's request for the return of an 
application that has been accepted for filing and consideration, but not

prejudice. The Commission may dismiss an application without prejudice 
before it has been designated for hearing when the applicant fails to

Sec. 1.767  Cable landing licenses.

    (a) Applications for cable landing licenses under 47 U.S.C. 34-39 
and Executive Order No. 10530, dated May 10, 1954, should be filed in 
accordance with the provisions of that Executive Order. These 
applications should contain:
    (1) The name, address and telephone number(s) of the applicant;
    (2) The Government, State, or Territory under the laws of which each 
corporate or partnership applicant is organized;
    (3) The name, title, post office address, and telephone number of 
the officer and any other contact point, such as legal counsel, to whom 
correspondence concerning the application is to be addressed;
    (4) A description of the submarine cable, including the type and 
number of channels and the capacity thereof;
    (5) A specific description of the cable landing stations on the 
shore of the United States and in foreign countries where the cable will 
land. The description shall include a map showing specific geographic 
coordinates, and may also include street addresses, of each landing 
station. The map must also specify the coordinates of any beach joint 
where those coordinates differ from the coordinates of the cable 
station. The applicant initially may file a general geographic 
description of the landing points; however, grant of the application 
will be conditioned on the Commission's final approval of a more 
specific description of the landing points, including all information 
required by this paragraph, to be filed by the applicant no later than 
ninety (90) days prior to construction. The Commission will give public 
notice of the filing of this description, and grant of the license will 
be considered final if the Commission does not notify the applicant 
otherwise in writing no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the 
specific description of the landing points, unless the Commission 
designates a different time period;
    (6) A statement as to whether the cable will be operated on a common 
carrier or non-common carrier basis;
    (7) A list of the proposed owners of the cable system, including 
each U.S. cable landing station, their respective voting and ownership 
interests in each U.S. cable landing station, their respective voting 
interests in the wet link portion of the cable system, and their 
respective ownership interests by segment in the cable;
    (8) For each applicant of the cable system, a certification as to 
whether the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier, 
including an entity that owns or controls a foreign cable landing 
station in any of the cable's destination markets. Include the 
citizenship of each applicant and information and certifications 
required in Sec. Sec. 63.18(h) through (k), and in Sec. 63.18(o), of 
this chapter;
    (9) A certification that the applicant accepts and will abide by the 
routine conditions specified in paragraph (g) of this section; and
    (10) Any other information that may be necessary to enable the 
Commission to act on the application.

    Note to paragraph (a)(10): Applicants for cable landing licenses may 
be subject to the consistency certification requirements of the Coastal 
Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C.

[[Page 208]]

1456, if they propose to conduct activities, in or outside of a coastal 
zone of a state with a federally-approved management plan, affecting any 
land or water use or natural resource of that state's coastal zone. 
Before filing their applications for a license to construct and operate 
a submarine cable system or to modify the construction of a previously 
approved submarine cable system, applicants must determine whether they 
are required to certify that their proposed activities will comply with 
the enforceable policies of a coastal state's approved management 
program. In order to make this determination, applicants should consult 
National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) regulations, 15 CFR 
part 930, subpart D, and review the approved management programs of 
coastal states in the vicinity of the proposed landing station to verify 
that this type of application is not a listed federal license activity 
requiring review and that no state has sought or received NOAA approval 
to review the application as an unlisted activity. If it is determined 
that any certification is required, applicants shall consult the 
affected coastal state(s) (or designated state agency(ies)) in 
determining the contents of any required consistency certification(s). 
Applicants may also consult the Office of Ocean and Coastal Management 
(OCRM) within NOAA for guidance. The cable landing license application 
filed with the Commission shall include any consistency certification 
required by section 1456(c)(3)(A) for any affected coastal state(s). 
Upon documentation from the applicant, or notification from each 
affected coastal state, that the state has either concurred, or by its 
inaction, is conclusively presumed to have concurred with the 
applicant's consistency certification, the Commission may take action on 
the application.

    (11)(i) If applying for authority to assign or transfer control of 
an interest in a cable system, the applicant shall complete paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section for both the transferor/assignor 
and the transferee/assignee. Only the transferee/assignee needs to 
complete paragraphs (a)(8) through (a)(9) of this section. At the 
beginning of the application, the applicant should also include a 
narrative of the means by which the transfer or assignment will take 
place. The application shall also specify, on a segment specific basis, 
the percentage of voting and ownership interests being transferred or 
assigned in the cable system, including in a U.S. cable landing station. 
The Commission reserves the right to request additional information as 
to the particulars of the transaction to aid it in making its public 
interest determination.
    (ii) In the event the transaction requiring an assignment or 
transfer of control application also requires the filing of a foreign 
carrier affiliation notification pursuant to Sec. 1.768, the applicant 
shall reference in the application the foreign carrier affiliation 
notification and the date of its filing. See Sec. 1.768. See also 
paragraph (g)(7) of this section (providing for post-transaction 
notification of pro forma assignments and transfers of control).
    (iii) An assignee or transferee must notify the Commission no later 
than thirty (30) days after either consummation of the assignment or 
transfer or a decision not to consummate the assignment or transfer. The 
notification shall identify the file numbers under which the initial 
license and the authorization of the assignment or transfer were 
granted.
    (b) These applications are acted upon by the Commission after 
obtaining the approval of the Secretary of State and such assistance 
from any executive department or establishment of the Government as it 
may require.
    (c) Original files relating to submarine cable landing licenses and 
applications for licenses since June 30, 1934, are kept by the 
Commission. Such applications for licenses (including all documents and 
exhibits filed with and made a part thereof, with the exception of any 
maps showing the exact location of the submarine cable or cables to be 
licensed) and the licenses issued pursuant thereto, with the exception 
of such maps, shall, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, be open 
to public inspection in the offices of the Commission in Washington, 
D.C.
    (d) Original files relating to licenses and applications for 
licenses for the landing operation of cables prior to June 30, 1934, 
were kept by the Department of State, and such files prior to 1930 have 
been transferred to the Executive and Foreign Affairs Branch of the 
General Records Office of the National Archives. Requests for inspection 
of these files should, however, be addressed to the Federal 
Communications Commission, Washington, D.C., 20554; and the Commission 
will obtain such files for a temporary period in

[[Page 209]]

order to permit inspection at the offices of the Commission.
    (e) A separate application shall be filed with respect to each 
individual cable system for which a license is requested, or for which 
modification or amendment of a previous license is requested. The 
application fee for a non common-carrier cable landing license is 
payment type code BJT. Applicants for common carrier cable landing 
licenses shall pay the fees for both a common carrier cable landing 
license (payment type code CXT) and overseas cable construction (payment 
type code BIT). There is no application fee for modification of a cable 
landing license, except that the fee for assignment or transfer of 
control of a cable landing license is payment type code CUT. See Sec. 
1.1107(2) of this chapter.
    (f) Applicants shall disclose to any interested member of the 
public, upon written request, accurate information concerning the 
location and timing for the construction of a submarine cable system 
authorized under this section. This disclosure shall be made within 30 
days of receipt of the request.
    (g) Routine conditions. Except as otherwise ordered by the 
Commission, the following rules apply to each licensee of a cable 
landing license granted on or after March 15, 2002:
    (1) Grant of the cable landing license is subject to:
    (i) All rules and regulations of the Federal Communications 
Commission;
    (ii) Any treaties or conventions relating to communications to which 
the United States is or may hereafter become a party; and
    (iii) Any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United 
States rescinding, changing, modifying or amending any rights accruing 
to any person by grant of the license;
    (2) The location of the cable system within the territorial waters 
of the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and 
upon its shores shall be in conformity with plans approved by the 
Secretary of the Army. The cable shall be moved or shifted by the 
licensee at its expense upon request of the Secretary of the Army, 
whenever he or she considers such course necessary in the public 
interest, for reasons of national defense, or for the maintenance and 
improvement of harbors for navigational purposes;
    (3) The licensee shall at all times comply with any requirements of 
United States government authorities regarding the location and 
concealment of the cable facilities, buildings, and apparatus for the 
purpose of protecting and safeguarding the cables from injury or 
destruction by enemies of the United States of America;
    (4) The licensee, or any person or company controlling it, 
controlled by it, or under direct or indirect common control with it, 
does not enjoy and shall not acquire any right to handle traffic to or 
from the United States, its territories or its possessions unless such 
service is authorized by the Commission pursuant to section 214 of the 
Communications Act, as amended;
    (5)(i) The licensee shall be prohibited from agreeing to accept 
special concessions directly or indirectly from any foreign carrier, 
including any entity that owns or controls a foreign cable landing 
station, where the foreign carrier possesses sufficient market power on 
the foreign end of the route to affect competition adversely in the U.S. 
market, and from agreeing to accept special concessions in the future.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, a special concession is defined 
as an exclusive arrangement involving services, facilities, or functions 
on the foreign end of a U.S. international route that are necessary to 
land, connect, or operate submarine cables, where the arrangement is not 
offered to similarly situated U.S. submarine cable owners, indefeasible-
right-of-user holders, or lessors, and includes arrangements for the 
terms for acquisition, resale, lease, transfer and use of capacity on 
the cable; access to collocation space; the opportunity to provide or 
obtain backhaul capacity; access to technical network information; and 
interconnection to the public switched telecommunications network.

    Note to paragraph (g)(5): Licensees may rely on the Commission's 
list of foreign carriers that do not qualify for the presumption that 
they lack market power in particular foreign points for purposes of 
determining which foreign carriers are the subject of the requirements 
of this section. The Commission's list of foreign carriers that do not

[[Page 210]]

qualify for the presumption that they lack market power is available 
from the International Bureau's World Wide Web site at http://
www.fcc.gov/ib.

    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section, the 
cable landing license and rights granted in the license shall not be 
transferred, assigned, or disposed of, or disposed of indirectly by 
transfer of control of the licensee, unless the Federal Communications 
Commission gives prior consent in writing;
    (7) A pro forma assignee or person or company that is the subject of 
a pro forma transfer of control of a cable landing license is not 
required to seek prior approval for the pro forma transaction. A pro 
forma assignee or person or company that is the subject of a pro forma 
transfer of control must notify the Commission no later than thirty (30) 
days after the assignment or transfer of control is consummated. The 
notification must certify that the assignment or transfer of control was 
pro forma, as defined in Sec. 63.24 of this chapter, and, together with 
all previous pro forma transactions, does not result in a change of the 
licensee's ultimate control. The licensee may file a single notification 
for an assignment or transfer of control of multiple licenses issued in 
the name of the licensee if each license is identified by the file 
number under which it was granted;
    (8) Unless the licensee has notified the Commission in the 
application of the precise locations at which the cable will land, as 
required by paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the licensee shall notify 
the Commission no later than ninety (90) days prior to commencing 
construction at that landing location. The Commission will give public 
notice of the filing of each description, and grant of the cable landing 
license will be considered final with respect to that landing location 
unless the Commission issues a notice to the contrary no later than 
sixty (60) days after receipt of the specific description. See paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section;
    (9) The Commission reserves the right to require the licensee to 
file an environmental assessment should it determine that the landing of 
the cable at the specific locations and construction of necessary cable 
landing stations may significantly affect the environment within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.1307 implementing the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969. See Sec. 1.1307(a) and (b). The cable landing license is 
subject to modification by the Commission under its review of any 
environmental assessment or environmental impact statement that it may 
require pursuant to its rules. See also Sec. 1.1306 note 1 and Sec. 
1.1307(c) and (d);
    (10) The Commission reserves the right, pursuant to section 2 of the 
Cable Landing License Act, 47 U.S.C. 35, Executive Order No. 10530 as 
amended, and section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
47 U.S.C. 214, to impose common carrier regulation or other regulation 
consistent with the Cable Landing License Act on the operations of the 
cable system if it finds that the public interest so requires;
    (11) The licensee, or in the case of multiple licensees, the 
licensees collectively, shall maintain de jure and de facto control of 
the U.S. portion of the cable system, including the cable landing 
stations in the United States, sufficient to comply with the 
requirements of the Commission's rules and any specific conditions of 
the license;
    (12) The licensee shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.768;
    (13) The cable landing license is revocable by the Commission after 
due notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to section 2 of the 
Cable Landing License Act, 47 U.S.C. 35, or for failure to comply with 
the terms of the license or with the Commission's rules; and
    (14) The licensee must notify the Commission within thirty (30) days 
of the date the cable is placed into service. The cable landing license 
shall expire twenty-five (25) years from the in-service date, unless 
renewed or extended upon proper application. Upon expiration, all rights 
granted under the license shall be terminated.
    (h) Applicants/Licensees. Except as otherwise required by the 
Commission, the following entities, at a minimum, shall be applicants 
for, and licensees on, a cable landing license:
    (1) Any entity that owns or controls a cable landing station in the 
United States; and

[[Page 211]]

    (2) All other entities owning or controlling a five percent (5%) or 
greater interest in the cable system and using the U.S. points of the 
cable system.
    (i) Processing of cable landing license applications. The Commission 
will take action upon an application eligible for streamlined 
processing, as specified in paragraph (k) of this section, within forty-
five (45) days after release of the public notice announcing the 
application as acceptable for filing and eligible for streamlined 
processing. If the Commission deems an application seeking streamlined 
processing acceptable for filing but ineligible for streamlined 
processing, or if an applicant does not seek streamlined processing, the 
Commission will issue public notice indicating that the application is 
ineligible for streamlined processing. Within ninety (90) days of the 
public notice, the Commission will take action upon the application or 
provide public notice that, because the application raises questions of 
extraordinary complexity, an additional 90-day period for review is 
needed. Each successive 90-day period may be so extended.
    (j) Applications for streamlining. Each applicant seeking to use the 
streamlined grant procedure specified in paragraph (i) of this section 
shall request streamlined processing in its application. Applications 
for streamlined processing shall include the information and 
certifications required by paragraph (k) of this section. On the date of 
filing with the Commission, the applicant shall also send a complete 
copy of the application, or any major amendments or other material 
filings regarding the application, to: U.S. Coordinator, EB/CIP, U.S. 
Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520-5818; 
Office of Chief Counsel/NTIA, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th St. and 
Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230; and Defense Information 
Systems Agency, Code RGC, 701 S. Courthouse Road, Arlington, Va. 22204, 
and shall certify such service on a service list attached to the 
application or other filing.
    (k) Eligibility for streamlining. Each applicant must demonstrate 
eligibility for streamlining by:
    (1) Certifying that it is not a foreign carrier and it is not 
affiliated with a foreign carrier in any of the cable's destination 
markets;
    (2) Demonstrating pursuant to Sec. 63.12(c)(l)(i) through (iii) of 
this chapter that any such foreign carrier or affiliated foreign carrier 
lacks market power; or
    (3) Certifying that the destination market where the applicant is, 
or has an affiliation with, a foreign carrier is a World Trade 
Organization (WTO) Member and the applicant agrees to accept and abide 
by the reporting requirements set out in paragraph (l) of this section. 
An application that includes an applicant that is, or is affiliated 
with, a carrier with market power in a cable's non-WTO Member 
destination country is not eligible for streamlining.
    (4) Certifying that for applications for a license to construct and 
operate a submarine cable system or to modify the construction of a 
previously approved submarine cable system, the submarine cable system 
will not be located in any states where the cable landing licenses may 
be subject to the consistency certification requirements of the Coastal 
Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1456.
    (l) Reporting Requirements Applicable to Licensees Affiliated with a 
Carrier with Market Power in a Cable's WTO Destination Market. Any 
licensee that is, or is affiliated with, a carrier with market power in 
any of the cable's WTO Member destination countries, and that requests 
streamlined processing of an application under paragraphs (j) and (k) of 
this section, must comply with the following requirements:
    (1) File quarterly reports summarizing the provisioning and 
maintenance of all network facilities and services procured from the 
licensee's affiliate in that destination market, within ninety (90) days 
from the end of each calendar quarter. These reports shall contain the 
following:
    (i) The types of facilities and services provided (for example, a 
lease of wet link capacity in the cable, collocation of licensee's 
equipment in the cable station with the ability to provide backhaul, or 
cable station and backhaul services provided to the licensee);

[[Page 212]]

    (ii) For provisioned facilities and services, the volume or quantity 
provisioned, and the time interval between order and delivery; and
    (iii) The number of outages and intervals between fault report and 
facility or service restoration; and
    (2) File quarterly circuit status reports, within ninety (90) days 
from the end of each calendar quarter and in the format set out by the 
Sec. 43.82 of this chapter annual circuit status manual with the 
exception that activated or idle circuits must be reported on a 
facility-by-facility basis and derived circuits need not be specified. 
See Sec. 63.10(c)(5) of this chapter.
    (m) (1) Except as specified in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, 
amendments to pending applications, and applications to modify a 
license, including amendments or applications to add a new applicant or 
licensee, shall be signed by each initial applicant or licensee, 
respectively. Joint applicants or licensees may appoint one party to act 
as proxy for purposes of complying with this requirement.
    (2) Any licensee that seeks to relinquish its interest in a cable 
landing license shall file an application to modify the license. Such 
application must include a demonstration that the applicant is not 
required to be a licensee under paragraph (h) of this section and that 
the remaining licensee(s) will retain collectively de jure and de facto 
control of the U.S. portion of the cable system sufficient to comply 
with the requirements of the Commission's rules and any specific 
conditions of the license, and must be served on each other licensee of 
the cable system.
    (n) Subject to the availability of electronic forms, all 
applications and notifications described in this section must be filed 
electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS). A 
list of forms that are available for electronic filing can be found on 
the IBFS homepage. For information on electronic filing requirements,

<R05>
Sec. 1.768  Notification by and prior approval for submarine cable landing

licensees that are or propose to become affiliated with a foreign carrier.

    Any entity that is licensed by the Commission (``licensee'') to land 
or operate a submarine cable landing in a particular foreign destination 
market that becomes, or seeks to become, affiliated with a foreign 
carrier that is authorized to operate in that market, including an 
entity that owns or controls a cable landing station in that market, 
shall notify the Commission of that affiliation.
    (a) Affiliations requiring prior notification: Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the licensee must notify the Commission, 
pursuant to this section, forty-five (45) days before consummation of 
either of the following types of transactions:
    (1) Acquisition by the licensee, or by any entity that controls the 
licensee, or by any entity that directly or indirectly owns more than 
twenty-five percent (25%) of the capital stock of the licensee, of a 
controlling interest in a foreign carrier that is authorized to operate 
in a market where the cable lands; or
    (2) Acquisition of a direct or indirect interest greater than 
twenty-five percent (25%), or of a controlling interest, in the capital 
stock of the licensee by a foreign carrier that is authorized to operate 
in a market where the cable lands, or by an entity that controls such a 
foreign carrier.
    (b) Exceptions: (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, 
the notification required by this section need

[[Page 213]]

not be filed before consummation, and may instead by filed pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section, if either of the following is true with 
respect to the named foreign carrier, regardless of whether the 
destination market where the cable lands is a World Trade Organization 
(WTO) or non-WTO Member:
    (i) The Commission has previously determined in an adjudication that 
the foreign carrier lacks market power in that destination market (for 
example, in an international section 214 application or a declaratory 
ruling proceeding); or
    (ii) The foreign carrier owns no facilities in that destination 
market. For this purpose, a carrier is said to own facilities if it 
holds an ownership, indefeasible-right-of-user, or leasehold interest in 
a cable landing station or in bare capacity in international or domestic 
telecommunications facilities (excluding switches).
    (2) In the event paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot be 
satisfied, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the 
notification required by this section need not be filed before 
consummation, and may instead be filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, if the licensee certifies that the destination market where the 
cable lands is a WTO Member and provides certification to satisfy either 
of the following:
    (i) The licensee demonstrates that its foreign carrier affiliate 
lacks market power in the cable's destination market pursuant to Sec. 
63.10(a)(3) of this chapter (see Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter); or
    (ii) The licensee agrees to comply with the reporting requirements 
contained in Sec. 1.767(l) effective upon the acquisition of the 
affiliation. See Sec. 1.767(l).
    (c) Notification after consummation: Any licensee that becomes 
affiliated with a foreign carrier and has not previously notified the 
Commission pursuant to the requirements of this section shall notify the 
Commission within thirty (30) days after consummation of the 
acquisition.

    Example 1 to paragraph (c). Acquisition by a licensee (or by any 
entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is 
under direct or indirect common control with the licensee) of a direct 
or indirect interest in a foreign carrier that is greater than twenty-
five percent (25%) but not controlling is subject to paragraph (c) of 
this section but not to paragraph (a) of this section.
    Example 2 to paragraph (c). Notification of an acquisition by a 
licensee of a hundred percent (100%) interest in a foreign carrier may 
be made after consummation, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, 
if the foreign carrier operates only as a resale carrier.
    Example 3 to paragraph (c). Notification of an acquisition by a 
foreign carrier from a WTO Member of a greater than twenty-five percent 
(25%) interest in the capital stock of the licensee may be made after 
consummation, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, if the licensee 
demonstrates in the post-notification that the foreign carrier lacks 
market power in the cable's destination market or the licensee agrees to 
comply with the reporting requirements contained in Sec. 1.767(l) 
effective upon the acquisition of the affiliation.

    (d) Cross-reference: In the event a transaction requiring a foreign 
carrier notification pursuant to this section also requires a transfer 
of control or assignment application pursuant to the requirements of the 
license granted under Sec. 1.767 or Sec. 1.767(g), the foreign carrier 
notification shall reference in the notification the transfer of control 
or assignment application and the date of its filing. See Sec. 
1.767(g).
    (e) Contents of notification: The notification shall certify the 
following information:
    (1) The name of the newly affiliated foreign carrier and the country 
or countries at the foreign end of the cable in which it is authorized 
to provide telecommunications services to the public or where it owns or 
controls a cable landing station;
    (2) Which, if any, of those countries is a Member of the World Trade 
Organization;
    (3) The name of the cable system that is the subject of the 
notification, and the FCC file number(s) under which the license was 
granted;
    (4) The name, address, citizenship, and principal business of any 
person or entity that directly or indirectly owns at least ten percent 
(10%) of the equity of the licensee, and the percentage of equity owned 
by each of those entities (to the nearest one percent (1%));
    (5) Interlocking directorates. The name of any interlocking 
directorates, as defined in Sec. 63.09(g) of this chapter,

[[Page 214]]

with each foreign carrier named in the notification. See Sec. 63.09(g) 
of this chapter.
    (6) With respect to each foreign carrier named in the notification, 
a statement as to whether the notification is subject to paragraph (a) 
or (c) of this section. In the case of a notification subject to 
paragraph (a) of this section, the licensee shall include the projected 
date of closing. In the case of a notification subject to paragraph (c) 
of this section, the licensee shall include the actual date of closing.
    (7) If a licensee relies on an exception in paragraph (b) of this 
section, then a certification as to which exception the foreign carrier 
satisfies and a citation to any adjudication upon which the licensee is 
relying. Licensees relying upon the exceptions in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section must make the required certified demonstration in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section or the certified commitment to comply with the 
reporting requirements in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section in the 
notification required by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) If the licensee seeks to be excepted from the reporting 
requirements contained in Sec. 1.767(l), the licensee should 
demonstrate that each foreign carrier affiliate named in the 
notification lacks market power pursuant to Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this 
chapter. See Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter.
    (g) Procedure. After the Commission issues a public notice of the 
submissions made under this section, interested parties may file 
comments within fourteen (14) days of the public notice.
    (1) If the Commission deems it necessary at any time before or after 
the deadline for submission of public comments, the Commission may 
impose reporting requirements on the licensee based on the provisions of 
Sec. 1.767(l). See Sec. 1.767(l).
    (2) In the case of a prior notification filed pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section in which the foreign carrier is authorized to 
operate in, or own a cable landing station in, a non-WTO Member, the 
licensee must demonstrate that it continues to serve the public interest 
for it to retain its interest in the cable landing license for that 
segment of the cable that lands in the non-WTO destination market by 
demonstrating either that the foreign carrier lacks market power in that 
destination market pursuant to Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter or the 
market offers effective opportunities for U.S. companies to land and 
operate a submarine cable in that country. If the licensee is unable to 
make either required showing or is notified that the affiliation may 
otherwise harm the public interest pursuant to the Commission's policies 
and rules under 47 U.S.C. 34 through 39 and Executive Order No. 10530, 
dated May 10, 1954, then the Commission may impose conditions necessary 
to address any public interest harms or may proceed to an immediate 
authorization revocation hearing.

    Note to paragraph (g)(2): The assessment of whether a destination 
market offers effective opportunities for U.S. companies to land and 
operate a submarine cable will be made under the standard established in 
Rules and Policies on Foreign Participation in the U.S. 
Telecommunications Market, Market Entry and Regulation of Foreign-
Affiliated Entities, IB Docket Nos. 97-142 and 95-22, Report and Order 
and Order on Reconsideration, 12 FCC Rcd 23891, 23946 at paragraph 130, 
62 FR 64741, December 9, 1997.

    (h) All licensees are responsible for the continuing accuracy of 
information provided pursuant to this section for a period of forty-five 
(45) days after filing. During this period if the information furnished 
is no longer accurate, the licensee shall as promptly as possible, and 
in any event within ten (10) days, unless good cause is shown, file with 
the Commission a corrected notification referencing the FCC file numbers 
under which the original notification was provided.
    (i) A licensee that files a prior notification pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section may request confidential treatment of its filing, 
pursuant to Sec. 0.459 of this chapter, for the first twenty (20) days 
after filing.
    (j) Subject to the availability of electronic forms, all 
notifications described in this section must be filed electronically 
through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS). A list of forms 
that are available for electronic filing can be found on the IBFS 
homepage. For information on

1.10018 and the IBFS homepage at http://www.fcc.gov/ibfs. See also 
Sec. Sec. 63.20 and 63.53.

    Note to Sec. 1.768: The terms ``affiliated'' and ``foreign 
carrier,'' as used in this section, are defined as in Sec. 63.09 of 
this chapter except that the term ``foreign carrier'' also shall include 
an entity that owns or controls a cable landing station in a foreign 
market.

    (a) Petition--(1) Content. Petitions seeking investigation, 
suspension, or rejection of a new or revised tariff filing or any 
provision thereof shall specify the filing's Federal Communications 
Commission tariff number and carrier transmittal number, the items 
against which protest is made, and the specific reasons why the 
protested tariff filing warrants investigation, suspension, or rejection 
under the Communications Act. No petition shall include a prayer that it 
also be considered a formal complaint. Any formal complaint shall be 
filed as a separate pleading as provided in Sec. 1.721.
    (i) Petitions seeking investigation, suspension, or rejection of a 
new or revised tariff filing or any provision of such a publication, 
must specify the pertinent Federal Communications Commission tariff 
number and carrier transmittal number; the matters protested; and the 
specific reasons why the tariff warrants investigation, suspension, or 
rejection. When a single petition asks for more than one form of relief, 
it must separately and distinctly plead and support each form of relief. 
However, no petition may ask that it also be considered a formal 
complaint. Formal complaints must be separately lodged, as provided in 
Sec. 1.721.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, tariff filings by nondominant 
carriers will be considered prima facie lawful, and will not be 
suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension 
shows:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That the harm alleged to competition would be more substantial 
than the injury to the public arising from the unavailability of the 
service pursuant to the rates and conditions proposed in the tariff 
filing;
    (C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not 
suspended; and
    (D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the 
public interest.
    (iii) For the purpose of this section, any tariff filing by a local 
exchange carrier filed pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 61.39 will 
be considered prima facie lawful and will not be suspended by the 
Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows that the cost 
and demand studies or average schedule information was not provided upon 
reasonable request. If such a showing is not made, then the filing will 
be considered prima facie lawful and will not be suspended by the 
Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows each of the 
following:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That any unreasonable rate would not be corrected in a 
subsequent filing;
    (C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not 
suspended; and
    (D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the 
public interest.

[[Page 216]]

    (iv) For the purposes of this section, tariff filings made pursuant 
to Sec. 61.49(b) by carriers subject to price cap regulation will be 
considered prima facie lawful, and will not be suspended by the 
Commission unless the petition shows that the support information 
required in Sec. 61.49(b) was not provided, or unless the petition 
requesting suspension shows each of the following:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That the suspension would not substantially harm other 
interested parties;
    (C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not 
suspended; and
    (D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the 
public interest.
    (v) For the purposes of this section, any tariff filing by a price 
cap LEC filed pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 61.42(d)(4)(ii) of 
this chapter will be considered prima facie lawful, and will not be 
suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension 
shows each of the following:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That any unreasonable rate would not be corrected in a 
subsequent filing;
    (C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not 
suspended; and
    (D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the 
public interest.
    (2) When filed. All petitions seeking investigation, suspension, or 
rejection of a new or revised tariff filing shall meet the filing 
requirements of this paragraph. In case of emergency and within the time 
limits provided, a telegraphic request for such relief may be sent to

Sec. 1.915  General application requirements.

    (a) General requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, for all Wireless Radio Services, station licenses, as defined 
in section 308(a) of the Communications Act, as amended, operator 
licenses, modifications or renewals of licenses, assignments or 
transfers of control of station licenses or any rights thereunder, and 
waiver requests associated with any of the foregoing shall be granted 
only upon an application filed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1.913 through 
1.917 of this part.
    (b)(1) Exception for emergency filings. The Commission may grant 
station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, without the 
filing of a formal application in the following cases:
    (i) an emergency found by the Commission to involve danger to life 
or property or to be due to damage to equipment;
    (ii) a national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by 
the Congress and during the continuance of any war in which the United 
States is engaged, when such action is necessary for the national 
defense or security or otherwise in furtherance of the war effort; or
    (iii) an emergency where the Commission finds that it would not be 
feasible to secure renewal applications from existing licensees or 
otherwise to follow normal licensing procedures.
    (2) No such authorization shall be granted for or continue in effect 
beyond the period of the emergency or war requiring it. The procedures 
to be followed for emergency requests submitted under this subparagraph 
are the same as for seeking special temporary authority under Sec. 
1.931 of this part. After the end of the period of emergency, the party 
must submit its request by filing the appropriate FCC form in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.919  Ownership information.

    (a) Applicants or licensees in Wireless Radio Services that are 
subject to the ownership reporting requirements of Sec. 1.2112 shall 
use FCC Form 602 to provide all ownership information required by the 
chapter.
    (b) Any applicant or licensee that is subject to the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 1.2112 or Sec. 1.2114 shall file an FCC Form 602, 
or file an updated form if the ownership information on a previously 
filed FCC Form 602 is not current, at the time it submits:
    (1) An initial application for authorization (FCC Form 601);
    (2) An application for license renewal (FCC Form 601);
    (3) An application for assignment of authorization or transfer of 
control (FCC Form 603); or
    (4) A notification of consummation of a pro forma assignment of 
authorization or transfer of control (FCC Form 603) under the 
Commission's forbearance procedures (see Sec. 1.948(c ) of this part).
    (5) An application reporting any reportable eligibility event, as 
defined in Sec. 1.2114.
    (c) Reporting of Cellular Cross-Ownership Interests. (1) A cellular 
licensee of one channel block in a cellular geographic service area 
(CGSA) must report current ownership information if the licensee, a 
party that owns a controlling or otherwise attributable interest in the 
licensee, or a party that actually controls the licensee, obtains a 
direct or indirect ownership interest of more than 10 percent in a 
cellular licensee, a party that owns a controlling or otherwise 
attributable interest in a cellular licensee, or a party that actually 
controls a cellular licensee, for the other channel block in an 
overlapping CGSA, if the overlap is located in whole or in part in a 
Rural Service Area (RSA), as defined in Sec. 22.909 of this chapter. 
The ownership information must be filed on a FCC Form 602 within 30 days 
of the date of consummation of the transaction and reflect the specific 
levels of investment.
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the following 
definitions and other provisions shall apply:
    (i) Non-controlling interests. A direct or indirect non-attributable 
interest in both systems is excluded from the reporting requirement set 
out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Ownership attribution. For purposes of paragraph (c) of this 
section, ownership and other interests in cellular licensees will be 
attributed to their holders pursuant to the following criteria:
    (A) Controlling interest shall be attributable. Controlling interest 
means majority voting equity ownership, any general partnership 
interest, or any

[[Page 228]]

means of actual working control (including negative control) over the 
operation of the licensee, in whatever manner exercised.
    (B) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
amounting to 20 percent or more of the equity, or outstanding stock, or 
outstanding voting stock of a cellular licensee shall be attributed.
    (C) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity if in excess of the amounts set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (D) Debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, 
options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of 
conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until 
converted.
    (E) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (F) Officers and directors of a cellular licensee shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in the entity with which 
they are so associated. The officers and directors of an entity that 
controls a cellular licensee shall be considered to have an attributable 
interest in the cellular licensee.
    (G) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest. (For example, if A owns 20 percent of B, and B owns 40 
percent of licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C would be 8 
percent. If A owns 20 percent of B, and B owns 51 percent of licensee C, 
then A's interest in licensee C would be 20 percent because B's 
ownership of C exceeds 50 percent.)
    (H) Any person who manages the operations of a cellular licensee 
pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have an 
attributable interest in such licensee if such person, or its affiliate, 
has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or 
activities that determine, or significantly influence:
    (1) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (2) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (3) The prices charged for such services.
    (I) Any licensee, or its affiliate, who enters into a joint 
marketing arrangements with a cellular licensee, or its affiliate, shall 
be considered to have an attributable interest, if such licensee or 
affiliate has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in 
practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence:
    (1) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (2) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (3) The prices charged for such services.
    (3) Sunset Provisions. This notification requirement will sunset at 
the earlier of:
    (i) Five years after February 14, 2005, or
    (ii) At the cellular licensee's specific deadline for renewal.
    (d) A single FCC Form 602 may be associated with multiple 
applications filed by the same applicant or licensee. If an applicant or 
licensee already has a current FCC Form 602 on file when it files an 
initial application, renewal application, application for assignment or 
transfer of control, or notification of a pro forma assignment or 
transfer, it may certify that it has a current FCC Form 602 on file.
    (e) No filing fee is required to submit or update FCC Form 602.
    (f) Applicants or licensees in Wireless Radio Services that are not 
subject to the ownership reporting requirements of Sec. 1.2112 are not 
required to file FCC Form 602. However, such applicants and licensees 
may be required by the rules applicable to such services to disclose the 
real party (or parties) in interest to the application, including (as 
required) a complete disclosure of the identity and relationship of 
those persons or entities directly or indirectly

[[Page 229]]

owning or controlling (or both) the applicant or licensee.

Sec. 1.923  Content of applications.

    (a) General. Applications must contain all information requested on 
the applicable form and any additional information required by the rules 
in this chapter and any rules pertaining to the specific service for 
which the application is filed.
    (b) Reference to material on file. Questions on application forms 
that call for specific technical data, or that can be answered yes or no 
or with another short answer, must be answered on the form. Otherwise, 
if documents, exhibits, or other lengthy showings already on file with 
the FCC contain information required in an application, the application 
may incorporate such information by reference, provided that:
    (1) The referenced information has been filed in ULS or, if manually 
filed outside of ULS, the information comprises more than one ``8\1/
2\x11'' page.
    (2) The referenced information is current and accurate in all 
material respects; and
    (3) The application states specifically where the referenced 
information can actually be found, including:
    (i) The station call sign or application file number and its 
location if the reference is to station files or previously filed 
applications;
    (ii) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal 
citations, if the reference is to a docketed proceeding.
    (c) Antenna locations. Applications for stations at fixed locations 
must describe each transmitting antenna site by its geographical 
coordinates and also by its street address, or by reference to a nearby 
landmark. Geographical coordinates, referenced to NAD83, must be 
specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of 
latitude and longitude.
    (d) Antenna structure registration. Owners of certain antenna 
structures must notify the Federal Aviation Administration and register 
with the Commission as required by Part 17 of this chapter. Applications 
proposing the use of one or more new or existing antenna structures must 
contain the FCC Antenna Registration Number(s) of each structure for 
which registration is required. If registration is not required, the 
applicant must provide information in its application sufficient for the 
Commission to verify this fact.
    (e) Environmental concerns. Each applicant is required to indicate 
at the time its application is filed whether or not a Commission grant 
of the application may have a significant environmental effect, as 
defined by Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter. If answered affirmatively, an 
Environmental Assessment, required by Sec. 1.1311 of this chapter, must 
be filed with the application and environmental review by the Commission 
must be completed prior to construction.
    (f) International coordination. Channel assignments and/or usage 
under this part are subject to the applicable provisions and 
requirements of treaties and other international agreements between the 
United States government and the governments of Canada and Mexico.
    (g) Quiet zones. Each applicant is required to comply with the 
``Quiet Zone'' rule (see Sec. 1.924).
    (h) Taxpayer Identification Number (TINs). Wireless applicants and 
licensees, including all attributable owners of auctionable licenses as 
defined by Sec. 1.2112 of this part, are required to provide their 
Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINS) (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6109) to 
the Commission, pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 
(DCIA). Under the DCIA, the FCC may use an applicant or licensee's TIN 
for purposes of collecting and reporting to the Department of the 
Treasury any delinquent amounts arising out of such person's 
relationship with the Government. The Commission will not publicly 
disclose applicant or licensee TINs unless authorized by law, but will 
assign a ``public identification number'' to each applicant or licensee 
registering a TIN. This public identification number will be used for 
agency purposes other than debt collection.
    (i) Unless an exception is set forth elsewhere in this chapter, each 
applicant must specify an address where the

[[Page 230]]

applicant can receive mail delivery by the United States Postal Service. 
This address will be used by the Commission to serve documents or direct 
correspondence to the applicant.

Sec. 1.924  Quiet zones.

    Areas implicated by this paragraph are those in which it is 
necessary to restrict radiation so as to minimize possible impact on the 
operations of radio astronomy or other facilities that are highly 
sensitive to interference. Consent throughout this paragraph means 
written consent from the quiet zone, radio astronomy, research, and 
receiving installation entity. The areas involved and procedures 
required are as follows:
    (a) NRAO, NRRO. The requirements of this paragraph are intended to 
minimize possible interference at the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, West 
Virginia, and at the Naval Radio Research Observatory site at Sugar 
Grove, Pendleton County, West Virginia.
    (1) Applicants and licensees planning to construct and operate a new 
or modified station at a permanent fixed location within the area 
bounded by N 39[deg]15[min]0.4[sec] on the north, W 
78[deg]29[min]59.0[sec] on the east, N 37[deg]30[min]0.4[sec] on the 
south, and W 80[deg]29[min]59.2[sec] on the west must notify the 
Director, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Post Office Box No. 2, 
Green Bank, West Virginia 24944, in writing, of the technical details of 
the proposed operation. The notification must include the geographical 
coordinates of the antenna location, the antenna height, antenna 
directivity (if any), the channel, the emission type and power.
    (2) When an application for authority to operate a station is filed 
with the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section may be made prior to, or simultaneously with the application. 
The application must state the date that notification in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section was made. After receipt of such 
applications, the FCC will allow a period of 20 days for comments or 
objections in response to the notifications indicated. If an applicant 
submits written consent from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 
for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio Research Observatory, the FCC 
will process the application without awaiting the conclusion of the 20-
day period. For services that do not require individual station 
authorization, entities that have obtained written consent from the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the 
Naval Radio Research Observatory may begin to operate new or modified 
facilities prior to the end of the 20-day period. In instances in which 
notification has been made to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 
prior to application filing, the applicant must also provide notice to 
the quiet zone entity upon actual filing of the application with the 
FCC. Such notice will be made simultaneous with the filing of the 
application and shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (3) If an objection is received during the 20-day period from the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the 
Naval Radio Research Observatory, the FCC will, after consideration of 
the record, take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (b) Table Mountain. The requirements of this paragraph are intended 
to minimize possible interference at the Table Mountain Radio Receiving 
Zone of the Research Laboratories of the Department of Commerce located 
in Boulder County, Colorado.
    (1) Licensees and applicants planning to construct and operate a new 
or modified station at a permanent fixed location in the vicinity of 
Boulder County, Colorado are advised to give consideration, prior to 
filing applications, to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio 
Receiving Zone from interference. To prevent degradation of the present 
ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks 
to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding 
reflected signals) received on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of 
coordinates 40[deg]07[min]49.9[sec] North Latitude, 
105[deg]14[min]42.0[sec] West Longitude) resulting from new assignments 
(other than mobile stations) or from the modification

[[Page 231]]

or relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the values given in 
the following table:

that have no reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or 
power flux density figures in the above table would be exceeded by their 
proposed radio facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for:
    (i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) of the Table 
Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) transmitting 
with 50 watts or more effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary 
plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain 
Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations located with 16 kilometers (10 miles) transmitting 
with 1 kW or more ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) transmitting 
with 25 kW or more ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (3) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, NOAA R/OM62, 
325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305; telephone 303-497-6548, in advance of 
filing their applications with the Commission.
    (4) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, such consultation may 
avoid the filing of objections from the Department of Commerce or 
institution of proceedings to modify the authorizations of stations that 
radiate signals with a field strength or power flux density at the site 
in excess of those specified herein.
    (c) Federal Communications Commission protected field offices. The 
requirements of this paragraph are intended to minimize possible 
interference to FCC monitoring activities.
    (1) Licensees and applicants planning to construct and operate a new 
or modified station at a permanent fixed location in the vicinity of an 
FCC protected field office are advised to give consideration, prior to 
filing applications, to the need to avoid interfering with the 
monitoring activities of that office. FCC protected field offices are 
listed in Sec. 0.121 of this chapter.
    (2) Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that could 
produce on any channel a direct wave fundamental field strength of 
greater than 10 mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m\2\ power flux density assuming a free 
space characteristic impedance of 120[pi] [Omega]) in the authorized 
bandwidth at the protected field office may be examined to determine the 
potential for interference with monitoring activities. After 
consideration of the effects of the predicted field strength of the 
proposed station, including the cumulative effects of the signal from 
the proposed station with other ambient radio field strength levels at 
the protected field office, the FCC may add a condition restricting 
radiation toward the protected field office to the station 
authorization.
    (3) In the event that the calculated field strength exceeds 10 mV/m 
at the protected field office site, or if there is any question whether 
field strength levels might exceed that level, advance consultation with 
the FCC to discuss possible measures to avoid interference to monitoring 
activities should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Enforcement Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC 20554.
    (4) Advance consultation is recommended for applicants that have no 
reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or power flux 
density figure indicated would be exceeded by their proposed radio 
facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for:

[[Page 232]]

    (i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) of the 
protected field office;
    (ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the protected field offices.
    (iii) Stations located within 16 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kw or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the protected field office;
    (iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kw or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the protected field office;
    (v) Advance coordination for stations transmitting on channels above 
1000 MHz is recommended only if the proposed station is in the vicinity 
of a protected field office designated as a satellite monitoring 
facility in Sec. 0.121 of this chapter.
    (vi) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, such consultation may 
serve to avoid the need for later modification of the authorizations of 
stations that interfere with monitoring activities at protected field 
offices.
    (d) Notification to the Arecibo Observatory. The requirements in 
this section are intended to minimize possible interference at the 
Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Licensees must make reasonable 
efforts to protect the Observatory from interference. Licensees planning 
to construct and operate a new station at a permanent fixed location on 
the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques or Culebra in 
services in which individual station licenses are issued by the FCC; 
planning to construct and operate a new station at a permanent fixed 
location on these islands that may cause interference to the operations 
of the Arecibo Observatory in services in which individual station 
licenses are not issued by the FCC; or planning a modification of any 
existing station at a permanent fixed location on these islands that 
would increase the likelihood of causing interference to the operations 
of the Arecibo Observatory must notify the Interference Office, Arecibo 
Observatory, HC3 Box 53995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00612, in writing or 
electronically (e-mail address: prcz@naic.edu), of the technical 
parameters of the planned operation. Carriers may wish to use the 
interference guidelines provided by Cornell University as guidance in 
designing facilities to avoid interference to the Observatory. The 
notification must include identification of the geographical coordinates 
of the antenna location (NAD-83 datum), the antenna height, antenna 
directivity (if any), proposed channel and FCC Rule Part, type of 
emission, and effective isotropic radiated power.
    (1) In the Amateur radio service:
    (i) The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to 
repeaters that transmit on the 1.2 cm or shorter wavelength bands; and
    (ii) The coordination provision of paragraph (d) of this section 
does not apply to repeaters that are located 16 km or more from the 
Arecibo observatory.
    (2) In services in which individual station licenses are issued by 
the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (d) of this section may 
be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the application 
with the FCC, and at least 20 days in advance of the applicant's planned 
operation. The application must state the date that notification in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section was made. In services in 
which individual station licenses are not issued by the FCC, the 
notification required in paragraph (d) of this section should be sent at 
least 45 days in advance of the applicant's planned operation. In the 
latter services, the Interference Office must inform the FCC of a 
notification by an applicant within 20 days if the Office plans to file 
comments or objections to the notification. After the FCC receives an 
application from a service applicant or is informed by the Interference 
Office of a notification from a service applicant, the FCC will allow 
the Interference Office a period of 20 days for comments or objections 
in response to the application or notification. If an applicant submits 
written consent from the Interference Office, the FCC will process the 
application without awaiting the conclusion

[[Page 233]]

of the 20-day period. For services that do not require individual 
station authorization, entities that have obtained written consent from 
the Interference Office may begin to operate new or modified facilities 
prior to the end of the 20-day period. In instances in which 
notification has been made to the Interference Office prior to 
application filing, the applicant must also provide notice to the 
Interference Office upon actual filing of the application with the FCC. 
Such notice will be made simultaneous with the filing of the application 
and shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) If an objection to any planned service operation is received 
during the 20-day period from the Interference Office, the FCC will take 
whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (4) The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to 
operations that transmit on frequencies above 15 GHz.
    (e) Government satellite earth stations. (1) To minimize or avoid 
harmful interference to Government Satellite Earth Stations located in 
the Denver, Colorado and Washington, DC areas, any application for a new 
station license to operate in the 17.8-19.7 GHz band (except for low 
power operations governed by Sec. 101.147(r)(10) of this chapter), or 
for modification of an existing station license in this band which would 
change the frequency, power, emission, modulation, polarization, antenna 
height or directivity, or location of such a station, must be 
coordinated with the Federal Government by the Commission before an 
authorization will be issued, if the station or proposed station is 
located in whole or in part within any of the areas defined by the 
following rectangles or circles:

Sec. 1.925  Waivers.

    (a) Waiver requests generally. The Commission may waive specific 
requirements of the rules on its own motion or upon request. The fees 
for such waiver requests are set forth in Sec. 1.1102 of this part.
    (b) Procedure and format for filing waiver requests. (1) Requests 
for waiver of rules associated with licenses or applications in the 
Wireless Radio Services must be filed on FCC Form 601, 603, or 605.
    (2) Requests for waiver must contain a complete explanation as to 
why the waiver is desired. If the information necessary to support a 
waiver request is already on file, the applicant may cross-reference the 
specific filing where the information may be found.
    (3) The Commission may grant a request for waiver if it is shown 
that:
    (i) The underlying purpose of the rule(s) would not be served or 
would be frustrated by application to the instant case, and that a grant 
of the requested waiver would be in the public interest; or
    (ii) In view of unique or unusual factual circumstances of the 
instant case, application of the rule(s) would be inequitable, unduly 
burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or the applicant has no 
reasonable alternative.
    (4) Applicants requiring expedited processing of their request for 
waiver shall clearly caption their request for

[[Page 235]]

waiver with the words ``WAIVER--EXPEDITED ACTION REQUESTED.''
    (c) Action on Waiver Requests. (i) The Commission, in its 
discretion, may give public notice of the filing of a waiver request and 
seek comment from the public or affected parties.
    (ii) Denial of a rule waiver request associated with an application 
renders that application defective unless it contains an alternative 
proposal that fully complies with the rules, in which event, the 
application will be processed using the alternative proposal as if the 
waiver had not been requested. Applications rendered defective may be 
dismissed without prejudice.

Sec. 1.927  Amendment of applications.

    (a) Pending applications may be amended as a matter of right if they 
have not been designated for hearing or listed in a public notice as 
accepted for filing for competitive bidding, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (b) Applicants for an initial license in auctionable services may 
amend such applications only in accordance with Subpart Q of this part.
    (c) Amendments to non-auction applications that are applied for 
under Part 101 or that resolve mutual exclusivity may be filed at any 
time, subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.945 of this part.
    (d) Any amendment to an application for modification must be 
consistent with, and must not conflict with, any other application for 
modification regarding that same station.
    (e) Amendments to applications designated for hearing may be allowed 
by the presiding officer or, when a proceeding is stayed or otherwise 
pending before the full Commission, may be allowed by the Commission for 
good cause shown. In such instances, a written petition demonstrating 
good cause must be submitted and served upon the parties of record.
    (f) Amendments to applications are also subject to the service-
specific rules in applicable parts of this chapter.
    (g) Where an amendment to an application specifies a substantial 
change in beneficial ownership or control (de jure or de facto) of an 
applicant, the applicant must provide an exhibit with the amendment 
application containing an affirmative, factual showing as set forth in 
Sec. 1.948(i)(2).
    (h) Where an amendment to an application constitutes a major change, 
as defined in Sec. 1.929, the amendment shall be treated as a new 
application for determination of filing date, public notice, and 
petition to deny purposes.
    (i) If a petition to deny or other informal objection has been 
filed, a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be served on the 
petitioner. If the FCC has issued a public notice stating that the 
application appears to be mutually exclusive with another application 
(or applications), a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be 
served on any such mutually exclusive applicant (or applicants).

Sec. 1.928  Frequency coordination, Canada.

    (a) As a result of mutual agreements, the Commission has, since May 
1950 had an arrangement with the Canadian Department of Communications 
for the exchange of frequency assignment information and engineering 
comments on proposed assignments along the Canada-United States borders 
in certain bands above 30 MHz. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, this arrangement involves assignments in the following 
frequency bands.

radio frequency allotment plan along the United States-Canada borders 
utilized by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of 
Transport, respectively, may be excepted from this arrangement at the 
discretion of the referring agency.
    (d) Assignments proposed in any radio service in frequency bands 
below 470 MHz appropriate to this arrangement, other than those for 
stations in the Domestic Public (land mobile or fixed) category, may be 
excepted from this arrangement at the discretion of the referring agency 
if a base station assignment has been made previously under the terms of 
this arrangement or prior to its adoption in the same radio service and 
on the same frequency and in the local area, and provided the basic 
characteristics of the additional station are sufficiently similar 
technically to the original assignment to preclude harmful interference 
to existing stations across the border.
    (e) For bands below 470 MHz, the areas which are involved lie 
between Lines A and B and between Lines C and D, which are described as 
follows:

    Line A--Begins at Aberdeen, Wash., running by great circle arc to

Sec. 1.931  Application for special temporary authority.

    (a) Wireless Telecommunications Services. (1) In circumstances 
requiring immediate or temporary use of station in the Wireless 
Telecommunications Services, carriers may request special temporary 
authority (STA) to operate new or modified equipment. Such requests must 
be filed electronically using FCC Form 601 and must contain complete 
details about the proposed operation and the circumstances that fully 
justify and necessitate the grant of STA. Such requests should be filed 
in time to be received by the Commission at least 10 days prior to the 
date of proposed operation or, where an extension is sought, 10 days 
prior to the expiration date of the existing STA. Requests received less 
than 10 days prior to the desired date of operation may be given 
expedited consideration

[[Page 240]]

only if compelling reasons are given for the delay in submitting the 
request. Otherwise, such late-filed requests are considered in turn, but 
action might not be taken prior to the desired date of operation. 
Requests for STA must be accompanied by the proper filing fee.
    (2) Grant without Public Notice. STA may be granted without being 
listed in a Public Notice, or prior to 30 days after such listing, if:
    (i) The STA is to be valid for 30 days or less and the applicant 
does not plan to file an application for regular authorization of the 
subject operation;
    (ii) The STA is to be valid for 60 days or less, pending the filing 
of an application for regular authorization of the subject operation;
    (iii) The STA is to allow interim operation to facilitate completion 
of authorized construction or to provide substantially the same service 
as previously authorized; or
    (iv) The STA is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary 
circumstances requiring operation in the public interest and that delay 
in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public 
interest.
    (3) Limit on STA term. The Commission may grant STA for a period not 
to exceed 180 days under the provisions of section 309(f) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, (47 U.S.C. 309(f)) if 
extraordinary circumstances so require, and pending the filing of an 
application for regular operation. The Commission may grant extensions 
of STA for a period of 180 days, but the applicant must show that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.
    (b) Private Wireless Services. (1) A licensee of, or an applicant 
for, a station in the Private Wireless Services may request STA not to 
exceed 180 days for (A) operation of a new station or (B) operation of a 
licensed station in a manner which is beyond the scope of that 
authorized by the existing license. See Sec. Sec. 1.962(b)(5) and (f). 
Where the applicant, seeking a waiver of the 180 day limit, requests STA 
to operate as a private mobile radio service provider for a period 
exceeding 180 days, evidence of frequency coordination is required. 
Requests for shorter periods do not require coordination and, if 
granted, will be authorized on a secondary, non-interference basis.
    (2) STA may be granted in the following circumstances:
    (i) In emergency situations;
    (ii) To permit restoration or relocation of existing facilities to 
continue communication service;
    (iii) To conduct tests to determine necessary data for the 
preparation of an application for regular authorization;
    (iv) For a temporary, non-recurring service where a regular 
authorization is not appropriate;
    (v) In other situations involving circumstances which are of such 
extraordinary nature that delay in the institution of temporary 
operation would seriously prejudice the public interest.
    (3) The nature of the circumstance which, in the opinion of the 
applicant justifies issuance of STA, must be fully described in the 
request. Applications for STA must be filed at least 10 days prior to 
the proposed operation. Applications filed less than 10 days prior to 
the proposed operation date will be accepted only upon a showing of good 
cause.
    (4) The Commission may grant extensions of STA for a period of 180 
days, but the applicant must show that extraordinary circumstances 
warrant such an extension.
    (5) In special situations defined in Sec. 1.915(b)(1), a request 
for STA may be made by telephone or telegraph provided a properly signed 
application is filed within 10 days of such request.
    (6) An applicant for an Aircraft Radio Station License may operate 
the radio station pending issuance of an Aircraft Radio Station License 
by the Commission for a period of 90 days under temporary operating 
authority, evidenced by a properly executed certification made on FCC 
Form 605.
    (7) Unless the Commission otherwise prescribes, a person who has 
been granted an operator license of Novice, Technician, Technician Plus, 
General, or Advanced class and who has properly submitted to the 
administering VEs an application document for an operator license of a 
higher class, and who holds a CSCE indicating that he/she has completed 
the necessary examinations within the previous 365

[[Page 241]]

days, is authorized to exercise the rights and privileges of the higher 
operator class until final disposition of the application or until 365 
days following the passing of the examination, whichever comes first.
    (8) An applicant for a Ship Radio station license may operate the 
radio station pending issuance of the ship station authorization by the 
Commission for a period of 90 days, under a temporary operating 
authority, evidenced by a properly executed certification made on FCC 
Form 605.
    (9) An applicant for a station license in the Industrial/Business 
pool (other than an applicant who seeks to provide commercial mobile 
radio service as defined in Part 20 of this chapter) utilizing an 
already authorized facility may operate the station for a period of 180 
days, under a temporary permit, evidenced by a properly executed 
certification made on FCC Form 601, after filing an application for a 
station license together with evidence of frequency coordination, if 
required, with the Commission. The temporary operation of stations, 
other than mobile stations, within the Canadian coordination zone will 
be limited to stations with a maximum of 5 watts effective radiated 
power and a maximum antenna height of 20 feet (6.1 meters) above average 
terrain.
    (10) An applicant for a radio station license under Part 90, Subpart 
S, of this chapter (other than an applicant who seeks to provide 
commercial mobile radio service as defined in part 20 of this chapter) 
to utilize an already existing Specialized Mobile Radio System (SMR) 
facility or to utilize an already licensed transmitter may operate the 
radio station for a period of up to 180 days, under a temporary permit. 
Such request must be evidenced by a properly executed certification of 
FCC Form 601 after the filing of an application for station license, 
provided that the antenna employed by the control station is a maximum 
of 20 feet (6.1 meters) above a man-made structure (other than an 
antenna tower) to which it is affixed.
    (11) An applicant for an itinerant station license, an applicant for 
a new private land mobile radio station license in the frequency bands 
below 470 MHz and in the one-way paging 929-930 MHz band (other than a 
commercial mobile radio service applicant or licensee on these bands) or 
an applicant seeking to modify or acquire through assignment or transfer 
an existing station below 470 MHz or in the one-way paging 929-930 MHz 
band may operate the proposed station during the pendency of its 
application for a period of up to 180 days under a conditional permit. 
Conditional operations may commence upon the filing of a properly 
completed application that complies with Sec. 90.127 if the 
application, when frequency coordination is required, is accompanied by 
evidence of frequency coordination in accordance with Sec. 90.175 of 
this chapter. Operation under such a permit is evidenced by the properly 
executed Form 601 with certifications that satisfy the requirements of 
Sec. 90.159(b).
    (12) An applicant for a General Mobile Radio Service system license, 
sharing a multiple-licensed or cooperative shared base station used as a 
mobile relay station, may operate the system for a period of 180 days, 
under a Temporary Permit, evidenced by a properly executed certification 
made on FCC Form 605.

<R05>
Sec. 1.934  Defective applications and dismissal.

    (a) Dismissal of applications. The Commission may dismiss any 
application in the Wireless Radio Services at the request of the 
applicant; if the application is mutually exclusive with another 
application that is selected or granted in accordance with the rules in 
this part; for failure to prosecute or if the application is found to be 
defective; if the requested spectrum is not available; or if the 
application is untimely filed. Such dismissal may be ``without 
prejudice,'' meaning that the Commission may accept from the applicant 
another application for the same purpose at a later time, provided that 
the application is otherwise timely. Dismissal ``with prejudice'' means 
that the Commission will not accept another application from the 
applicant for the same purpose for a period of one year. Unless 
otherwise provided in this part, a dismissed application will not be 
returned to the applicant.
    (1) Dismissal at request of applicant. Any applicant may request 
that its application be withdrawn or dismissed. A request for the 
withdrawal of an application after it has been listed on Public Notice 
as tentatively accepted for filing is considered to be a request for 
dismissal of that application without prejudice.
    (i) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application with 
prejudice, the Commission will dismiss that application with prejudice.
    (ii) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application without 
prejudice, the Commission will dismiss that application without 
prejudice, unless:
    (A) It has been designated for comparative hearing; or

[[Page 243]]

    (B) It is an application for which the applicant submitted the 
winning bid in a competitive bidding process.
    (2) If an applicant who is a winning bidder for a license in a 
competitive bidding process requests dismissal of its short-form or 
long-form application, the Commission will dismiss that application with 
prejudice. The applicant will also be subject to default payments under 
Subpart Q of this part.
    (3) An applicant who requests dismissal of its application after 
that application has been designated for comparative hearing may submit 
a written petition requesting that the dismissal be without prejudice. 
Such petition must demonstrate good cause and be served upon all parties 
of record. The Commission may grant such petition and dismiss the 
application without prejudice or deny the petition and dismiss the 
application with prejudice.
    (b) Dismissal of mutually exclusive applications not granted. The 
Commission may dismiss mutually exclusive applications:
    (1) For which the applicant did not submit the winning bid in a 
competitive bidding process; or
    (2) That receive comparative consideration in a hearing but are not 
granted by order of the presiding officer.
    (c) Dismissal for failure to prosecute. The Commission may dismiss 
applications for failure of the applicant to prosecute or for failure of 
the applicant to respond substantially within a specified time period to 
official correspondence or requests for additional information. Such 
dismissal will generally be without prejudice if the failure to 
prosecute or respond occurred prior to designation of the application 
for comparative hearing, but may be with prejudice in cases of non-
compliance with Sec. 1.945 of this part. Dismissal will generally be 
with prejudice if the failure to prosecute or respond occurred after 
designation of the application for comparative hearing. The Commission 
may dismiss applications with prejudice for failure of the applicant to 
comply with requirements related to a competitive bidding process.
    (d) Dismissal as defective. The Commission may dismiss without 
prejudice an application that it finds to be defective. An application 
is defective if:
    (1) It is unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers to 
questions, informational showings, or other matters of a formal 
character;
    (2) It requests an authorization that would not comply with one or 
more of the Commission's rules and does not contain a request for waiver 
of these rule(s), or in the event the Commission denies such a waiver 
request, does not contain an alternative proposal that fully complies 
with the rules;
    (3) The appropriate filing fee has not been paid; or
    (4) The FCC Registration Number (FRN) has not been provided.
    (5) It requests a vanity call sign and the applicant has pending 
another vanity call sign application with the same receipt date.
    (e) Dismissal because spectrum not available. The Commission may 
dismiss applications that request spectrum which is unavailable because:
    (1) It is not allocated for assignment in the specific service 
requested;
    (2) It was previously assigned to another licensee on an exclusive 
basis or cannot be assigned to the applicant without causing harmful 
interference; or
    (3) Reasonable efforts have been made to coordinate the proposed 
facility with foreign administrations under applicable international 
agreements, and an unfavorable response (harmful interference 
anticipated) has been received.
    (f) Dismissal as untimely. The Commission may dismiss without 
prejudice applications that are premature or late filed, including 
applications filed prior to the opening date or after the closing date 
of a filing window, or after the cut-off date for a mutually exclusive 
application filing group.

Sec. 1.935  Agreements to dismiss applications, amendments or pleadings.

    Parties that have filed applications that are mutually exclusive 
with one or more other applications, and then enter into an agreement to 
resolve the mutual exclusivity by withdrawing or

[[Page 244]]

requesting dismissal of the application(s), specific frequencies on the 
application or an amendment thereto, must obtain the approval of the 
Commission. Parties that have filed or threatened to file a petition to 
deny, informal objection or other pleading against an application and 
then seek to withdraw or request dismissal of, or refrain from filing, 
the petition, either unilaterally or in exchange for a financial 
consideration, must obtain the approval of the Commission.
    (a) The party withdrawing or requesting dismissal of its application 
(or specific frequencies on the application), petition to deny, informal 
objection or other pleading or refraining from filing a pleading must 
submit to the Commission a request for approval of the withdrawal or 
dismissal, a copy of any written agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal, and an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the party nor its principals has 
received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess of 
the legitimate and prudent expenses incurred in preparing and 
prosecuting the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading in exchange for the withdrawal or dismissal of the 
application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading, or 
threat to file a pleading, except that this provision does not apply to 
dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to bona fide merger 
agreements;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading, or threat to file a pleading.
    (b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant's 
or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining party to any 
written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for 
withdrawing or dismissing the application, petition to deny, informal 
objection or other pleading; and
    (2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading.
    (c) No person shall make or receive any payments in exchange for 
withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing a petition to 
deny, informal objection, or any other pleading against an application. 
For the purposes of this section, reimbursement by an applicant of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of a potential petitioner or objector, 
incurred reasonably and directly in preparing to file a petition to 
deny, will not be considered to be payment for refraining from filing a 
petition to deny or an informal objection. Payments made directly to a 
potential petitioner or objector, or a person related to a potential 
petitioner or objector, to implement non-financial promises are 
prohibited unless specifically approved by the Commission.
    (d) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by 
the filing party, if an individual; a partner having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a partnership; or an officer having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) Each application, petition to deny, informal objection or other 
pleading is deemed to be pending before the Commission from the time the 
petition to deny is filed with the Commission until such time as an 
order or correspondence of the Commission granting, denying or 
dismissing it is no longer subject to reconsideration by the Commission 
or to review by any court.
    (3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting 
and/or settling its application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading for which reimbursement is sought.
    (4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets or the provision 
of tangible pecuniary

[[Page 245]]

benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that confer any type of 
benefit on the recipient.
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any payments 
made or received in exchange for withdrawing a short-form application 
for a Commission authorization awarded through competitive bidding shall 
be subject to the restrictions set forth in Sec. 1.2105(c) of this 
chapter.

Sec. 1.937  Repetitious or conflicting applications.

    (a) Where the Commission has, for any reason, dismissed with 
prejudice or denied any license application in the Wireless Radio 
Services, or revoked any such license, the Commission will not consider 
a like or new application involving service of the same kind to 
substantially the same area by substantially the same applicant, its 
successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the benefit of the 
original parties in interest, until after the lapse of 12 months from 
the effective date of final Commission action.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) If an appeal has been taken from the action of the Commission 
dismissing with prejudice or denying any application in the Wireless 
Radio Services, or if the application is subsequently designated for 
hearing, a like application for service of the same type to the same 
area, in whole or in part, filed by that applicant or by its successor 
or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of the parties in interest 
to the original application, will not be considered until the final 
disposition of such appeal.
    (d) While an application is pending, any subsequent inconsistent or 
conflicting application submitted by, on behalf of, or for the benefit 
of the same applicant, its successor or assignee will not be accepted 
for filing.

<R05>
Sec. 1.939  Petitions to deny.

    (a) Who may file. Any party in interest may file with the Commission 
a petition to deny any application listed in a Public Notice as accepted 
for filing, whether as filed originally or upon major amendment as 
defined in Sec. 1.929 of this part.
    (1) For auctionable license applications, petitions to deny and 
related pleadings are governed by the procedures set forth in Sec. 
1.2108 of this part.
    (2) Petitions to deny for non-auctionable applications that are 
subject to petitions under Sec. 309(d) of the Communications Act must 
comply with the provisions of this section and must be filed no later 
than 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the application 
or major amendment to the application as accepted for filing.
    (b) Filing of petitions. Petitions to deny and related pleadings may 
be filed electronically via ULS. Manually filed petitions to deny must 
be filed with the Office of the Secretary, 445 12th Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20554. Attachments to manually filed applications may be 
filed on a standard 3\1/4\[sec] magnetic diskette formatted to be 
readable by high density floppy drives operating under MS-DOS (version 
3.X or later compatible versions). Each diskette submitted must contain 
an ASCII text file listing each filename and a brief description of the 
contents of each file on the diskette. The files on the diskette, other 
than the table of contents, should be in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document 
Format (PDF) whenever possible. Petitions to deny and related pleadings 
must reference the file number of the pending application that is the 
subject of the petition.
    (c) Service. A petitioner shall serve a copy of its petition to deny 
on the applicant and on all other interested parties pursuant to Sec. 
1.47. Oppositions and replies shall be served on the petitioner and all 
other interested parties.
    (d) Content. A petition to deny must contain specific allegations of 
fact sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the petitioner is a 
party in interest and that a grant of the application would be 
inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. Such 
allegations of fact, except for those of which official notice may be 
taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with 
personal knowledge thereof.

[[Page 246]]

    (e) Petitions to deny amended applications. Petitions to deny a 
major amendment to an application may raise only matters directly 
related to the major amendment that could not have been raised in 
connection with the application as originally filed. This paragraph does 
not apply to petitioners who gain standing because of the major 
amendment.
    (f) Oppositions and replies. The applicant and any other interested 
party may file an opposition to any petition to deny and the petitioner 
may file a reply thereto in which allegations of fact or denials 
thereof, except for those of which official notice may be taken, shall 
be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge 
thereof. Time for filing of oppositions and replies is governed by Sec. 
1.45 of this part for non-auctionable services and Sec. 1.2108 of this 
part for auctionable services.
    (g) Dismissal of petition. The Commission may dismiss any petition 
to deny that does not comply with the requirements of this section if 
the issues raised become moot, or if the petitioner or his/her attorney 
fails to appear at a settlement conference pursuant to Sec. 1.956 of 
this part. The reasons for the dismissal will be stated in the dismissal 
letter or order. When a petition to deny is dismissed, any related 
responsive pleadings are also dismissed
    (h) Grant of petitioned application. If a petition to deny has been 
filed and the Commission grants the application, the Commission will 
dismiss or deny the petition by issuing a concise statement of the 
reason(s) for dismissing or denying the petition, disposing of all 
substantive issues raised in the petition.

Sec. 1.945  License grants.

    (a) License grants--auctionable license applications. Procedures for 
grant of licenses that are subject to competitive bidding under section 
309(j) of the Communications Act are set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.2108 and 
1.2109 of this part.
    (b) License grants--non-auctionable license applications. No 
application that is not subject to competitive bidding under Sec. 
309(j) of the Communications Act will be granted by the Commission prior 
to the 31st day following the issuance of a Public Notice of the 
acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial 
amendment thereof, unless the application is not subject to Sec. 309(b) 
of the Communications Act.
    (c) Grant without hearing. In the case of both auctionable license 
applications and non-mutually exclusive non-auctionable license 
applications, the Commission will grant the application without a 
hearing if it is proper upon its face and if the Commission finds from 
an examination of such application and supporting data, any pleading 
filed, or other matters which it may officially notice, that:
    (1) There are no substantial and material questions of fact;
    (2) The applicant is legally, technically, financially, and 
otherwise qualified;
    (3) A grant of the application would not involve modification, 
revocation, or non-renewal of any other existing license;
    (4) A grant of the application would not preclude the grant of any 
mutually exclusive application; and
    (5) A grant of the application would serve the public interest, 
convenience, and necessity.
    (d) Grant of petitioned applications. The FCC may grant, without a 
formal hearing, an application against which petition(s) to deny have 
been filed. If any petition(s) to deny are pending (i.e. have not been 
dismissed or withdrawn by the petitioner) when an application is 
granted, the FCC will deny the petition(s) and issue a concise statement 
of the reason(s) for the denial, disposing of all substantive issues 
raised in the petitions.
    (e) Partial and conditional grants. The FCC may grant applications 
in part, and/or subject to conditions other than those normally applied 
to authorizations of the same type. When the FCC does this, it will 
inform the applicant of the reasons therefor. Such partial or 
conditional grants are final unless the FCC revises its action in 
response to a petition for reconsideration. Such petitions for 
reconsideration must be filed by the applicant within thirty days

[[Page 247]]

after the date of the letter or order stating the reasons for the 
partial or conditional grant, and must reject the partial or conditional 
grant and return the instrument of authorization.
    (f) Designation for hearing. If the Commission is unable to make the 
findings prescribed in subparagraph (c), it will formally designate the 
application for hearing on the grounds or reasons then obtaining and 
will notify the applicant and all other known parties in interest of 
such action.
    (1) Orders designating applications for hearing will specify with 
particularity the matters in issue.
    (2) Parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the 
Commission of its action in designating a particular application for 
hearing may acquire the status of a party to the proceeding by filing a 
petition for intervention showing the basis of their interest not more 
than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register of the hearing 
issues or any substantial amendment thereto.
    (3) The applicant and all other parties in interest shall be 
permitted to participate in any hearing subsequently held upon such 
applications. Hearings may be conducted by the Commission or by the 
Chief of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, or, in the case of a 
question which requires oral testimony for its resolution, an 
Administrative Law Judge. The burden of proceeding with the introduction 
of evidence and burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that 
with respect to any issue presented by a petition to deny or a petition 
to enlarge the issues, such burdens shall be as determined by the 
Commission or the Chief of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.

Sec. 1.946  Construction and coverage requirements.

    (a) Construction and commencement of service requirements. For each 
of the Wireless Radio Services, requirements for construction and 
commencement of service or commencement of operations are set forth in 
the rule part governing the specific service. For purposes of this 
section, the period between the date of grant of an authorization and 
the date of required commencement of service or operations is referred 
to as the construction period.
    (b) Coverage and substantial service requirements. In certain 
Wireless Radio Services, licensees must comply with geographic coverage 
requirements or substantial service requirements within a specified time 
period. These requirements are set forth in the rule part governing each 
specific service. For purposes of this section, the period between the 
date of grant of an authorization and the date that a particular degree 
of coverage or substantial service is required is referred to as the 
coverage period.
    (c) Termination of authorizations. If a licensee fails to commence 
service or operations by the expiration of its construction period or to 
meet its coverage or substantial service obligations by the expiration 
of its coverage period, its authorization terminates automatically (in 
whole or in part as set forth in the service rules), without specific 
Commission action, on the date the construction or coverage period 
expires.
    (d) Licensee notification of compliance. A licensee who commences 
service or operations within the construction period or meets its 
coverage or substantial services obligations within the coverage period 
must notify the Commission by filing FCC Form 601. The notification must 
be filed within 15 days of the expiration of the applicable construction 
or coverage period. Where the authorization is site-specific, if service 
or operations have begun using some, but not all, of the authorized 
transmitters, the notification must show to which specific transmitters 
it applies.
    (e) Requests for extension of time. Licensees may request to extend 
a construction period or coverage period by filing FCC Form 601. The 
request must be filed before the expiration of the construction or 
coverage period.
    (1) An extension request may be granted if the licensee shows that 
failure to meet the construction or coverage deadline is due to 
involuntary loss of site or other causes beyond its control.

[[Page 248]]

    (2) Extension requests will not be granted for failure to meet a 
construction or coverage deadline due to delays caused by a failure to 
obtain financing, to obtain an antenna site, or to order equipment in a 
timely manner. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days of its 
initial license grant, a presumption of diligence is established.
    (3) Extension requests will not be granted for failure to meet a 
construction or coverage deadline because the licensee undergoes a 
transfer of control or because the licensee intends to assign the 
authorization. The Commission will not grant extension requests solely 
to allow a transferee or assignee to complete facilities that the 
transferor or assignor failed to construct.
    (4) The filing of an extension request does not automatically extend 
the construction or coverage period unless the request is based on 
involuntary loss of site or other circumstances beyond the licensee's 
control, in which case the construction period is automatically extended 
pending disposition of the extension request.
    (5) A request for extension of time to construct a particular 
transmitter or other facility does not extend the construction period 
for other transmitters and facilities under the same authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 1.947  Modification of licenses.

    (a) All major modifications, as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this part, 
require prior Commission approval. Applications for major modifications 
also shall be treated as new applications for determination of filing 
date, Public Notice, and petition to deny purposes.
    (b) Licensees may make minor modifications to station 
authorizations, as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this part (other than pro 
forma transfers and assignments), as a matter of right without prior 
Commission approval. Where other rule parts permit licensees to make 
permissive changes to technical parameters without notifying the 
Commission (e.g., adding, modifying, or deleting internal sites), no 
notification is required. For all other types of minor modifications 
(e.g., name, address, point of contact changes), licensees must notify 
the Commission by filing FCC Form 601 within thirty (30) days of 
implementing any such changes.
    (c) Multiple pending modification applications requesting changes to 
the same or related technical parameters on an authorization are not 
permitted. If a modification application is pending, any additional 
changes to the same or related technical parameters may be requested 
only in an amendment to the pending modification application.
    (d) Any proposed modification that requires a fee as set forth at 
part 1, subpart G, of this chapter must be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 1.913.

Sec. 1.948  Assignment of authorization or transfer of control, notification of consummation.

    (a) General. Except as provided in this section, authorizations in 
the Wireless Radio Services may be assigned by the licensee to another 
party, voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, or the 
control of a licensee holding such authorizations may be transferred, 
only upon application to and approval by the Commission.
    (b) Limitations on transfers and assignments. (1) A change from less 
than 50% ownership to 50% or more ownership shall always be considered a 
transfer of control.
    (2) In other situations a controlling interest shall be determined 
on a case-by-case basis considering the distribution of ownership, and 
the relationships of the owners, including family relationships.
    (3) Designated Entities, as defined in Sec. 1.2110(a) of this part, 
must comply with Sec. Sec. 1.2110 and 1.2111 of this part when seeking 
to assign or transfer control of an authorization.
    (4) Stations must meet all applicable requirements regarding 
transfers and assignments contained in the rules pertaining to the 
specific service in which the station is licensed.
    (5) Licenses, permits, and authorizations for stations in the 
Amateur, Ship, Aircraft, Commercial Operator and Personal Radio Services 
(except

[[Page 249]]

218-219 MHz Service) may not be assigned or transferred, unless 
otherwise stated.
    (c) Application required. In the case of an assignment of 
authorization or transfer of control, the assignor must file an 
application for approval of the assignment on FCC Form 603. If the 
assignee or transferee is subject to the ownership reporting 
requirements of Sec. 1.2112, the assignee or transferee must also file 
an updated FCC Form 602 or certify that a current FCC Form 602 is on 
file.
    (1) In the case of a non-substantial (pro forma) transfer or 
assignment involving a telecommunications carrier, as defined in Sec. 
153(44) of the Communications Act, filing of the Form 603 and Commission 
approval in advance of the proposed transaction is not required, 
provided that:
    (i) the affected license is not subject to unjust enrichment 
provisions under subpart Q of this part;
    (ii) the transfer or assignment does not involve a proxy contest; 
and
    (iii) the transferee or assignee provides notice of the transaction 
by filing FCC Form 603 within 30 days of its completion, and provides 
any necessary updates of ownership information on FCC Form 602.
    (2) In the case of an involuntary assignment or transfer, FCC Form 
603 must be filed no later than 30 days after the event causing the 
involuntary assignment or transfer.
    (d) Notification of consummation. In all Wireless Radio Services, 
licensees are required to notify the Commission of consummation of an 
approved transfer or assignment using FCC Form 603. The assignee or 
transferee is responsible for providing this notification, including the 
date the transaction was consummated. For transfers and assignments that 
require prior Commission approval, the transaction must be consummated 
and notification provided to the Commission within 180 days of public 
notice of approval, and notification of consummation must occur no later 
than 30 days after actual consummation, unless a request for an 
extension of time to consummate is filed on FCC Form 603 prior to the 
expiration of this 180-day period. For transfers and assignments that do 
not require prior Commission approval, notification of consummation must 
be provided on FCC Form 603 no later than 30 days after consummation, 
along with any necessary updates of ownership information on FCC Form 
602.
    (e) Partial assignment of authorization. If the authorization for 
some, but not all, of the facilities of a radio station in the Wireless 
Radio Services is assigned to another party, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, such action is a partial assignment of authorization. To 
request Commission approval of a partial assignment of authorization, 
the assignor must notify the Commission on FCC Form 603 of the 
facilities that will be deleted from its authorization upon consummation 
of the assignment.
    (f) Partitioning and disaggregation. Where a licensee proposes to 
partition or disaggregate a portion of its authorization to another 
party, the application will be treated as a request for partial 
assignment of authorization. The assignor must notify the Commission on 
FCC Form 603 of the geographic area or spectrum that will be deleted 
from its authorization upon consummation of the assignment.
    (g) Involuntary transfer and assignment. In the event of the death 
or legal disability of a permittee or licensee, a member of a 
partnership, or a person directly or indirectly in control of a 
corporation which is a permittee or licensee, the Commission shall be 
notified promptly of the occurrence of such death or legal disability. 
Within 30 days after the occurrence of such death or legal disability 
(except in the case of a ship or amateur station), an application shall 
be filed for consent to involuntary assignment of such permit or 
license, or for involuntary transfer of control of such corporation, to 
a person or entity legally qualified to succeed to the foregoing 
interests under the laws of the place having jurisdiction over the 
estate involved. The procedures and forms to be used are the same 
procedures and forms as those specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. In the case of Ship, aircraft, Commercial Operator, Amateur, 
and Personal Radio Services (except for 218-219 MHz Service) involuntary 
assignment of licenses will not be granted; such licenses shall be 
surrendered for cancellation upon

[[Page 250]]

the death or legal disability of the licensee. Amateur station call 
signs assigned to the station of a deceased licensee shall be available 
for reassignment pursuant to Sec. 97.19 of this chapter.
    (h) Disclosure requirements. Applicants for transfer or assignment 
of licenses in auctionable services must comply with the disclosure 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.2111 and 1.2112 of this part.
    (i) Trafficking. Applications for approval of assignment or transfer 
may be reviewed by the Commission to determine if the transaction is for 
purposes of trafficking in service authorizations.
    (1) Trafficking consists of obtaining or attempting to obtain an 
authorization for the principal purpose of speculation or profitable 
resale of the authorization rather than for the provision of 
telecommunication services to the public or for the licensee's own 
private use.
    (2) The Commission may require submission of an affirmative, factual 
showing, supported by affidavit of persons with personal knowledge 
thereof, to demonstrate that the assignor did not acquire the 
authorization for the principal purpose of speculation or profitable 
resale of the authorization. This showing may include, for example, a 
demonstration that the proposed assignment is due to changed 
circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee after the 
grant of the authorization, or that the proposed assignment is 
incidental to a sale of other facilities or a merger of interests.
    (j) Processing of applications. Applications for assignment of 
authorization or transfer of control relating to the Wireless Radio 
Services will be processed pursuant either to general approval 
procedures or the immediate approval procedures, as discussed herein.
    (1) General approval procedures. Applications will be processed 
pursuant to the general approval procedures set forth in this paragraph 
unless they are submitted and qualify for the immediate approval 
procedures set forth in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (i) To be accepted for filing under these general approval 
procedures, the application must be sufficiently complete and contain 
all necessary information and certifications requested on the applicable 
form, FCC Form 603, including any information and certifications 
(including those of the proposed assignee or transferee relating to 
eligibility, basic qualifications, and foreign ownership) required by 
the rules of this chapter and any rules pertaining to the specific 
service for which the application is filed, and must include payment of 
the required application fee(s) (see Sec. 1.1102).
    (ii) Once accepted for filing, the application will be placed on 
public notice, except no prior public notice will be required for 
applications involving authorizations in the Private Wireless Services, 
as specified in Sec. 1.933(d)(9).
    (iii) Petitions to deny filed in accordance with section 309(d) of 
the Communications Act must comply with the provisions of Sec. 1.939, 
except that such petitions must be filed no later than 14 days following 
the date of the public notice listing the application as accepted for 
filing.
    (iv) No later than 21 days following the date of the public notice 
listing an application as accepted for filing, the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) will affirmatively consent to the 
application, deny the application, or determine to subject the 
application to further review. For applications for which no prior 
public notice is required, the Bureau will affirmatively consent to the 
application, deny the application, or determine to subject the 
application to further review no later than 21 days following the date 
on which the application has been filed, if filed electronically, and 
any required application fee has been paid (see Sec. 1.1102); if filed 
manually, the Bureau will affirmatively consent to the application, deny 
the application, or determine to subject the application to further 
review no later than 21 days after the necessary data in the manually 
filed application is entered into ULS.
    (v) If the Bureau determines to subject the application to further 
review, it will issue a public notice so indicating. Within 90 days 
following the date of that public notice, the Bureau will either take 
action upon the application or provide public notice that an additional 
90-day period for review is needed.

[[Page 251]]

    (vi) Consent to the application is not deemed granted until the 
Bureau affirmatively acts upon the application.
    (vii) Grant of consent to the application will be reflected in a 
public notice (see Sec. 1.933(a)) promptly issued after the grant.
    (viii) If any petition to deny is filed, and the Bureau grants the 
application, the Bureau will deny the petition(s) and issue a concise 
statement of the reason(s) for denial, disposing of all substantive 
issues raised in the petition(s).
    (2) Immediate approval procedures. Applications that meet the 
requirements of paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section qualify for the 
immediate approval procedures.
    (i) To qualify for the immediate approval procedures, the 
application must be sufficiently complete, contain all necessary 
information and certifications (including those relating to eligibility, 
basic qualifications, and foreign ownership), and include payment of the 
requisite application fee(s), as required for an application processed 
under the general approval procedures set forth in paragraph (j)(1) of 
this section, and also must establish, through certifications, that the 
following additional qualifications are met:
    (A) The license does not involve spectrum licensed in a Wireless 
Radio Service that may be used to provide interconnected mobile voice 
and/or data services under the applicable service rules and that would, 
if assigned or transferred, create a geographic overlap with spectrum in 
any licensed Wireless Radio Service (including the same service) in 
which the proposed assignee or transferee already holds a direct or 
indirect interest of 10% or more (see Sec. 1.2112), either as a 
licensee or a spectrum lessee, and that could be used by the assignee or 
transferee to provide interconnected mobile voice and/or data services;
    (B) The licensee is not a designated entity or entrepreneur subject 
to unjust enrichment requirements and/or transfer restrictions under 
applicable Commission rules (see Sec. Sec. 1.2110 and 1.2111, and 
Sec. Sec. 24.709, 24.714, and 24.839 of this chapter); and,
    (C) The assignment or transfer of control does not require a waiver 
of, or declaratory ruling pertaining to, any applicable Commission 
rules, and there is no pending issue as to whether the license is 
subject to revocation, cancellation, or termination by the Commission.
    (ii) Provided that the application establishes that it meets all of

Sec. 1.955  Termination of authorizations.

    (a) Authorizations in general remain valid until terminated in 
accordance with this section, except that the Commission may revoke an 
authorization pursuant to section 312 of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended. See 47 U.S.C. 312.
    (1) Expiration. Authorizations automatically terminate, without 
specific Commission action, on the expiration date specified therein, 
unless a timely application for renewal is filed. See Sec. 1.949 of 
this part. No authorization granted under the provisions of this part 
shall be for a term longer than ten years, except to the extent a longer 
term is authorized under Sec. 27.13 of part 27 of this chapter.
    (2) Failure to meet construction or coverage requirements. 
Authorizations automatically terminate (in whole or in part as set forth 
in the service rules), without specific Commission action, if the 
licensee fails to meet applicable construction or coverage requirements. 
See Sec. 1.946(c).
    (3) Service discontinued. Authorizations automatically terminate, 
without specific Commission action, if service is permanently 
discontinued. The Commission authorization or the individual service 
rules govern the definition of permanent discontinuance for purposes of 
this section. A licensee who discontinues operations shall notify the 
Commission of the discontinuance of operations by submitting FCC Form 
601 or 605 requesting license cancellation.
    (b) Special temporary authority (STA) automatically terminates 
without specific Commission action upon failure to comply with the terms 
and conditions therein, or at the end of the period specified therein, 
unless a timely request for an extension of the STA term is filed in 
accordance with Sec. 1.931 of this part. If a timely filed request for 
extension of the STA term is dismissed or denied, the STA automatically 
terminates, without specific Commission action, on the day after the 
applicant or the applicant's attorney is notified of the Commission's 
action dismissing or denying the request for extension.
    (c) Authorizations submitted by licensees for cancellation terminate 
when the Commission gives Public Notice of such action.

Sec. 1.956  Settlement conferences.

    Parties are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution 
procedures to settle disputes. See subpart E of this part. In any 
contested proceeding, the Commission, in its discretion, may direct the 
parties or their attorneys to appear before it for a conference.
    (a) The purposes of such conferences are:
    (1) To obtain admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties 
as to any or all of the matters in controversy;
    (2) To consider the necessity for or desirability of amendments to 
the pleadings, or of additional pleadings or evidentiary submissions;

[[Page 253]]

    (3) To consider simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (4) To encourage settlement of the matters in controversy by 
agreement between the parties; and
    (5) To consider other matters that may aid in the resolution of the 
contested proceeding.
    (b) Conferences are scheduled by the Commission at a time and place 
it may designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone conference 
call.
    (c) The failure of any party or attorney, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a failure to 
prosecute, subjecting that party's application or petition to dismissal 
by the Commission.

Sec. 1.957  Procedure with respect to amateur radio operator license.

    Each candidate for an amateur radio license which requires the 
applicant to pass one or more examination elements must present the 
Volunteer Examiners (VEs) with a properly completed FCC Form 605 prior 
to the examination. Upon completion of the examination, the VEs will 
grade the test papers. If the applicant is successful, the VEs will 
forward the candidate's application to a Volunteer-Examiner Coordinator 
(VEC). The VEs will then issue a certificate for sucessful completion of 
an amateur radio operator examination. The VEC will forward the 
application to the Commission's Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, facility.

Sec. 1.958  Distance computation.

    The method given in this section must be used to compute the 
distance between any two locations, except that, for computation of 
distance involving stations in Canada and Mexico, methods for distance 
computation specified in the applicable international agreement, if any, 
must be used instead. The result of a distance calculation under parts 
21 and 101 of this chapter must be rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
kilometer. The method set forth in this paragraph is considered to be 
sufficiently accurate for distances not exceeding 475 km (295 miles).
    (a) Convert the latitudes and longitudes of each reference point 
from degree-minute-second format to degree-decimal format by dividing 
minutes by 60 and seconds by 3600, then adding the results to degrees.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13AP05.008

    (b) Calculate the mean geodetic latitude between the two reference 
points by averaging the two latitudes:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13AP05.009

    (c) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree latitude 
difference for the mean geodetic latitude calculated in paragraph (b) of 
this section as follows:

KPD<INF>lat</INF> = 111.13209 - 0.56605 cos 2ML + 0.00120 cos 4ML

    (d) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree of longitude 
difference for the mean geodetic latitude calculated in paragraph (b) of 
this section as follows:

KPD<INF>lon</INF> = 111.41513 cos 5ML - 0.09455 cos 3ML + 0.00012 cos 
    5ML

    (e) Calculate the North-South distance in kilometers as follows:

NS = KPD<INF>lat</INF> x (LAT1<INF>dd</INF> - LAT2<INF>dd</INF>)

    (f) Calculate the East-West distance in kilometers as follows:

EW = KPD<INF>lon</INF> x (LON1<INF>dd</INF> - LON2<INF>dd</INF>)

    (g) Calculate the distance between the locations by taking the 
square root of the sum of the squares of the East-West and North-South 
distances:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13AP05.010

    (h) Terms used in this section are defined as follows:
    (1) LAT1<INF>dd</INF> and LON1<INF>dd</INF> are the coordinates of 
the first location in degree-decimal format.
    (2) LAT2<INF>dd</INF> and LON2<INF>dd</INF> are the coordinates of 
the second location in degree-decimal format.

[[Page 254]]

    (3) ML is the mean geodetic latitude in degree-decimal format.
    (4) KPD<INF>lat</INF> is the number of kilometers per degree of 
latitude at a given mean geodetic latitude.
    (5) KPD<INF>lon</INF> is the number of kilometers per degree of 
longitude at a given mean geodetic latitude.
    (6) NS is the North-South distance in kilometers.
    (7) EW is the East-West distance in kilometers.
    (8) DIST is the distance between the two locations, in kilometers.

Sec. 1.959  Computation of average terrain elevation.

    Except as otherwise specified in Sec. 90.309(a)(4) of this chapter, 
average terrain elevation must be calculated by computer using 
elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file. The 
file must be identified. If a 30 second point data file is used, the 
elevation data must be processed for intermediate points using 
interpolation techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. In 
cases of dispute, average terrain elevation determinations can also be 
done manually, if the results differ significantly from the computer 
derived averages.
    (a) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of 
the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers (2 and 
10 miles) extending radially from the antenna site. If a portion of the 
radial path extends over foreign territory or water, such portion must 
not be included in the computation of average elevation unless the 
radial path again passes over United States land between 16 and 134 
kilometers (10 and 83 miles) away from the station. At least 50 evenly 
spaced data points for each radial should be used in the computation.
    (b) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial 
average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials).
    (c) For locations in Dade and Broward Counties, Florida, the method 
prescribed above may be used or average terrain elevation may be assumed 
to be 3 meters (10 feet).

electronically via the ULS.
    (b) The report shall include comprehensive and detailed information 
on the following:
    (1) The final objective.
    (2) Results of operation to date.
    (3) Analysis of the results obtained.
    (4) Copies of any published reports.
    (5) Need for continuation of the program.
    (6) Number of hours of operation on each frequency.
    (c) Where required by the particular service rules, licensees who 
have entered into agreements with other persons for the cooperative use 
of radio station facilities must submit annually an audited financial 
statement reflecting the nonprofit cost-sharing nature of the 
arrangement to the Commission's offices in Washington, DC or 
alternatively may be sent to the Commission electronically via the ULS, 
no later than three months after the close of the licensee's fiscal 
year.

Sec. 1.1110  Attachment of charges.

    The charges required to accompany a request for the Commission's 
regulatory services listed in Sec. Sec. 1.1102 through 1.1109 of this 
subpart will not be refundable to the applicant irrespective of the 
Commission's disposition of that request. Return or refund of charges 
will be made only in certain limited instances as set out at Sec. 
1.1115 of this subpart.

[74 FR 3445, Jan. 21, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1111  Payment of charges.

    (a) The schedule of fees for applications and other filings (Bureau/
Office Fee Filing Guides) lists those applications and other filings 
that must be accompanied by an FCC Form 159, Remittance Advice' or the 
electronic version of the form, FCC Form 159-E, one of the forms that is 
automatically generated when an applicant accesses the Commission's on-
line filing and payment process.
    (b) Applicants may access the Commission's on-line filing (http://
www.fcc.gov/e-file.html) and fee payment program by accessing (http://
www.fcc.gov/feefiler.html). Applicants who use the on-line process will 
be directed to the appropriate electronic application and payment forms 
for completion and submission of the required application(s) and payment 
information.
    (c) Applications and other filings that are not submitted in 
accordance with these instructions will be returned as unprocessable.

    Note to paragraph (c): This requirement for the simultaneous 
submission of fee forms with applications or other filings does not 
apply to the payment of fees for which the Commission has established a 
billing process. See Sec. 1.1121 of this subpart.

    (d) Applications returned to applicants for additional information 
or corrections will not require an additional fee when resubmitted, 
unless the additional information results in an increase of the original 
fee amount. Those applications not requiring an additional fee should be 
resubmitted directly to the Bureau/Office requesting the additional 
information. The original fee will be forfeited if the additional 
information or corrections are not resubmitted to the appropriate 
Bureau/Office by the prescribed deadline. A forfeited application fee 
will not be refunded. If an additional fee is required, the original fee 
will be returned and the application must be resubmitted with a new 
remittance in the amount of the required fee to the Commission's lockbox 
bank. Applicants should attach a copy of the Commission's request for 
additional or corrected information to their resubmission.
    (1) If the Bureau/Office staff discovers within 30 days after the 
resubmission that the required fee was not submitted, the application 
will be dismissed.
    (2) If after 30 days the Bureau/Office staff discovers the required 
fee has not been paid, the application will be retained and a 25 percent 
late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if the Commission 
has completed its action on the application. Any Commission actions 
taken prior to timely payment of these charges are contingent and 
subject to recession.
    (e) Should the staff change the status of an application, resulting 
in an increase in the fee due, the applicant will be billed for the 
remainder under the conditions established by Sec. 1.1118(b) of the 
rules.

    Note to paragraph (e): Due to the statutory requirements applicable 
to tariff filings, the procedures for handling tariff filings may vary 
from the procedures set out in the rules.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1112  Form of payment.

    (a) Fee payments should be in the form of a check, bank draft, on 
money order denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a United States 
financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications 
Commission or by a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover 
credit card. No other

[[Page 266]]

credit card is acceptable. Fees for applications and other filings paid 
by credit card will not be accepted unless the credit card section of 
FCC Form 159 is completed in full. The Commission discourages applicants 
from submitting cash and will not be responsible for cash sent through 
the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated more than six months prior 
to their submission to the Commission's lockbox bank and postdated 
checks will not be accepted and will be returned as deficient. Third 
party checks (i.e., checks with a third party as maker or endorser) will 
not be accepted.
    (1) Specific procedures for electronic payments are announced in 
Bureau/Office fee filing guides.
    (2) It is the responsibility of the payer to insure that any 
electronic payment is made in the manner required by the Commission. 
Failure to comply with the Commission's procedures will result in the 
return of the application or other filing.
    (3) Payments by wire transfer will be accepted; however, to insure 
proper credit, applicants must follow the instructions set out in the 
appropriate Bureau/Office fee filing guide.
    (b) Applicants are required to submit one payment instrument (check, 
bank draft or money order) and FCC Form 159 with each application or 
filing. Multiple payment instruments for a single application or filing 
are not permitted. Except that a separate Fee Form (FCC Form 159) will 
not be required once the information requirements of that form (the Fee 
Code, fee amount, and total fee remitted) are incorporated into the 
underlying application form.
    (c) The Commission may accept multiple money orders in payment of a 
fee for a single application where the fee exceeds the maximum amount 
for a money order established by the issuing agency and the use of 
multiple money orders is the only practical method available for fee 
payment.
    (d) The Commission may require payment of fees with a cashier's 
check upon notification to an applicant or filer or prospective group of 
applicants under the conditions set forth below in paragraphs (d) (1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) Payment by cashier's check may be required when a person or 
organization has made payment, on one or more occasions with a payment 
instrument on which the Commission does not receive final payment and 
such failure is not excused by bank error.
    (2) The Commission will notify the party in writing that future 
payments must be made by cashier's check until further notice. If, 
subsequent to such notice, payment is not made by cashier's check, the 
party's payment will not be accepted and its application or other filing 
will be returned.
    (e) All fees collected will be paid into the general fund of the 
United States Treasury in accordance with Pub. L. 99-272.
    (f) The Commission will furnish a stamped receipt of an application 
only upon request that complies with the following instructions. In 
order to obtain a stamped receipt for an application (or other filing), 
the application package must include a copy of the first page of the 
application, clearly marked ``copy'', submitted expressly for the 
purpose of serving as a receipt of the filing. The copy should be the 
top document in the package. The copy will be date-stamped immediately 
and provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For 
submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return 
mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-
addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the date stamped copy 
of the application. No remittance receipt copies will be furnished.

Sec. 1.1114  Conditionality of Commission or staff authorizations.

    (a) Any instrument of authorization granted by the Commission, or by 
its staff under delegated authority, will be conditioned upon final 
payment of the applicable fee or delinquent fees and timely payment of 
bills issued by the Commission. As applied to checks, bank drafts and 
money orders, final payment shall mean receipt by the Treasury of funds 
cleared by the financial institution on which the check, bank draft or 
money order is drawn.
    (1) If, prior to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the 
Commission is notified that final payment has not been made, the 
application or filing will be:
    (i) Dismissed and returned to the applicant;

[[Page 268]]

    (ii) Shall lose its place in the processing line;
    (iii) And will not be accorded nunc pro tunc treatment if

    (i) Automatically rescind that instrument of authorization for 
failure to meet the condition imposed by this subsection; and
    (ii) Notify the grantee of this action; and
    (iii) Not permit nunc pro tunc treatment for the resubmission of the 
application or filing if the relevant deadline has expired.
    (3) Upon receipt of a notification of rescision of the 
authorization, the grantee will immediately cease operations initiated 
pursuant to the authorization.
    (b) In those instances where the Commission has granted a request 
for deferred payment of a fee or issued a bill payable at a future date, 
further processing of the application or filing, or the grant of 
authority, shall be conditioned upon final payment of the fee, plus 
other required payments for late payments, by the date prescribed by the 
deferral decision or bill. Failure to comply with the terms of the 
deferral decision or bill shall result in the automatic dismissal of the 
submission or rescision of the Commission authorization for failure to 
meet the condition imposed by this subpart. The Commission reserves the 
right to return payments received after the date established on the bill 
and exercise the conditions attached to the application. The Commission 
shall:
    (1) Notify the grantee that the authorization has been rescinded;
    (i) Upon such notification, the grantee will immediately cease 
operations initiated pursuant to the authorization.
     (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Not permit nunc pro tunc treatment to applicants who attempt to 
refile after the original deadline for the underlying submission.
    (c) (1) Where an applicant is found to be delinquent in the payment 
of application fees, the Commission will make a written request for the 
delinquent fee, together with any penalties that may be due under this 
subpart. Such request shall inform the applicant/filer that failure to 
pay or make satisfactory payment arrangements will result in the 
Commission's withholding action on, and/or as appropriate, dismissal of, 
any applications or requests filed by the applicant. The staff shall 
also inform the applicant of the procedures for seeking Commission 
review of the staff's fee determination.
    (2) If, after final determination that the fee is due or that the 
applicant is delinquent in the payment of fees, and payment is not made 
in a timely manner, the staff will withhold action on the application or 
filing until payment or other satisfactory arrangement is made. If 
payment or satisfactory arrangement is not made within 30 days of the 
date of the original notification, the application will be dismissed.

authorization (or a pending application for authorization) in order to 
comply with new or additional requirements of the Commission's rules or 
the rules of another Federal agency. However, if the applicant also 
requests an additional modification, renewal, or other action, the 
appropriate fee for such additional request must accompany the 
application. Cases in which a fee will be paid include applications by 
FM and TV licensees or permittees seeking to upgrade channel after a 
rulemaking.
    (b) Applicants in the Special Emergency Radio and Public Safety 
Radio Services that are government entities or nonprofit entities. 
Applicants claiming nonprofit status must include a current Internal

conjunction with the NCE broadcast station on an NCE basis.
    (e) Other applicants, permittees, or licensees providing, or 
proposing to provide, an NCE or instructional service, but not 
qualifying under paragraph (c) of this section, may be exempt from 
filing fees, or be entitled to a refund, in the following circumstances.
    (1) An applicant is exempt from filing fees if it is an organization 
that, like the Public Broadcasting Service or National Public Radio, 
receives funding directly or indirectly through the Public Broadcasting 
Fund, 47 U.S.C. 396(k), distributed by the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, where the authorization requested will be used in 
conjunction with the organization on an NCE basis;
    (2) An applicant for a translator or low power television station 
that proposes an NCE service will be entitled to

[[Page 270]]

a refund of fees paid for the filing of the application when, after 
grant, it provides proof that it has received funding for the 
construction of the station through the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) or other showings as required by the 
Commission.
    (3) An applicant that has qualified for a fee refund under paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section and continues to operate as an NCE station is 
exempt from fees for broadcast auxiliary stations (subparts D, E, and F 
of part 74) or stations in the private radio or common carrier services 
where such authorization is to be used in conjunction with the NCE 
translator or low power station.
    (4) An applicant that is the licensee in the Educational Broadband 
Service (EBS) (formerly, Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS)) 
(parts 27 and 74, e.g., Sec. Sec. 27.1200, et seq., and 74.832(b), of 
this chapter) is exempt from filing fees where the authorization 
requested will be used by the applicant in conjunction with the 
provision of the EBS.
    (f) Applicants, permittees or licensees who qualify as governmental 
entities. For purposes of this exemption a governmental entity is 
defined as any state, possession, city, county, town, village, municipal 
corporation or similar political organization or subpart thereof 
controlled by publicly elected or duly appointed public officials 
exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective 
communities or programs.
    (g) Applications for Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permits 
where the applicant intends to use the permit solely in conjunction with 
duties performed at radio facilities qualifying for fee exemption under 
paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section.

    Note: Applicants claiming exemptions under the terms of this subpart 
must certify as to their eligibility for the exemption through a cover 
letter accompanying the application or filing. This certification is not 
required if the applicable FCC Form requests the information justifying 
the exemption.

Sec. 1.1117  Adjustments to charges.

    (a) The Schedule of Charges established by Sec. Sec. 1.1102 through 
1.1109 of this subpart shall be reviewed by the Commission on October 1, 
1999 and every two years thereafter, and adjustments made, if any, will 
be reflected in the next publication of Schedule of Charges.
    (1) The fees will be adjusted by the Commission to reflect the 
percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers 
(CPI-U) from the date of enactment of the authorizing legislation 
(December 19, 1989) to the date of adjustment, and every two years 
thereafter, to reflect the percentage change in the CPI-U in the period 
between the enactment date and the adjustment date.
    (2) Adjustments based upon the percentage change in the CPI-U will 
be applied against the base fees as enacted or amended by Congress in 
the year the fee was enacted or amended.
    (b) Increases or decreases in charges will apply to all categories 
of fees covered by this subpart. Individual fees will not be adjusted 
until the increase or decrease, as determined by the net change in the 
CPI-U since the date of enactment of the authorizing legislation, 
amounts to at least $5 in the case of fees under $100, or 5% or more in 
the case of fees of $100 or greater. All fees will be adjusted upward to 
the next $5 increment.
    (c) Adjustments to fees made pursuant to these procedures will not 
be subject to notice and comment rulemakings, nor will these decisions 
be subject to petitions for reconsideration under Sec. 1.429 of the 
rules. Requests for modifications will be limited

Sec. 1.1118  Penalty for late or insufficient payments.

    (a) Filings subject to fees and accompanied by defective fee 
submissions will be dismissed under Sec. 1.1111 (d) of this subpart 
where the defect is discovered by the Commission's staff within 30 
calendar days from the receipt of the application or filing by the 
Commission.
    (1) A defective fee may be corrected by resubmitting the application 
or other filing, together with the entire correct fee.
    (2) For purposes of determining whether the filing is timely, the 
date of resubmission with the correct fee will be considered the date of 
filing. However, in cases where the fee payment fails due to error of 
the applicant's bank, as evidenced by an affidavit of an officer of the 
bank, the date of the original submission will be considered the date of 
filing.
    (b) Applications or filings accompanied by insufficient fees or no 
fees, or where such applications or filings are made by persons or 
organizations that are delinquent in fees owed to the Commission, that 
are inadvertently forwarded to Commission staff for substantive review 
will be billed for the amount due if the discrepancy is not discovered 
until after 30 calendar days from the receipt of the application or 
filing by the Commission. Applications or filings that are accompanied 
by insufficient fees or no fees will have a penalty charge equaling 25 
percent of the amount due added to each bill. Any Commission action 
taken prior to timely payment of these charges is contingent and subject 
to rescission.
    (c) Applicants to whom a deferral of payment is granted under the 
terms of this subsection will be billed for the amount due plus a charge 
equalling 25 percent of the amount due. Any Commission actions taken 
prior to timely payment of these charges are contingent and subject to 
rescission.
    (d) Failure to submit fees, following notice to the applicant of 
failure to submit the required fee, is subject to collection of the fee, 
including interest thereon, any associated penalties, and the full cost 
of collection to the Federal government pursuant to the provisions of 
the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Public Law 104-134, 
110 Stat. 1321, 1358 (Apr. 26, 1996), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq. 
See 47 CFR 1.1901 through 1.1952. The debt collection processes 
described above may proceed concurrently with any other sanction in this 
paragraph.

not be incorporated because that reference does not exist in the

Sec. 1.1119  Petitions and applications for review.

    (a) The fees established by this subpart may be waived or deferred 
in specific instances where good cause is shown and where waiver or 
deferral of the fee would promote the public interest.
    (b) Requests for waivers or deferrals will only be considered when 
received from applicants acting in respect to their own applications. 
Requests for waivers or deferrals of entire classes of services will not 
be considered.
    (c) Petitions for waivers, deferrals, fee determinations, 
reconsiderations and applications for review will be acted upon by the 
Managing Director with the concurrence of the General Counsel. All such 
filings within the scope of the fee rules shall be filed as a separate 
pleading and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director. 
Any such request that is not filed as a separate pleading will not be

[[Page 272]]

considered by the Commission. Requests for deferral of a fee payment for 
financial hardship must be accompanied by supporting documentation.
    (1) Petitions and applications for review submitted with a fee must 
be submitted to the Commission's lock box bank at the address for the 
appropriate service set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1102 through 1.1107.
    (2) If no fee payment is submitted, the request should be filed with 
the Commission's Secretary.
    (d) Deferrals of fees will be granted for an established period of 
time not to exceed six months.
    (e) Applicants seeking waivers must submit the request for waiver 
with the application or filing, required fee and FCC Form 159, or a 
request for deferral. A petition for waiver and/or deferral of payment 
must be submitted to the Office of the Managing Director as specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section. Waiver requests that do not include these 
materials will be dismissed in accordance with Sec. 1.1111 of this 
subpart. Submitted fees will be returned if a waiver is granted. The 
Commission will not be responsible for delays in acting upon these 
requests.
    (f) Petitions for waiver of a fee based on financial hardship will 
be subject to the provisions of paragraph 1.1166(e).

Sec. 1.1120  Error claims.

    (a) Applicants who wish to challenge a staff determination of an 
insufficient fee or delinquent debt may do so in writing. A challenge to 
a determination that a party is delinquent in paying the full 
application fee must be accompanied by suitable proof that the fee had 
been paid or waived (or deferred from payment during the period in 
question), or by the required application payment and any assessment 
penalty payment (see Sec. 1.1118) of this subpart). Failure to comply 
with these procedures will result in dismissal of the challenge. These 
claims should be addressed to the Federal Communications Commission, 
Attention: Financial Operations, 445 12th St., SW., Washington, DC 20554 
or e-mailed to ARINQUIRIES@fcc.gov.
    (b) Actions taken by Financial Operations staff are subject to the 
reconsideration and review provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.106 and 1.115 of 
this part, EXCEPT THAT reconsideration and/or review will only be 
available where the applicant has made the full and proper payment of 
the underlying fee as required by this subpart.
    (1) Petitions for reconsideration and/or applications for review 
submitted by applicants that have not made the full and proper fee 
payment will be dismissed; and
    (2) If the fee payment should fail while the Commission is 
considering the matter, the petition for reconsideration or application 
for review will be dismissed.

Settlements (Sec. 1.1103 of this subpart), Accounting and Audits Field 
Audits and Review of Arrest Audits (Sec. 1.1106 of this subpart) should

Sec. 1.1157  Payment of charges for regulatory fees.

    Payment of a regulatory fee, required under Sec. Sec. 1.1152 
through 1.1156, shall be filed in the following manner:
    (a)(1) The amount of the regulatory fee payment that is due with any 
application for authorization shall be the multiple of the number of 
years in the entire term of the requested license or other authorization 
multiplied by the annual fee payment required in the Schedule of 
Regulatory Fees, effective at the time the application is filed. Except 
as set forth in Sec. 1.1160, advance payments shall be final and shall 
not be readjusted during the term of the license or authorization, 
notwithstanding any subsequent increase or decrease in the annual amount 
of a fee required under the Schedule of Regulatory Fees.
    (2) Failure to file the appropriate regulatory fee due with an 
application for authorization will result in the return of the 
accompanying application, including an application for which the 
Commission has assigned a specific filing deadline.

[[Page 278]]

    (b)(1) Payments of standard regulatory fees applicable to certain 
wireless radio, mass media, common carrier, cable and international 
services shall be filed in full on an annual basis at a time announced 
by the Commission or the Managing Director, pursuant to delegated 
authority, and published in the Federal Register.
    (2) Large regulatory fees, as annually defined by the Commission, 
may be submitted in installment payments or in a single payment on a 
date certain as announced by the Commission or the Managing Director, 
pursuant to delegated authority, and published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Standard regulatory fee payments, as well as any installment 
payment, must be filed with a FCC Form 159, FCC Remittance Advice, and a 
FCC Form 159C, Remittance Advice Continuation Sheet, if additional space 
is needed. Failure to submit a copy of FCC Form 159 with a standard 
regulatory fee payment, or an installment payment, will result in the 
return of the submission and a 25 percent penalty if the payment is 
resubmitted after the date the Commission establishes for the payment of 
standard regulatory fees and for any installment payment.
    (1) Any late filed regulatory fee payment will be subject to the 
penalties set forth in section 1.1164.
    (2) If one or more installment payments are untimely submitted or 
not submitted at all, the eligibility of the subject regulatee to submit 
installment payments may be cancelled.
    (d) Any Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) licensee subject to 
payment of an annual regulatory fee shall retain for a period of two (2)

Sec. 1.1158  Form of payment for regulatory fees.

    Any regulatory fee payment must be submitted in the form of a check, 
bank draft or money order denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a 
United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal 
Communications Commission or by Visa, Mastercard, American Express or 
Discover credit cards only. The Commission discourages applicants from 
submitting cash payments and will not be responsible for cash sent 
through the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated more than six 
months prior to their submission to the Commission's lockbox bank and 
postdated checks will not be accepted and will be returned as deficient.
    (a) Upon authorization from the Commission following a written 
request, electronic fund transfer (EFT) payment of a regulatory fee may 
be made as follows:
    (1)(i) The payor may instruct its bank to make payment of the 
regulatory fee directly to the Commission's lockbox bank, or
    (ii) The payor may authorize the Commission to direct its lockbox 
bank to withdraw funds directly from the payor's bank account.
    (2) No EFT payment of a regulatory fee will be accepted unless the 
payor has obtained the written authorization of the Commission to submit 
regulatory fees electronically. Procedures for electronic payment of 
regulatory fees will be announced by Public Notice. It is the 
responsibility of the payor to insure that any electronic payment is 
made in the manner required by the Commission. Failure to comply with 
the Commission's procedures for electronic fee payment will result in 
the return of the fee payment, and a penalty fee of 25 percent if the 
subsequent refiling of the fee payment is late. Failure to comply will 
also subject the payor to the penalties set forth in Sec. 1.1164.
    (b) Multiple payment instruments for a single regulatory fee are not 
permitted, except that the Commission will accept multiple money orders 
in payment of any fee where the fee exceeds the maximum amount for a 
money order established by the issuing entity and the use of multiple 
money orders is the only practicable means available for payment.
    (c) Payment of multiple standard regulatory fees (including an 
installment payment) due on the same date,

[[Page 279]]

may be made with a single payment instrument and cover mass media, 
common carrier, international, and cable service fee payments. Each 
regulatee is solely responsible for accurately accounting for and 
listing each license or authorization and the number of subscribers, 
access lines, or other relevant units on the accompanying FCC Form 159 
and, if needed, FCC Form 159C and for making full payment for every 
regulatory fee listed on the accompanying form. Any omission or payment 
deficiency of a regulatory fee will result in a 25 percent penalty of 
the amount due and unpaid.
    (d) Any regulatory fee payment (including a regulatory fee payment 
submitted with an application in the wireless radio service) made by 
credit card or money order must be submitted with a completed FCC Form 
159. Failure to accurately enter the credit card number and date of 
expiration and the payor's signature in the appropriate blocks on FCC 
Form 159 will result in rejection of the credit card payment.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1159  Filing locations and receipts for regulatory fees.

    (a) Regulatory fee payments must be directed to the location and 
address set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1152 through 1.1156 for the specific 
category of fee involved. Any regulatory fee required to be submitted 
with an application must be filed as a part of the application package 
accompanying the application. The Commission will not take 
responsibility for matching fees, forms and applications submitted at 
different times or locations.
    (b) Petitions for reconsideration or applications for review of fee 
decisions submitted with a standard regulatory fee payment pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 1.1152 through 1.1156 of the rules are to be filed with the 
Commission's lockbox bank in the manner set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1152 
through 1.1156 for payment of the fee subject to the petition for 
reconsideration or the application for review. Petitions for 
reconsideration and applications for review that are submitted with no 
accompanying payment should be filed with the Secretary, Federal 
Communications Commission, Attention: Managing Director, Washington, 
D.C. 20554.
    (c) Any request for exemption from a regulatory fee shall be filed 
with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention: 
Managing Director, Washington, D.C. 20554, except that requests for 
exemption accompanied by a tentative fee payment shall be filed at the 
lockbox set forth for the appropriate service in Sec. Sec. 1.1152 
through 1.1156.
    (d) The Commission will furnish a receipt for a regulatory fee 
payment only upon request. In order to obtain a receipt for a regulatory 
fee payment, the package must include an extra copy of the Form FCC 159 
or, if a Form 159 is not required with the payment, a copy of the first 
page of the application or other filing submitted with the regulatory 
fee payment, submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt 
for the regulatory fee payment and application fee payment, if required. 
The document should be clearly marked ``copy'' and should be the top 
document in the package. The copy will be date stamped immediately and 
provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For 
submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return 
mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-
addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the receipt document.
    (e) The Managing Director may issue annually, at his discretion, a 
Public Notice setting forth the names of all commercial regulatees that 
have paid a regulatory fee and shall publish the Public Notice in the 
Federal Register.

Sec. 1.1160  Refunds of regulatory fees.

    (a) Regulatory fees will be refunded, upon request, only in the 
following instances:
    (1) When no regulatory fee is required or an excessive fee has been 
paid. In the case of an overpayment, the refund amount will be based on 
the applicants', permittees', or licensees' entire submission. All 
refunds will be issued to the payor named in the appropriate block of 
the FCC Form 159. Payments

[[Page 280]]

in excess of a regulatory fee will be refunded only if the overpayment 
is $10.00 or more.
    (2) In the case of advance payment of regulatory fees, subject to 
Sec. 1.1152, a refund will be issued based on unexpired full years:
    (i) When the Commission adopts new rules that nullify a license or 
other authorization, or a new law or treaty renders a license or other 
authorization useless;
    (ii) When a licensee in the wireless radio service surrenders the 
license or other authorization subject to a fee payment to the 
Commission; or
    (iii) When the Commission declines to grant an application submitted 
with a regulatory fee payment.
    (3) When a waiver is granted in accordance with Sec. 1.1166.
    (b) No pro-rata refund of an annual fee will be issued.
    (c) No refunds will be issued based on unexpired partial years.
    (d) No refunds will be processed without a written request from the 
applicant, permittee, licensee or agent.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1161  Conditional license grants and delegated authorizations.

    (a) Grant of any application or an instrument of authorization or 
other filing for which a regulatory fee is required to accompany the 
application or filing, will be conditioned upon final payment of the 
current or delinquent regulatory fees. Final payment shall mean receipt 
by the U.S. Treasury of funds cleared by the financial institution on 
which the check, bank draft, money order, credit card (Visa, MasterCard, 
American Express, or Discover), wire or electronic payment is drawn.
    (1) If, prior to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the 
Commission is notified that final payment of the regulatory fee has not 
been made, the application or filing:
    (i) Will be dismissed and returned;
    (ii) Shall lose its place in the processing line; and
    (iii) Will not be treated as timely filed if resubmitted after the 
relevant filing deadline.
    (2) If, subsequent to a grant of an instrument of authorization or 
other filing, the Commission is notified that final payment has not been 
made, the Commission will:
    (i) Automatically rescind that instrument of authorization for 
failure to meet the condition imposed by this subsection;
    (ii) Notify the grantee of this action; and
    (iii) Treat as late filed any application resubmitted after the 
original deadline for filing the application.
    (3) Upon receipt of a notification of rescission of the 
authorization, the grantee will immediately cease operations initiated 
pursuant to the authorization.
    (b) In those instances where the Commission has granted a request 
for deferred payment of a regulatory fee, further processing of the 
application or filing or the grant of authority shall be conditioned 
upon final payment of the regulatory fee and any required penalties for 
late payment prescribed by the deferral decision. Failure to comply with 
the terms of the deferral decision shall result in the automatic 
dismissal of the submission or rescission of the Commission 
authorization. Further, the Commission shall:
    (1) Notify the grantee that the authorization has been rescinded. 
Upon such notification, the grantee will immediately cease operations 
initiated pursuant to the authorization; and
    (2) Treat as late filed any application resubmitted after the 
original deadline for filing the application.
    (c)(1) Where an applicant is found to be delinquent in the payment 
of regulatory fees, the Commission will make a written request for the 
fee, together with any penalties that may be rendered under this 
subpart. Such request shall inform the regulatee that failure to pay may 
result in the Commission withholding action on any application or 
request filed by the applicant. The staff shall also inform the 
regulatee of the procedures for seeking Commission review of the staff's 
determination.
    (2) If, after final determination that the fee is due or that the 
applicant is delinquent in the payment of fees and payment is not made 
in a timely manner, the staff will withhold action on

[[Page 281]]

the application or filing until payment or other satisfactory 
arrangement is made. If payment or satisfactory arrangement is not made 
within 30 days, the application will be dismissed.

such other time as required by the Managing Director. Acceptable 
documentation may include Internal Revenue Service determination 
letters, state or government certifications or other documentation that 
non-profit status has been approved by a state or other governmental 
authority. Applicants, permittees and licensees are required to file 
documentation of their nonprofit status only once, except upon request 
of the Managing Director.
    (2) Within sixty (60) days of a change in nonprofit status, a 
licensee or permittee previously claiming a 501(C) exemption is required 
to file with the Secretary of the Commission (Attn: Managing Director) 
written notice of such change in its nonprofit status or ownership. 
Additionally, for-profit purchasers or assignees of a license, station

days of the effective date of the purchase or assignment.
    (d) Applicants, permittees or licensees in the Special Emergency

international radio service requiring payment of a regulatory fee, if 
the service is used in conjunction with their NCE broadcast station on 
an NCE basis.
    (g) Other applicants, permittees or licensees providing, or 
proposing to provide, a NCE or instructional service, but not qualifying 
under paragraph (e) of this section, may be exempt from regulatory fees, 
or be entitled to a refund, in the following circumstances:
    (1) The applicant, permittee or licensee is an organization that, 
like the Public Broadcasting Service or National Public Radio, receives 
funding directly or indirectly through the Public Broadcasting Fund, 47 
U.S.C. 396(k),

[[Page 282]]

distributed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where the 
authorization requested will be used in conjunction with the 
organization on an NCE basis;
    (2) An applicant, permittee or licensee of a translator or low power 
television station operating or proposing to operate an NCE service who, 
after grant, provides proof that it has received funding for the 
construction of the station through the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) or other showings as required by the 
Commission; or
    (3) An applicant, permittee, or licensee provided a fee refund under 
Sec. 1.1160 and operating as an NCE station, is exempt from fees for 
broadcast auxiliary stations (subparts D, E, F, and G of part 74 of this

international services where such authorization is to be used in 
conjunction with the NCE translator or low power station.
    (h) An applicant, permittee or licensee that is the licensee in the 
Educational Broadband Service (EBS) (formerly, Instructional Television 
Fixed Service (ITFS)) (parts 27 and 74, e.g., Sec. Sec. 27.1200, et 
seq., and 74.832(b), of this chapter) is exempt from regulatory fees 
where the authorization requested will be used by the applicant in 
conjunction with the provision of the EBS.
    (i) Applications filed in the wireless radio service for the sole 
purpose of modifying an existing authorization (or a pending application 
for authorization). However, if the applicant also requests a renewal or 
reinstatement of its license or other authorization for which the 
submission of a regulatory fee is required, the appropriate regulatory 
fee for such additional request must accompany the application.

Sec. 1.1163  Adjustments to regulatory fees.

    (a) For Fiscal Year 1995, the amounts assessed for regulatory fees 
are set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1152 through 1.1156.
    (b) For Fiscal year 1996 and thereafter, the Schedule of Regulatory 
Fees, contained in Sec. Sec. 1.1152 through 1.1156, may be adjusted 
annually by the Commission pursuant to section 9 of the Communications 
Act. 47 U.S.C. 159. Adjustments to the fees established for any category 
of regulatory fee payment shall include projected cost increases or 
decreases and an estimate of the volume of licensees or units upon which 
the regulatory fee is calculated.
    (c) The fees assessed shall:
    (1) Be derived by determining the full-time equivalent number of 
employees performing enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking 
activities, user information services, and international activities 
within the Wireline Competition Bureau, Media Bureau, International 
Bureau and other offices of the Commission, adjusted to take into 
account factors that are reasonably related to the benefits provided to 
the payor of the fee by the Commission's activities, including such 
factors as service coverage area, shared use versus exclusive use, and 
other factors that the Commission determines are necessary in the public 
interest;
    (2) Be established at amounts that will result in collection, during 
each fiscal year, of an amount that can reasonably be expected to equal 
the amount appropriated for such fiscal year for the performance of the 
activities described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) The Commission shall by rule amend the Schedule of Regulatory 
Fees by proportionate increases or decreases that reflect, in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, changes in the amount 
appropriated for the performance of the activities described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for such fiscal year. Such 
proportionate increases or decreases shall be adjusted to reflect 
unexpected increases or decreases in the number of licensees or units 
subject to payment of such fees and result in collection of an aggregate 
amount of fees that will approximately equal the amount appropriated for 
the subject regulatory activities.
    (e) The Commission shall, by rule, amend the Schedule of Regulatory 
Fees if the Commission determines that the Schedule requires amendment 
to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In 
making such amendments, the Commission shall

[[Page 283]]

add, delete or reclassify services in the Schedule to reflect additional 
deletions or changes in the nature of its services as a consequence of 
Commission rulemaking proceedings or changes in law.
    (f) In making adjustments to regulatory fees, the Commission will 
round such fees to the nearest $5.00 in the case of fees under 
$1,000.00, or to the nearest $25.00 in the case of fees of $1,000.00 or 
more.

Sec. 1.1164  Penalties for late or insufficient regulatory fee payments.

    Any late payment or insufficient payment of a regulatory fee, not 
excused by bank error, shall subject the regulatee to a 25 percent 
penalty of the amount of the fee of installment payment which was not 
paid in a timely manner. A timely fee payment or installment payment is 
one received at the Commission's lockbox bank by the due date specified 
by the Commission or by the Managing Director. A payment will also be 
considered late filed if the payment instrument (check, money order, 
bank draft or credit card) is uncollectible.
    (a) The Commission may, in its discretion, following one or more 
late filed installment payments, require a regulatee to pay the entire 
balance of its regulatory fee by a date certain, in addition to 
assessing a 25 percent penalty.
    (b) In cases were a fee payment fails due to error by the payor's 
bank, as evidenced by an affidavit of an officer of the bank, the date 
of the original submission will be considered the date of filing.
    (c) If a regulatory fee is paid in a timely manner, the regulatee 
will be notified of its deficiency. This notice will automatically 
assess a 25 percent penalty, subject the delinquent payor's pending 
applications to dismissal, and may require a delinquent payor to show 
cause why its existing instruments of authorization should not be 
subject to rescission.
    (d)(1) Where a regulatee's new, renewal or reinstatement application 
is required to be filed with a regulatory fee (as is the case with 
wireless radio services), the application will be dismissed if the 
regulatory fee is not included with the application package. In the case 
of a renewal or reinstatement application, the application may not be 
refiled unless the appropriate regulatory fee plus the 25 percent 
penalty charge accompanies the refiled application.
    (2) If the application that must be accompanied by a regulatory fee 
is a mutually exclusive application with a filing deadline, or any other 
application that must be filed by a date certain, the application will 
be dismissed if not accompanied by the proper regulatory fee and will be 
treated as late filed if resubmitted after the original date for filing 
application.
    (e) Any pending or subsequently filed application submitted by a 
party will be dismissed if that party is determined to be delinquent in 
paying a standard regulatory fee or an installment payment. The 
application may be resubmitted only if accompanied by the required 
regulatory fee and by any assessed penalty payment.
    (f) In instances where the Commission may revoke an existing 
instrument of authorization for failure to file a regulatory fee, the 
Commission will provide prior notice to the regulatee of such action and 
shall allow the licensee no less than 60 days to either pay the fee or 
show cause why the payment assessed is inapplicable or should otherwise 
be waived or deferred.
    (1) An adjudicatory hearing will not be designated unless the 
response by the regulatee to the Order to Show Cause presents a 
substantial and material question of fact.
    (2) Disposition of the proceeding shall be based upon written 
evidence only and the burden of proceeding with the introduction of 
evidence and the burden of proof shall be on the respondent regulatee.
    (3) Unless the regulatee substantially prevails in the hearing, the 
Commission may assess costs for the conduct of the proceeding against 
the respondent regulatee. See 47 U.S.C. 402(b)(5).
    (4) Any regulatee failing to submit a regulatory fee, following 
notice to the regulatee of failure to submit the required fee, is 
subject to collection of the fee, including interest thereon, any 
associated penalties, and the full cost

[[Page 284]]

of collection to the Federal government pursuant to section 3720A of the 
Internal Revenue Code, 31 U.S.C. 3717, and to the provisions of the Debt 
Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3717. See 47 CFR 1.1901 through 1.1952. The 
debt collection processes described above may proceed concurrently with 
any other sanction in this paragraph.
    (5) An application or filing by a regulatee that is delinquent in 
its debt to the Commission is also subject to dismissal under 47 CFR 
1.1910.

Sec. 1.1166  Waivers, reductions and deferrals of regulatory fees.

    The fees established by sections 1.1152 through 1.1156 may be 
waived, reduced or deferred in specific instances, on a case-by-case 
basis, where good cause is shown and where waiver, reduction or deferral 
of the fee would promote the public interest. Requests for waivers, 
reductions or deferrals of regulatory fees for entire categories of 
payors will not be considered.
    (a) Requests for waivers, reductions or deferrals will be acted upon 
by the Managing Director with the concurrence of the General Counsel. 
All such filings within the scope of the fee rules shall be filed as a 
separate pleading and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing 
Director. Any such request that is not filed as a separate pleading will 
not be considered by the Commission.
    (1) If the request for waiver, reduction or deferral is accompanied 
by a fee payment, the request must be submitted to the Commission's 
lockbox bank at the address for the appropriate service set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1152 through 1.1156 of this subpart.
    (2) If no fee payment is submitted, the request should be filed with 
the Commission's Secretary.
    (b) Deferrals of fees will be granted for a period of six months 
following the date that the fee is initially due.
    (c) Petitions for waiver of a regulatory fee must be accompanied by 
the required fee and FCC Form 159. Submitted fees will be returned if a 
waiver is granted. Waiver requests that do not include the required fees 
or forms will be dismissed unless accompanied by a petition to defer 
payment due to financial hardship, supported by documentation of the 
financial hardship.
    (d) Petitions for reduction of a fee must be accompanied by the full 
fee payment and Form 159. Petitions for reduction accompanied by a fee 
payment must be addressed to the Federal Communications Commission, 
Attention: Petitions, Post Office Box 979084, St. Louis, Missouri, 
63197-9000. Petitions for reduction that do not include the required 
fees or forms will be dismissed unless accompanied by a petition to 
defer payment due to financial hardship, supported by documentation of 
the financial hardship.
    (e) Petitions for waiver of a fee based on financial hardship, 
including bankruptcy, will not be granted, even if otherwise consistent 
with Commission policy, to the extent that the total regulatory and 
application fees for which waiver is sought exceeds $500,000 in any 
fiscal year, including regulatory fees due in any fiscal year, but paid 
prior to the due date. In computing this amount, the amounts owed by an 
entity and its subsidiaries and other affiliated entities will be 
aggregated. In cases where the claim of financial hardship is not based 
on bankruptcy, waiver, partial waiver, or deferral of fees above the 
$500,000 cap may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 1.1167  Error claims related to regulatory fees.

    (a) Challenges to determinations or an insufficient regulatory fee 
payment or delinquent fees should be made in

[[Page 285]]

writing. A challenge to a determination that a party is delinquent in 
paying a standard regulatory fee must be accompanied by suitable proof 
that the fee had been paid or waived (deferred from payment during the 
period in question), or by the required regulatory payment and any 
assessed penalty payment (see Sec. 1.1164(c) of this subpart). 
Challenges submitted with a fee payment must be submitted to address 
stated on the invoice or billing statement. Challenges not accompanied 
by a fee payment should be filed with the Commission's Secretary and 
clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director or emailed to 
ARINQUIRIES@fcc.gov.
    (b) The filing of a petition for reconsideration or an application 
for review of a fee determination will not relieve licensees from the 
requirement that full and proper payment of the underlying fee payment 
be submitted, as required by the Commission's action, or delegated 
action, on a request for waiver, reduction or deferment. Petitions for 
reconsideration and applications for review submitted with a fee payment 
must be submitted to the same location as the original fee payment. 
Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review not 
accompanied by a fee payment should be filed with the Commission's 
Secretary and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director.
    (1) Failure to submit the fee by the date required will result in 
the assessment of a 25 percent penalty.
    (2) If the fee payment should fail while the Commission is 
considering the matter, the petition for reconsideration or application 
for review will be dismissed.

Appropriation Act of 1952, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 9701, which authorizes 
agencies to prescribe regulations that establish charges for the 
provision of government services and products. Under this authority, the 
Federal Communications Commission may prescribe and collect fees for 
competitive bidding-related services and products as specified in Sec. 
1.1182.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1200  Introduction.

    (a) Purpose. To ensure the fairness and integrity of its decision-
making, the Commission has prescribed rules to regulate ex parte 
presentations in Commission proceedings. These rules specify ``exempt'' 
proceedings, in which ex

[[Page 286]]

parte presentations may be made freely (Sec. 1.1204(b)), ``permit-but-
disclose'' proceedings, in which ex parte presentations to Commission 
decision-making personnel are permissible but subject to certain 
disclosure requirements (Sec. 1.1206), and ``restricted'' proceedings 
in which ex parte presentations to and from Commission decision-making 
personnel are generally prohibited (Sec. 1.1208). In all proceedings, a 
certain period (''the Sunshine Agenda period'') is designated in which 
all presentations to Commission decision-making personnel are prohibited 
(Sec. 1.1203). The limitations on ex parte presentations described in 
this section are subject to certain general exceptions set forth in 
Sec. 1.1204(a). Where the public interest so requires in a particular 
proceeding, the Commission and its staff retain the discretion to modify 
the applicable ex parte rules by order, letter, or public notice. Joint 
Boards may modify the ex parte rules in proceedings before them.
    (b) Inquiries concerning the propriety of ex parte presentations 
should be directed to the Office of General Counsel.

[62 FR 15853, Apr. 3, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1202  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Presentation. A communication directed to the merits or outcome 
of a proceeding, including any attachments to a written communication or 
documents shown in connection with an oral presentation directed to the 
merits or outcome of a proceeding. Excluded from this term are 
communications which are inadvertently or casually made, inquiries 
concerning compliance with procedural requirements if the procedural 
matter is not an area of controversy in the proceeding, statements made 
by decisionmakers that are limited to providing publicly available 
information about pending proceedings, and inquiries relating solely to 
the status of a proceeding, including inquiries as to the approximate 
time that action in a proceeding may be taken. However, a status inquiry 
which states or implies a view as to the merits or outcome of the 
proceeding or a preference for a particular party, which states why 
timing is important to a particular party or indicates a view as to the 
date by which a proceeding should be resolved, or which otherwise is 
intended to address the merits or outcome or to influence the timing of 
a proceeding is a presentation.

    Note to paragraph (a): A communication expressing concern about 
administrative delay or expressing concern that a proceeding be resolved 
expeditiously will be treated as a permissible status inquiry so long as 
no reason is given as to why the proceeding should be expedited other 
than the need to resolve administrative delay, no view is expressed as 
to the merits or outcome of the proceeding, and no view is expressed as 
to a date by which the proceeding should be resolved. A presentation by 
a party in a restricted proceeding not designated for hearing requesting 
action by a particular date or giving reasons that a proceeding should 
be expedited other than the need to avoid administrative delay (and 
responsive presentations by other parties) may be made on an ex parte 
basis subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.1204(a)(11).

    (b) Ex parte presentation. Any presentation which:
    (1) If written, is not served on the parties to the proceeding; or
    (2) If oral, is made without advance notice to the parties and 
without opportunity for them to be present.

    Note to paragraph (b): Written communications include electronic 
submissions transmitted in the form of texts, such as by Internet 
electronic mail.

    (c) Decision-making personnel. Any member, officer, or employee of 
the Commission, or, in the case of a Joint Board, its members or their 
staffs, who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in 
formulating a decision, rule, or order in a proceeding. Any person who 
has been made a party to a proceeding or who otherwise has been excluded 
from the decisional process shall not be treated as a decision-maker 
with respect to that proceeding. Thus, any person designated as part of 
a separate trial staff shall not be considered a decision-making person 
in the designated proceeding. Unseparated Bureau or Office staff shall 
be considered decision-making personnel with respect to decisions, 
rules, and orders in which their Bureau or Office participates in 
enacting, preparing, or reviewing.

[[Page 287]]

    (d) Party. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the following 
persons are parties:
    (1) In a proceeding not designated for hearing, any person who files 
an application, waiver request, petition, motion, request for a 
declaratory ruling, or other filing seeking affirmative relief 
(including a Freedom of Information Act request), and any person (other 
than an individual viewer or listener filing comments regarding a 
pending broadcast application or members of Congress or their staffs or 
branches of the federal government or their staffs) filing a written 
submission referencing and regarding such pending filing which is served 
on the filer, or, in the case of an application, any person filing a 
mutually exclusive application;

    Note 1 to paragraph (d)(1): Persons who file mutually exclusive 
applications for services that the Commission has announced will be 
subject to competitive bidding or lotteries shall not be deemed parties 
with respect to each others' applications merely because their 
applications are mutually exclusive. Therefore, such applicants may make 
presentations to the Commission about their own applications provided 
that no one has become a party with respect to their application by 
other means, e.g., by filing a petition or other opposition against the 
applicant or an associated waiver request, if the petition or opposition 
has been served on the applicant.

    (2) Any person who files a complaint or request to revoke a license 
or other authorization or for an order to show cause which shows that 
the complainant has served it on the subject of the complaint or which 
is a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 and Sec. 1.721 of this 
chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either Sec. Sec. 6.21 or 7.21 of this 
chapter, and the person who is the subject of such a complaint or 
request that shows service or is a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 
and Sec. 1.721 of this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either Sec. Sec. 
6.21 or 7.21 of this chapter;
    (3) The subject of an order to show cause, hearing designation 
order, notice of apparent liability, or similar notice or order, or 
petition for such notice or order;
    (4) In a proceeding designated for hearing, any person who has been 
given formal party status; and
    (5) In an informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 
of the Administrative Procedure Act (other than a proceeding for the 
allotment of a broadcast channel) or a proceeding before a Joint Board 
or before the Commission to consider the recommendation of a Joint 
Board, members of the general public after the issuance of a notice of 
proposed rulemaking or other order as provided under Sec. 1.1206(a) (1) 
or (2).
    (6) In an informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 
of the Administrative Procedure Act (other than a proceeding for the 
allotment of a broadcast channel) or a proceeding before a Joint Board 
or before the Commission to consider the recommendation of a Joint 
Board, members of the general public after the issuance of a notice of 
proposed rulemaking or other order as provided under Sec. 1.1206(a) (1) 
or (2).

    Note 2 to paragraph (d): To be deemed a party, a person must make 
the relevant filing with the Secretary, the relevant Bureau or Office, 
or the Commission as a whole. Written submissions made only to the 
Chairman or individual Commissioners will not confer party status.
    Note 3 to paragraph (d): The fact that a person is deemed a party 
for purposes of this subpart does not constitute a determination that 
such person has satisfied any other legal or procedural requirements, 
such as the operative requirements for petitions to deny or requirements 
as to timeliness. Nor does it constitute a determination that such 
person has any other procedural rights, such as the right to intervene 
in hearing proceedings. The Commission or the staff may also determine 
in particular instances that persons who qualify as ``parties'' under 
Sec. 1.1202(d) should nevertheless not be deemed parties for purposes 
of this subpart.
    Note 4 to paragraph (d): Individual listeners or viewers submitting 
comments regarding a pending broadcast application pursuant to Sec. 
1.1204(a)(8) will not become parties simply by service of the comments. 
The Media Bureau may, in its discretion, make such a commenter a party, 
if doing so would be conducive to the Commission's consideration of the 
application or would otherwise be appropriate.
    Note 5 to paragraph (d): A member of Congress or his or her staff, 
or other agencies or branches of the federal government or their staffs 
will not become a party by service of a written submission regarding a 
pending proceeding that has not been designated

[[Page 288]]

for hearing unless the submission affirmatively seeks and warrants grant 
of party status.

    (e) Matter designated for hearing. Any matter that has been 
designated for hearing before an administrative law judge or which is 
otherwise designated for hearing in accordance with procedures in 5 
U.S.C. 554.

                       Sunshine Period Prohibition


<R05>
Sec. 1.1203  Sunshine period prohibition.

    (a) With respect to any Commission proceeding, all presentations to 
decisionmakers concerning matters listed on a Sunshine Agenda, whether 
ex parte or not, are prohibited during the period prescribed in 
paragraph (b) of this section unless:
    (1) The presentation is exempt under Sec. 1.1204(a);
    (2) The presentation relates to settlement negotiations and 
otherwise complies with any ex parte restrictions in this subpart;
    (3) The presentation occurs in the course of a widely attended 
speech or panel discussion and concerns a Commission action in an exempt 
or a permit-but-disclose proceeding that has been adopted (not including 
private presentations made on the site of a widely attended speech or 
panel discussion); or
    (4) The presentation is made by a member of Congress or his or her 
staff, or by other agencies or branches of the Federal government or 
their staffs in a proceeding exempt under Sec. 1.1204 or subject to 
permit-but-disclose requirements under Sec. 1.1206. If the presentation 
is of substantial significance and clearly intended to affect the 
ultimate decision, the presentation (or, if oral, a summary of the 
presentation) must be placed in the record of the proceeding by 
Commission staff or by the presenter in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in Sec. 1.1206(b).
    (b) The prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
applies from the release of a public notice that a matter has been 
placed on the Sunshine Agenda until the Commission:
    (1) Releases the text of a decision or order relating to the matter;
    (2) Issues a public notice stating that the matter has been deleted 
from the Sunshine Agenda; or
    (3) Issues a public notice stating that the matter has been returned 
to the staff for further consideration, whichever occurs first.

                           General Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 1.1204  Exempt ex parte presentations and proceedings.

    (a) Exempt ex parte presentations. The following types of 
presentations are exempt from the prohibitions in restricted proceedings 
(Sec. 1.1208), the disclosure requirements in permit-but-disclose 
proceedings (Sec. 1.1206), and the prohibitions during the Sunshine 
Agenda period prohibition (Sec. 1.1203):
    (1) The presentation is authorized by statute or by the Commission's 
rules to be made without service, see, e.g., Sec. 1.333(d), or involves 
the filing of required forms;
    (2) The presentation is made by or to the General Counsel and his or 
her staff and concerns judicial review of a matter that has been decided 
by the Commission;
    (3) The presentation directly relates to an emergency in which the 
safety of life is endangered or substantial loss of property is 
threatened, provided that, if not otherwise submitted for the record, 
Commission staff promptly places the presentation or a summary of the 
presentation in the record and discloses it to other parties as 
appropriate.
    (4) The presentation involves a military or foreign affairs function 
of the United States or classified security information;
    (5) The presentation is to or from an agency or branch of the 
Federal Government or its staff and involves a matter over which that 
agency or branch and the Commission share jurisdiction provided that, 
any new factual information obtained through such a presentation that is 
relied on by the Commission in its decision-making process will, if not 
otherwise submitted

[[Page 289]]

for the record, be disclosed by the Commission no later than at the time 
of the release of the Commission's decision;
    (6) The presentation is to or from the United States Department of 
Justice or Federal Trade Commission and involves a telecommunications 
competition matter in a proceeding which has not been designated for 
hearing and in which the relevant agency is not a party or commenter (in 
an informal rulemaking or Joint board proceeding) provided that, any new 
factual information obtained through such a presentation that is relied 
on by the Commission in its decision-making process will be disclosed by 
the Commission no later than at the time of the release of the 
Commission's decision;

    Note 1 to paragraph (a): Under paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this 
section, information will be relied on and disclosure will be made only 
after advance coordination with the agency involved in order to ensure 
that the agency involved retains control over the timing and extent of 
any disclosure that may have an impact on that agency's jurisdictional 
responsibilities. If the agency involved does not wish such information 
to be disclosed, the Commission will not disclose it and will disregard 
it in its decision-making process, unless it fits within another 
exemption not requiring disclosure (e.g., foreign affairs). The fact 
that an agency's views are disclosed under paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) 
does not preclude further discussions pursuant to, and in accordance 
with, the exemption.

    (7) The presentation is between Commission staff and an advisory 
coordinating committee member with respect to the coordination of 
frequency assignments to stations in the private land mobile services or 
fixed services as authorized by 47 U.S.C. 332;
    (8) The presentation is a written presentation made by a listener or 
viewer of a broadcast station who is not a party under Sec. 
1.1202(d)(1), and the presentation relates to a pending application that 
has not been designated for hearing for a new or modified broadcast 
station or license, for renewal of a broadcast station license or for 
assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast permit or license;
    (9) The presentation is made pursuant to an express or implied 
promise of confidentiality to protect an individual from the possibility 
of reprisal, or there is a reasonable expectation that disclosure would 
endanger the life or physical safety of an individual;
    (10) The presentation is requested by (or made with the advance 
approval of) the Commission or staff for the clarification or adduction 
of evidence, or for resolution of issues, including possible settlement, 
subject to the following limitations:
    (i) This exemption does not apply to restricted proceedings 
designated for hearing;
    (ii) In restricted proceedings not designated for hearing, any new 
written information elicited from such request or a summary of any new 
oral information elicited from such request shall promptly be served by 
the person making the presentation on the other parties to the 
proceeding. Information relating to how a proceeding should or could be 
settled, as opposed to new information regarding the merits, shall not 
be deemed to be new information for purposes of this section. The 
Commission or its staff may waive the service requirement if service 
would be too burdensome because the parties are numerous or because the 
materials relating to such presentation are voluminous. If the service 
requirement is waived, copies of the presentation or summary shall be 
placed in the record of the proceeding and the Commission or its staff 
shall issue a public notice which states that copies of the presentation 
or summary are available for inspection. The Commission or its staff may 
determine that service or public notice would interfere with the 
effective conduct of an investigation and dispense with the service and 
public notice requirements;
    (iii) If the presentation is made in a proceeding subject to permit-
but-disclose requirements, disclosure of any new written information 
elicited from such request or a summary of any new oral information 
elicited from such request must be made in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 1.1206(b), provided, however, that the Commission 
or its staff may determine that disclosure would interfere with the 
effective conduct of an investigation and dispense with the disclosure 
requirement.

[[Page 290]]

As in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section, information relating to how 
a proceeding should or could be settled, as opposed to new information 
regarding the merits, shall not be deemed to be new information for 
purposes of this section;

    Note 2 to paragraph (a): If the Commission or its staff dispenses 
with the service or notice requirement to avoid interference with an 
investigation, a determination will be made in the discretion of the 
Commission or its staff as to when and how disclosure should be made if 
necessary. See Amendment of Subpart H, Part I, 2 FCC Rcd 6053, 6054 ]] 
10-14 (1987).

    (iv) If the presentation is made in a proceeding subject to the 
Sunshine period prohibition, disclosure must be made in accordance with 
the requirements of Sec. 1.1206(b) or by other adequate means of notice 
that the Commission deems appropriate;
    (v) In situations where new information regarding the merits is 
disclosed during settlement discussions, and the Commission or staff 
intends that the product of the settlement discussions will be disclosed 
to the other parties or the public for comment before any action is 
taken, the Commission or staff in its discretion may defer disclosure of 
such new information until comment is sought on the settlement proposal 
or the settlement discussions are terminated.
    (11) The presentation is an oral presentation in a restricted 
proceeding not designated for hearing requesting action by a particular 
date or giving reasons that a proceeding should be expedited other than 
the need to avoid administrative delay. A detailed summary of the 
presentation shall promptly be filed in the record and served by the 
person making the presentation on the other parties to the proceeding, 
who may respond in support or opposition to the request for expedition, 
including by oral ex parte presentation, subject to the same service 
requirement.
    (12) The presentation is between Commission staff and:
    (i) The administrator of the interstate telecommunications relay 
services fund relating to administration of the telecommunications relay 
services fund pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 225;
    (ii) The North American Numbering Plan Administrator or the North 
American Numbering Plan Billing and Collection Agent relating to the 
administration of the North American Numbering Plan pursuant to 47 
U.S.C. 251(e);
    (iii) The Universal Service Administrative Company relating to the 
administration of universal service support mechanisms pursuant to 47 
U.S.C. 254; or
    (iv) The Number Portability Administrator relating to the 
administration of local number portability pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 
251(b)(2) and (e); provided that the relevant administrator has not 
filed comments or otherwise participated as a party in the proceeding.
    (b) Exempt proceedings. Unless otherwise provided by the Commission 
or the staff pursuant to Sec. 1.1200(a), ex parte presentations to or 
from Commission decision-making personnel are permissible and need not 
be disclosed with respect to the following proceedings, which are 
referred to as ``exempt'' proceedings:
    (1) A notice of inquiry proceeding;
    (2) A petition for rulemaking, except for a petition requesting the 
allotment of a broadcast channel (see also Sec. 1.1206(a)(1)), or other 
request that the Commission modify its rules, issue a policy statement 
or issue an interpretive rule, or establish a Joint Board;
    (3) A tariff proceeding (including directly associated waiver 
requests or requests for special permission) prior to it being set for 
investigation (see also Sec. 1.1206(a)(4));
    (4) A proceeding relating to prescription of common carrier 
depreciation rates under section 220(b) of the Communications Act prior 
to release of a public notice of specific proposed depreciation rates 
(see also Sec. 1.1206(a)(9));
    (5) An informal complaint proceeding under 47 U.S.C. 208 and Sec. 
1.717 of this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either Sec. Sec. 6.17 or 
7.17 of this chapter; and
    (6) A complaint against a cable operator regarding its rates that is 
not filed on the standard complaint form required by Sec. 76.951 of 
this chapter (FCC Form 329).

    Notes 1-3 to paragraph (b): [Reserved]
    Note 4 to paragraph (b): In the case of petitions for rulemaking 
that seek Commission

preemption of state or local regulatory authority, the petitioner must 
serve the original petition on any state or local government, the 
actions of which are specifically cited as a basis for requesting 
preemption. Service should be made on those bodies within the state or 
local governments that are legally authorized to accept service of legal 
documents in a civil context. Such pleadings that are not served will be 
dismissed without consideration as a defective pleading and treated as a 
violation of the ex parte rules unless the Commission determines that 
the matter should be entertained by making it part of the record under 
Sec. 1.1212(d) and the parties are so informed.

                       Non-Restricted Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.1206  Permit-but-disclose proceedings.

    (a) Unless otherwise provided by the Commission or the staff 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1200(a), until the proceeding is no longer subject 
to administrative reconsideration or review or to judicial review, ex 
parte presentations (other than ex parte presentations exempt under 
Sec. 1.1204(a)) to or from Commission decision-making personnel are 
permissible in the following proceedings, which are referred to as 
permit-but-disclose proceedings, provided that ex parte presentations to 
Commission decision-making personnel are disclosed pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section:

    Note 1 to paragraph (a): In the case of petitions for declaratory 
ruling that seek Commission preemption of state or local regulatory 
authority and petitions for relief under 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)(v), the 
petitioner must serve the original petition on any state or local 
government, the actions of which are specifically cited as a basis for 
requesting preemption. Service should be made on those bodies within the 
state or local governments that are legally authorized to accept service 
of legal documents in a civil context. Such pleadings that are not 
served will be dismissed without consideration as a defective pleading 
and treated as a violation of the ex parte rules unless the Commission 
determines that the matter should be entertained by making it part of 
the record under Sec. 1.1212(d) and the parties are so informed.

    (1) An informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 of 
the Administrative Procedure Act other than a proceeding for the 
allotment of a broadcast channel, upon release of a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (see also Sec. 1.1204(b)(2));
    (2) A proceeding involving a rule change, policy statement or 
interpretive rule adopted without a Notice of Proposed Rule Making upon

of the Communications Act that does not also involve applications under 
Title III of the Communications Act (see also Sec. 1.1208);
    (6) Unless designated for hearing, a proceeding involving an 
application for a Cable Landing Act license that does not also involve 
applications under Title III of the Communications Act (see also Sec. 
1.1208);
    (7) A proceeding involving a request for information filed pursuant 
to the Freedom of Information Act;

    Note 2 to paragraph (a): Where the requested information is the 
subject of a request for confidentiality, the person filing the request

    (8) A proceeding before a Joint Board or a proceeding before the 
Commission involving a recommendation from a Joint Board;
    (9) A proceeding conducted pursuant to section 220(b) of the 
Communications Act for prescription of common carrier depreciation rates 
upon release of a public notice of specific proposed depreciation rates 
(see also Sec. 1.1204(b)(4));
    (10) A proceeding to prescribe a rate of return for common carriers 
under section 205 of the Communications Act; and
    (11) A cable rate complaint proceeding pursuant to section 623(c) of 
the Communications Act where the complaint is filed on FCC Form 329.

    Note 3 to paragraph (a): In a permit-but-disclose proceeding 
involving only one ``party,'' as defined in Sec. 1.1202(d) of this 
section, the party and the Commission may freely make presentations to 
each other and need not comply with the disclosure requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b) The following disclosure requirements apply to ex parte 
presentations in permit but disclose proceedings:
    (1) Written presentations. A person who makes a written ex parte 
presentation subject to this section shall, no later than the next 
business day after the presentation, submit two copies of the 
presentation to the Commission's secretary under separate cover for 
inclusion in the public record. The presentation (and cover letter) 
shall clearly identify the proceeding to which it relates, including the 
docket number, if any, shall indicate that two copies have been 
submitted to the Secretary, and must be labeled as an ex parte 
presentation. If the presentation relates to more than one proceeding, 
two copies shall be filed for each proceeding. Alternatively, in 
rulemaking proceedings governed by Sec. 1.49(f), the person making the 
presentation may file one copy of the presentation electronically; no 
additional paper copies need to be filed.
    (2) Oral presentations. A person who makes an oral ex parte 
presentation subject to this section that presents data or arguments not 
already reflected in that person's written comments, memoranda or other 
filings in that proceeding shall, no later than the next business day 
after the presentation, submit to the Commission's Secretary, an 
original and one copy of a memorandum which summarizes the new data or 
arguments. Except in proceedings subject to Sec. 1.49(f) in which 
pleadings are filed electronically, a copy of the memorandum must also 
be submitted to the Commissioners or Commission employees involved in 
the oral presentation. In proceedings governed by Sec. 1.49(f), the 
person making the presentation may, alternatively, electronically file 
one copy of the memorandum, which will be available to Commissioners and 
Commission employees involved in the presentation through the 
Commission's electronic comment filing system. Memoranda must contain a 
summary of the substance of the ex parte presentation and not merely a 
listing of the subjects discussed. More than a one or two sentence 
description of the views and arguments presented is generally required. 
The memorandum (and cover letter) shall clearly identify the proceeding 
to which it relates, including the docket number, if any, shall indicate 
that an original and one copy have been submitted to the Secretary or 
that one copy has been filed electronically, and must be labeled as an 
ex parte presentation. If the presentation relates to more than one 
proceeding, two copies of the memorandum (or an original and one copy) 
shall be filed for each proceeding.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b): Where, for example, presentations occur in 
the form of discussion at a widely attended meeting, preparation of a 
memorandum as specified in the rule might be cumbersome. Under these 
circumstances, the rule may be satisfied by submitting a transcript or 
tape recording of the discussion as an alternative to a memorandum.

    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, in 
permit-but-disclose proceedings presentations made by members of 
Congress or their staffs or by an agency or branch of the Federal 
Government or its staff shall be treated as ex parte presentations only 
if the presentations are of substantial significance and clearly 
intended to affect the ultimate decision. The Commission staff shall 
prepare a written summary of any such oral presentations and place them 
in the record in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section and 
place any such written presentations in the record in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Notice of ex parte presentations. The Commission's Secretary or, 
in the case of non-docketed proceedings, the relevant Bureau or Office 
shall place in

[[Page 293]]

the public file or record of the proceeding written ex parte 
presentations and memoranda reflecting oral ex parte presentations. The 
Secretary shall issue a public notice listing any written ex parte 
presentations or written summaries of oral ex parte presentations 
received by his or her office relating to any permit-but-disclose 
proceeding. Such public notices should generally be released at least 
twice per week.

    Note 2 to paragraph (b): Interested persons should be aware that 
some ex parte filings, for example, those not filed in accordance with 
the requirements of this paragraph (b), might not be placed on the 
referenced public notice. All ex parte presentations and memoranda filed 
under this section will be available for public inspection in the public 
file or record of the proceeding, and parties wishing to ensure 
awareness of all filings should review the public file or record.
    Note 3 to paragraph (b): As a matter of convenience, the Secretary 
may also list on the referenced public notices materials, even if not ex 
parte presentations, that are filed after the close of the reply comment 
period or, if the matter is on reconsideration, the reconsideration 
reply comment period.

                         Restricted Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.1208  Restricted proceedings.

    Unless otherwise provided by the Commission or its staff pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1200(a) of this section, ex parte presentations (other than ex 
parte presentations exempt under Sec. 1.1204(a) of this section) to or 
from Commission decision-making personnel are prohibited in all 
proceedings not listed as exempt in Sec. 1.1204(b) or permit-but-
disclose in Sec. 1.1206(a) of this section until the proceeding is no 
longer subject to administrative reconsideration or review or judicial 
review. Proceedings in which ex parte presentations are prohibited, 
referred to as ``restricted'' proceedings, include, but are not limited 
to, all proceedings that have been designated for hearing, proceedings 
involving amendments to the broadcast table of allotments, applications 
for authority under Title III of the Communications Act, and all waiver 
proceedings (except for those directly associated with tariff filings).

    Note 1 to Sec. 1.1208: In a restricted proceeding involving only 
one ``party,'' as defined in Sec. 1.1202(d), the party and the 
Commission may freely make presentations to each other because there is 
no other party to be served or with a right to have an opportunity to be 
present. See Sec. 1.1202(b). Therefore, to determine whether 
presentations are permissible in a restricted proceeding without service 
or notice and an opportunity for other parties to be present the 
definition of a ``party'' should be consulted.
    Examples: After the filing of an uncontested application or waiver 
request, the applicant or other filer would be the sole party to the 
proceeding. The filer would have no other party to serve with or give 
notice of any presentations to the Commission, and such presentations 
would therefore not be ``ex parte presentations'' as defined by Sec. 
1.1202(b) and would not be prohibited. On the other hand, in the example 
given, because the filer is a party, a third person who wished to make a 
presentation to the Commission concerning the application or waiver 
request would have to serve or notice the filer. Further, once the 
proceeding involved additional ``parties'' as defined by Sec. 1.1202(d) 
(e.g., an opponent of the filer who served the opposition on the filer), 
the filer and other parties would have to serve or notice all other 
parties.
    Note 2 to Sec. 1.1208: Consistent with Sec. 1.1200(a), the 
Commission or its staff may determine that a restricted proceeding not 
designated for hearing involves primarily issues of broadly applicable 
policy rather than the rights and responsibilities of specific parties 
and specify that the proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1206 governing permit-but-disclose proceedings.

      Procedures for Handling of Prohibited Ex Parte Presentations


<R05>
Sec. 1.1212  Procedures for handling of prohibited ex parte presentations.

    (a) Commission personnel who believe that an oral presentation which 
is being made to them or is about to be

[[Page 294]]

made to them is prohibited shall promptly advise the person initiating 
the presentation that it is prohibited and shall terminate the 
discussion.
    (b) Commission personnel who receive oral ex parte presentations 
which they believe are prohibited shall forward to the Office of General 
Counsel a statement containing the following information:
    (1) The name of the proceeding;
    (2) The name and address of the person making the presentation and 
that person's relationship (if any) to the parties to the proceeding;
    (3) The date and time of the presentation, its duration, and the 
circumstances under which it was made;
    (4) A full summary of the substance of the presentation;
    (5) Whether the person making the presentation persisted in doing so 
after being advised that the presentation was prohibited; and
    (6) The date and time that the statement was prepared.
    (c) Commission personnel who receive written ex parte presentations 
which they believe are prohibited shall forward them to the Office of 
General Counsel. If the circumstances in which the presentation was made 
are not apparent from the presentation itself, a statement describing 
those circumstances shall be submitted to the Office of General Counsel 
with the presentation.
    (d) Prohibited written ex parte presentations and all documentation 
relating to prohibited written and oral ex parte presentations shall be 
placed in a public file which shall be associated with but not made part 
of the record of the proceeding to which the presentations pertain. Such 
materials may be considered in determining the merits of a restricted 
proceeding only if they are made part of the record and the parties are 
so informed.
    (e) If the General Counsel determines that an ex parte presentation 
or presentation during the Sunshine period is prohibited by this 
subpart, he or she shall notify the parties to the proceeding that a 
prohibited presentation has occurred and shall serve on the parties 
copies of the presentation (if written) and any statements describing 
the circumstances of the presentation. Service by the General Counsel 
shall not be deemed to cure any violation of the rules against 
prohibited ex parte presentations.
    (f) If the General Counsel determines that service on the parties 
would be unduly burdensome because the parties to the proceeding are 
numerous, he or she may issue a public notice in lieu of service. The 
public notice shall state that a prohibited presentation has been made 
and may also state that the presentation and related materials are 
available for public inspection.
    (g) The General Counsel shall forward a copy of any statement 
describing the circumstances in which the prohibited ex parte 
presentation was made to the person who made the presentation. Within 
ten days thereafter, the person who made the presentation may file with 
the General Counsel a sworn declaration regarding the presentation and 
the circumstances in which it was made. The General Counsel may serve 
copies of the sworn declaration on the parties to the proceeding.
    (h) Where a restricted proceeding precipitates a substantial amount 
of correspondence from the general public, the procedures in paragraphs 
(c) through (g) of this section will not be followed with respect to 
such correspondence. The correspondence will be placed in a public file 
and be made available for public inspection.

[62 FR 15857, Apr. 3, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1214  Disclosure of information concerning violations of this subpart.

    Any party to a proceeding or any Commission employee who has 
substantial reason to believe that any violation of this subpart has 
been solicited, attempted, or committed shall promptly advise the Office 
of General Counsel in writing of all the facts and circumstances which 
are known to him or her.

                                Sanctions


<R05>
Sec. 1.1216  Sanctions.

    (a) Parties. Upon notice and hearing, any party to a proceeding who 
directly or indirectly violates or causes the violation of any provision 
of this subpart,

[[Page 295]]

or who fails to report the facts and circumstances concerning any such 
violation as required by this subpart, may be disqualified from further 
participation in that proceeding. In proceedings other than a 
rulemaking, a party who has violated or caused the violation of any 
provision of this subpart may be required to show cause why his or her 
claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, 
disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected. In any proceeding, such 
alternative or additional sanctions as may be appropriate may also be 
imposed.
    (b) Commission personnel. Commission personnel who violate 
provisions of this subpart may be subject to appropriate disciplinary or 
other remedial action as provided in part 19 of this chapter.
    (c) Other persons. Such sanctions as may be appropriate under the 
circumstances shall be imposed upon other persons who violate the 
provisions of this subpart.

Subpart I_Procedures Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act 
                                 of 1969

    Source: 51 FR 15000, Apr. 22, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1301  Basis and purpose.

    The provisions of this subpart implement Subchapter I of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321-
4335.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1302  Cross-reference; Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality.

    A further explanation regarding implementation of the National 
Environmental Policy Act is provided by the regulations issued by the 
Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR 1500-1508.28.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1303  Scope.

    The provisions of this subpart shall apply to all Commission actions 
that may or will have a significant impact on the quality of the human 
environment. To the extent that other provisions of the Commission's 
rules and regulations are inconsistent with the subpart, the provisions 
of this subpart shall govern.

[55 FR 20396, May 16, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1304  Information and assistance.

    For general information and assistance concerning the provisions of 
this subpart, the Office of General Counsel may be contacted, (202) 632-
6990. For more specific information, the Bureau responsible for 
processing a specific application should be contacted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1305  Actions which normally will have a significant impact upon the environment, for which Environmental Impact Statements must be prepared.

    Any Commission action deemed to have a significant effect upon the 
quality of the human environment requires the preparation of a Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Final Environmental Impact 
Statement (FEIS) (collectively referred to as EISs) (see Sec. Sec. 
1.1314, 1.1315 and 1.1317). The Commission has reviewed representative 
actions and has found no common pattern which would enable it to specify 
actions that will thus automatically require EISs.

    Note: Our current application forms refer applicants to Sec. 1.1305 
to determine if their proposals are such that the submission of 
environmental information is required (see Sec. 1.1311). Until the 
application forms are revised to reflect our new environmental rules, 
applicants should refer to Sec. 1.1307. Section 1.1307 now delineates 
those actions for which applicants must submit environmental 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1306  Actions which are categorically excluded from environmental processing.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 1.1307 (c) and (d), Commission 
actions not covered by Sec. 1.1307 (a) and (b) are deemed individually 
and cumulatively to have no significant effect on the quality of the 
human environment and are categorically excluded from environmental 
processing.
    (b) Specifically, any Commission action with respect to any new 
application, or minor or major modifications of existing or authorized 
facilities or equipment, will be categorically excluded, provided such 
proposals do not:

[[Page 296]]

    (1) Involve a site location specified under Sec. 1.1307(a) (1)-(7), 
or
    (2) Involve high intensity lighting under Sec. 1.1307(a)(8).
    (3) Result in human exposure to radiofrequency radiation in excess 
of the applicable safety standards specified in Sec. 1.1307(b).

    Note 1: The provisions of Sec. 1.1307(a) of this part requiring the 
preparation of EAs do not encompass the mounting of antenna(s) on an 
existing building or antenna tower unless Sec. 1.1307(a)(4) of this 
part is applicable. Such antennas are subject to Sec. 1.1307(b) of this 
part and require EAs if their construction would result in human 
exposure to radiofrequency radiation in excess of the applicable health 
and safety guidelines cited in Sec. 1.1307(b) of this part. The 
provisions of Sec. 1.1307 (a) and (b) of this part do not encompass the 
installation of aerial wire or cable over existing aerial corridors of 
prior or permitted use or the underground installation of wire or cable 
along existing underground corridors of prior or permitted use, 
established by the applicant or others. The use of existing buildings, 
towers or corridors is an environmentally desirable alternative to the 
construction of new facilities and is encouraged. The provisions of 
Sec. 1.1307(a) and (b) of this part do not encompass the construction 
of new submarine cable systems.
    Note 2: The specific height of an antenna tower or supporting 
structure, as well as the specific diameter of a satellite earth 
station, in and of itself, will not be deemed sufficient to warrant 
environmental processing, see Sec. Sec. 1.1307 and 1.1308.
    Note 3: The construction of an antenna tower or supporting structure 
in an established ``antenna farm'': (i.e., an area in which similar 
antenna towers are clustered, whether or not such area has been 
officially designated as an antenna farm), will be categorically 
excluded unless one or more of the antennas to be mounted on the tower 
or structure are subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.1307(b) and the 
additional radiofrequency radiation from the antenna(s) on the new tower 
or structure would cause human exposure in excess of the applicable 
health and safety guidelines cited in Sec. 1.1307(b).

19, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1307  Actions that may have a significant environmental effect, for which Environmental Assessments (EAs) must be prepared.

    (a) Commission actions with respect to the following types of 
facilities may significantly affect the environment and thus require the 
preparation of EAs by the applicant (see Sec. Sec. 1.1308 and 1.1311) 
and may require further Commission environmental processing (see 
Sec. Sec. 1.1314, 1.1315 and 1.1317):
    (1) Facilities that are to be located in an officially designated 
wilderness area.
    (2) Facilities that are to be located in an officially designated 
wildlife preserve.
    (3) Facilities that: (i) May affect listed threatened or endangered 
species or designated critical habitats; or (ii) are likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of any proposed endangered or 
threatened species or likely to result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of proposed critical habitats, as determined by the 
Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 
1973.

    Note: The list of endangered and threatened species is contained in 
50 CFR 17.11, 17.22, 222.23(a) and 227.4. The list of designated 
critical habitats is contained in 50 CFR 17.95, 17.96 and part 226. To 
ascertain the status of proposed species and habitats, inquiries may be 
directed to the Regional Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
Department of the Interior.

    (4) Facilities that may affect districts, sites, buildings, 
structures or objects, significant in American history, architecture, 
archeology, engineering or culture, that are listed, or are eligible for 
listing, in the National Register of Historic Places. (See 16 U.S.C. 
470w(5); 36 CFR part 60 and 800.) To ascertain whether a proposed action 
may affect properties that are listed or eligible for listing in the 
National Register of Historic Places, an applicant shall follow the 
procedures set forth in the rules of the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation, 36 CFR part 800, as modified and supplemented by the 
Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless 
Antennas, Appendix B to Part 1 of this Chapter, and the Nationwide 
Programmatic Agreement Regarding the Section 106 National Historic 
Preservation Act Review Process, Appendix C to Part 1 of this Chapter.
    (5) Facilities that may affect Indian religious sites.
    (6) Facilities to be located in a flood Plain (See Executive Order 
11988.)

[[Page 297]]

    (7) Facilities whose construction will involve significant change in 
surface features (e.g., wetland fill, deforestation or water diversion). 
(In the case of wetlands on Federal property, see Executive Order 
11990.)
    (8) Antenna towers and/or supporting structures that are to be 
equipped with high intensity white lights which are to be located in 
residential neighborhoods, as defined by the applicable zoning law.
    (b) In addition to the actions listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, Commission actions granting construction permits, licenses to 
transmit or renewals thereof, equipment authorizations or modifications 
in existing facilities, require the preparation of an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) if the particular facility, operation or transmitter 
would cause human exposure to levels of radiofrequency radiation in 
excess of the limits in Sec. Sec. 1.1310 and 2.1093 of this chapter. 
Applications to the Commission for construction permits, licenses to 
transmit or renewals thereof, equipment authorizations or modifications 
in existing facilities must contain a statement confirming compliance 
with the limits unless the facility, operation, or transmitter is 
categorically excluded, as discussed below. Technical information 
showing the basis for this statement must be submitted to the Commission 
upon request. Such compliance statements may be omitted from license 
applications for transceivers subject to the certification requirement 
in Sec. 25.129 of this chapter.
    (1) The appropriate exposure limits in Sec. Sec. 1.1310 and 2.1093 
of this chapter are generally applicable to all facilities, operations 
and transmitters regulated by the Commission. However, a determination 
of compliance with the exposure limits in Sec. 1.1310 or Sec. 2.1093 
of this chapter (routine environmental evaluation), and preparation of 
an EA if the limits are exceeded, is necessary only for facilities, 
operations and transmitters that fall into the categories listed in 
table 1, or those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. All 
other facilities, operations and transmitters are categorically excluded 
from making such studies or preparing an EA, except as indicated in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For purposes of table 1, 
building-mounted antennas means antennas mounted in or on a building 
structure that is occupied as a workplace or residence. The term power 
in column 2 of table 1 refers to total operating power of the 
transmitting operation in question in terms of effective radiated power 
(ERP), equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), or peak envelope 
power (PEP), as defined in Sec. 2.1 of this chapter. For the case of 
the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, subpart H of part 22 of this 
chapter; the Personal Communications Service, part 24 of this chapter 
and the Specialized Mobile Radio Service, part 90 of this chapter, the 
phrase total power of all channels in column 2 of table 1 means the sum 
of the ERP or EIRP of all co-located simultaneously operating 
transmitters owned and operated by a single licensee. When applying the 
criteria of table 1, radiation in all directions should be considered. 
For the case of transmitting facilities using sectorized transmitting 
antennas, applicants and licensees should apply the criteria to all 
transmitting channels in a given sector, noting that for a highly 
directional antenna there is relatively little contribution to ERP or 
EIRP summation for other directions.

only), the Specialized Mobile Radio Service, and the 3650MHz Wireless 
Broadband Service authorized under Subpart H of parts 22, 24, 25, 27, 
80, and 90 of this chapter are subject to routine environmental 
evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment authorization or use, as 
specified in Sec. Sec. 2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter. Unlicensed 
PCS, unlicensed NII and millimeter wave devices are also subject to 
routine environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment 
authorization or use, as specified in Sec. Sec. 15.253(f), 15.255(g), 
15.319(i), and 15.407(f) of this chapter. Portable transmitting 
equipment for use in the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) is 
subject to routine environment evaluation as specified in Sec. Sec. 
2.1093 and 5.1125 of this chapter. Equipment authorized for use in the 
Medical Device Radiocommunication Service (MedRadio) as a medical 
implant or body-worn transmitter (as defined in Appendix 1 to Subpart E 
of part 95 of this chapter) is subject to routine environmental 
evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment authorization, as 
specified in Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter by finite difference time 
domain computational modeling or laboratory measurement techniques. 
Where a showing is based on computational modeling, the Commission 
retains the discretion to request that specific absorption rate 
measurement data be submitted. All other mobile, portable, and 
unlicensed transmitting devices are categorically excluded from routine 
environmental evaluation for RF exposure under Sec. Sec. 2.1091, 2.1093 
of this chapter except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this

    (3) In general, when the guidelines specified in Sec. 1.1310 are 
exceeded in an accessible area due to the emissions from multiple fixed 
transmitters, actions necessary to bring the area into compliance are 
the shared responsibility of all licensees whose transmitters produce, 
at the area in question, power density levels that exceed 5% of the 
power density exposure limit applicable to their particular transmitter 
or field strength levels that, when squared, exceed 5% of the square of 
the electric or magnetic field strength limit applicable to their 
particular transmitter. Owners of transmitter sites are expected to 
allow applicants and licensees to take reasonable steps to comply with 
the requirements contained in Sec. 1.1307(b) and, where feasible, 
should encourage co-location of transmitters and common solutions for 
controlling access to areas where the RF exposure limits contained in 
Sec. 1.1310 might be exceeded.
    (i) Applicants for proposed (not otherwise excluded) transmitters, 
facilities or modifications that would cause non-compliance with the 
limits specified in Sec. 1.1310 at an accessible area previously in 
compliance must submit an EA if emissions from the applicant's 
transmitter or facility would result, at the area in question, in a 
power density that exceeds 5% of the power density exposure limit 
applicable to that transmitter or facility or in a field strength that, 
when squared, exceeds 5% of the square of the electric or magnetic field 
strength limit applicable to that transmitter or facility.
    (ii) Renewal applicants whose (not otherwise excluded) transmitters 
or facilities contribute to the field strength or power density at an 
accessible area not in compliance with the limits specified in Sec. 
1.1310 must submit an EA if emissions from the applicant's transmitter 
or facility results, at the area in question, in a power density that 
exceeds 5% of the power density exposure

limit applicable to that transmitter or facility or in a field strength 
that, when squared, exceeds 5% of the square of the electric or magnetic 
field strength limit applicable to that transmitter of facility.
    (4) Transition Provisions. Applications filed with the Commission 
prior to October 15, 1997 (or January 1, 1998, for the Amateur Radio 
Service only), for construction permits, licenses to transmit or 
renewals thereof, modifications in existing facilities or other 
authorizations or renewals thereof require the preparation of an 
Environmental Assessment if the particular facility, operation or 
transmitter would cause human exposure to levels of radiofrequency 
radiation that are in excess of the requirements contained in paragraphs 
(b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(iii) of this section. In accordance with Sec. 
1.1312, if no new application or Commission action is required for a 
licensee to construct a new facility or physically modify an existing 
facility, e.g., geographic area licensees, and construction begins on or 
after October 15, 1997, the licensee will be required to prepare an 
Environmental Assessment if construction or modification of the facility 
would not comply with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. These transition provisions do not apply to applications for 
equipment authorization or use for mobile, portable and unlicensed 
devices as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) For facilities and operations licensed or authorized under parts

``uncontrolled'' environments, as defined by IEEE C95.1-1991, will apply 
to all PCS base and mobile stations, as appropriate.
    (iii) Applications for all other types of facilities and operations 
are categorically excluded from routine RF radiation evaluation except 
as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (5) Existing transmitting facilities, devices and operations: All 
existing transmitting facilities, operations and devices regulated by 
the Commission must be in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section by September 1, 2000, or, if not 
in compliance, file an Environmental Assessment as specified in Sec. 
1.1311.
    (c) If an interested person alleges that a particular action, 
otherwise categorically excluded, will have a significant environmental 
effect, the person shall submit to the Bureau responsible for processing 
that action a written petition setting forth in detail the reasons 
justifying or circumstances necessitating environmental consideration

[[Page 301]]

in the decision-making process. (See Sec. 1.1313). The Bureau shall 
review the petition and consider the environmental concerns that have 
been raised. If the Bureau determines that the action may have a 
significant environmental impact, the Bureau will require the applicant 
to prepare an EA (see Sec. Sec. 1.1308 and 1.1311), which will serve as 
the basis for the determination to proceed with or terminate 
environmental processing.
    (d) If the Bureau responsible for processing a particular action, 
otherwise categorically excluded, determines that the proposal may have 
a significant environmental impact, the Bureau, on its own motion, shall 
require the applicant to submit an EA. The Bureau will review and 
consider the EA as in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may 
regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal 
wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of 
radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with 
the regulations contained in this chapter concerning the environmental 
effects of such emissions. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (1) The term personal wireless service means commercial mobile 
services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless 
exchange access services;
    (2) The term personal wireless service facilities means facilities 
for the provision of personal wireless services;
    (3) The term unlicensed wireless services means the offering of 
telecommunications services using duly authorized devices which do not 
require individual licenses, but does not mean the provision of direct-
to-home satellite services; and
    (4) The term direct-to-home satellite services means the 
distribution or broadcasting of programming or services by satellite 
directly to the subscriber's premises without the use of ground 
receiving or distribution equipment, except at the subscriber's premises 
or in the uplink process to the satellite.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1308  Consideration of environmental assessments (EAs); findings of no significant impact.

    (a) Applicants shall prepare EAs for actions that may have a 
significant environmental impact (see Sec. 1.1307). An EA is described 
in detail in Sec. 1.1311 of this part of the Commission rules.
    (b) The EA is a document which shall explain the environmental 
consequences of the proposal and set forth sufficient analysis for the 
Bureau or the Commission to reach a determination that the proposal will 
or will not have a significant environmental effect. To assist in making 
that determination, the Bureau or the Commission may request further 
information from the applicant, interested persons, and agencies and 
authorities which have jurisdiction by law or which have relevant 
expertise.

    Note: With respect to actions specified under Sec. 1.1307 (a)(3) 
and (a)(4), the Commission shall solicit and consider the comments of 
the Department of Interior, and the State Historic Preservation Officer 
and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, respectively, in 
accordance with their established procedures. See Interagency 
Cooperation--Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 50 CFR part 
402; Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties, 36 CFR part 800. In 
addition, when an action interferes with or adversely affects an 
American Indian tribe's religious site, the Commission shall solicit the 
views of that American Indian tribe. See Sec. 1.1307(a)(5).

    (c) If the Bureau or the Commission determines, based on an 
independent review of the EA and any applicable mandatory consultation 
requirements imposed upon Federal agencies (see note above), that the 
proposal will have a significant environmental impact upon the quality 
of the human environment, it will so inform the applicant. The applicant 
will then have an opportunity to amend its application so as to reduce, 
minimize, or eliminate environmental problems. See Sec. 1.1309. If the 
environmental problem is not eliminated, the Bureau will publish in the 
Federal Register a Notice of Intent (see Sec. 1.1314) that EISs will be 
prepared (see Sec. Sec. 1.1315 and 1.1317), or

[[Page 302]]

    (d) If the Bureau or Commission determines, based on an independent 
review of the EA, and any mandatory consultation requirements imposed 
upon Federal agencies (see the note to paragraph (b) of this section), 
that the proposal would not have a significant impact, it will make a 
finding of no significant impact. Thereafter, the application will be 
processed without further documentation of environmental effect. 
Pursuant to CEQ regulations, see 40 CFR 1501.4 and 1501.6, the applicant 
must provide the community notice of the Commission's finding of no 
significant impact.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1309  Application amendments.

    Applicants are permitted to amend their applications to reduce, 
minimize or eliminate potential environmental problems. As a routine 
matter, an applicant will be permitted to amend its application within 
thirty (30) days after the Commission or the Bureau informs the 
applicant that the proposal will have a significant impact upon the 
quality of the human environment (see Sec. 1.1308(c)). The period of 
thirty (30) days may be extended upon a showing of good cause.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1310  Radiofrequency radiation exposure limits.

    The criteria listed in table 1 shall be used to evaluate the 
environmental impact of human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) radiation 
as specified in Sec. 1.1307(b), except in the case of portable devices 
which shall be evaluated according to the provisions of Sec. 2.1093 of 
this chapter. Further information on evaluating compliance with these 
limits can be found in the FCC's OST/OET Bulletin Number 65, 
``Evaluating Compliance with FCC-Specified Guidelines for Human Exposure 
to Radiofrequency Radiation.''

    Note to Introductory Paragraph: These limits are generally based on 
recommended exposure guidelines published by the National Council on 
Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in ``Biological Effects and 
Exposure Criteria for Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields,'' NCRP 
Report No. 86, Sections 17.4.1, 17.4.1.1, 17.4.2 and 17.4.3. Copyright 
NCRP, 1986, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. In the frequency range from 100 
MHz to 1500 MHz, exposure limits for field strength and power density 
are also generally based on guidelines recommended by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) in Section 4.1 of ``IEEE Standard 
for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency 
Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz,'' ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992,

<R05>
Sec. 1.1311  Environmental information to be included in the environmental assessment (EA).

    (a) The applicant shall submit an EA with each application that is 
subject to environmental processing (see Sec. 1.1307). The EA shall 
contain the following information:
    (1) For antenna towers and satellite earth stations, a description 
of the facilities as well as supporting structures and appurtenances, 
and a description of the site as well as the surrounding area and uses. 
If high intensity white lighting is proposed or utilized within a 
residential area, the EA must also address the impact of this lighting 
upon the residents.
    (2) A statement as to the zoning classification of the site, and 
communications with, or proceedings before and determinations (if any) 
made by zoning, planning, environmental or other local, state or Federal 
authorities on matters relating to environmental effect.
    (3) A statement as to whether construction of the facilities has 
been a source of controversy on environmental grounds in the local 
community.
    (4) A discussion of environmental and other considerations which led 
to the selection of the particular site and, if relevant, the particular 
facility; the nature and extent of any unavoidable adverse environmental 
effects, and any alternative sites or facilities which have been or 
might reasonably be considered.
    (5) Any other information that may be requested by the Bureau or 
Commission.
    (6) If endangered or threatened species or their critical habitats 
may be affected, the applicant's analysis must utilize the best 
scientific and commercial data available, see 50 CFR 402.14(c).
    (b) The information submitted in the EA shall be factual (not 
argumentative or conclusory) and concise with sufficient detail to 
explain the environmental consequences and to enable the Commission or 
Bureau, after an independent review of the EA, to reach a determination 
concerning the proposal's environmental impact, if any. The EA shall 
deal specifically with any feature of the site which has special 
environmental significance (e.g., wilderness areas, wildlife preserves, 
natural migration paths for birds and other wildlife, and sites of 
historic, architectural, or archeological value). In the case of 
historically significant sites, it shall specify the effect of the 
facilities on any district, site, building, structure or object listed, 
or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places. It 
shall also detail any substantial change in the character of the land 
utilized (e.g., deforestation, water diversion, wetland fill, or other 
extensive change of surface features). In the case of wilderness areas, 
wildlife preserves, or other like areas, the statement shall discuss the 
effect of any continuing pattern of human intrusion into the area (e.g., 
necessitated by the operation and maintenance of the facilities).
    (c) The EA shall also be accompanied with evidence of site approval 
which has been obtained from local or Federal land use authorities.
    (d) To the extent that such information is submitted in another part 
of the application, it need not be duplicated in the EA, but adequate 
cross-reference to such information shall be supplied.
    (e) An EA need not be submitted to the Commission if another agency 
of the Federal Government has assumed responsibility for determining 
whether of the facilities in question will have a significant effect on 
the quality of the human environment and, if it will, for invoking the 
environmental impact statement process.

Sec. 1.1314  Environmental impact statements (EISs).

    (a) Draft Environmental Impact Statements (DEISs) (Sec. 1.1315) and 
Final Environmental Impact Statements (FEISs) (referred to collectively 
as EISs) (Sec. 1.1317) shall be prepared by the Bureau responsible for 
processing the proposal when the Commission's or the Bureau's analysis 
of the EA (Sec. 1.1308) indicates that the proposal will have a 
significant effect upon the environment and the matter has not been 
resolved by an amendment.
    (b) As soon as practically feasible, the Bureau will publish in the 
Federal Register a Notice of Intent to prepare EISs. The Notice shall 
briefly identify the proposal, concisely describe the environmental 
issues and concerns presented by the subject application, and generally 
invite participation from affected or involved agencies, authorities and 
other interested persons.
    (c) The EISs shall not address non-environmental considerations. To 
safeguard against repetitive and unnecessarily lengthy documents, the 
Statements, where feasible, shall incorporate by reference material set 
forth in previous documents, with only a brief summary of its content. 
In preparing the EISs, the Bureau will identify and address the 
significant environmental issues and eliminate the insignificant issues 
from analysis.
    (d) To assist in the preparation of the EISs, the Bureau may request 
further information from the applicant, interested persons and agencies 
and authorities, which have jurisdiction by law or which have relevant 
expertise. The Bureau may direct that technical studies be made by the 
applicant and that the applicant obtain expert opinion concerning the 
potential environmental problems and costs associated with the proposed 
action, as well as comparative analyses of alternatives. The Bureau may 
also consult experts in an effort to identify measures that could be 
taken to minimize the adverse effects and alternatives to the proposed 
facilities that are not, or are less, objectionable. The Bureau may also 
direct that objections be raised with appropriate local, state or 
Federal land use agencies or authorities (if their views have not been 
previously sought).

and, thus, preparing the EISs shall draft

[[Page 305]]

supplements to Statements where significant new circumstances occur or 
information arises relevant to environmental concerns and bearing upon 
the application.
    (f) The Application, the EA, the DEIS, and the FEIS and all related 
documents, including the comments filed by the public and any agency, 
shall be part of the administrative record and will be routinely 
available for public inspection.
    (g) If EISs are to be prepared, the applicant must provide the 
community with notice of the availability of environmental documents and 
the scheduling of any Commission hearings in that action.
    (h) The timing of agency action with respect to applications subject 
to EISs is set forth in 40 CFR 1506.10. No decision shall be made until 
ninety (90) days after the Notice of Availability of the Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement is published in the Federal Register, and 
thirty (30) days after the Notice of Availability of the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement is published in the Federal Register, 
which time period may run concurrently, See 40 CFR 1506.10(c); see also

shall utilize the FEIS in considering the environmental issues, together 
with all other non-environmental issues. In a comparative context, the 
respective parties shall be afforded the opportunity to comment on the 
FEIS, and the Administrative Law Judge's decision shall contain an 
evaluation of the respective applications based on environmental and 
non-environmental public interest factors.
    (2) Upon review of an initial decision, the Commission will consider 
and assess all aspects of the FEIS and will render its decision, giving 
due consideration to the environmental and nonenvironmental issues.
    (b) In all non-hearing matters, the Commission, as part of its 
decision-making process, will review the FEIS, along with other relevant 
issues, to ensure that the environmental effects are specifically 
assessed and given comprehensive consideration.

Sec. 1.1403  Duty to provide access; modifications; notice of removal, 

increase or modification; petition for temporary stay; and cable operator notice.

    (a) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any 
telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, 
duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it. 
Notwithstanding this obligation, a utility may deny a cable television 
system or any telecommunications carrier access to its poles, ducts, 
conduits, or rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory basis where there is 
insufficient capacity or for reasons of safety, reliability and 
generally applicable engineering purposes.
    (b) Requests for access to a utility's poles, ducts, conduits or 
rights-of-way by a telecommunications carrier or cable operator must be 
in writing. If access is not granted within 45 days of the request for 
access, the utility must confirm the denial in writing by the 45th day. 
The utility's denial of access shall be specific, shall include all 
relevant evidence and information supporting its denial, and shall 
explain how such evidence and information relate to a denial of access 
for reasons of lack of capacity, safety, reliability or engineering 
standards.
    (c) A utility shall provide a cable television system operator or 
telecommunications carrier no less than 60 days written notice prior to:
    (1) Removal of facilities or termination of any service to those 
facilities, such removal or termination arising out of a rate, term or 
condition of the cable television system operator's of 
telecommunications carrier's pole attachment agreement;
    (2) Any increase in pole attachment rates; or
    (3) Any modification of facilities other than routine maintenance or

Sec. 1.1404  Complaint.

    (a) The complaint shall contain the name and address of the 
complainant, name and address of the respondent, and shall contain a 
verification (in the form in Sec. 1.721(b)), signed by the complainant 
or officer thereof if complainant is a corporation, showing 
complainant's direct interest in the matter complained of. Counsel for 
the complainant may sign the complaint. Complainants may join together 
to file a joint complaint. Complaints filed by associations shall 
specifically identify each utility, cable television system operator, or 
telecommunications carrier who is a party to the complaint and shall be 
accompanied by a document from each identified member certifying that 
the complaint is being filed on its behalf.
    (b) The complaint shall be accompanied by a certification of service 
on the named respondent, and each of the Federal, State, and local 
governmental agencies that regulate any aspect of the services provided 
by the complainant or respondent.
    (c) In a case where it is claimed that a rate, term, or condition is 
unjust or unreasonable, the complaint shall contain a statement that the 
State has not certified to the Commission that it regulates the rates, 
terms and conditions for pole attachments. The complaint shall include a 
statement that the utility is not owned by any railroad, any person who 
is cooperatively organized or any person owned by the Federal Government 
or any State.
    (d) The complaint shall be accompanied by a copy of the pole 
attachment agreement, if any, between the cable system operator or 
telecommunications carrier and the utility. If there is no present pole 
attachment agreement, the complaint shall contain:
    (1) A statement that the utility uses or controls poles, ducts, or 
conduits used or designated, in whole or in part, for wire 
communication; and
    (2) A statement that the cable television system operator or 
telecommunications carrier currently has attachments on the poles, 
ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way.
    (e) The complaint shall state with specificity the pole attachment 
rate, term or condition which is claimed to be unjust or unreasonable.
    (f) In any case, where it is claimed that a term or condition is 
unjust or unreasonable, the claim shall specify all information and 
argument relied upon to justify said claim.
    (g) For attachments to poles, where it is claimed that either a rate 
is unjust or unreasonable, or a term or condition is unjust or 
unreasonable and examination of such term or condition requires review 
of the associated rate, the complaint shall provide data and information 
in support of said claim.
    (1) The data and information shall include, where applicable:
    (i) The gross investment by the utility for pole lines;
    (ii) The investment in crossarms and other items which do not 
reflect the cost of owning and maintaining poles, if available;
    (iii) The depreciation reserve from the gross pole line investment;
    (iv) The depreciation reserve from the investment in crossarms and 
other items which do not reflect the cost of owning and maintaining 
poles, if available;
    (v) The total number of poles:

[[Page 309]]

    (A) Owned; and
    (B) Controlled or used by the utility. If any of these poles are 
jointly owned, the complaint shall specify the number of such jointly 
owned poles and the percentage of each joint pole or the number of 
equivalent poles owned by the subject utility;
    (vi) The total number of poles which are the subject of the 
complaint;
    (vii) The number of poles included in paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of this 
section that are controlled or used by the utility through lease between 
the utility and other owner(s), and the annual amounts paid by the 
utility for such rental;
    (viii) The number of poles included in paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of this 
section that are owned by the utility and that are leased to other users 
by the utility, and the annual amounts paid to the utility for such 
rental;
    (ix) The annual carrying charges attributable to the cost of owning 
a pole. These charges may be expressed as a percentage of the net pole 
investment. With its pleading, the utility shall file a copy of the 
latest decision of the state regulatory body or state court which 
determines the treatment of accumulated deferred taxes if it is at issue 
in the proceeding and shall note the section which specifically 
determines the treatment and amount of accumulated deferred taxes.
    (x) The rate of return authorized for the utility for intrastate 
service. With its pleading, the utility shall file a copy of the latest 
decision of the state regulatory body or state court which establishes 
this authorized rate of return if the rate of return is at issue in the 
proceeding and shall note the section which specifically establishes 
this authorized rate and whether the decision is subject to further 
proceedings before the state regulatory body or a court. In the absence 
of a state authorized rate of return, the rate of return set by the 
Commission for local exchange carriers shall be used as a default rate 
of return;
    (xi) The average amount of usable space per pole for those poles 
used for pole attachments (13.5 feet may be in lieu of actual 
measurement, but may be rebutted);
    (xii) The average amount of unusable space per pole for those poles 
used for pole attachments (a 24 foot presumption may be used in lieu of 
actual measurement, but the presumption may be rebutted); and
    (xiii) Reimbursements received from CATV operators and 
telecommunications carriers for non-recurring costs.
    (2) Data and information should be based upon historical or original 
cost methodology, insofar as possible. Data should be derived from 
ARMIS, FERC 1, or other reports filed with state or federal regulatory 
agencies (identify source). Calculations made in connection with these 
figures should be provided to the complainant. The complainant shall 
also specify any other information and argument relied upon to attempt 
to establish that a rate, term, or condition is not just and reasonable.
    (h) With respect to attachments within a duct or conduit system, 
where it is claimed that either a rate is unjust or unreasonable, or a 
term or condition is unjust or unreasonable and examination of such term 
or condition requires review of the associated rate, the complaint shall 
provide data and information in support of said claim.
    (1) The data and information shall include, where applicable:
    (i) The gross investment by the utility for conduit;
    (ii) The accumulated depreciation from the gross conduit investment;
    (iii) The system duct length or system conduit length and the method 
used to determine it;
    (iv) The length of the conduit subject to the complaint;
    (v) The number of ducts in the conduit subject to the complaint;
    (vi) The number of inner-ducts in the duct occupied, if any. If 
there are no inner-ducts, the attachment is presumed to occupy one-half 
duct.
    (vii) The annual carrying charges attributable to the cost of owning 
conduit. These charges may be expressed as a percentage of the net 
linear cost of a conduit. With its pleading, the utility shall file a 
copy of the latest decision of the state regulatory body or state court 
which determines the treatment of accumulated deferred taxes if it is at

[[Page 310]]

issue in the proceeding and shall note the section which specifically 
determines the treatment and amount of accumulated deferred taxes.
    (viii) The rate of return authorized for the utility for intrastate 
service. With its pleading, the utility shall file a copy of the latest 
decision of the state regulatory body or state court which establishes 
this authorized rate of return if the rate of return is at issue in the 
proceeding and shall note the section which specifically establishes 
this authorized rate and whether the decision is subject to further 
proceedings before the state regulatory body or a court. In the absence 
of a state authorized rate of return, the rate of return set by the 
Commission for local exchange carriers shall be used as a default rate 
of return; and
    (ix) Reimbursements received by utilities from CATV operators and 
telecommunications carriers for non-recurring costs.
    (2) Data and information should be based upon historical or original 
cost methodology, insofar as possible. Data should be derived from 
ARMIS, FERC 1, or other reports filed with state or federal regulatory 
agencies (identify source). Calculations made in connection with these 
figures should be provided to the complainant. The complainant shall 
also specify any other information and argument relied upon to attempt 
to establish that a rate, term, or condition is not just and reasonable.
    (i) With respect to rights-of-way, where it is claimed that either a 
rate is unjust or unreasonable, or a term or condition is unjust or 
unreasonable and examination of such term or condition requires review 
of the associated rate, the complaint shall provide data and information 
in support of said claim. The data and information shall include, where 
applicable, equivalent information as specified in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (j) If any of the information and data required in paragraphs (g), 
(h) and (i) of this section is not provided to the cable television 
operator or telecommunications carrier by the utility upon reasonable 
request, the cable television operator or telecommunications carrier 
shall include a statement indicating the steps taken to obtain the 
information from the utility, including the dates of all requests. No 
complaint filed by a cable television operator or telecommunications 
carrier shall be dismissed where the utility has failed to provide the 
information required under paragraphs (g), (h) or (i) of this section, 
as applicable, after such reasonable request. A utility must supply a 
cable television operator or telecommunications carrier the information 
required in paragraph (g), (h) or (i) of this section, as applicable, 
along with the supporting pages from its ARMIS, FERC Form 1, or other 
report to a regulatory body, within 30 days of the request by the cable 
television operator or telecommunications carrier. The cable television 
operator or telecommunications carrier, in turn, shall submit these 
pages with its complaint. If the utility did not supply these pages to 
the cable television operator or telecommunications carrier in response 
to the information request, the utility shall supply this information in 
its response to the complaint.
    (k) The complaint shall include a brief summary of all steps taken 
to resolve the problem prior to filing. If no such steps were taken, the 
complaint shall state the reason(s) why it believed such steps were 
fruitless.
    (l) Factual allegations shall be supported by affidavit of a person 
or persons with actual knowledge of the facts, and exhibits shall be 
verified by the person who prepares them.
    (m) In a case where a cable television system operator or 
telecommunications carrier claims that it has been denied access to a 
pole, duct, conduit or right-of-way despite a request made pursuant to 
section 47 U.S.C. Sec. 224(f), the complaint shall be filed within 30 
days of such denial. In addition to meeting the other requirements of 
this section, the complaint shall include the data and information 
necessary to support the claim, including:
    (1) The reasons given for the denial of access to the utility's 
poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way;
    (2) The basis for the complainant's claim that the denial of access 
is improper;
    (3) The remedy sought by the complainant;

[[Page 311]]

    (4) A copy of the written request to the utility for access to its 
poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-way; and
    (5) A copy of the utility's response to the written request 
including all information given by the utility to support its denial of 
access. A complaint alleging improper denial of access will not be 
dismissed if the complainant is unable to obtain a utility's written 
response, or if the utility denies the complainant any other information 
needed to establish a prima facie case.

Sec. 1.1408  Number of copies and form of pleadings.

    (a) An original and three copies of the complaint, response, and 
reply shall be filed with the Commission.

conformity with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.49, 1.50 and 1.52.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1409  Commission consideration of the complaint.

    (a) In its consideration of the complaint, response, and reply, the 
Commission may take notice of any information contained in publicly 
available filings made by the parties and may accept, subject to 
rebuttal, studies that have been conducted. The Commission may also 
request that one or more of the parties make additional filings or 
provide additional information. Where one of the parties has failed to 
provide information required to be provided by these rules or requested 
by the Commission, or where costs, values or amounts are disputed, the 
Commission may estimate such costs, values or amounts it considers 
reasonable, or may decide adversely to a party who has failed to supply 
requested information which is readily available to it, or both.
    (b) The complainant shall have the burden of establishing a prima 
facie case that the rate, term, or condition is not just and reasonable 
or that the denial of access violates 47 U.S.C. Sec. 224(f). If, 
however, a utility argues that the proposed rate is lower than its 
incremental costs, the utility has the burden of establishing that such 
rate is below the statutory minimum just and reasonable rate. In a case 
involving a denial of access, the utility shall have the burden of 
proving that the denial was lawful, once a prima facie case is 
established by the complainant.
    (c) The Commission shall determine whether the rate, term or 
condition complained of is just and reasonable. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, a rate is just and reasonable if it assures a utility the 
recovery of not less than the additional costs of providing pole 
attachments, nor more than an amount determined by multiplying the 
percentage of the total usable space, or the percentage of the total 
duct or conduit capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by 
the sum of the operating expenses and actual capital costs of the 
utility attributable to the entire pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.
    (d) The Commission shall deny the complaint if it determines that 
the complainant has not established a prima facie case, or that the 
rate, term or condition is just and reasonable, or that the denial of 
access was lawful.
    (e) When parties fail to resolve a dispute regarding charges for 
pole attachments and the Commission's complaint procedures under Section 
1.1404 are invoked, the Commission will apply the following formulas for 
determining a maximum just and reasonable rate:
    (1) The following formula shall apply to attachments to poles by 
cable operators providing cable services. This formula shall also apply 
to attachments to poles by any telecommunications carrier (to the extent 
such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment agreement) or cable 
operator providing telecommunications services until February 8, 2001:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.011


[[Page 313]]


[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.012

    (2) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section the following formula 
shall apply to attachments to poles by any telecommunications carrier 
(to the extent such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment 
agreement) or cable operator providing telecommunications services 
beginning February 8, 2001:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.013

    (3) The following formula shall apply to attachments to conduit by 
cable operators and telecommunications carriers:

    simplified as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.015
    
    If no inner-duct is installed the fraction, ``1 Duct divided by the 
No. of Inner-Ducts'' is presumed to be \1/2\.
    (f) Paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall become effective February 
8, 2001 (i.e., five years after the effective date of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996). Any increase in the rates for pole 
attachments that results from the adoption of such regulations shall be 
phased in over a period of five years beginning on the effective date of 
such regulations in equal annual increments. The five-year phase-in is 
to apply to rate increases only. Rate reductions are to be implemented 
immediately. The determination of any rate

[[Page 314]]

increase shall be based on data currently available at the time of the 
calculation of the rate increase.

Sec. 1.1410  Remedies.

    If the Commission determines that the rate, term, or condition 
complained of is not just and reasonable, it may prescribe a just and 
reasonable rate, term, or condition and may:
    (a) Terminate the unjust and unreasonable rate, term, or condition;
    (b) Substitute in the pole attachment agreement the just and 
reasonable rate, term, or condition established by the Commission; and
    (c) Order a refund, or payment, if appropriate. The refund or 
payment will normally be the difference between the amount paid under 
the unjust and/or unreasonable rate, term, or condition and the amount 
that would have been paid under the rate, term, or condition established 
by the Commission from the date that the complaint, as acceptable, was 
filed, plus interest.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1411  Meetings and hearings.

    The Commission may decide each complaint upon the filings and 
information before it, may require one or more informal meetings with 
the parties to clarify the issues or to consider settlement of the 
dispute, or may, in its discretion, order evidentiary procedures upon 
any issues it finds to have been raised by the filings.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1412  Enforcement.

    If the respondent fails to obey any order imposed under this 
subpart, the Commission on its own motion or by motion of the 
complainant may order the respondent to show cause why it should not 
cease and desist from violating the Commission's order.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1413  Forfeiture.

    (a) If any person willfully fails to obey any order imposed under 
this subpart, or any Commission rule, or
    (b) If any person shall in any written response to Commission 
correspondence or inquiry or in any application, pleading, report, or 
any other written statement submitted to the Commission pursuant to this 
subpart make any misrepresentation bearing on any matter within the 
jurisdiction of the Commission, the Commission may, in addition to any 
other remedies, including criminal penalties under section 1001 of Title 
18 of the United States Code, impose a forfeiture pursuant to section 
503(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 503(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1414  State certification.

    (a) If the Commission does not receive certification from a state 
that:
    (1) It regulates rates, terms and conditions for pole attachments;
    (2) In so regulating such rates, terms and conditions, the state has 
the authority to consider and does consider the interests of the 
subscribers of cable television services as well as the interests of the 
consumers of the utility services; and,
    (3) It has issued and made effective rules and regulations 
implementing the state's regulatory authority over pole attachments 
(including a specific methodology for such regulation which has been 
made publicly available in the state), it will be rebuttably presumed 
that the state is not regulating pole attachments.
    (b) Upon receipt of such certification, the Commission shall give 
public notice. In addition, the Commission shall compile and publish 
from time to time, a listing of states which have provided 
certification.
    (c) Upon receipt of such certification, the Commission shall forward 
any pending case thereby affected to the state regulatory authority, 
shall so notify the parties involved and shall give public notice 
thereof.
    (d) Certification shall be by order of the state regulatory body or 
by a person having lawful delegated authority under provisions of state 
law to submit such certification. Said person shall provide in writing a 
statement that he or she has such authority and shall cite the law, 
regulation or other instrument conferring such authority.

[[Page 315]]

    (e) Notwithstanding any such certification, jurisdiction will revert 
to this Commission with respect to any individual matter, unless the 
state takes final action on a complaint regarding such matter:
    (1) Within 180 days after the complaint is filed with the state, or
    (2) Within the applicable periods prescribed for such final action 
in such rules and regulations of the state, if the prescribed period 
does not extend beyond 360 days after the filing of such complaint.

Sec. 1.1415  Other orders.

    The Commission may issue such other orders and so conduct its 
proceedings as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and 
the ends of justice.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1416  Imputation of rates; modification costs.

    (a) A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications 
services or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing such 
services (and charge any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate company 
engaged in the provision of such services) an equal amount to the pole 
attachment rate for which such company would be liable under this 
section.
    (b) The costs of modifying a facility shall be borne by all parties 
that obtain access to the facility as a result of the modification and 
by all parties that directly benefit from the modification. Each party 
described in the preceding sentence shall share proportionately in the 
cost of the modification. A party with a preexisting attachment to the 
modified facility shall be deemed to directly benefit from a 
modification if, after receiving notification of such modification as 
provided in subpart J of this part, it adds to or modifies its 
attachment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party with a preexisting 
attachment to a pole, conduit, duct or right-of-way shall not be 
required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its 
attachment if such rearrangement or replacement is necessitated solely 
as a result of an additional attachment or the modification of an 
existing attachment sought by another party. If a party makes an 
attachment to the facility after the completion of the modification, 
such party shall share proportionately in the cost of the modification 
if such modification rendered possible the added attachment.

Sec. 1.1417  Allocation of Unusable Space Costs.

    (a) With respect to the formula referenced in Sec. 1.1409(e)(2), a 
utility shall apportion the cost of providing unusable space on a pole 
so that such apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing 
unusable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal 
apportionment of such costs among all attaching entities.
    (b) All attaching entities attached to the pole shall be counted for 
purposes of apportioning the cost of unusable space.
    (c) Utilities may use the following rebuttable presumptive averages 
when calculating the number of attaching entities with respect to the 
formula referenced in Sec. 1.1409(e)(2). For non-urbanized service 
areas (under 50,000 population), a presumptive average number of 
attaching entities of three (3). For urbanized service areas (50,000 or 
higher population), a presumptive average number of attaching entities 
of five (5). If any part of the utility's service area within the state 
has a designation of urbanized (50,000 or higher population) by the 
Bureau of Census, United States Department of Commerce, then all of that 
service area shall be designated as urbanized for purposes of 
determining the presumptive average number of attaching entities.
    (d) A utility may establish its own presumptive average number of 
attaching entities for its urbanized and non-urbanized service area as 
follows:
    (1) Each utility shall, upon request, provide all attaching entities 
and all entities seeking access the methodology and information upon 
which the utilities presumptive average number of attachers is based.

[[Page 316]]

    (2) Each utility is required to exercise good faith in establishing 
and updating its presumptive average number of attachers.
    (3) The presumptive average number of attachers may be challenged by 
an attaching entity by submitting information demonstrating why the 
utility's presumptive average is incorrect. The attaching entity should 
also submit what it believes should be the presumptive average and the 
methodology used. Where a complete inspection is impractical, a 
statistically sound survey may be submitted.
    (4) Upon successful challenge of the existing presumptive average 
number of attachers, the resulting data determined shall be used by the 
utility as the presumptive number of attachers within the rate formula.

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 12026, Mar. 12, 1998, Sec. 1.1417 was 
added. The section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given

Sec. 1.1418  Use of presumptions in calculating the space factor.

    With respect to the formulas referenced in Sec. 1.1409(e)(1) and 
Sec. 1.1409(e)(2), the space occupied by an attachment is presumed to 
be one (1) foot. The amount of usable space is presumed to be 13.5 feet. 
The amount of unusable space is presumed to be 24 feet. The pole height 
is presumed to be 37.5 feet. These presumptions may be rebutted by 
either party.

 Subpart K_Implementation of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) in 
                           Agency Proceedings

    Authority: Sec. 203(a)(1), Pub. L. 96-481, 94 Stat. 2325 (5 U.S.C. 
504(c)(1)).

    Source: 47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, unless otherwise noted.

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1.1501  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the EAJA in 
this subpart), provides for the award of attorney's fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the 
Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over 
the Commission, unless the Commission's position in the proceeding was 
substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust, 
or when the demand of the Commission is substantially in excess of the 
decision in the adversary adjudication and is unreasonable when compared 
with such decision, under the facts and circumstances of the case, 
unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise 
acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. The 
rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the 
proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, 
and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make 
them.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39898, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502  When the EAJA applies.

    The EAJA applies to any adversary adjudication pending or commenced 
before the Commission on or after August 5, 1985. The provisions of 
Sec. 1.1505(b) apply to any adversary adjudications commenced on or 
after March 29, 1996.

[61 FR 39898, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1503  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The EAJA applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the 
position of the Commission or any other agency of the United States, or 
any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other 
representative who enters an appearance and participates in the 
proceeding. Any proceeding in which this Agency may fix a lawful present 
or future rate is not covered by the EAJA. Proceedings to grant or renew 
licenses

[[Page 317]]

are also excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke 
licenses are covered if they are otherwise ``adversary adjudications''.
    (b) The Commission may designate a proceeding as an adversary 
adjudication for purposes of the EAJA by so stating in an order 
initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The 
Commission's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary 
adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party 
who believes the proceeding is covered by the EAJA; whether the 
proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in 
proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the EAJA and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any awards made will 
include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 11653, Apr. 10, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1504  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the EAJA, the applicant must be a party, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 
551(3), to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The 
applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out 
in this paragraph and in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable association as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 
employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees;
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million 
and not more than 500 employees;
    (6) For purposes of Sec. 1.1505(b), a small entity as defined in 5 
U.S.C. 601.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The number of employees of an applicant include all persons who 
regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the Administrative Law Judge determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the EAJA in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
Administrative Law Judge may determine that financial relationships of 
the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 11653, Apr. 10, 1987; 61 
FR 39898, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1505  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing party may receive an award for fees and expenses 
incurred in connection either with an adversary adjudication, or with a 
significant and discrete substantive portion of an adversary 
adjudication in which the

[[Page 318]]

party has prevailed over the position of the Commission.
    (1) The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the 
position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the 
action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary 
adjudication is based.
    (2) An award will be reduced or denied if the Commission's position 
was substantially justified in law and fact, if special circumstances 
make an award unjust, or if the prevailing party unduly or unreasonably 
protracted the adversary adjudication.
    (b) If, in an adversary adjudication arising from a Commission 
action to enforce a party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory 
requirement, the demand of the Commission is substantially in excess of 
the decision in the adversary adjudication and is unreasonable when 
compared with that decision, under the facts and circumstances of the 
case, the party shall be awarded the fees and other expenses related to 
defending against the excessive demand, unless the party has committed a 
willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special 
circumstances make an award unjust. The ``demand'' of the Commission 
means the express demand which led to the adversary adjudication, but it 
does not include a recitation by the Commission of the maximum statutory 
penalty in the administrative complaint, or elsewhere when accompanied 
by an express demand for a lesser amount.
    (c) The burden of proof that an award should not be made is on the 
appropriate Bureau (see Sec. 1.21) whose representative shall be called 
``Bureau counsel'' in this subpart K.

[61 FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1506  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00, or for adversary adjudications commenced on or after 
March 29, 1996, $125.00, per hour. No award to compensate an expert 
witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert 
witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of 
the attorney; agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, 
agent or witness ordinarily charges its clients separately for such 
expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the Administrative Law Judge shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the service 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
    (e) Fees may be awarded only for work performed after designation of 
a proceeding or after issuance of a show cause order.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1507  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special 
circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to 
handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt 
regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher 
than $125.00 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered 
by this part. The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for 
this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.

[[Page 319]]

    (b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for 
rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees, in accordance 
with subpart C of this chapter. The petition should identify the rate 
the petitioner believes this agency should establish and the types of 
proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain 
fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. This agency will 
respond to the petition by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying 
the petition, or taking other appropriate action.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1508  Awards against other agencies.

    If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over 
another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding 
before the Commission and takes a position that is not substantially 
justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be 
made against that agency. Counsel for that agency shall be treated as 
Bureau counsel for the purpose of this subpart.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39899, July 31, 1996]

                  Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 1.1511  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under EAJA 
shall dentify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall 
state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the 
type and purpose of its organization or business. The application shall 
also:
    (1) Show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position 
of an agency or agencies in the proceeding that the applicant alleges 
was not substantially justified; or
    (2) Show that the demand by the agency or agencies in the proceeding 
was substantially in excess of, and was unreasonable when compared with, 
the decision in the proceeding.
    (b) The application shall also include a declaration that the 
applicant is a small entity as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601 or a statement 
that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an 
individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their 
affiliates). However, an applicant may omit the statement concerning its 
net worth if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and 
in what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1512  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 1.1504(f) of this part) at the time the proceeding was 
designated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under

[[Page 320]]

the standards in this subpart. The Administrative Law Judge may require 
an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility 
for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the Administrative Law Judge in 
a sealed enevelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information'', 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosue of the 
information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is 
not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be 
served on Bureau counsel, but need not be served on any other party to 
the proceeding. If the Administrative Law Judge finds that the 
information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed 
in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to 
inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information 
Act, Sec. Sec. 0.441 through 0.466 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1513  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing hours spent in connection with the proceeding by 
each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the 
rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The Administrative Law Judge may require the 
applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any 
expenses claimed.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1514  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, or when the demand of the Commission is substantially 
in excess of the decision in the proceeding, but in no case later than 
30 days after the Commission's final disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.
    (c) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later of
    (1) The date on which an initial decision or other recommended 
disposition of the merits of the proceeding by an Administrative Law 
Judge becomes administratively final;
    (2) Issuance of an order disposing of any petitions for 
reconsideration of the Commission's order in the proceeding;
    (3) If no petition for reconsideration is filed, the last date on 
which such petition could have been filed;
    (4) Issuance of a final order by the Commission or any other final 
resolution of a proceeding, such as settlement or voluntary dismissal, 
which is not subject to a petition for reconsideration, or to a petition 
for judicial review; or

                 Procedures for Considering Applications


<R05>
Sec. 1.1521  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading relating to an 
application shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding 
in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, except as 
provided in Sec. 1.1512(b) for confidential financial information.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1522  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application Bureau counsel 
may file an answer to the application. Unless Bureau counsel requests an 
extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate 
under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within 
the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award request.
    (b) If Bureau counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted by the Administrative Law Judge 
upon request by Bureau counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of Bureau 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, Bureau counsel shall include 
with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 1.1526.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1523  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 1.1526.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1524  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and Bureau 
counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is 
served or an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not participate further in proceedings on the application 
unless the Administrative Law Judge determines that the public interest 
requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of 
matters raised in the comments.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1525  Settlement.

    The applicant and Bureau counsel may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the 
underlying proceeding has been concluded. If a prevailing party and 
Bureau counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an 
application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the 
proposed settlement. If the Administrative Law Judge approves the 
proposed settlement, it shall be forwarded to the Commission for final 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1526  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or Bureau counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the Administrative 
Law Judge may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, 
oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to issues other 
than excessive demand or substantial justification, an evidentiary 
hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for 
full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and 
shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position 
of the agency embodied an excessive demand or was substantially 
justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, 
as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees 
and other expenses are sought.
    (b) A request that the Administrative Law Judge order further 
proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the 
information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why

[[Page 322]]

the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 11653, Apr. 10, 1987; 61 
FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1527  Decision.

    The Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial decision on the 
application as soon as possible after completion of proceedings on the 
application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions 
regarding the applicant's eligibility and whether the applicant was a 
prevailing party or whether the demand by the agency or agencies in the 
proceeding was substantially in excess of, and was unreasonable when 
compared with, the decision in the adversary adjudication, and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at 
issue, findings on whether the Commission's position substantially 
justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, 
committed a willful violation of law, or otherwise acted in bad faith, 
or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant 
has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall 
allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the 
agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.

[61 FR 39900, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1528  Commission review.

    Either the applicant or Bureau counsel may seek Commission review of 
the initial decision on the application, or the Commission may decide to 
review the decision on its own initiative, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
1.276 through 1.282 of this chapter. Except as provided in Sec. 1.1525, 
if neither the applicant nor Bureau counsel seeks review and the 
Commission does not take review on its own initiative, the initial 
decision on the application shall become a final decision of the 
Commission 50 days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a 
matter within the discretion of the Commission. If review is taken, the 
Commission will issue a final decision on the application or remand the 
application to the Administrative Law Judge for further proceedings.

[47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 39900, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1529  Judicial review.

    Judicial review of final agency decisions on awards may be sought as 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1530  Payment of award.

    An applicant seeking payment of an award from the Commission shall 
submit to the General Counsel a copy of the Commission's final decision 
granting the award, accompanied by a statement that the applicant will 
not seek review of the decision in the United States courts, or a copy 
of the court's order directing payment. The Commission will pay the 
amount awarded to the applicant unless judicial review of the award or 
the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by 
the applicant or any other party to the proceeding.

filings using FCC Forms 320, 321, 322, 324, 325, and 327 and their 
respective associated schedules must be filed electronically in 
accordance with the electronic filing instructions provided by COALS.
    (1) There will be two ways for parties to electronically file 
applications with the Commission: batch and interactive.
    (i) Batch filing. Batch filing involves data transmission in a 
single action. Batch filers will follow a set Commission format for 
entering data. Batch filers will then send, via file transfer protocol, 
batches of data to the Commission for compiling. COALS will compile such 
filings overnight and respond the next business day with a return or 
dismissal of any defective filings. Thus, batch filers will not receive 
immediate correction from the system as they enter the information.
    (ii) Interactive filing. Interactive filing involves data 
transmission with screen-by-screen prompting from the Commission's COALS 
system. Interactive filers will receive prompts from the system 
identifying data entries outside the acceptable ranges of data for the 
individual fields at the time the data entry is made.
    (2) Attachments to applications must be uploaded along with the 
electronically filed application whenever possible.
    (3) Any associated documents submitted with an application must be 
uploaded as attachments to the application whenever possible. The 
attachment should be uploaded via COALS in Adobe Acrobat Portable 
Document Format (PDF) whenever possible.
    (c) Manual filing. (1) Forms 320, 321, 322, 324, 325, and 327 may be 
filed manually.
    (2) Manual filings must be submitted to the Commission at the 
appropriate address with the appropriate filing fee. The addresses for 
filing and the fee amounts for particular applications are listed in 
subpart G of this part, and in the appropriate fee filing guide for each 
service available from the Commission's Forms Distribution Center by 
calling 1-800-418-FORM (3676). The form may be downloaded from the 
Commission's Web site: http://www.fcc.gov.
    (3) Manual filings requiring fees as set forth at subpart G, of this 
part must be filed in accordance with Sec. 0.401(b) of this chapter.

[[Page 327]]

    (4) Manual filings that do not require fees must be addressed and 
sent to the Media Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th 
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20554.
    (5) FCC forms may be reproduced and the copies used in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 0.409 of this chapter.
    (d) Applications requiring prior coordination. Parties filing 
applications that require frequency coordination shall, prior to filing, 
complete all applicable frequency coordination requirements in Sec. 
78.36 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1706  Content of filings.

    (a) General. Filings must contain all information requested on the 
applicable form and any additional information required by the rules in 
this title and any rules pertaining to the specific service for which 
the filing is made.
    (b) Antenna locations. Applications for CARS stations and 
aeronautical frequency usage notifications must describe each 
transmitting antenna site or center of the cable system, respectively, 
by its geographical coordinates. Geographical coordinates must be 
specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest tenth of a 
second of latitude and longitude. Submissions must provide such data 
using the NAD83 datum.
    (c) Antenna structure registration. Owners of certain antenna 
structures must notify the Federal Aviation Administration and register 
with the Commission as required by Part 17 of this chapter. Applications 
proposing the use of one or more new or existing antenna structures must 
contain the FCC Antenna Registration Number(s) of each structure for 
which registration is required. If registration is not required, the 
applicant must provide information in its application sufficient for the 
Commission to verify this fact.
    (d) Environmental concerns. Each applicant is required to indicate 
at the time its application is filed whether a Commission grant of the 
application may have a significant environmental effect, as defined by 
Sec. 1.1307. If yes, an Environmental Assessment, required by Sec. 
1.1311, must be filed with the application and environmental review by 
the Commission must be completed prior to construction.
    (e) International coordination. Channel assignments and usage under 
part 78 are subject to the applicable provisions and requirements of 
treaties and other international agreements between the United States 
government and the governments of Canada and Mexico.
    (f) Taxpayer Identification Number (TINs). All filers are required 
to provide their Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINS) (as defined in 
26 U.S.C. 6109) to the Commission, pursuant to the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA). Under the DCIA, the FCC may use an 
applicant or licensee's TIN for purposes of collecting and reporting to 
the Department of the Treasury any delinquent amounts arising out of 
such person's relationship with the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1707  Acceptance of filings.

    Regardless of filing method, all submissions with an insufficient 
fee, grossly deficient or inaccurate information, or those without a 
valid signature will be dismissed immediately. For any submission that 
is found subsequently to have minimally deficient or inaccurate 
information, we will notify the filer of the defect. We will allow 15 
days from the date of this notification for correction or amendment of 
the submission if the amendment is minor. If the applicant files a 
timely corrected application, it will ordinarily be processed as a minor 
amendment in accordance with the Commission's rules. Thus it will have 
no effect on the initial filing date of the application or the 
applicant's filing priority. If, however, the amendment made by the 
applicant is not a simple correction, but constitutes a major amendment 
to the application, it will be governed by the rules and procedures 
applicable to major amendments, that is, it will be treated as a new 
application with a new filing date and new fees must be paid by the 
applicant. Finally, if the applicant fails to submit an amended 
application within the period specified in the notification, the 
application will be subject to dismissal for failure to prosecute.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1830  General prohibitions against discrimination.

    (a) No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of 
disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits 
of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the Commission.
    (b) Discriminatory actions prohibited.
    (1) The Commission, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may 
not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, 
on the basis of disability--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity 
to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is 
not equal to that afforded others;
    (iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, 
benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal 
opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to 
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with 
disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary 
to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, 
or services that are as effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or

    (2) The Commission may not deny a qualified individual with a 
disability the opportunity to participate in any program or activity 
even where the Commission is also providing equivalent permissibly 
separate or different programs or activities for persons with 
disabilities.

[[Page 331]]

    (3) The Commission may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration--
    (i) That have the purpose or effect of subjecting qualified 
individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of 
disability; or

impairing accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with 
respect to individuals with disabilities.
    (4) The Commission may not, in determining the site or location of a 
facility, make selections--
    (i) That have the purpose or effect of excluding individuals with 
disabilities from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting

programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the 
Commission are not, themselves, covered by this part.
    (7) The Commission shall make reasonable modifications in policies, 
practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid 
discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the Commission can 
demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the 
nature of the program, service, or activity.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1840  Employment.

    No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of 
disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any 
program or activity conducted by the Commission. The definitions, 
requirements and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973, 29 U.S.C. 791, as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission in 29 CFR parts 1614 and 1630, as well as the procedures set 
forth in the Basic Negotiations Agreement Between the Federal 
Communications Commission and National Treasury Employees Union, as 
amended, and Subchapter III of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 
U.S.C. 7121(d), shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1849  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1850, no qualified 
individual with a disability shall, because the Commission's facilities 
are inaccessible to, or unusable, by individuals with disabilities, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted 
by the Commission.
    (b) Individuals shall request accessibility to the Commission's 
programs and facilities by contacting the Commission's Section 504 
Officer. Such contact may be made in the manner indicated in the FCC 
Section 504 Handbook. The Commission will make every effort to provide 
accommodations requiring the assistance of other persons (e.g., American 
Sign Language interpreters, communication access realtime translation 
(CART) providers,

[[Page 332]]

transcribers, captioners, and readers) if the request is made to the 
Commission's Section 504 Officer a minimum of five business days in 
advance of the program. If such requests are made fewer than five 
business days prior to an event, the Commission will make every effort 
to secure accommodation services, although it may be less likely that 
the Commission will be able to secure such services.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1850  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the 
Commission shall operate each program or activity so that the program or 
activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the Commission to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;
    (2) Require the Commission to take any action that it can 
demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a 
program or activity, or in undue financial and administrative burdens. 
In those circumstances where Commission personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the 
Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 
1.1850(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that 
compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by 
the Managing Director, in consultation with the Section 504 Officer, 
after considering all Commission resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the Commission shall take any other action that would not 
result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless 
ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The Commission may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as the redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, or 
any other methods that result in making its programs or activities 
readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The 
Commission is not required to make structural changes in existing 
facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance 
with this section. The Commission, in making alterations to existing 
buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled 
by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-
4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available 
methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Commission 
shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities 
to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated 
setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The Commission shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within sixty (60) days of the 
effective date of this subpart, except that where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three (3) 
years of the effective date of this part.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
Commission shall develop, within six (6) months of the effective date of 
this subpart, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to 
complete such changes. The Commission shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or 
organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate 
in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both 
oral and written). A copy of the transitional plan shall be made 
available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--

[[Page 333]]

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the Commission's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with disabilities;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one (1) year, identify steps that will be taken 
during each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1851  Building accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Commission shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities. The definitions, requirements and 
standards of the Architectural Barriers Act, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, as 
established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings 
covered by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1870  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
disability in programs or activities conducted by the Commission.
    (b) The Commission shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1614 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 
U.S.C. 791.
    (c) Complaints alleging violation of section 504 with respect to the 
Commission's programs and activities shall be addressed to the Managing 
Director and filed with the Office of the Secretary, Federal 
Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW., Room TWB-204, 
Washington, DC 20554.
    (d) Acceptance of complaint. (1) The Commission shall accept and 
investigate all complete complaints, as defined in Sec. 1.1803 of this 
part, for which it has jurisdiction. All such complaints must be filed

discrimination. The Commission may extend this time period for good 
cause.
    (2) If the Commission receives a complaint that is not complete as 
defined in Sec. 1.1803 of this part, the complainant will be notified 
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the incomplete complaint that 
additional information is needed. If the complainant fails to complete 
the complaint within thirty (30) days of receipt of this notice, the 
Commission shall dismiss the complaint without prejudice.
    (e) If the Commission receives a complaint over which it does not 
have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall 
make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate 
government entity.
    (f) The Commission shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with disabilities.
    (g) Within one-hundred eighty (180) days of the receipt of a

    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within ninety (90) days of 
receipt from the Commission of the letter required by Sec. 1.1870(g). 
The Commission may extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the Office of 
the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW., 
Room TWB-204, Washington, DC 20554.

[[Page 334]]

    (j) The Commission shall notify the complainant of the results of 
the appeal within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the appeal request. 
If the Commission determines that it needs additional information from 
the complainant, and requests such information, the Commission shall 
have sixty (60) days from the date it receives the additional 
information to make its determination on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in (g) and (j) of this section may be 
extended with the permission of the General Counsel.
    (l) The Commission may delegate its authority for conducting 
complaint investigations to other federal agencies, except that the

a debt under 5 U.S.C. 5514 by deduction(s) at one or more officially 
established pay intervals from the current pay account of an employee 
without his or her consent.
    (r) The term waiver means the cancellation, remission, forgiveness, 
or non-recovery of a debt or fee, including, but not limited to, a debt 
due to the United States, by an entity or an employee to an agency and 
as the waiver is permitted or required by 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, 
31 U.S.C. 3711, or any other law.
    (s) Words in the plural form shall include the singular, and vice-
versa, and words signifying the masculine gender shall include the 
feminine, and vice-versa. The terms includes and including do not 
exclude matters not listed but do include matters of the same general 
class.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1902  Exceptions.

    (a) Claims arising from the audit of transportation accounts 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726 shall be determined, collected, compromised, 
terminated or settled in accordance with regulations published under the 
authority of 31 U.S.C. 3726 (see 41 CFR part 101-41).
    (b) Claims arising out of acquisition contracts subject to the 
Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) shall be determined, collected, 
compromised, terminated, or settled in accordance with those 
regulations. (See 48 CFR part 32). If not otherwise provided for in the 
FAR, contract claims that have been the subject of a contracting 
officer's final decision in accordance with section 6(a) of the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605(a)), may be determined, collected, 
compromised, terminated or settled under the provisions of this 
regulation, except that no additional review of the debt shall be 
granted beyond that provided by the contracting officer in accordance 
with the provisions of section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 
(41 U.S.C.

[[Page 336]]

605), and the amount of any interest, administrative charge, or penalty 
charge shall be subject to the limitations, if any, contained in the 
contract out of which the claim arose.
    (c) Claims based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the 
antitrust laws, or in regard to which there is an indication of fraud, 
the presentation of a false claim, or a misrepresentation on the part of 
the debtor or any other party having an interest in the claim, shall be 
referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) as only the DOJ has 
authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection action on such 
claims. The standards in the FCCS relating to the administrative 
collection of claims do apply, but only to the extent authorized by the 
DOJ in a particular case. Upon identification of a claim based in whole 
or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or any claim 
involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation 
on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, 
the Commission shall promptly refer the case to the Department of 
Justice for action. At its discretion, the DOJ may return the claim to 
the forwarding agency for further handling in accordance with the 
standards in the FCCS.
    (d) Tax claims are excluded from the coverage of this regulation.
    (e) The Commission will attempt to resolve interagency claims by 
negotiation in accordance with Executive Order 12146 (3 CFR 1980 Comp., 
pp. 409-412).
    (f) Nothing in this subpart shall supercede or invalidate other 
Commission rules, such as the part 1 general competitive bidding rules 
(47 CFR part 1, subpart Q) or the service specific competitive bidding 
rules, as may be amended, regarding the Commission's rights, including 
but not limited to the Commission's right to cancel a license or 
authorization, obtain judgment, or collect interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1903  Use of procedures.

    Procedures authorized by this regulation (including, but not limited 
to, disclosure to a consumer reporting agency, contracting for 
collection services, administrative offset and salary offset) may be 
used singly or in combination, so long as the requirements of applicable 
law and regulation are satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1904  Conformance to law and regulations.

    The requirements of applicable law (31 U.S.C. 3701-3719, as amended 
by Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749 and Public Law 104-134, 110 Stat. 
1321, 1358) have been implemented in government-wide standards which 
include the Regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (5 CFR 
part 550) and the Federal Claims Collection Standards issued jointly by 
the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General of the United 
States (31 CFR parts 900-904). Not every item in the previous sentence 
described standards has been incorporated or referenced in this 
regulation. To the extent, however, that circumstances arise which are 
not covered by the terms stated in these regulations, the Commission 
will proceed in any actions taken in accordance with applicable 
requirements found in the standards referred to in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1905  Other procedures; collection of forfeiture penalties.

    Nothing contained in these regulations is intended to require the 
Commission to duplicate administrative or other proceedings required by 
contract or other laws or regulations, nor do these regulations 
supercede procedures permitted or required by other statutes or 
regulations. In particular, the assessment and collection of monetary 
forfeitures imposed by the Commission will be governed initially by the 
procedures prescribed by 47 U.S.C. 503, 504 and 47 CFR 1.80. After 
compliance with those procedures, the Commission may determine that the 
collection of a monetary forfeiture under the collection alternatives 
prescribed by this subpart is appropriate but need not duplicate 
administrative or other proceedings. Fees and penalties prescribed by 
law, e.g., 47 U.S.C. 158 and 159, and promulgated under the authority of 
47 U.S.C. 309(j) (e.g., 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q) may be collected as 
permitted by applicable law. Nothing contained herein is intended to 
restrict the Commission

[[Page 337]]

from exercising any other right to recover or collect amounts owed to 
it.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1906  Informal action.

    Nothing contained in these regulations is intended to preclude 
utilization of informal administrative actions or remedies which may be 
available (including, e.g., Alternative Dispute Resolution), and/or for 
the Commission to exercise rights as agreed to among the parties in 
written agreements, including notes and security agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1907  Return of property or collateral.

    Nothing contained in this regulation is intended to deter the 
Commission from exercising any other right under law or regulation or by 
agreement it may have or possess, or to exercise its authority and right 
as a regulator under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the 
Commission's rules, and demanding the return of specific property or 
from demanding, as a non-exclusive alternative, either the return of 
property or the payment of its value or the amount due the United States 
under any agreement or Commission rule.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1908  Omissions not a defense.

    The failure or omission of the Commission to comply with any 
provision in this regulation shall not serve as a defense to any debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1909  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1910  Effect of insufficient fee payments, delinquent debts, or debarment.

    (a)(1) An application (including a petition for reconsideration or 
any application for review of a fee determination) or request for 
authorization subject to the FCC Registration Number (FRN) requirement 
set forth in subpart W of this chapter will be examined to determine if 
the applicant has paid the appropriate application fee, appropriate 
regulatory fees, is delinquent in its debts owed the Commission, or is 
debarred from receiving Federal benefits (see, e.g., 31 CFR 285.13; 47 
CFR part 1, subpart P).
    (2) Fee payments, delinquent debt, and debarment will be examined 
based on the entity's taxpayer identifying number (TIN), supplied when 
the entity acquired or was assigned an FRN. See 47 CFR 1.8002(b)(1).
    (b)(1) Applications by any entity found not to have paid the proper 
application or regulatory fee will be handled pursuant to the rules set 
forth in 47 CFR part 1, subpart G.
    (2) Action will be withheld on applications, including on a petition 
for reconsideration or any application for review of a fee 
determination, or requests for authorization by any entity found to be 
delinquent in its debt to the Commission (see Sec. 1.1901(j)), unless 
otherwise provided for in this regulation, e.g., 47 CFR 1.1928 (employee 
petition for a hearing). The entity will be informed that action will be 
withheld on the application until full payment or arrangement to pay any 
non-tax delinquent debt owed to the Commission is made and/or that the 
application may be dismissed. See the provisisons of Sec. Sec. 1.1108, 
1.1109, 1.1116 and 1.1118. Any Commission action taken prior to the 
payment of delinquent non-tax debt owed to the Commission is contingent 
and subject to recission. Failure to make payment on any delinquent debt 
is subject to collection of the debt, including interest thereon, any 
associated penalties, and the full cost of collection to the Federal 
government pursuant to the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement 
Act, 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (3) If a delinquency has not been paid or the debtor has not made 
other satisfactory arrangements within 30 days of the date of the notice 
provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the application 
or request for authorization will be dismissed.
    (i) The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section 
will not apply if the applicant has timely filed a challenge through an 
administrative appeal or a contested judicial proceeding either to the 
existence or amount of the non-tax delinquent debt owed the Commission.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section 
will not apply where more restrictive rules govern treatment of 
delinquent debtors, such as 47 CFR 1.2105(a)(2)(x) and (xi).

[[Page 338]]

    (c)(1) Applications for emergency or special temporary authority 
involving safety of life or property (including national security 
emergencies) or involving a brief transition period facilitating 
continuity of service to a substantial number of customers or end users, 
will not be subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. However, paragraphs (a) and (b) will be applied to permanent 
authorizations for these services.
    (2) Provisions of paragraph (a) and (b) of this section will not 
apply to application or requst for authorization to which 11 U.S.C. 
525(a) is applicable.

  Administrative Offset--Consumer Reporting Agencies--Contracting for 
                               Collection


<R05>
Sec. 1.1911  Demand for payment.

    (a) Written demand as described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
and which may be in the form of a letter, order, memorandum, or other 
form of written communication, will be made promptly upon a debtor of 
the United States in terms that inform the debtor of the consequences of 
failing to cooperate to resolve the debt. The specific content, timing, 
and number of demand letters depend upon the type and amount of the 
debt, including, e.g., any notes and the terms of agreements of the 
parties, and the debtor's response, if any, to the Commission's letters 
or telephone calls. One demand letter will be deemed sufficient. In 
determining the timing of the demand letter(s), the Commission will give 
due regard to the need to refer debts promptly to the Department of 
Justice for litigation, in accordance with the FCCS. When necessary to 
protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent the 
expiration of a statute of limitations), written demand may be preceded 
by other appropriate actions under the FCCS, including immediate 
referral for litigation. The demand letter does not provide an 
additional period within to challenge the existence of, or amount of the 
non-tax debt if such time period has expired under Commission rules or 
other applicable limitation periods. Nothing contained herein is 
intended to limit the Commission's authority or discretion as may 
otherwise be permitted to collect debts owed.
    (b) The demand letter will inform the debtor of:
    (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the opportunities, if any, of 
the debtor to request review within the Commission;
    (2) The applicable standards for assessing any interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs (Sec. Sec. 1.1940 and 1.1941);
    (3) The date by which payment is to be made to avoid late charges 
and enforced collection, which normally will not be more than 30 days 
from the date that the initial demand letter was mailed or hand-
delivered; and
    (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or 
office within the Commission.
    (c) The Commission will expend all reasonable effort to ensure that 
demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they 
are dated. As provided for in any agreement among parties, or as may be 
required by exigent circumstances, the Commission may use other forms of 
delivery, including, e.g., facsimile telecopier or electronic mail. 
There is no prescribed format for demand letters. The Commission 
utilizes demand letters and procedures that will lead to the earliest 
practicable determination of whether the debt can be resolved 
administratively or must be referred for litigation.
    (d) The Commission may, as circumstances and the nature of the debt 
permit, include in demand letters such items as the Commission's 
willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment; its policies with 
respect to the use of credit bureaus, debt collection centers, and 
collection agencies; the Commission's remedies to enforce payment of the 
debt (including assessment of interest, administrative costs and 
penalties, administrative garnishment, the use of collection agencies, 
Federal salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative offset, and 
litigation); the requirement that any debt delinquent for more than 180 
days be transferred to the Department of the Treasury for collection; 
and, depending on applicable statutory authority, the debtor's 
entitlement to consideration of a waiver. Where applicable, the debtor 
will be

[[Page 339]]

provided with a period of time (normally not more than 15 calendar days) 
from the date of the demand in which to exercise the opportunity to 
request a review.
    (e) The Commission will respond promptly to communications from the 
debtor, within 30 days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who 
dispute the debt that they must furnish available evidence to support 
their contentions.
    (f) Prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time 
during or after completion of the demand process, if the Commission 
determines to pursue, or is required to pursue, offset, the procedures 
applicable to offset in Sec. Sec. 1.1912 and 1.1913, as applicable, 
will be followed. The availability of funds or money for debt 
satisfaction by offset and the Commission's determination to pursue 
collection by offset shall release the Commission from the necessity of 
further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section.
    (g) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, the Commission will 
advise each person determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the 
debt can be collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. 
This notification will follow the requirements of Executive Order 12988 
(3 CFR, 1996 Comp., pp. 157-163) and may be given as part of a demand 
letter under paragraph (b) of this section or in a separate document. 
Litigation counsel for the Government will be advised that this notice 
has been given.
    (h) When the Commission learns that a bankruptcy petition has been 
filed with respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further 
collection action, the Commission may immediately seek legal advice from 
its counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending 
or contemplated collection activities. Unless the Commission determines 
that the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 
U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases 
collection activity against the debtor should stop immediately.
    (1) After seeking legal advice, a proof of claim will be filed in 
most cases with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. The Commission will 
refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on 
sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.
    (2) If the Commission is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from 
the automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and 
requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.
    (3) Offset is stayed in most cases by the automatic stay. However, 
the Commission will determine from its counsel whether its payments to 
the debtor and payments of other agencies available for offset may be 
frozen by the Commission until relief from the automatic stay can be 
obtained from the bankruptcy court. The Commission will also determine 
from its counsel whether recoupment is available.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1912  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) Scope. (1) The term administrative offset has the meaning 
provided in Sec. 1.1901.
    (2) This section does not apply to:
    (i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided 
in 42 U.S.C. 404;
    (ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided 
for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);
    (iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal 
Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of 
the United States;
    (iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards 
are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets 
under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, 
and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);
    (v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a 
debtor against the United States;
    (vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal 
statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular 
types of debts; or
    (vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including 
bankruptcy.
    (3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or 
payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 
3716 may be collected by administrative offset under

[[Page 340]]

the common law or other applicable statutory authority.
    (4) Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of 
payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not 
be conducted more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect 
the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right 
to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been 
known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged 
with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This 
limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.
    (5) In bankruptcy cases, the Commission will seek legal advice from 
its counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 
11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by 
offset.
    (b) Mandatory centralized administrative offset. (1) The Commission 
is required to refer past due, legally enforceable nontax debts which 
are over 180 days delinquent to the Treasury for collection by 
centralized administrative offset. Debts which are less than 180 days 
delinquent also may be referred to the Treasury for this purpose. See 
FCCS for debt certification requirements.
    (2) The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who 
owe debts referred to the Treasury as described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section shall be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be 
made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials 
include disbursing officials of Treasury, the Department of Defense, the 
United States Postal Service, other Government corporations, and 
disbursing officials of the United States designated by the Treasury. 
When the name and TIN of a debtor match the name and TIN of a payee and 
all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be 
offset to satisfy the debt.
    (3) Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in 
writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a 
past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice shall include 
a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the 
offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of 
the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within 
the creditor agency who will respond to questions regarding the offset.
    (4)(i) Before referring a delinquent debt to the Treasury for 
administrative offset, and subject to any agreement and/or waiver to the 
contrary by the debtor, the Commission shall ensure that offsets are 
initiated only after the debtor:
    (A) Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt, 
the intention of the Commission to use administrative offset to collect 
the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 
3716; and
    (B) The debtor has been given:
    (1) The opportunity to request within 15 days of the date of the 
written notice, after which opportunity is deemed waived, by the debtor, 
to inspect and copy Commission records related to the debt;
    (2) The opportunity, unless otherwise waived by the debtor, for a 
review within the Commission of the determination of indebtedness; and
    (3) The opportunity to request within 15 days of the date of the 
written notice, after which the opportunity is deemed waived by the 
debtor, for the debtor to make a written agreement to repay the debt.
    (ii) The Commission may omit the procedures set forth in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section when:
    (A) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;
    (B) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile 
Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and 
other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not 
supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets 
accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or
    (C) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted 
under paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission first learns of the 
existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient 
time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior 
notice and an

[[Page 341]]

opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review 
are omitted, the Commission shall give the debtor such notice and an 
opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund 
any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.
    (iii) When the Commission previously has given a debtor any of the 
required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular 
debt (see 31 CFR 901.2), the Commission need not duplicate such notice 
and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.
    (5) Before the Commission refers delinquent debts to the Treasury, 
the Office of Managing Director must certify, in a form acceptable to 
the Treasury, that:
    (i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and
    (ii) The Commission has complied with all due process requirements 
under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and its regulations.
    (6) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt 
from centralized administrative offset. The Treasury shall exempt 
payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative 
offset when requested in writing by the head of the payment certifying 
or authorizing agency. Also, the Treasury may exempt other classes of 
payments from centralized offset upon the written request of the head of 
the payment certifying or authorizing agency.
    (7) Benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
301 et seq.), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921 et 
seq.), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other 
than tier 2 benefits), may be offset only in accordance with Treasury 
regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security 
Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of 
Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.
    (8) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Treasury may waive the 
provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 
concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and 
verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative 
offset upon receipt of a certification from a creditor agency that the 
due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. 
The certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only 
the Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury is required 
to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Non-centralized administrative offset. (1) Generally, non-
centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that 
the Commission conducts, at the Commission's discretion, internally or 
in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the 
debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized 
administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally 
enforceable nontax delinquent debts may be collected through non-
centralized administrative offset. In these cases, a creditor agency may 
make a request directly to a payment-authorizing agency to offset a 
payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may 
be appropriate for a creditor agency to request that the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal employee's lump-sum payment 
upon leaving Government service to satisfy an unpaid advance.
    (2) The Commission will make reasonable effort to ensure that such 
offsets may occur only after:
    (i) The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section (subject to any waiver by the debtor); 
and
    (ii) The payment authorizing agency has received written 
certification from the Commission that the debtor owes the past due, 
legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that the 
creditor agency has fully complied with its regulations concerning 
administrative offset.
    (3) Payment authorizing agencies shall comply with offset requests 
by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless 
the offset would not be in the best interests of

[[Page 342]]

the United States with respect to the program of the payment authorizing 
agency, or would otherwise be contrary to law. Appropriate use should be 
made of the cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting 
collection by administrative offset.
    (4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative 
offset, agencies should apply the recovered amounts to those debts in 
accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined 
by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the 
applicable statute of limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1913  Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

    Upon providing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) with written 
certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in 
Sec. 1.1912(b)(4), the Commission may request OPM to offset a debtor's 
anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations 
codified at 5 CFR 831.1801-831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM 
will identify and ``flag'' a debtor's account in anticipation of the 
time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments 
from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be 
initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in 
Sec. 1.1914(a)(4).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1914  Collection in installments.

    (a) Subject to the Commission's rules pertaining to the installment 
loan program (see e.g., 47 CFR Sec. 1.2110(g)), subpart Q or other 
agreements among the parties, the terms of which will control, whenever 
feasible, the Commission shall collect the total amount of a debt in one 
lump sum. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one lump 
sum, the Commission, in its sole discretion, may accept payment in 
regular installments. The Commission will obtain financial statements 
from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay in one lump sum 
and which are able to verify independently such representations (see 31 
CFR 902.2(g)). The Commission will require and obtain a legally 
enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the 
terms of the arrangement, including, as appropriate, sureties and other 
indicia of creditworthiness (see Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, 2 
U.S.C. 661, et seq., OMB Circular A-129), and that contains a provision 
accelerating the debt in the event of default.
    (b) The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a 
reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to 
pay. If possible, the installment payments will be sufficient in size 
and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.
    (c) Security for deferred payments will be obtained in appropriate 
cases. The Commission may accept installment payments notwithstanding 
the refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give 
security, at the Commission's option.
    (d) The Commission may deny the extension of credit to any debtor 
who fails to provide the records requested or fails to show an ability 
to pay the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1915  Exploration of compromise.

    The Commission may attempt to effect compromise, preferably during 
the course of personal interviews, in accordance with the standards set 
forth in part 902 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR 
part 902). The Commission will also consider a request submitted by the 
debtor to compromise the debt. Such requests should be submitted in 
writing with full justification of the offer and addressing the bases 
for compromise at 31 CFR 902.2. Debtors will provide full financial 
information to support any request for compromise based on the debtor's 
inability to pay the debt. Unless otherwise provided by law, when the 
principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized 
by the Attorney General, the authority to accept the compromise rests 
with the Department of Justice. The Commission will evaluate an offer, 
using the factors

[[Page 343]]

set forth in 31 CFR 902.2 and, as appropriate, refer the offer with the 
appropriate financial information to the Department of Justice. 
Department of Justice approval is not required if the Commission rejects 
a compromise offer.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1916  Suspending or terminating collection action.

    The suspension or termination of collection action shall be made in 
accordance with the standards set forth in part 903 of the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR part 903).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1917  Referrals to the Department of Justice and transfer of delinquent debt to the Secretary of Treasury.

    (a) Referrals to the Department of Justice shall be made in 
accordance with the standards set forth in part 904 of the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR part 904).
    (b) The DCIA includes separate provisions governing the requirements 
that the Commission transfer delinquent debts to Treasury for general 
collection purposes (cross-servicing) in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
3711(g)(1) and (2), and notify Treasury of delinquent debts for the 
purpose of administrative offset in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
3716(c)(6). Title 31, U.S.C. 3711(g)(1) requires the Commission to 
transfer to Treasury all collection activity for a given debt. Under 
section 3711(g), Treasury will use all appropriate debt collection tools 
to collect the debt, including referral to a designated debt collection 
center or private collection agency, and administrative offset. Once a 
debt has been transferred to Treasury pursuant to the procedures at 31 
CFR 285.12, the Commission will cease all collection activity related to 
that debt.
    (c) All non-tax debts of claims owed to the Commission that have 
been delinquent for a period of 180 days shall be transferred to the 
Secretary of the Treasury. Debts which are less than 180 days delinquent 
may also be referred to the Treasury. Upon such transfer the Secretary 
of the Treasury shall take appropriate action to collect or terminate 
collection actions on the debt or claim. A debt is past-due if it has 
not been paid by the date specified in the Commission's initial written 
demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a 
post-delinquency payment agreement) unless other satisfactory payment 
arrangements have been made.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1918  Use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) The term individual means a natural person, and the term 
consumer reporting agency has the meaning provided in the Federal Claims 
Collection Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3) or the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 168a(f).
    (b) The Commission may disclose to a consumer reporting agency, or 
provide information to the Treasury who may disclose to a consumer 
reporting agency from a system of records, information that an 
individual is responsible for a claim. System information includes, for 
example, name, taxpayer identification number, business and home 
address, business and home telephone numbers, the amount of the debt, 
the amount of unpaid principle, the late period, and the payment 
history. Before the Commission reports the information, it will:
    (1) Provide notice required by section 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) that 
information in the system may be disclosed to a consumer reporting 
agency;
    (2) Review the claim to determine that it is valid and overdue;
    (3) Make reasonable efforts using information provided by the debtor 
in Commission files to notify the debtor, unless otherwise specified 
under the terms of a contract or agreement--
    (i) That payment of the claim is overdue;
    (ii) That, within not less than 60 days from the date of the notice, 
the Commission intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency that 
the individual is responsible for that claim;
    (iii) That information in the system of records may be disclosed to 
the consumer reporting agency; and
    (iv) That unless otherwise specified and agreed to in an agreement, 
contract, or by the terms of a note and/or security agreement, or that 
the debt arises from the nonpayment of a Commission fee, penalty, or 
other statutory

[[Page 344]]

or regulatory obligations, the individual will be provided with an 
explanation of the claim, and, as appropriate, procedures to dispute 
information in the records of the agency about the claim, and to 
administrative appeal or review of the claim; and
    (4) Review Commission records to determine that the individual has 
not--
    (i) Repaid or agreed to repay the claim under a written repayment 
plan agreed to and signed by both the individual and the Commission's 
representative; or, if eligible; and
    (ii) Filed for review of the claim under paragraph (g) of this 
section;
    (c) The Commission shall: (1) Disclose to each consumer reporting 
agency to which the original disclosure was made a substantial change in 
the condition or amount of the claim;
    (2) Verify or correct promptly information about the claim, on 
request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of any or all 
information so disclosed; and
    (3) Obtain assurances from each consumer reporting agency that they 
are complying with all laws of the United States relating to providing 
consumer credit information.
    (d) The Commission shall ensure that information disclosed to the 
consumer reporting agency is limited to--
    (1) Information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and
    (3) The agency or program under which the claim arose.
    (e) All accounts in excess of $100 that have been delinquent more 
than 31 days will normally be referred to a consumer reporting agency.
    (f) Under the same provisions as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Commission may disclose to a credit reporting agency, 
information relating to a debtor other than a natural person. Such 
commercial debt accounts are not covered by the Privacy Act. Moreover, 
commercial debt accounts are subject to the Commission's rules 
concerning debt obligation, including part 1 rules related to auction 
debt, and the agreements of the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1919  Contracting for collection services.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Commission may contract with private collection contractors, as defined 
in 31 U.S.C. 3701(f), to recover delinquent debts. In that regard, the 
Commission:
    (1) Retains the authority to resolve disputes, compromise debts, 
suspend or terminate collection activity, and refer debts for 
litigation;
    (2) Restricts the private collection contractor from offering, as an 
incentive for payment, the opportunity to pay the debt less the private 
collection contractor's fee unless the Commission has granted such 
authority prior to the offer;
    (3) Specifically requires, as a term of its contract with the 
private collection contractor, that the private collection contractor is 
subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 
552a(m), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations 
pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to 
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and
    (4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all 
amounts collected.
    (b) Although the Commission will use government-wide debt collection 
contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private 
collection contractors, the Commission may refer debts to private 
collection contractors pursuant to a contract between the Commission and 
the private collection contractor in those situations where the 
Commission is not required to transfer debt to the Secretary of the 
Treasury for debt collection.
    (c) Agencies may fund private collection contractor in accordance 
with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), or as otherwise permitted by law.
    (d) The Commission may enter into contracts for locating and 
recovering assets of the United States, such as unclaimed assets, but it 
will first establish procedures that are acceptable to Treasury before 
entering into contracts to recover assets of the United States held by a 
state government or a financial institution.

[[Page 345]]

    (e) The Commission may enter into contracts for debtor asset and 
income search reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(d), such 
contracts may provide that the fee a contractor charges the Commission 
for such services may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless 
otherwise prohibited by statute. In that regard, fees for those services 
will be added to the amount collected and are part of the administrative 
collection costs passed on to the debtor. See Sec. 1.1940.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 1.1920-1.1924  [Reserved]

                      Salary Offset-Individual Debt


<R05>
Sec. 1.1925  Purpose.

    Sections 1.1925 through 1.1939 apply to individuals who are 
employees of the Commission and provides the standards to be followed by 
the Commission in implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514; sec. 8(1) of E.O. 11609 (3 
CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p.586); redesignated in sec. 2-1 of E.O. 12107 (3 
CFR, 1978 Comp., p.264) to recover a debt from the pay account of a 
Commission employee. It also establishes procedural guidelines to 
recover debts when the employee's creditor and paying agencies are not 
the same.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1926  Scope.

    (a) Coverage. This section applies to the Commission and employees 
as defined by Sec. 1.1901.
    (b) Applicability. This section and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in 
recovering certain debts by offset, except where the employee consents 
to the recovery, from the current pay account of that employee. Because 
it is an administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary 
offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and these regulations 
should be consistent with the provisions of the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900-904).
    (1) Excluded debts or claims. The procedures contained in this 
section do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or the tariff laws of the United 
States, or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is 
explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel 
advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 
4108).
    (2) Section 1.1926 does not preclude an employee from requesting 
waiver of an erroneous payment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 
32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a 
debt, in the manner prescribed by the Commissioner. Similarly, this 
subpart does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of the 
collection of a debt under any other applicable statutory authority.
    (c) Time limit. Under 31 CFR 901.3(a)(4) offset may not be initiated 
more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt 
first accrued, unless an exception applies as stated in section 
901.3(a)(4).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1927  Notification.

    (a) Salary offset deductions will not be made unless the Managing 
Director of the Commission, or the Managing Director's designee, 
provides to the employee at least 30 days before any deduction, written 
notice stating at a minimum:
    (1) The Commission's determination that a debt is owed, including 
the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;
    (2) The Commission's intention to collect the debt by means of 
deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account;
    (3) The frequency and amount of the intended deduction (stated as a 
fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of pay, not to exceed 15 percent 
of disposable pay) and the intention to continue the deductions until 
the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved;
    (4) An explanation of the Commission's policy concerning interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs (See Sec. Sec. 1.1940 and 1.1941), 
a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in 
accordance with the FCCS;
    (5) The employee's right to inspect and copy Government records 
relating to the debt or, if the employee or his or her representative 
cannot personally inspect the records, to request and receive a copy of 
such records.
    (6) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms 
agreeable to the Commission) to establish a schedule for the voluntary 
repayment of the

[[Page 346]]

debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for 
repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in 
writing, signed by both the employee and the Managing Director (or 
designee) of the Commission and documented in Commission files (see the 
FCCS).
    (7) The employee's right to a hearing conducted by an official 
arranged by the Commission (an administrative law judge, or 
alternatively, a hearing official not under the control of the head of 
the Commission) if a petition is filed as prescribed by this subpart.
    (8) The method and time period for petitioning for a hearing;
    (9) That the timely filing of a petition for hearing will stay the 
commencement of collection proceedings;
    (10) That the final decision in the hearing (if one is requested) 
will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 
days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the 
employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the 
proceedings;
    (11) That any knowingly false, misleading, or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:
    (i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under Chapter 75 of title 5, 
U.S.C., part 752 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, or any other 
applicable statutes or regulations.
    (ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act sections 3729-3731 of 
title 31, U.S.C., or any other applicable statutory authority; or
    (iii) Criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 of 
title 18, U.S.C., or any other applicable statutory authority.
    (12) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under 
statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection 
is being made; and
    (13) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions 
to the contrary, that amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are 
later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly 
refunded to the employee.
    (b) Notifications under this section shall be hand delivered with a 
record made of the date of delivery, or shall be mailed by certified 
mail, return receipt requested.
    (c) No notification, hearing, written responses or final decisions 
under this regulation are required by the Commission for:
    (1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of 
coverage, or change in coverage, under a Federal benefit program 
requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered 
was accumulated over four pay periods or less;
    (2) A routine intra-Commission adjustment of pay that is made to 
correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative 
errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment 
occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, or as 
soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice 
of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for 
contesting such adjustment; or
    (3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, 
at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the 
individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of 
the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1928  Hearing.

    (a) Petition for hearing. (1) An employee may request a hearing by 
filing a written petition with the Managing Director of the Commission, 
or designated official stating why the employee believes the 
determination of the Commission concerning the existence or the amount 
of the debt is in error.
    (2) The employee's petition must be executed under penalty of 
perjury by the employee and fully identify and explain with reasonable 
specificity all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, which the 
employee believes support his or her position.
    (3) The petition must be filed no later than fifteen (15) calendar 
days from the date that the notification was hand delivered or the date 
of delivery by certified mail, return receipt requested.

[[Page 347]]

    (4) If a petition is received after the fifteenth (15) calendar day 
deadline referred to paragraph (a) (3) of this section, the Commission 
will nevertheless accept the petition if the employee can show, in 
writing, that the delay was due to circumstances beyond his or her 
control, or because of failure to receive notice of the time limit 
(unless otherwise aware of it).
    (5) If a petition is not filed within the time limit specified in 
paragraph (a) (3) of this section, and is not accepted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the employee's right to hearing will 
be considered waived, and salary offset will be implemented by the 
Commission.
    (b) Type of hearing. (1) The form and content of the hearing will be 
determined by the hearing official who shall be a person outside the 
control or authority of the Commission except that nothing herein shall 
be construed to prohibit the appointment of an administrative law judge 
by the Commission. In determining the type of hearing, the hearing 
officer will consider the nature and complexity of the transaction 
giving rise to the debt. The hearing may be conducted as an informal 
conference or interview, in which the Commission and employee will be 
given a full opportunity to present their respective positions, or as a 
more formal proceeding involving the presentation of evidence, arguments 
and written submissions.
    (2) The employee may represent him or herself, or may be represented 
by an attorney.
    (3) The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of the 
hearing.
    (4) The decision of the hearing officer shall be in writing, and 
shall state:
    (i) The facts purported to evidence the nature and origin of the 
alleged debt;
    (ii) The hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions, in 
the light of the hearing, as to--
    (A) The employee's and/or agency's grounds,
    (B) The amount and validity of the alleged debt, and,
    (C) The repayment schedule, if applicable.
    (5) The decision of the hearing official shall constitute the final 
administrative decision of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1929  Deduction from employee's pay.

    (a) Deduction by salary offset, from an employee's current 
disposable pay, shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Ordinarily, debts to the United States will be collected in 
full, in one lump sum. This will be done when funds are available for 
payment in one lump sum. However, if the employee is financially unable 
to pay in one lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of 
disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection 
must be made in installments.
    (2) The size of the installment deductions will bear a reasonable 
relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay 
(see the FCCS). However, the installments will not exceed 15 percent of 
the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee 
has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.
    (3) Deduction will generally commence with the next full pay 
interval (ordinarily the next biweekly pay period) following the date: 
of the employee's written consent to salary offset, the waiver of 
hearing, or the decision issued by the hearing officer.
    (4) Installment deductions will be pro-rated for a period not 
greater than the anticipated period of employment except as provided in 
Sec. 1.1930.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1930  Liquidation from final check or recovery from other payment.

    (a) If the employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment 
or period of active duty ends before collection of the debt is 
completed, offset of the entire remaining balance of the debt may be 
made from a final payment of any nature, including, but not limited to a 
final salary payment or lump-sum leave due the employee as the date of 
separation, to such extent as is necessary to liquidate the debt.
    (b) If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from a final payment, 
offset may be made from later payments of any kind due from the United 
States, including, but not limited to, the Civil

[[Page 348]]

Service Retirement and Disability Fund, pursuant to Sec. 1.1913.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1931  Non-waiver of rights by payments.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be construed as a waiver 
of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any 
other provision of contract or law, unless statutory or contractual 
provisions provide to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1932  Refunds.

    (a) Refunds shall promptly be made when--(1) A debt is waived or 
otherwise found not owing to the United States (unless expressly 
prohibited by statute or regulation); or
    (2) The employee's paying agency is directed by an administrative or 
judicial order to refund amounts deducted from his or her current pay.
    (b) Refunds do not bear interest unless required or permitted by law 
or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1933  Interest, penalties and administrative costs.

    The assessment of interest, penalties and administrative costs shall 
be in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.1940 and 1.1941.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1934  Recovery when the Commission is not creditor agency.

    (a) Responsibilities of creditor agency. Upon completion of the 
procedures established under 5 U.S.C. 5514, the creditor agency must do 
the following:
    (1) Must certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the 
amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is due, the 
date of the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and 
that the creditor agency's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have 
been approved by OPM.
    (2) If the collection must be made in installments, the creditor 
agency also must advise the Commission of the number of installments to 
be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencement date 
of the first installment (if a date other than the next officially 
established pay period is required).
    (3) Unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in 
writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required 
procedures, and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the 
Commission, the creditor agency also must advise the Commission of the 
action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) the 
action(s) was taken.
    (4) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the creditor 
agency must submit a debt claim containing the information specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section and an installment 
agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable 
to the Commission.
    (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor 
agency must submit its claim to the Commission for collection pursuant 
to Sec. 1.1930. The Commission will certify the total amount of its 
collection and provide copies to the creditor agency and the employee as 
stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the Commission is aware 
that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must 
provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such 
payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that 
there has been full compliance with the provisions of this section. 
However, the creditor agency must submit a properly certified claim to 
the agency responsible for making such payments before collection can be 
made.
    (6) If the employee is already separated and all payments from the 
Commission have been paid, the creditor agency may request, unless 
otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from 
the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801 et 
seq.), or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the 
debt. (31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR 102.4)
    (b) Responsibilities of the Commission--(1) Complete claim. When the 
Commission receives a properly certified debt claim from a creditor 
agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin prospectively at the 
next official established pay interval. The Commission

[[Page 349]]

will notify the employee that the Commission has received a certified 
debt claim from the creditor agency (including the amount) and written 
notice of the date deductions from salary will commence and of the 
amount of such deductions.
    (2) Incomplete claim. When the Commission receives an incomplete 
debt claim from a creditor agency, the Commission will return the debt 
claim with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart 
must be provided, and a properly certified debt claim received, before 
action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.
    (3) Review. The Commission will not review the merits of the 
creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity 
of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
    (c) Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another. (1) 
If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the 
Commission, the employee transfers to a position served by a different 
paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the Commission must 
certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. One copy of 
the certification must be furnished to the employee, another to the 
creditor agency along with notice of employee's transfer. However, the 
creditor agency must submit a properly certified claim to the new paying 
agency before collection can be resumed.
    (2) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the 
creditor agency need not repeat the due process procedures described by 
5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. However, the 
creditor agency is responsible for reviewing the debt upon receiving the 
former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure 
the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1935  Obtaining the services of a hearing official.

    (a) When the debtor does not work for the creditor agency and the 
creditor agency cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before 
an administrative law judge or before a hearing official furnished 
pursuant to another lawful arrangement, the creditor agency may contact 
an agent of the Commission designated in Appendix A of 5 CFR part 581 
for a hearing official, and the Commission will then cooperate as 
provided by the FCCS and provide a hearing official.
    (b) When the debtor works for the creditor agency, the creditor 
agency may contact any agent (of another agency) designated in appendix 
A of 5 CFR part 581 to arrange for a hearing official. Agencies must 
then cooperate as required by the FCCS and provide a hearing official.
    (c) The determination of a hearing official designated under this 
section is considered to be an official certification regarding the 
existence and amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset 
under 5 U.S.C. 5514. A creditor agency may make a certification to the 
Secretary of the Treasury under 31 CFR 550.1108 or a paying agency under 
31 CFR 550.1109 regarding the existence and amount of the debt based on 
the certification of a hearing official. If a hearing official 
determines that a debt may not be collected via salary offset, but the 
creditor agency finds that the debt is still valid, the creditor agency 
may still seek collection of the debt through other means, such as 
offset of other Federal payments, litigation, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1936  Administrative wage garnishment.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides procedures for the Commission to 
collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative 
wage garnishment to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United 
States.
    (b) Scope. (1) This section applies to Commission-administered 
programs that give rise to a delinquent nontax debt owed to the United 
States and to the Commission's pursuit of recovery of such debt.
    (2) This section shall apply notwithstanding any provision of State 
law.
    (3) Nothing in this section precludes the compromise of a debt or 
the suspension or termination of collection action in accordance with 
applicable law. See, for example, the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards (FCCS), 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.

[[Page 350]]

    (4) The receipt of payments pursuant to this section does not 
preclude the Commission from pursuing other debt collection remedies, 
including the offset of Federal payments to satisfy delinquent nontax 
debt owed to the United States. The Commission may pursue such debt 
collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative 
wage garnishment.
    (5) This section does not apply to the collection of delinquent 
nontax debt owed to the Commission from the wages of Federal employees 
from their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal 
salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514, Sec. Sec. 1.1925 
through 1.1935, and other applicable laws.
    (6) Nothing in this section requires the Commission to duplicate 
notices or administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws 
or regulations.
    (c) Definitions. In addition to the definitions set forth in Sec. 
1.1901 as used in this section, the following definitions shall apply:
    (1) Business day means Monday through Friday. For purposes of 
computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a 
Federal legal holiday.
    (2) Certificate of service means a certificate signed by a 
Commission official indicating the nature of the document to which it 
pertains, the date of mailing of the document, and to whom the document 
is being sent.
    (3) Day means calendar day. For purposes of computation, the last 
day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or 
a Federal legal holiday.
    (4) Disposable pay means that part of the debtor's compensation 
(including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and 
vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health 
insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld.
    (5) Amounts required by law to be withheld include amounts for 
deductions such as social security taxes and withholding taxes, but do 
not include any amount withheld pursuant to a court order.
    (6) Employer means a person or entity that employs the services of 
others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer 
includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does 
not include an agency of the Federal Government.
    (7) Garnishment means the process of withholding amounts from an 
employee's disposable pay and the paying of those amounts to a creditor 
in satisfaction of a withholding order.
    (8) Withholding order means any order for withholding or garnishment 
of pay issued by an agency, or judicial or administrative body. For 
purposes of this section, the terms ``wage garnishment order'' and 
``garnishment order'' have the same meaning as ``withholding order.''
    (d) General rule. Whenever the Commission determines that a 
delinquent debt is owed by an individual, the Commission may initiate 
proceedings administratively to garnish the wages of the delinquent 
debtor as governed by procedures prescribed by 31 CFR 285. Wage 
garnishment will usually be performed for the Commission by the Treasury 
as part of the debt collection processes for Commission debts referred 
to Treasury for further collection action.
    (e) Notice requirements. (1) At least 30 days before the initiation 
of garnishment proceedings, the Commission shall mail, by first class 
mail, to the debtor's last known address a written notice informing the 
debtor of:
    (i) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (ii) The intention of the Commission to initiate proceedings to 
collect the debt through deductions from pay until the debt and all 
accumulated interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in 
full; and
    (iii) An explanation of the debtor's rights, including those set 
forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and the time frame within 
which the debtor may exercise his or her rights.
    (2) The debtor shall be afforded the opportunity:
    (i) To inspect and copy agency records related to the debt;
    (ii) To enter into a written repayment agreement with the Commission 
under terms agreeable to the Commission; and

[[Page 351]]

    (iii) For a hearing in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section 
concerning the existence or the amount of the debt or the terms of the 
proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order. However, the 
debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of the proposed 
repayment schedule if these terms have been established by written 
agreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (3) The Commission will keep a copy of a certificate of service 
indicating the date of mailing of the notice. The certificate of service 
may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is 
sufficient for evidentiary purposes.
    (f) Hearing. Pursuant to 31 CFR 285.11(f)(1), the Commission hereby 
adopts by reference the hearing procedures of 31 CFR 285.11(f).
    (g) Wage garnishment order. (1) Unless the Commission receives 
information that the Commission believes justifies a delay or 
cancellation of the withholding order, the Commission will send, by 
first class mail, a withholding order to the debtor's employer within 30 
days after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing 
(i.e., within 15 business days after the mailing of the notice described 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or, if a timely request for a 
hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 days after a final decision is 
made by the Commission to proceed with garnishment, or as soon as 
reasonably possible thereafter.
    (2) The withholding order sent to the employer under paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section shall be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of 
the Treasury on the Commission's letterhead and signed by the head of 
the Commission or his/her delegate. The order shall contain only the 
information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding 
order, including the debtor's name, address, and social security number, 
as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where 
payments should be sent.
    (3) The Commission will keep a copy of a certificate of service 
indicating the date of mailing of the order. The certificate of service 
may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is 
sufficient for evidentiary purposes.
    (h) Certification by employer. Along with the withholding order, the 
Commission shall send to the employer a certification in a form 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The employer shall complete 
and return the certification to the Commission within the time frame 
prescribed in the instructions to the form addressing matters such as 
information about the debtor's employment status and disposable pay 
available for withholding.
    (i) Amounts withheld. (1) After receipt of the garnishment order 
issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable 
pay paid to the applicable debtor during each pay period the amount of 
garnishment described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of 
this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of:
    (i) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the 
debtor's disposable pay; or
    (ii) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on 
Garnishment). The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount 
by which a debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to 
thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.
    (3) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with 
priority the following shall apply:
    (i) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders 
issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section and shall have priority over other 
withholding orders which are served later in time. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, withholding orders for family support shall have priority 
over withholding orders issued under this section.
    (ii) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a 
withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order 
issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family 
support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld 
pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the 
lesser of:

[[Page 352]]

    (A) The amount calculated under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, or
    (B) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the 
amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.
    (iii) If a debtor owes more than one debt to the Commission, the 
Commission may issue multiple withholding orders provided that the total 
amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders does not exceed 
the amount set forth in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. For purposes 
of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the term agency refers to the Commission 
that is owed the debt.
    (4) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (i)(2) and 
(i)(3) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of 
debtor.
    (5) The employer shall promptly pay to the Commission all amounts 
withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to 
this section.
    (6) An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and 
disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.
    (7) Any assignment or allotment by an employee of his earnings shall 
be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the 
withholding order issued under this section, except for any assignment 
or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.
    (8) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the 
debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives 
notification from the Commission to discontinue wage withholding. The 
garnishment order shall indicate a reasonable period of time within 
which the employer is required to commence wage withholding.
    (j) Exclusions from garnishment. The Commission may not garnish the 
wages of a debtor who it knows has been involuntarily separated from 
employment until the debtor has been reemployed continuously for at 
least 12 months. The debtor has the burden of informing the Commission 
of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from 
employment.
    (k) Financial hardship. (1) A debtor whose wages are subject to a 
wage withholding order under this section, may, at any time, request a 
review by the Commission of the amount garnished, based on materially 
changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic 
illness which result in demonstrated financial hardship.
    (2) A debtor requesting a review under paragraph (k)(1) of this 
section shall submit the basis for claiming that the current amount of 
garnishment results in demonstrated financial hardship to the debtor, 
along with supporting documentation. The Commission will consider any 
information submitted; however, demonstrated financial hardship must be 
based on financial records that include Federal and state tax returns, 
affidavits executed under the pain and penalty of perjury, and, in the 
case of business-related financial hardship (e.g., the debtor is a 
partner or member of a business-agency relationship) full financial 
statements (audited and/or submitted under oath) in accordance with 
procedures and standards established by the Commission.
    (3) If a financial hardship is found, the Commission will downwardly 
adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the 
Commission, the amount garnisheed to reflect the debtor's financial 
condition. The Commission will notify the employer of any adjustments to 
the amounts to be withheld.
    (l) Ending garnishment. (1) Once the Commission has fully recovered 
the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs consistent with the FCCS, the Commission will send 
the debtor's employer notification to discontinue wage withholding.
    (2) At least annually, the Commission shall review its debtors' 
accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts 
that have been paid in full.
    (m) Actions prohibited by the employer. An employer may not 
discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against the 
debtor due to the issuance of a withholding order under this section.

[[Page 353]]

    (n) Refunds. (1) If a hearing official, at a hearing held pursuant 
to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, determines that a debt is not 
legally due and owing to the United States, the Commission shall 
promptly refund any amount collected by means of administrative wage 
garnishment.
    (2) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this 
section shall not bear interest.
    (o) Right of action. The Commission may sue any employer for any 
amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable 
to an employee in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (i) of this 
section. However, a suit may not be filed before the termination of the 
collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing 
is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of 
limitations period. For purposes of this section, ``termination of the 
collection action'' occurs when the Commission has terminated collection 
action in accordance with the FCCS or other applicable standards. In any 
event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to 
occur if the Commission has not received any payments to satisfy the 
debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, 
in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.

Sec. Sec. 1.1937-1.1939  [Reserved]

      Interest, Penalties, Administrative Costs and Other Sanctions


<R05>
Sec. 1.1940  Assessment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this 
section or Sec. 1.1941, the Commission shall charge interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. The Commission will mail, hand-deliver, or 
use other forms of transmission, including facsimile telecopier service, 
a written notice to the debtor, at the debtor's CORES contact address 
(see section 1.8002(b)) explaining the Commission's requirements 
concerning these charges except where these requirements are included in 
a contractual or repayment agreement, or otherwise provided in the 
Commission's rules, as may be amended from time to time. These charges 
shall continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise 
resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges. This 
provision is not intended to modify or limit the terms of any contract, 
note, or security agreement from the debtor, or to modify or limit the 
Commission's rights under its rules with regard to the notice or the 
parties' agreement to waive notice.
    (b) The Commission shall charge interest on debts owed the United 
States as follows:
    (1) Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency, or as 
otherwise provided by the terms of any contract, note, or security 
agreement, regulation, or law.
    (2) Unless otherwise established in a contract, note, or security 
agreement, repayment agreement, or by statute, the rate of interest 
charged shall be the rate established annually by the Treasury in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, an agency 
may charge a higher rate of interest if it reasonably determines that a 
higher rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. The 
agency should document the reason(s) for its determination that the 
higher rate is necessary.
    (3) The rate of interest, as initially charged, shall remain fixed 
for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a 
repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the agency 
may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the current 
value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is 
executed. Interest shall not be compounded, that is, interest shall not 
be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by 
this section. If, however, a debtor defaults on a previous repayment 
agreement, charges that accrued but were not collected under the 
defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal under the new 
repayment agreement.
    (c) The Commission shall assess administrative costs incurred for 
processing and handling delinquent debts. The calculation of 
administrative costs may be based on actual costs incurred or upon 
estimated costs as determined

[[Page 354]]

by the Commission. Commission administrative costs include the personnel 
and service costs (e.g., telephone, copier, and overhead) to notify and 
collect the debt, without regard to the success of such efforts by the 
Commission.
    (d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, 
or by statute, the Commission will charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), currently not to exceed six percent (6%) a year on 
the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This 
charge shall accrue from the date of delinquency. If the rate permitted 
under 31 U.S.C. 3717 is changed, the Commission will apply that rate.
    (e) The Commission may increase an administrative debt by the cost 
of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under 
this section. Administrative debt includes, but is not limited to, a 
debt based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a 
debt based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising 
from loans and loan guaranties. The cost of living adjustment is the 
percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of 
the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price 
Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was 
determined or last adjusted. Increases to administrative debts shall be 
computed annually. Agencies should use this alternative only when there 
is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and 
penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of 
the debt.
    (f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts 
received by the agency shall be applied first to outstanding penalties 
and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third 
to the outstanding principal.
    (g) The Commission will waive the collection of interest and 
administrative charges imposed pursuant to this section on the portion 
of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest 
began to accrue. The Commission will not extend this 30-day period 
except for good cause shown of extraordinary and compelling 
circumstances, completely documented and supported in writing, submitted 
and received before the expiration of the first 30-day period. The 
Commission may, on good cause shown of extraordinary and compelling 
circumstances, completely documented and supported in writing, waive 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs charged under this 
section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, 
either under the criteria set forth in these standards for the 
compromise of debts, or if the agency determines that collection of 
these charges is against equity and good conscience or is not in the 
best interest of the United States.
    (h) The Commission retains the common law right to impose interest 
and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1941  Exemptions.

    (a) The preceding sections of this part, to the extent they reflect 
remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and 
the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, such as administrative 
offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and 
interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or 
payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 
U.S.C. 1 et seq.); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), 
except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c); 
or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, 
however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act 
of 1996, to the extent that they are authorized under some other statute 
or the common law.
    (b) This section should not be construed as prohibiting the use of 
these authorities or requirements when collecting debts owed by persons 
employed by agencies administering the laws cited in paragraph (a) of 
this section unless the debt arose under those laws. However, the 
Commission is authorized to assess interest and related charges on debts 
which are not subject

[[Page 355]]

to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under the common law or other 
applicable statutory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1942  Other sanctions.

    The remedies and sanctions available to the Commission in this 
subpart are not exclusive. The Commission may impose other sanctions, 
where permitted by law, for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated 
failure of a debtor to pay such a claim. In such cases, the Commission 
will provide notice, as required by law, to the debtor prior to 
imposition of any such sanction.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 1.1943-1.1949  [Reserved]

              Cooperation With the Internal Revenue Service


<R05>
Sec. 1.1950  Reporting discharged debts to the Internal Revenue Service.

    (a) In accordance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code and implementing regulations (26 U.S.C. 6050P; 26 CFR 1.6050P-1), 
when the Commission discharges a debt for less than the full value of 
the indebtedness, it will report the outstanding balance discharged, not 
including interest, to the Internal Revenue Service, using IRS Form 
1099-C or any other form prescribed by the Service, when:
    (1) The principle amount of the debt not in dispute is $600 or more; 
and
    (2) The obligation has not been discharged in a bankruptcy 
proceeding; and
    (3) The obligation is no longer collectible either because the time 
limit in the applicable statute for enforcing collection expired during 
the tax year, or because during the year a formal compromise agreement 
was reached in which the debtor was legally discharged of all or a 
portion of the obligation.
    (b) The Treasury will prepare the Form 1099-C for those debts 
transferred to Treasury for collection and deemed uncollectible.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1951  Offset against tax refunds.

    The Commission will take action to effect administrative offset 
against tax refunds due to debtors under 26 U.S.C. 6402, in accordance 
with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and Treasury Department 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1952  Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

    (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or 
compromise a debt under this subpart or other authority, the Commission 
may send a request to the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee) to 
obtain a debtor's mailing address from the records of the Internal 
Revenue Service.
    (b) The Commission is authorized to use mailing addresses obtained 
under paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a 
delinquent debt and may disclose such mailing addresses to other 
agencies and to collection agencies for collection purposes.

           General Provisions Concerning Interagency Requests


<R05>
Sec. 1.1953  Interagency requests.

    (a) Requests to the Commission by other Federal agencies for 
administrative or salary offset shall be in writing and forwarded to the 
Financial Operations Center, FCC, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20554.
    (b) Requests by the Commission to other Federal agencies holding 
funds payable to the debtor will be in writing and forwarded, certified 
return receipt, as specified by that agency in its regulations. If the 
agency's rules governing this matter are not readily available or 
identifiable, the request will be submitted to that agency's office of 
legal counsel with a request that it be processed in accordance with 
their internal procedures.
    (c) Requests to and from the Commission shall be accompanied by a 
certification that the debtor owes the debt (including the amount) and 
that the procedures for administrative or salary offset contained in 
this subpart, or comparable procedures prescribed by the requesting 
agency, have been fully complied with. The Commission will cooperate 
with other agencies in effecting collection.
    (d) Requests to and from the Commission shall be processed within 30 
calendar days of receipt. If such processing is impractical or not 
feasible,

[[Page 356]]

notice to extend the time period for another 30 calendar days will be 
forwarded 10 calendar days prior to the expiration of the first 30-day 
period.

Sec. 1.2002  Applicants required to submit information.

    (a) In order to be eligible for any new, modified, and/or renewed 
instrument of authorization from the Commission, including but not 
limited to, authorizations issued pursuant to sections 214, 301, 302, 
303(1), 308, 310(d), 318, 319, 325(b), 351, 361(b), 362(b), 381, and 385 
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, by whatever name that 
instrument may be designated, all applicants shall certify that neither 
the applicant nor any party to the application is subject to a denial of 
Federal benefits that includes FCC benefits pursuant to section 5301 of 
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. 21 U.S.C. 862. If a section 5301 
certification has been incorporated into the FCC application form being 
filed, the applicant need not submit a separate certification. If a 
section 5301 certification has not been incorporated into the FCC 
application form being filed, the applicant shall be deemed to have 
certified by signing the application, unless an exhibit is included 
stating that the signature does not constitute such a certification and 
explaining why the applicant is unable to certify. If no FCC application 
form is involved, the applicant must attach a certification to its 
written application. If the applicant is unable to so certify, the 
applicant shall be ineligible for the authorization for which it 
applied, and will have 90 days from the filing of the application to 
comply with this rule. If a section 5301 certification has been 
incorporated into the FCC application form, failure to respond to the 
question concerning certification shall result in dismissal of the 
application pursuant to the relevant processing rules.
    (b) A party to the application, as used in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall include:
    (1) If the applicant is an individual, that individual;
    (2) If the applicant is a corporation or unincorporated association, 
all officers, directors, or persons holding 5% or more of the 
outstanding stock or shares (voting and/or non-voting) of the applicant; 
and
    (3) If the applicant is a partnership, all non-limited partners and 
any limited partners holding a 5% or more interest in the partnership.
    (c) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are not 
applicable to the Amateur Radio Service, the Citizens Band Radio 
Service, the Radio Control Radio Service, to users in the Public Mobile 
Services and the Private Radio Services that are not individually 
licensed by the Commission, or to Federal, State or local governmental 
entities or subdivisions thereof.
    (d) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are 
applicable to spectrum lessees (see Sec. 1.9003 of subpart X of this 
part) engaged in spectrum manager leasing arrangements and de facto 
transfer leasing arrangements pursuant to the rules set forth in subpart 
X of this part.

                           General Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 1.2101  Purpose.

[59 FR 44293, Aug. 26, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 40718, Aug. 9, 1995; 62 
FR 23163, Apr. 29, 1997; 63 FR 10780, Mar. 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1.2103  Competitive bidding design options.

    (a) The Commission will choose from one or more of the following 
types of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to 
competitive bidding:
    (1) Simultaneous multiple-round auctions (using remote or on-site 
electronic bidding);
    (2) Sequential multiple round auctions (using either oral ascending 
or remote and/or on-site electronic bidding);
    (3) Sequential or simultaneous single-round auctions (using either 
sealed paper or remote and/or on-site electronic bidding); and
    (4) Combinatorial (package) bidding auctions.
    (b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow 
bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses or 
authorizations, in addition to bids on individual licenses or 
authorizations. The Commission may require that to be declared the high 
bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a 
specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be used with any type of 
auction. The Commission may also allow bidders to submit contingent bids 
on individual and/or combinations of licenses.
    (1) Apportioned package bid. The apportioned package bid on a 
license is an estimate of the price of an individual license included in 
a package of licenses in an auction with combinatorial (package) 
bidding. Apportioned package bids shall be determined by the Commission 
according to a methodology it establishes in advance of each auction 
with combinatorial bidding.
    (2) Substitute for bid amount. The apportioned package bid on a 
license included in a package shall be used in place of the amount of an 
individual bid on that license when the bid amount is needed to 
determine the size of a designated entity bidding credit (see Sec. 
1.2110(f)(1) and (f)(2)), a new entrant bidding credit (see Sec. 
73.5007), a bid withdrawal or default payment obligation (see Sec. 
1.2104(g)), a tribal land bidding credit limit (see Sec. 
1.2110(f)(3)(iv)), or a size-based bidding credit unjust enrichment 
payment obligation (see Sec. 1.2111(d), (e)(2) and (e)(3)), or for any 
other determination required by the Commission's rules or procedures.
    (c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine 
bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the 
highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This 
technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction.
    (d) The Commission may use real time bidding in all electronic 
auction designs.

[59 FR 44293, Aug. 26, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 13542, Mar. 21, 1997; 
63 FR 2341, Jan. 15, 1998; 68 FR 42995, July 21, 2003; 71 FR 6226, Feb. 
7, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 1.2104  Competitive bidding mechanisms.

    (a) Sequencing. The Commission will establish the sequence in which 
multiple licenses will be auctioned.
    (b) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous 
multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the

[[Page 360]]

Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned 
simultaneously or in combination.
    (c) Reserve Price. The Commission may establish a reserve price or 
prices, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license or 
licenses subject to auction will not be awarded. For any auction of 
eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 
U.S.C. 923(g)(2)) requiring the recovery of estimated relocation costs, 
the Commission will establish a reserve price or prices pursuant to 
which the total cash proceeds from any auction of eligible frequencies 
shall equal at least 110 percent of the total estimated relocation costs 
provided to the Commission by the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act (47 
U.S.C. 923(g)(4)).
    (d) Minimum Bid Increments, Minimum Opening Bids and Maximum Bid 
Increments. The Commission may, by announcement before or during an 
auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms. 
The Commission also may establish minimum opening bids and maximum bid 
increments on a service-specific basis.
    (e) Stopping Rules. The Commission may establish stopping rules 
before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate the 
auctions within a reasonable time.
    (f) Activity Rules. The Commission may establish activity rules 
which require a minimum amount of bidding activity.
    (g) Withdrawal, Default and Disqualification Payment. As specified 
below, when the Commission conducts an auction pursuant to Sec. 1.2103, 
the Commission will impose payments on bidders who withdraw high bids 
during the course of an auction, or who default on payments due after an 
auction closes or who are disqualified.
    (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder that 
withdraws a bid during the course of an auction is subject to a 
withdrawal payment equal to the difference between the amount of the 
withdrawn bid and the amount of the winning bid in the same or 
subsequent auction(s). In the event that a bidding credit applies to any 
of the bids, the bid withdrawal payment is either the difference between 
the net withdrawn bid and the subsequent net winning bid, or the 
difference between the gross withdrawn bid and the subsequent gross 
winning bid, whichever is less. No withdrawal payment will be assessed 
for a withdrawn bid if either the subsequent winning bid or any of the 
intervening subsequent withdrawn bids equals or exceeds that withdrawn 
bid. The withdrawal payment amount is deducted from any upfront payments 
or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has deposited with the 
Commission. In the case of multiple bid withdrawals on a single license, 
the payment for each bid withdrawal will be calculated based on the 
sequence of bid withdrawals and the amounts withdrawn in the same or 
subsequent auction(s). In the event that a license for which there have 
been withdrawn bids subject to withdrawal payments is not won in the 
same auction, those bidders for which a final withdrawal payment cannot 
be calculated will be assessed an interim bid withdrawal payment of 
between 3 and 20 percent of their withdrawn bids, according to a 
percentage (or percentages) established by the Commission in advance of 
the auction. The interim bid withdrawal payment will be applied toward 
any final bid withdrawal payment that will be assessed at the close of a 
subsequent auction of the corresponding license.

    Example 1 to paragraph (g)(1). Bidder A withdraws a bid of $100. 
Subsequently, Bidder B places a bid of $90 and withdraws. In that same 
auction, Bidder C wins the license at a bid of $95. Withdrawal payments 
are assessed as follows: Bidder A owes $5 ($100-$95). Bidder B owes 
nothing.
    Example 2 to paragraph (g)(1). Bidder A withdraws a bid of $100. 
Subsequently, Bidder B places a bid of $95 and withdraws. In that same 
auction, Bidder C wins the license at a bid of $90. Withdrawal payments 
are assessed as follows: Bidder A owes $5 ($100-$95). Bidder B owes $5 
($95-$90).
    Example 3 to paragraph (g)(1). Bidder A withdraws a bid of $100. 
Subsequently, in that same auction, Bidder B places a bid of $90 and 
withdraws. In a subsequent auction, Bidder C places a bid of $95 and 
withdraws. Bidder D wins the license in that auction at a bid of $80. 
Assuming that the Commission

[[Page 361]]

established an interim bid withdrawal payment of 3 percent in advance of 
the first auction, withdrawal payments are assessed as follows: At the 
end of the first auction, Bidder A and Bidder B are each assessed an 
interim withdrawal payment equal to 3 percent of their withdrawn bids 
pending Commission assessment of a final withdrawal payment (Bidder A 
would owe 3% of $100, or $3, and Bidder B would owe 3% of $90, or 
$2.70). At the end of the second auction, Bidder A would owe $5 ($100-
$95) less the $3 interim withdrawal payment for a total of $2. Because 
Bidder C placed a subsequent bid that was higher than Bidder B's $90 
bid, Bidder B would owe nothing. Bidder C would owe $15 ($95-$80).

    (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. A bidder 
assumes a binding obligation to pay its full bid amount upon acceptance 
of the winning bid at the close of an auction. If a bidder defaults or 
is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting 
bidder will be subject to a default payment consisting of a deficiency 
payment, described in Sec. 1.2104(g)(2)(i), and an additional payment, 
described in Sec. 1.2104(g)(2)(ii) and (g)(2)(iii). The default payment 
will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the 
defaulting bidder has deposited with the Commission.
    (i) Deficiency payment. The deficiency payment will equal the 
difference between the amount of the defaulted bid and the amount of the 
winning bid in a subsequent auction, so long as there have been no 
intervening withdrawn bids that equal or exceed the defaulted bid or the 
subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid or any intervening 
subsequent withdrawn bid equals or exceeds the defaulted bid, no 
deficiency payment will be assessed. If there have been intervening 
subsequent withdrawn bids that are lower than the defaulted bid and 
higher than the subsequent winning bid, but no intervening withdrawn 
bids that equal or exceed the defaulted bid, the deficiency payment will 
equal the difference between the amount of the defaulted bid and the 
amount of the highest intervening subsequent withdrawn bid. In the event 
that a bidding credit applies to any of the applicable bids, the 
deficiency payment will be based solely on net bids or solely on gross 
bids, whichever results in a lower payment.
    (ii) Additional payment--applicable percentage. When the default or 
disqualification follows an auction without combinatorial bidding, the 
additional payment will equal between 3 and 20 percent of the applicable 
bid, according to a percentage (or percentages) established by the 
Commission in advance of the auction. When the default or 
disqualification follows an auction with combinatorial bidding, the 
additional payment will equal 25 percent of the applicable bid.
    (iii) Additional payment--applicable bid. When no deficiency payment 
is assessed, the applicable bid will be the net amount of the defaulted 
bid. When a deficiency payment is assessed, the applicable bid will be 
the subsequent winning bid, using the same basis--i.e., net or gross--as 
was used in calculating the deficiency payment.
    (h) The Commission will generally release information concerning the 
identities of bidders before each auction but may choose, on an auction-
by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of the bidders associated 
with bidder identification numbers.
    (i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the 
event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, evidence of security 
breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any 
other reason that affects the fair and efficient conduct of the 
competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole 
discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the 
beginning of the current or some previous round or cancel the 
competitive bidding in its entirety.
    (j) Bid apportionment. The Commission may specify a method for 
apportioning a bid among portions of the license (i.e., portions of the 
license's service area or bandwidth, or both) when necessary to compare 
a bid on the original license or portions thereof with a bid on a 
corresponding reconfigured license for purposes of the Commission's 
rules or procedures, such as

[[Page 362]]

to calculate a bid withdrawal or default payment obligation in 
connection with the bid.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2105  Bidding application and certification procedures; prohibition of certain communications.

    (a) Submission of Short-Form Application (FCC Form 175). In order to 
be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit a short-form 
application (FCC Form 175), together with any appropriate upfront 
payment set forth by Public Notice. Beginning January 1, 1999, all 
short-form applications must be filed electronically.
    (1) All short-form applications will be due:
    (i) On the date(s) specified by public notice; or
    (ii) In the case of application filing dates which occur 
automatically by operation of law (see, e.g., 47 CFR 22.902), on a date 
specified by public notice after the Commission has reviewed the 
applications that have been filed on those dates and determined that 
mutual exclusivity exists.
    (2) The short-form application must contain the following 
information:
    (i) Identification of each license on which the applicant wishes to 
bid;
    (ii)(A) The applicant's name, if the applicant is an individual. If 
the applicant is a corporation, then the short-form application will 
require the name and address of the corporate office and the name and 
title of an officer or director. If the applicant is a partnership, then 
the application will require the name, citizenship and address of all 
general partners, and, if a partner is not a natural person, then the 
name and title of a responsible person should be included as well. If 
the applicant is a trust, then the name and address of the trustee will 
be required. If the applicant is none of the above, then it must 
identify and describe itself and its principals or other responsible 
persons; and
    (B) Applicant ownership and other information, as set forth in Sec. 
1.2112.
    (iii) The identity of the person(s) authorized to make or withdraw a 
bid;
    (iv) If the applicant applies as a designated entity pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110, a statement to that effect and a declaration, under 
penalty of perjury, that the applicant is qualified as a designated 
entity under Sec. 1.2110.
    (v) Certification that the applicant is legally, technically, 
financially and otherwise qualified pursuant to section 308(b) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission will accept 
applications certifying that a request for waiver or other relief from 
the requirements of section 310 is pending;
    (vi) Certification that the applicant is in compliance with the 
foreign ownership provisions of section 310 of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended;
    (vii) Certification that the applicant is and will, during the 
pendency of its application(s), remain in compliance with any service-
specific qualifications applicable to the licenses on which the 
applicant intends to bid including, but not limited to, financial 
qualifications. The Commission may require certification in certain 
services that the applicant will, following grant of a license, come 
into compliance with certain service-specific rules, including, but not 
limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;
    (viii) An exhibit, certified as truthful under penalty of perjury, 
identifying all parties with whom the applicant has entered into 
partnerships, joint ventures, consortia or other agreements, 
arrangements or understandings of any kind relating to the licenses 
being auctioned, including any such agreements relating to the post-
auction market structure.
    (ix) Certification under penalty of perjury that it has not entered 
and will not enter into any explicit or implicit agreements, 
arrangements or understandings of any kind with any parties other than 
those identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii) regarding the amount 
of their bids, bidding strategies or the particular licenses on which 
they will or will not bid.
    (x) Certification that the applicant is not in default on any 
Commission licenses and that it is not delinquent on any non-tax debt 
owed to any Federal agency.

[[Page 363]]

    (xi) An attached statement made under penalty of perjury indicating 
whether or not the applicant has ever been in default on any Commission 
license or has ever been delinquent on any non-tax debt owed to any 
Federal agency.

    Note to paragraph (a): The Commission may also request applicants to 
submit additional information for informational purposes to aid in its 
preparation of required reports to Congress.

    (b) Modification and Dismissal of Short-Form Application (FCC Form 
175). (1) Any short-form application (FCC Form 175) that does not 
contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this section is 
unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected subsequent to the 
applicable filing deadline. The application will be dismissed with 
prejudice and the upfront payment, if paid, will be returned.
    (2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to 
cure defects specified herein (except for failure to sign the 
application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected 
application. During the resubmission period for curing defects, a short-
form application may be amended or modified to cure defects identified 
by the Commission or to make minor amendments or modifications. After 
the resubmission period has ended, a short-form application may be 
amended or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the 
application. Major amendments cannot be made to a short-form application 
after the initial filing deadline. Major amendments include changes in 
ownership of the applicant that would constitute an assignment or 
transfer of control, changes in an applicant's size which would affect 
eligibility for designated entity provisions, and changes in the license 
service areas identified on the short-form application on which the 
applicant intends to bid. Minor amendments include, but are not limited 
to, the correction of typographical errors and other minor defects not 
identified as major. An application will be considered to be newly filed 
if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after 
applicable filing deadlines.
    (3) Applicants who fail to correct defects in their applications in 
a timely manner as specified by public notice will have their 
applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission.
    (4) Applicants shall have a continuing obligation to make any 
amendments or modifications that are necessary to maintain the accuracy 
and completeness of information furnished in pending applications. Such 
amendments or modifications shall be made as promptly as possible, and 
in no case more than five business days after applicants become aware of 
the need to make any amendment or modification, or five business days 
after the reportable event occurs, whichever is later. An applicant's 
obligation to make such amendments or modifications to a pending 
application continues until they are made.
    (c) Prohibition of certain communications. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section, after the short-
form application filing deadline, all applicants for licenses in any of 
the same geographic license areas are prohibited from cooperating or 
collaborating with respect to, discussing with each other, or disclosing 
to each other in any manner the substance of their own, or each other's, 
or any other competing applicants' bids or bidding strategies, or 
discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, until after the down 
payment deadline, unless such applicants are members of a bidding 
consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's 
short-form application pursuant to Sec. 1.2105(a)(2)(viii).
    (2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect 
formation of consortia or changes in ownership at any time before or 
during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in 
control of the applicant, and provided that the parties forming 
consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for 
licenses in any of the same geographic license areas. Such changes will 
not be considered major modifications of the application.

[[Page 364]]

    (3) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make 
agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided the parties to the 
agreement have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic 
license areas.
    (4) After the filing of short-form applications, a holder of a non-
controlling attributable interest in an entity submitting a short-form 
application may acquire an ownership interest in, form a consortium 
with, or enter into a joint bidding arrangement with, other applicants 
for licenses in the same geographic license area, provided that:
    (i) The attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission 
that it has not communicated and will not communicate with any party 
concerning the bids or bidding strategies of more than one of the 
applicants in which it holds an attributable interest, or with which it 
has a consortium or joint bidding arrangement, and which have applied 
for licenses in the same geographic license area(s); and
    (ii) The arrangements do not result in any change in control of an 
applicant; or
    (iii) When an applicant has withdrawn from the auction, is no longer 
placing bids and has no further eligibility, a holder of a non-
controlling, attributable interest in such an applicant may obtain an 
ownership interest in or enter into a consortium with another applicant 
for a license in the same geographic service area, provided that the 
attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission that it did not 
communicate with the new applicant prior to the date that the original 
applicant withdrew from the auction.
    (5) Applicants must modify their short-form applications to reflect 
any changes in ownership or in membership of consortia or joint bidding 
arrangements.
    (6) Any applicant that makes or receives a communication of bids or 
bidding strategies prohibited under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall report such communication in writing to the Commission 
immediately, and in no case later than five business days after the 
communication occurs. An applicant's obligation to make such a report 
continues until the report has been made. Such reports shall be filed as 
directed in public notices detailing procedures for the bidding that was 
the subject of the reported communication. If no public notice provides 
direction, such notices shall be filed with the Chief of the Auctions 
and Spectrum Access Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, by the 
most expeditious means available.
    (7) For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) The term applicant shall include all controlling interests in 
the entity submitting a short-form application to participate in an 
auction (FCC Form 175), as well as all holders of partnership and other 
ownership interests and any stock interest amounting to 10 percent or 
more of the entity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of 
the entity submitting a short-form application, and all officers and 
directors of that entity; and
    (ii) The term bids or bidding strategies shall include capital calls 
or requests for additional funds in support of bids or bidding 
strategies.

    Example: Company A is an applicant in area 1. Company B and Company 
C each own 10 percent of Company A. Company D is an applicant in area 1, 
area 2, and area 3. Company C is an applicant in area 3. Without 
violating the Commission's Rules, Company B can enter into a consortium 
arrangement with Company D or acquire an ownership interest in Company D 
if Company B certifies either (1) that it has communicated with and will 
communicate neither with Company A or anyone else concerning Company A's 
bids or bidding strategy, nor with Company C or anyone else concerning 
Company C's bids or bidding strategy, or (2) that it has not 
communicated with and will not communicate with Company D or anyone else 
concerning Company D's bids or bidding strategy.

Sec. 1.2106  Submission of upfront payments.

    (a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to 
competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment. In that event, the 
amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will 
be set forth

[[Page 365]]

in a Public Notice. Any auction applicant that has previously been in 
default on any Commission license or has previously been delinquent on 
any non-tax debt owed to any Federal agency must submit an upfront 
payment equal to 50 percent more than that set for each particular 
license. No interest will be paid on upfront payments.
    (b) Upfront payments must be made by wire transfer in U.S. dollars 
from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal 
Communications Commission.
    (c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's 
Rules, or if insufficient funds are tendered to constitute a valid 
upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to 
correct its submission to bring it up to the minimum valid upfront 
payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least 
the minimum upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its 
application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made will 
be returned.
    (d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any 
down payment required for licenses on which the bidder is the high 
bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of 
a winning bidder, the Commission may refund the excess amount after 
determining that no bid withdrawal penalties are owed by that bidder.
    (e) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d), in the event 
a penalty is assessed pursuant to Sec. 1.2104 for bid withdrawal or 
default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the 
Commission will be used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or default penalty 
before being applied toward any additional payment obligations that the 
high bidder may have.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2107  Submission of down payment and filing of long-form applications.

    (a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify 
the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified by public notice, within ten (10) 
business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a 
particular license(s), a high bidder must submit to the Commission's 
lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are 
necessary to bring its total deposits (not including upfront payments 
applied to satisfy bid withdrawal or default payments) up to twenty (20) 
percent of its high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions 
conducted under Sec. 1.2103, however, bidders may be required to submit 
their down payments with their bids.) Unless otherwise specified by 
public notice, this down payment must be made by wire transfer in U.S. 
dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the 
Federal Communications Commission. Down payments will be held by the 
Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the license and has 
paid the remaining balance due on the license or authorization, in which 
case it will not be returned, or until the winning bidder is found 
unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which case it will be 
returned, less applicable payments. No interest on any down payment will 
be paid to the bidders.
    (c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a 
timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after being notified 
that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-
form application'') pursuant to the rules governing the service in which 
the applicant is the high bidder. Notwithstanding any other provision in 
title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, high 
bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with their 
long-form applications. Specific procedures for filing applications will 
be set out by Public Notice. Ownership disclosure requirements are set 
forth in Sec. 1.2112. Beginning January 1, 1999, all long-form 
applications must be filed electronically. An applicant that fails to 
submit the required long-form application

[[Page 366]]

under this paragraph and fails to establish good cause for any late-
filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be subject 
to the payments set forth in Sec. 1.2104.
    (d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must 
provide a detailed explanation of the terms and conditions and parties 
involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other 
agreement or arrangement it had entered into relating to the competitive 
bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements 
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form 
applications pursuant to Sec. 1.2105.
    (e) A winning bidder that seeks a bidding credit to serve a 
qualifying tribal land, as defined in Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(i), within a 
particular market must indicate on the long-form application (FCC Form 
601) that it intends to serve a qualifying tribal land within that 
market.
    (f) An applicant must also submit FCC Form 602 (see Sec. 1.919 of 
this chapter) with its long form application (FCC Form 601).
    (g)(1)(i) A consortium participating in competitive bidding pursuant 
to Sec. 1.2110(b)(3)(i) that is a winning bidder may not apply as a 
consortium for licenses covered by the winning bids. Individual members 
of the consortium or new legal entities comprising individual consortium 
members may apply for the licenses covered by the winning bids of the 
consortium. An individual member of the consortium or a new legal entity 
comprising two or more individual consortium members applying for a 
license pursuant to this provision shall be the applicant for purposes 
of all related requirements and filings, such as filing FCC Form 602. 
However, the members filing separate long-form applications shall all 
use the consortium's FCC Registration Number (``FRN'') on their long-
form applications. An application by an individual consortium member or 
a new legal entity comprising two or more individual consortium members 
for a license covered by the winning bids of the consortium shall not 
constitute a major modification of the application or a change in 
control of the applicant for purposes of Commission rules governing the 
application.
    (ii) Within ten business days after release of the public notice 
announcing grant of a long-form application, that licensee must update 
its filings in the Commission's Universal Licensing System (``ULS'') to 
substitute its individual FRN for that of the consortium.
    (2) The continuing eligibility for size-based benefits, such as 
size-based bidding credits or set-aside licenses, of a newly formed 
legal entity comprising two or more individual consortium members will 
be based on the size of such newly formed entity as of the filing of its 
long-form application.
    (3) Members of a consortium intending to partition or disaggregate 
license(s) among individual members or new legal entities comprising two 
or more individual consortium members must select one member or one new 
legal entity comprising two or more individual consortium members to 
apply for the license(s). The applicant must include in its 
applications, as part of the explanation of terms and conditions 
provided pursuant to Sec. 1.2107(d), the agreement of the applicable 
parties to partition or disaggregate the relevant license(s). Upon grant 
of the long-form application for that license, the licensee must then 
apply to partition or disaggregate the license pursuant to those terms 
and conditions.

Sec. 1.2108  Procedures for filing petitions to deny against long-form applications.

    (a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act 
or the commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific procedures 
for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the 
Commission's Rules, the procedures in this section shall apply to the 
filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning 
bidders.
    (b) Within a period specified by Public Notice and after the 
Commission by Public Notice announces that long-

[[Page 367]]

form applications have been accepted for filing, petitions to deny such 
applications may be filed. The period for filing petitions to deny shall 
be no more than ten (10) days. The appropriate licensing Bureau, within 
its discretion, may, in exigent circumstances, reduce this period of 
time to no less than five (5) days. Any such petitions must contain 
allegations of fact supported by affidavit of a person or persons with 
personal knowledge thereof.
    (c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and 
the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations of fact or 
denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons 
with personal knowledge thereof. The time for filing such oppositions 
shall be at least five (5) days from the filing date for petitions to 
deny, and the time for filing replies shall be at least five (5) days 
from the filing date for oppositions. The Commission may grant a license 
based on any long-form application that has been accepted for filing. 
The Commission shall in no case grant licenses earlier than seven (7) 
days following issuance of a public notice announcing long-form 
applications have been accepted for filing.
    (d) If the Commission determines that:
    (1) An applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and 
material issue of fact concerning that determination, it will grant the 
application.
    (2) An applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial 
issue of fact concerning that determination, the Commission need not 
hold an evidentiary hearing and will deny the application.
    (3) Substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it 
will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit all or part of the 
evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other 
than administrative law judges to preside at the taking of written 
evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2109  License grant, denial, default, and disqualification.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified by public notice, auction winners are 
required to pay the balance of their winning bids in a lump sum within 
ten (10) business days following the release of a public notice 
establishing the payment deadline. If a winning bidder fails to pay the 
balance of its winning bids in a lump sum by the applicable deadline as 
specified by the Commission, it will be allowed to make payment within 
ten (10) business days after the payment deadline, provided that it also 
pays a late fee equal to five percent of the amount due. When a winning 
bidder fails to pay the balance of its winning bid by the late payment 
deadline, it is considered to be in default on its license(s) and 
subject to the applicable default payments. Licenses will be awarded 
upon the full and timely payment of winning bids and any applicable late 
fees.
    (b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has 
declared competitive bidding closed or fails to remit the required down 
payment within ten (10) business days after the Commission has declared 
competitive bidding closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, 
its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the default 
payment specified in Sec. Sec. 1.2104(g)(2) or 1.2104(g)(3), whichever 
is applicable. In such event, the Commission, at its discretion, may 
either re-auction the license(s) to existing or new applicants or offer 
it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final 
bids. If the license(s) is offered to the other highest bidders (in 
descending order), the down payment obligations set forth in Sec. 
1.2107(b) will apply. However, in combinatorial bidding auctions, the 
Commission will only re-auction the license(s) to existing or new 
applicants. The Commission will not offer the package or licenses to the 
next highest bidder.
    (c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, 
fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely manner, or 
defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the 
required down payment, will be deemed to have defaulted, its application 
will be dismissed, and it will be

[[Page 368]]

liable for the payment set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.2104(g)(2) or 
1.2104(g)(3), whichever is applicable. In such event, the Commission may 
either re-auction the license(s) to existing or new applicants or offer 
it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final 
bids. However, in combinatorial bidding auctions, the Commission will 
only re-auction the license(s) to existing or new applicants. The 
Commission will not offer the package or licenses to the next highest 
bidder.
    (d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the 
Commission's rules in connection with their participation in the 
competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other 
applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of their upfront payment, down 
payment or full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in 
future auctions.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2110  Designated entities.

    (a) Designated entities are small businesses, businesses owned by 
members of minority groups and/or women, and rural telephone companies.
    (b) Eligibility for small business and entrepreneur provisions--(1) 
Size attribution. (i) The gross revenues of the applicant (or licensee), 
its affiliates, its controlling interests, the affiliates of its 
controlling interests, and the entities with which it has an 
attributable material relationship shall be attributed to the applicant 
(or licensee) and considered on a cumulative basis and aggregated for 
purposes of determining whether the applicant (or licensee) is eligible 
for status as a small business, very small business, or entrepreneur, as 
those terms are defined in the service-specific rules. An applicant 
seeking status as a small business, very small business, or 
entrepreneur, as those terms are defined in the service-specific rules, 
must disclose on its short- and long-form applications, separately and 
in the aggregate, the gross revenues for each of the previous three 
years of the applicant (or licensee), its affiliates, its controlling 
interests, the affiliates of its controlling interests, and the entities 
with which it has an attributable material relationship.
    (ii) If applicable, pursuant to Sec. 24.709 of this chapter, the 
total assets of the applicant (or licensee), its affiliates, its 
controlling interests, the affiliates of its controlling interests, and 
the entities with which it has an attributable material relationship 
shall be attributed to the applicant (or licensee) and considered on a 
cumulative basis and aggregated for purposes of determining whether the 
applicant (or licensee) is eligible for status as an entrepreneur. An 
applicant seeking status as an entrepreneur must disclose on its short- 
and long-form applications, separately and in the aggregate, the gross 
revenues for each of the previous two years of the applicant (or 
licensee), its affiliates, its controlling interests, the affiliates of 
its controlling interests, and the entities with which it has an 
attributable material relationship.
    (2) Aggregation of affiliate interests. Persons or entities that 
hold interests in an applicant (or licensee) that are affiliates of each 
other or have an identity of interests identified in Sec. 
1.2110(c)(5)(iii) will be treated as though they were one person or 
entity and their ownership interests aggregated for purposes of 
determining an applicant's (or licensee's) compliance with the 
requirements of this section.

    Example 1 to paragraph (b)(2): ABC Corp. is owned by individuals, A, 
B and C, each having an equal one-third voting interest in ABC Corp. A 
and B together, with two-thirds of the stock have the power to control 
ABC Corp. and have an identity of interest. If A&B invest in DE Corp., a 
broadband PCS applicant for block C, A and B's separate interests in DE 
Corp. must be aggregated because A and B are to be treated as one person 
or entity.
    Example 2 to paragraph (b)(2): ABC Corp. has subsidiary BC Corp., of 
which it holds a controlling 51 percent of the stock. If ABC Corp. and 
BC Corp., both invest in DE Corp., their separate interests in DE Corp. 
must be aggregated because ABC Corp. and BC Corp. are affiliates of each 
other.

    (3) Exceptions--(i) Consortium. Where an applicant to participate in 
bidding for Commission licenses or permits is a consortium either of 
entities eligible for size-based bidding credits an/or for closed 
bidding based on gross revenues and/or total assets, the gross revenues

[[Page 369]]

and/or total assets of each consortium member shall not be aggregated. 
Each consortium member must constitute a separate and distinct legal 
entity to qualify for this exception. Consortia that are winning bidders 
using this exception must comply with the requirements of Sec. 
1.2107(g) of this chapter as a condition of license grant.
    (ii) Applicants without identifiable controlling interests. Where an 
applicant (or licensee) cannot identify controlling interests under the 
standards set forth in this section, the gross revenues of all interest 
holders in the applicant, and their affiliates, will be attributable.
    (iii) Rural telephone cooperatives. (A)(1) An applicant will be 
exempt from Sec. 1.2110(c)(2)(ii)(F) for the purpose of attribution in 
Sec. 1.2110(b)(1), if the applicant or a controlling interest in the 
applicant, as the case may be, meets all of the following conditions:
    (i) The applicant (or the controlling interest) is organized as a 
cooperative pursuant to state law;
    (ii) The applicant (or the controlling interest) is a ``rural 
telephone company'' as defined by the Communications Act; and
    (iii) The applicant (or the controlling interest) demonstrates 
either that it is eligible for tax-exempt status under the Internal 
Revenue Code or that it adheres to the cooperative principles 
articulated in Puget Sound Plywood, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, 44 T.C. 305 (1965).
    (2) If the condition in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(1)(i) above cannot 
be met because the relevant jurisdiction has not enacted an organic 
statute that specifies requirements for organization as a cooperative, 
the applicant must show that it is validly organized and its articles of 
incorporation, by-laws, and/or other relevant organic documents provide 
that it operates pursuant to cooperative principles.
    (B) However, if the applicant is not an eligible rural telephone 
cooperative under paragraph (a) of this section, and the applicant has a 
controlling interest other than the applicant's officers and directors 
or an eligible rural telephone cooperative's officers and directors, 
paragraph (a) of this section applies with respect to the applicant's 
officers and directors and such controlling interest's officers and 
directors only when such controlling interest is either:
    (1) An eligible rural telephone cooperative under paragraph (a) of 
this section or
    (2) controlled by an eligible rural telephone cooperative under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (iv) Applicants or licensees with material relationships--(A) 
Impermissible material relationships. An applicant or licensee that 
would otherwise be eligible for designated entity benefits under this 
section and applicable service-specific rules shall be ineligible for 
such benefits if the applicant or licensee has an impermissible material 
relationship. An applicant or licensee has an impermissible material 
relationship when it has arrangements with one or more entities for the 
lease or resale (including under a wholesale agreement) of, on a 
cumulative basis, more than 50 percent of the spectrum capacity of any 
one of the applicant's or licensee's licenses.
    (B) Attributable material relationships. An applicant or licensee 
must attribute the gross revenues (and, if applicable, the total assets) 
of any entity, (including the controlling interests, affiliates, and 
affiliates of the controlling interests of that entity) with which the 
applicant or licensee has an attributable material relationship. An 
applicant or licensee has an attributable material relationship when it 
has one or more arrangements with any individual entity for the lease or 
resale (including under a wholesale agreement) of, on a cumulative 
basis, more than 25 percent of the spectrum capacity of any one of the 
applicant's or licensee's licenses.
    (C) Grandfathering--(1) Licensees. An impermissible or attributable 
material relationship shall not disqualify a licensee for previously 
awarded benefits with respect to a license awarded before April 25, 
2006, based on spectrum lease or resale (including wholesale) 
arrangements entered into before April 25, 2006.
    (2) Applicants. An impermissible or attributable material 
relationship shall not disqualify an applicant seeking eligibility in an 
application for a license, authorization, assignment, or

[[Page 370]]

transfer of control or for partitioning or disaggregation filed before 
April 25, 2006, based on spectrum lease or resale (including wholesale) 
arrangements entered into before April 25, 2006. Any applicant seeking 
eligibility in an application for a license, authorization, assignment, 
or transfer of control or for partitioning or disaggregation filed after 
April 25, 2006, or in an application to participate in an auction in 
which bidding begins on or after June 5, 2006, need not attribute the 
material relationship(s) of those entities that are its affiliates based 
solely on Sec. 1.2110(c)(5)(i)(C) if those affiliates entered into such 
material relationship(s) before April 25, 2006, and are subject to a 
contractual prohibition preventing them from contributing to the 
applicant's total financing.

    Example to paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(2): Newco is an applicant seeking 
designated entity status in an auction in which bidding begins after the 
effective date of the rules. Investor is a controlling interest of 
Newco. Investor also is a controlling interest of Existing DE. Existing 
DE previously was awarded designated entity benefits and has 
impermissible material relationships based on leasing agreements entered 
into before April 25, 2006, with a third party, Lessee, that were in 
compliance with the Commission's designated eligibility standards prior 
to April 25, 2006. In this example, Newco would not be prohibited from 
acquiring designated entity benefits solely because of the existing 
impermissible material relationships of its affiliate, Existing DE. 
Newco, Investor, and Existing DE, however, would need to enter into a 
contractual prohibition that prevents Existing DE from contributing to 
the total financing of Newco.

    (c) Definitions--(1) Small businesses. The Commission will establish 
the definition of a small business on a service-specific basis, taking 
into consideration the characteristics and capital requirements of the 
particular service.
    (2) Controlling interests. (i) For purposes of this section, 
controlling interest includes individuals or entities with either de 
jure or de facto control of the applicant. De jure control is evidenced 
by holdings of greater than 50 percent of the voting stock of a 
corporation, or in the case of a partnership, general partnership 
interests. De facto control is determined on a case-by-case basis. An 
entity must disclose its equity interest and demonstrate at least the 
following indicia of control to establish that it retains de facto 
control of the applicant:
    (A) The entity constitutes or appoints more than 50 percent of the 
board of directors or management committee;
    (B) The entity has authority to appoint, promote, demote, and fire 
senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the 
licensee; and
    (C) The entity plays an integral role in management decisions.
    (ii) Calculation of certain interests. (A) Fully diluted 
requirement. (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of 
this section, ownership interests shall be calculated on a fully diluted 
basis; all agreements such as warrants, stock options and convertible 
debentures will generally be treated as if the rights thereunder already 
have been fully exercised.
    (2) Rights of first refusal and put options shall not be calculated 
on a fully diluted basis for purposes of determining de jure control; 
however, rights of first refusal and put options shall be calculated on 
a fully diluted basis if such ownership interests, in combination with 
other terms to an agreement, deprive an otherwise qualified applicant or 
licensee of de facto control.

    Note to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A): Mutually exclusive contingent 
ownership interests, i.e., one or more ownership interests that, by 
their terms, are mutually exclusive of one or more other ownership 
interests, shall be calculated as having been fully exercised only in 
the possible combinations in which they can be exercised by their 
holder(s). A contingent ownership interest is mutually exclusive of 
another only if contractual language specifies that both interests 
cannot be held simultaneously as present ownership interests.

    (B) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock shall be 
attributed as specified.
    (C) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person 
who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person who has 
the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right 
to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the 
trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business relationship 
to

[[Page 371]]

the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests held in trust.
    (D) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity.
    (E) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (F) Officers and directors of the applicant shall be considered to 
have a controlling interest in the applicant. The officers and directors 
of an entity that controls a licensee or applicant shall be considered 
to have a controlling interest in the licensee or applicant. The 
personal net worth, including personal income of the officers and 
directors of an applicant, is not attributed to the applicant. To the 
extent that the officers and directors of an applicant are affiliates of 
other entities, the gross revenues of the other entities are attributed 
to the applicant.
    (G) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (H) Any person who manages the operations of an applicant or 
licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have 
a controlling interest in such applicant or licensee if such person, or 
its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in 
practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence:
    (1) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (2) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (3) The prices charged for such services.
    (I) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangement with an applicant or licensee, or its affiliate, shall be 
considered to have a controlling interest, if such applicant or 
licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence:
    (1) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (2) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (3) The prices charged for such services.
    (3) Businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women. 
Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific services, a 
business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in 
which minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens control the 
applicant, have at least greater than 50 percent equity ownership and, 
in the case of a corporate applicant, have a greater than 50 percent 
voting interest. For applicants that are partnerships, every general 
partner must be either a minority and/or woman (or minorities and/or 
women) who are U.S. citizens and who individually or together own at 
least 50 percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 
percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women who are U.S. 
citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on 
a fully diluted basis; agreements such as stock options and convertible 
debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to 
control an entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder 
already have been fully exercised. However, upon a demonstration that 
options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not 
deprive the minority and female principals of a substantial financial 
stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated 
entity, a designated entity may seek a waiver of the requirement that 
the equity of the minority and female principals must be calculated on a 
fully-diluted basis. The term minority includes individuals of Black or 
African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaskan Native,

[[Page 372]]

Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander extraction.
    (4) Rural telephone companies. A rural telephone company is any 
local exchange carrier operating entity to the extent that such entity--
    (i) Provides common carrier service to any local exchange carrier 
study area that does not include either:
    (A) Any incorporated place of 10,000 inhabitants or more, or any 
part thereof, based on the most recently available population statistics 
of the Bureau of the Census, or
    (B) Any territory, incorporated or unincorporated, included in an 
urbanized area, as defined by the Bureau of the Census as of August 10, 
1993;
    (ii) Provides telephone exchange service, including exchange access, 
to fewer than 50,000 access lines;
    (iii) Provides telephone exchange service to any local exchange 
carrier study area with fewer than 100,000 access lines; or
    (iv) Has less than 15 percent of its access lines in communities of 
more than 50,000 on the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act 
of 1996.
    (5) Affiliate. (i) An individual or entity is an affiliate of an 
applicant or of a person holding an attributable interest in an 
applicant if such individual or entity--
    (A) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the 
applicant, or
    (B) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or
    (C) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or parties 
that also controls or has the power to control the applicant, or
    (D) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
    (ii) Nature of control in determining affiliation.
    (A) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties 
who directly or indirectly control or have the power to control it. 
Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it 
is exercised so long as the power to control exists.

    Example. An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of 
another concern would have negative power to control such concern since 
such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the 
bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder with less than 50 
percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken by the other 
stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation exists when the applicant 
has the power to control a concern while at the same time another 
person, or persons, are in control of the concern at the will of the 
party or parties with the power to control.

    (B) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of 
director, officer or key employee positions; contractual or other 
business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key 
employee is an employee who, because of his/her position in the concern, 
has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations 
or management of the concern.
    (C) Control can arise through management positions where a concern's 
voting stock is so widely distributed that no effective control can be 
established.

    Example. In a corporation where the officers and directors own 
various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's 
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give 
him or her control or the power to control and the remaining 60 percent 
is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock 
interest greater than 10 percent, management has the power to control. 
If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons 
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be 
deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

    (iii) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation 
can arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of 
interest, such as members of the same family or persons with common 
investments. In determining if the applicant controls or has the power 
to control a concern, persons with an identity of interest will be 
treated as though they were one person.

    Example. Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable 
interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder has 
enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have 
the power to control Corporation Y. The two shareholders with these 
common investments (or identity in interest) are treated as though they 
are one person and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the 
applicant.


[[Page 373]]


    (A) Spousal affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control 
or have the power to control interests owned or controlled by either of 
them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a 
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. In calculating 
their net worth, investors who are legally separated must include their 
share of interests in property held jointly with a spouse.
    (B) Kinship affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed 
to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or 
controlled by other immediate family members. In this context 
``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-
in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother 
or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half brother or sister. This 
presumption may be rebutted by showing that the family members are 
estranged, the family ties are remote, or the family members are not 
closely involved with each other in business matters.

    Example. A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-
in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application. Because A 
and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in 
Corporation Y is attributable to B, and thus to the applicant, unless B 
rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

    (iv) Affiliation through stock ownership. (A) An applicant is 
presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she 
owns or controls or has the power to control 50 percent or more of its 
voting stock.
    (B) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control 
a concern even though he or she owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block 
of stock he or she owns, controls or has the power to control is large 
as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
    (C) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, such 
minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the 
aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other 
stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons 
individually controls or has the power to control the concern; however, 
such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power 
to control, in fact, does not exist.
    (v) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge. Except as set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are 
generally considered to have a present effect on the power to control 
the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, 
debentures, and agreements are generally treated as though the rights 
held thereunder had been exercised. However, an affiliate cannot use 
such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over 
another concern before it actually does so.

    Example 1 to paragraph (c)(5)(v). If company B holds an option to 
purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable 
interest in a PCS application, the situation is treated as though 
company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling 
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken 
into account in determining the size of the applicant.
    Example 2. If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 
outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an 
attributable interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, 
SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo, BigCo 
will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, 
until SmallCo actually exercises its option to purchase such shares. In 
order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which 
requires such options to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the 
option is not considered to have present effect in this case.
    Example 3. If company A has entered into an agreement to merge with 
company B in the future, the situation is treated as though the merger 
has taken place.

    Note to paragraph (c)(5)(v): Mutually exclusive contingent ownership 
interests, i.e., one or more ownership interests that, by their terms, 
are mutually exclusive of one or more other ownership interests, shall 
be calculated as having been fully exercised only in the possible 
combinations in which they

[[Page 374]]

can be exercised by their holder(s). A contingent ownership interest is 
mutually exclusive of another only if contractual language specifies 
that both interests cannot be held simultaneously as present ownership 
interests.

    (vi) Affiliation under voting trusts. (A) Stock interests held in 
trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the 
power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell 
such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at 
will or to replace the trustee at will.
    (B) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (C) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, 
is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of voting stock 
for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern 
in order that such concern or another concern may meet the Commission's 
size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this 
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the 
appropriate jurisdiction.
    (vii) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally 
arises where officers, directors, or key employees serve as the majority 
or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or 
the management of another entity.
    (viii) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally 
arises where one concern shares office space and/or employees and/or 
other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns 
are in the same or related industry or field of operations, or where 
such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing 
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other 
concern.
    (ix) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation 
generally arises where one concern is dependent upon another concern for 
contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or 
potential control, of the other concern.
    (x) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements. (A) A joint 
venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns 
and/or individuals, with interests in any degree or proportion, formed 
by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, 
specific business venture for joint profit for which purpose they 
combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but not on 
a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The 
determination whether an entity is a joint venture is based upon the 
facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business 
operation may be designated by the parties involved. An agreement to 
share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the 
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the 
business operation is a joint venture.
    (B) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated 
with each other. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to define 
a small business consortium, for purposes of determining status as a 
designated entity, as a joint venture under attribution standards 
provided in this section.
    (xi) Exclusion from affiliation coverage. For purposes of this 
section, Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations 
organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 
1601 et seq.), or entities owned and controlled by such tribes or 
corporations, are not considered affiliates of an applicant (or 
licensee) that is owned and controlled by such tribes, corporations or 
entities, and that otherwise complies with the requirements of this 
section, except that gross revenues derived from gaming activities 
conducted by affiliate entities pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) will be counted in determining such 
applicant's (or licensee's) compliance with the financial requirements 
of this section, unless such applicant establishes that it will not 
receive a substantial unfair competitive advantage because significant 
legal constraints restrict the applicant's ability to access such gross 
revenues.
    (6) Consortium. A consortium of small businesses, very small 
businesses, or

[[Page 375]]

entrepreneurs is a conglomerate organization composed of two or more 
entities, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small 
business, very small business, or entrepreneur, as those terms are 
defined in the service-specific rules. Each individual member must 
constitute a separate and distinct legal entity to qualify.
    (d) The Commission may set aside specific licenses for which only 
eligible designated entities, as specified by the Commission, may bid.
    (e) The Commission may permit partitioning of service areas in 
particular services for eligible designated entities.
    (f) Bidding credits. (1) The Commission may award bidding credits 
(i.e., payment discounts) to eligible designated entities. Competitive 
bidding rules applicable to individual services will specify the 
designated entities eligible for bidding credits, the licenses for which 
bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other 
procedures.
    (2) Size of bidding credits. A winning bidder that qualifies as a 
small business may use the following bidding credits corresponding to 
its respective average gross revenues for the preceding 3 years:
    (i) Businesses with average gross revenues for the preceding years, 
3 years not exceeding $3 million are eligible for bidding credits of 35 
percent;
    (ii) Businesses with average gross revenues for the preceding years, 
3 years not exceeding $15 million are eligible for bidding credits of 25 
percent; and
    (iii) Businesses with average gross revenues for the preceding 
years, 3 years not exceeding $40 million are eligible for bidding 
credits of 15 percent.
    (3) Bidding credit for serving qualifying tribal land. A winning 
bidder for a market will be eligible to receive a bidding credit for 
serving a qualifying tribal land within that market, provided that it 
complies with Sec. 1.2107(e). The following definition, terms, and 
conditions shall apply for the purposes of this section and Sec. 
1.2107(e):
    (i) Qualifying tribal land means any federally recognized Indian 
tribe's reservation, Pueblo, or Colony, including former reservations in 
Oklahoma, Alaska Native regions established pursuant to the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), and Indian allotments, that 
has a wireline telephone subscription rate equal to or less than eighty-
five (85) percent based on the most recently available U.S. Census Data.
    (ii) Certification. (A) Within 180 days after the filing deadline 
for long-form applications, the winning bidder must amend its long-form 
application and attach a certification from the tribal government 
stating the following:
    (1) The tribal government authorizes the winning bidder to site 
facilities and provide service on its tribal land;
    (2) The tribal area to be served by the winning bidder constitutes 
qualifying tribal land; and
    (3) The tribal government has not and will not enter into an 
exclusive contract with the applicant precluding entry by other 
carriers, and will not unreasonably discriminate among wireless carriers 
seeking to provide service on the qualifying tribal land.
    (B) In addition, within 180 days after the filing deadline for long-
form applications, the winning bidder must amend its long-form 
application and file a certification that it will comply with the 
construction requirements set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this 
section and consult with the tribal government regarding the siting of 
facilities and deployment of service on the tribal land.
    (C) If the winning bidder fails to submit the required 
certifications within the 180-day period, the bidding credit will not be 
awarded, and the winning bidder must pay any outstanding balance on its 
winning bid amount.
    (iii) Bidding credit formula. Subject to the applicable bidding 
credit limit set forth in Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iv), the bidding credit 
shall equal five hundred thousand (500,000) dollars for the first two 
hundred (200) square miles (518 square kilometers) of qualifying tribal 
land, and twenty-five hundred (2500) dollars for each additional square 
mile (2.590 square kilometers) of qualifying tribal land above two 
hundred (200) square miles (518 square kilometers).
    (iv) Bidding credit limit. If the high bid is equal to or less than 
one million

[[Page 376]]

(1,000,000) dollars, the maximum bidding credit calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iii) shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the high 
bid. If the high bid is greater than one million (1,000,000) dollars, 
but equal to or less than two million (2,000,000) dollars, the maximum 
bidding credit calculated pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iii) shall not 
exceed five hundred thousand (500,000) dollars. If the high bid is 
greater than two million (2,000,000) dollars, the maximum bidding credit 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iii) shall not exceed thirty-
five (35) percent of the high bid.
    (v) Bidding credit limit in auctions subject to specified reserve 
price(s). In any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 
113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2) with reserve 
price(s) and in any auction with reserve price(s) in which the 
Commission specifies that this provision shall apply, the aggregate 
amount available to be awarded as bidding credits for serving qualifying 
tribal land with respect to all licenses subject to a reserve price 
shall not exceed the amount by which winning bids for those licenses net 
of discounts the Commission takes into account when reporting net bids 
in the Public Notice closing the auction exceed the applicable reserve 
price. If the total amount that might be awarded as tribal land bidding 
credits based on applications for all licenses subject to the reserve 
price exceeds the aggregate amount available to be awarded, the 
Commission will award eligible applicants a pro rata tribal land bidding 
credit. The Commission may determine at any time that the total amount 
that might be awarded as tribal land bidding credits is less than the 
aggregate amount available to be awarded and grant full tribal land 
bidding credits to relevant applicants, including any that previously 
received pro rata tribal land bidding credits. To determine the amount 
of an applicant's pro rata tribal land bidding credit, the Commission 
will multiply the full amount of the tribal land bidding credit for 
which the applicant would be eligible excepting this limitation 
((f)(3)(v)) of this section by a fraction, consisting of a numerator in 
the amount by which winning bids for licenses subject to the reserve 
price net of discounts the Commission takes into account when reporting 
net bids in the Public Notice closing the auction exceed the reserve 
price and a denominator in the amount of the aggregate maximum tribal 
land bidding credits for which applicants for such licenses might have 
qualified excepting this limitation ((f)(3)(v)) of this section. When 
determining the aggregate maximum tribal land bidding credits for which 
applicants for such licenses might have qualified, the Commission shall 
assume that any applicant seeking a tribal land bidding credit on its 
long-form application will be eligible for the largest tribal land 
bidding credit possible for its bid for its license excepting this 
limitation ((f)(3)(v)) of this section. After all applications seeking a 
tribal land bidding credit with respect to licenses covered by a reserve 
price have been finally resolved, the Commission will recalculate the 
pro rata credit. For these purposes, final determination of a credit 
occurs only after any review or reconsideration of the award of such 
credit has been concluded and no opportunity remains for further review 
or reconsideration. To recalculate an applicant's pro rata tribal land 
bidding credit, the Commission will multiply the full amount of the 
tribal land bidding credit for which the applicant would be eligible 
excepting this limitation ((f)(3)(v)) of this section by a fraction, 
consisting of a numerator in the amount by which winning bids for 
licenses subject to the reserve price net of discounts the Commission 
takes into account when reporting net bids in the Public Notice closing 
the auction exceed the reserve price and a denominator in the amount of 
the aggregate amount of tribal land bidding credits for which all 
applicants for such licenses would have qualified excepting this 
limitation ((f)(3)(v)) of this section.
    (vi) Application of credit. A pending request for a bidding credit 
for serving qualifying tribal land has no effect on a bidder's 
obligations to make any auction payments, including down and final 
payments on winning bids, prior to award of the bidding credit by the

[[Page 377]]

Commission. Tribal land bidding credits will be calculated and awarded 
prior to license grant. If the Commission grants an applicant a pro rata 
tribal land bidding credit prior to license grant, as provided by 
paragraph (f)(3)(v) of this section, the Commission shall recalculate 
the applicant's pro rata tribal land bidding credit after all 
applications seeking tribal land biddings for licenses subject to the 
same reserve price have been finally resolved. If a recalculated tribal 
land bidding credit is larger than the previously awarded pro rata 
tribal land bidding credit, the Commission will award the difference.
    (vii) Post-construction certification. Within fifteen (15) days of 
the third anniversary of the initial grant of its license, a recipient 
of a bidding credit under this section shall file a certification that 
the recipient has constructed and is operating a system capable of 
serving seventy-five (75) percent of the population of the qualifying 
tribal land for which the credit was awarded. The recipient must provide 
the total population of the tribal area covered by its license as well 
as the number of persons that it is serving in the tribal area.
    (viii) Performance penalties. If a recipient of a bidding credit 
under this section fails to provide the post-construction certification 
required by paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section, then it shall repay 
the bidding credit amount in its entirety, plus interest. The interest 
will be based on the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations 
applicable on the date the license is granted. Such payment shall be 
made within thirty (30) days of the third anniversary of the initial 
grant of its license. Failure to repay the bidding credit amount and 
interest within the required time period will result in automatic 
termination of the license without specific Commission action. Repayment 
of bidding credit amounts pursuant to this provision shall not affect 
the calculation of amounts available to be awarded as tribal land 
bidding credits pursuant to (f)(3)(v) of this section.
    (g) Installment payments. The Commission may permit small businesses 
(including small businesses owned by women, minorities, or rural 
telephone companies that qualify as small businesses) and other entities 
determined to be eligible on a service-specific basis, which are high 
bidders for licenses specified by the Commission, to pay the full amount 
of their high bids in installments over the term of their licenses 
pursuant to the following:
    (1) Unless otherwise specified by public notice, each eligible 
applicant paying for its license(s) on an installment basis must deposit 
by wire transfer in the manner specified in Sec. 1.2107(b) sufficient 
additional funds as are necessary to bring its total deposits to ten 
(10) percent of its winning bid(s) within ten (10) days after the 
Commission has declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. 
Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay 
a default payment pursuant to Sec. 1.2104(g)(2).
    (2) Within ten (10) days of the conditional grant of the license 
application of a winning bidder eligible for installment payments, the 
licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby 
commencing the eligible licensee's installment payment plan. If a 
winning bidder eligible for installment payments fails to submit this 
additional ten (10) percent of its high bid by the applicable deadline 
as specified by the Commission, it will be allowed to make payment 
within ten (10) business days after the payment deadline, provided that 
it also pays a late fee equal to five percent of the amount due. When a 
winning bidder eligible for installment payments fails to submit this 
additional ten (10) percent of its winning bid, plus the late fee, by 
the late payment deadline, it is considered to be in default on its 
license(s) and subject to the applicable default payments. Licenses will 
be awarded upon the full and timely payment of second down payments and 
any applicable late fees.
    (3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each 
eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment plan and that 
it must execute a promissory note and security agreement as a condition 
of the installment payment plan. Unless other terms are specified in the 
rules of particular services, such plans will:

[[Page 378]]

    (i) Impose interest based on the rate of U.S. Treasury obligations 
(with maturities closest to the duration of the license term) at the 
time of licensing;
    (ii) Allow installment payments for the full license term;
    (iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two years; and
    (iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining term of the 
license.
    (4) A license granted to an eligible entity that elects installment 
payments shall be conditioned upon the full and timely performance of 
the licensee's payment obligations under the installment plan.
    (i) Any licensee that fails to submit its quarterly payment on an 
installment payment obligation (the ``Required Installment Payment'') 
may submit such payment on or before the last day of the next quarter 
(the ``first additional quarter'') without being considered delinquent. 
Any licensee making its Required Installment Payment during this period 
(the ``first additional quarter grace period'') will be assessed a late 
payment fee equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of the past due 
Required Installment Payment. The late payment fee applies to the total 
Required Installment Payment regardless of whether the licensee 
submitted a portion of its Required Installment Payment in a timely 
manner.
    (ii) If any licensee fails to make the Required Installment Payment 
on or before the last day of the first additional quarter set forth in 
paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, the licensee may submit its 
Required Installment Payment on or before the last day of the next 
quarter (the ``second additional quarter''), except that no such 
additional time will be provided for the July 31, 1998 suspension 
interest and installment payments from C or F block licensees that are 
not made within 90 days of the payment resumption date for those 
licensees, as explained in Amendment of the Commission's Rules Regarding 
Installment Payment Financing for Personal Communications Services (PCS) 
Licensees, Order on Reconsideration of the Second Report and Order, WT 
Docket No. 97-82, 13 FCC Rcd 8345 (1998). Any licensee making the 
Required Installment Payment during the second additional quarter (the 
``second additional quarter grace period'') will be assessed a late 
payment fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the past due 
Required Installment Payment. Licensees shall not be required to submit 
any form of request in order to take advantage of the first and second 
additional quarter grace periods.
    (iii) All licensees that avail themselves of these grace periods 
must pay the associated late payment fee(s) and the Required Installment 
Payment prior to the conclusion of the applicable additional quarter 
grace period(s). Payments made at the close of any grace period(s) will 
first be applied to satisfy any lender advances as required under each 
licensee's ``Note and Security Agreement,'' with the remainder of such 
payments applied in the following order: late payment fees, interest 
charges, installment payments for the most back-due quarterly 
installment payment.
    (iv) If an eligible entity obligated to make installment payments 
fails to pay the total Required Installment Payment, interest and any 
late payment fees associated with the Required Installment Payment 
within two quarters (6 months) of the Required Installment Payment due 
date, it shall be in default, its license shall automatically cancel, 
and it will be subject to debt collection procedures. A licensee in the 
PCS C or F blocks shall be in default, its license shall automatically 
cancel, and it will be subject to debt collection procedures, if the 
payment due on the payment resumption date, referenced in paragraph 
(g)(4)(ii) of this section, is more than ninety (90) days delinquent.
    (h) The Commission may establish different upfront payment 
requirements for categories of designated entities in competitive 
bidding rules of particular auctionable services.
    (i) The Commission may offer designated entities a combination of 
the available preferences or additional preferences.
    (j) Designated entities must describe on their long-form 
applications how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility for 
designated entity status, and must list and summarize on their long-form 
applications all agreements that

[[Page 379]]

affect designated entity status such as partnership agreements, 
shareholder agreements, management agreements, spectrum leasing 
arrangements, spectrum resale (including wholesale) arrangements, and 
all other agreements, including oral agreements, establishing, as 
applicable, de facto or de jure control of the entity or the presence or 
absence of impermissible and attributable material relationships. 
Designated entities also must provide the date(s) on which they entered 
into each of the agreements listed. In addition, designated entities 
must file with their long-form applications a copy of each such 
agreement. In order to enable the Commission to audit designated entity 
eligibility on an ongoing basis, designated entities that are awarded 
eligibility must, for the term of the license, maintain at their 
facilities or with their designated agents the lists, summaries, dates, 
and copies of agreements required to be identified and provided to the 
Commission pursuant to this paragraph and to Sec. 1.2114.
    (k) The Commission may, on a service-specific basis, permit 
consortia, each member of which individually meets the eligibility 
requirements, to qualify for any designated entity provisions.
    (l) The Commission may, on a service-specific basis, permit 
publicly-traded companies that are owned by members of minority groups 
or women to qualify for any designated entity provisions.
    (m) Audits. (1) Applicants and licensees claiming eligibility shall 
be subject to audits by the Commission, using in-house and contract 
resources. Selection for audit may be random, on information, or on the 
basis of other factors.
    (2) Consent to such audits is part of the certification included in 
the short-form application (FCC Form 175). Such consent shall include 
consent to the audit of the applicant's or licensee's books, documents 
and other material (including accounting procedures and practices) 
regardless of form or type, sufficient to confirm that such applicant's 
or licensee's representations are, and remain, accurate. Such consent 
shall include inspection at all reasonable times of the facilities, or 
parts thereof, engaged in providing and transacting business, or keeping 
records regarding FCC-licensed service and shall also include consent to 
the interview of principals, employees, customers and suppliers of the 
applicant or licensee.
    (n) Annual reports. Each designated entity licensee must file with 
the Commission an annual report within five business days before the 
anniversary date of the designated entity's license grant. The annual 
report shall include, at a minimum, a list and summaries of all 
agreements and arrangements (including proposed agreements and 
arrangements) that relate to eligibility for designated entity benefits. 
In addition to a summary of each agreement or arrangement, this list 
must include the parties (including affiliates, controlling interests, 
and affiliates of controlling interests) to each agreement or 
arrangement, as well as the dates on which the parties entered into each 
agreement or arrangement. Annual reports will be filed no later than, 
and up to five business days before, the anniversary of the designated 
entity's license grant.
    (o) Gross revenues. Gross revenues shall mean all income received by 
an entity, whether earned or passive, before any deductions are made for 
costs of doing business (e.g., cost of goods sold), as evidenced by 
audited financial statements for the relevant number of most recently 
completed calendar years or, if audited financial statements were not 
prepared on a calendar-year basis, for the most recently completed 
fiscal years preceding the filing of the applicant's short-form (FCC 
Form 175). If an entity was not in existence for all or part of the 
relevant period, gross revenues shall be evidenced by the audited 
financial statements of the entity's predecessor-in-interest or, if 
there is no identifiable predecessor-in-interest, unaudited financial 
statements certified by the applicant as accurate. When an applicant 
does not otherwise use audited financial statements, its gross revenues 
may be certified by its chief financial officer or its equivalent and 
must be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles.

[[Page 380]]

    (p) Total assets. Total assets shall mean the book value (except 
where generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require market 
valuation) of all property owned by an entity, whether real or personal, 
tangible or intangible, as evidenced by the most recently audited 
financial statements or certified by the applicant's chief financial 
offer or its equivalent if the applicant does not otherwise use audited 
financial statements.

Sec. 1.2111  Assignment or transfer of control: unjust enrichment.

    (a) Reporting requirement. An applicant seeking approval for a 
transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the 
Commission's rules) of a license within three years of receiving a new 
license through a competitive bidding procedure must, together with its 
application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the 
Commission a statement indicating that its license was obtained through 
competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission 
the associated contracts for sale, option agreements, management 
agreements, or other documents disclosing the local consideration that 
the applicant would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of 
its license (see Sec. 1.948). This information should include not only 
a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-kind, or 
other consideration (e.g., management or consulting contracts either 
with or without an option to purchase; below market financing).
    (b) Unjust enrichment payment: set-aside. As specified in this 
paragraph an applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or 
assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's rules) of, or for 
entry into a material relationship (see Sec. Sec. 1.2110, 1.2114) 
(otherwise permitted under the Commission's rules) involving, a license 
acquired by the applicant pursuant to a set-aside for eligible 
designated entities under Sec. 1.2110(c), or which proposes to take any 
other action relating to ownership or control that will result in loss 
of eligibility as a designated entity, must seek Commission approval and 
may be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the 
Commission by cashier's check or wire transfer before consent will be 
granted. The Payment will be based upon a schedule that will take 
account of the term of the license, any applicable construction 
benchmarks, and the estimated value of the set-aside benefit, which will 
be calculated as the difference between the amount paid by the 
designated entity for the license and the value of comparable non-set-
aside license in the free market at the time of the auction. The 
Commission will establish the amount of the Payment and the burden will 
be on the applicants to disprove this amount. No Payment will be 
required if:
    (1) The license is transferred or assigned more than five years 
after its initial issuance, unless otherwise specified; or
    (2) The proposed transferee or assignee is an eligible designated 
entity under Sec. 1.2110(c) or the service-specific competitive bidding 
rules of the particular service, and so certifies.
    (c) Unjust enrichment payment: installment financing. (1) If a 
licensee that utilizes installment financing under this section seeks to 
assign or transfer control of its license to an entity not meeting the 
eligibility standards for installment payments, the licensee must make 
full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest 
accrued through the date of assignment or transfer as a condition of 
approval.
    (2) If a licensee that utilizes installment financing under this 
section seeks to make any change in ownership structure or to enter into 
a material relationship (see Sec. 1.2110) that would result in the 
licensee losing eligibility for installment payments, the licensee shall 
first seek Commission approval and must make full payment of the 
remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest accrued through the 
date

[[Page 381]]

of such change as a condition of approval. A licensee's (or other 
attributable entity's) increased gross revenues or increased total 
assets due to nonattributable equity investments, debt financing, 
revenue from operations or other investments, business development or 
expanded service shall not be considered to result in the licensee 
losing eligibility for installment payments.
    (3) If a licensee seeks to make any change in ownership or to enter 
into a material relationship (see Sec. 1.2110) that would result in the 
licensee qualifying for a less favorable installment plan under this 
section, the licensee shall seek Commission approval and must adjust its 
payment plan to reflect its new eligibility status. A licensee may not 
switch its payment plan to a more favorable plan.
    (d) Unjust enrichment payment: bidding credits. (1) A licensee that 
utilizes a bidding credit, and that during the initial term seeks to 
assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that does not meet 
the eligibility criteria for a bidding credit, will be required to 
reimburse the U.S. Government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus 
interest based on the rate for ten year U.S. Treasury obligations 
applicable on the date the license was granted, as a condition of 
Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. If, within the 
initial term of the license, a licensee that utilizes a bidding credit 
seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that is 
eligible for a lower bidding credit, the difference between the bidding 
credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which 
the acquiring party would qualify, plus interest based on the rate for 
ten year U.S. treasury obligations applicable on the date the license is 
granted, must be paid to the U.S. Government as a condition of 
Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. If, within the 
initial term of the license, a licensee that utilizes a bidding credit 
seeks to make any ownership change or to enter into a material 
relationship (see Sec. 1.2110) that would result in the licensee losing 
eligibility for a bidding credit (or qualifying for a lower bidding 
credit), the amount of the bidding credit (or the difference between the 
bidding credit originally obtained and the bidding credit for which the 
licensee would qualify after restructuring or entry into a material 
relationship), plus interest based on the rate for ten year U.S. 
treasury obligations applicable on the date the license is granted, must 
be paid to the U.S. Government as a condition of Commission approval of 
the assignment or transfer or of a reportable eligibility event (see 
Sec. 1.2114).
    (2) Payment schedule. (i) For licenses initially granted after April 
25, 2006, the amount of payments made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section will be 100 percent of the value of the bidding credit 
prior to the filing of the notification informing the Commission that 
the construction requirements applicable at the end of the initial 
license term have been met. If the notification informing the Commission 
that the construction requirements applicable at the end of the initial 
license term have been met, the amount of the payments will be reduced 
over time as follows:
    (A) A loss of eligibility in the first five years of the license 
term will result in a forfeiture of 100 percent of the value of the 
bidding credit (or in the case of eligibility changing to qualify for a 
lower bidding credit, 100 percent of the difference between the bidding 
credit received and the bidding credit for which it is eligible);
    (B) A loss of eligibility in years 6 and 7 of the license term will 
result in a forfeiture of 75 percent of the value of the bidding credit 
(or in the case of eligibility changing to qualify for a lower bidding 
credit, 75 percent of the difference between the bidding credit received 
and the bidding credit for which it is eligible);
    (C) A loss of eligibility in years 8 and 9 of the license term will 
result in a forfeiture of 50 percent of the value of the bidding credit 
(or in the case of eligibility changing to qualify for a lower bidding 
credit, 50 percent of the difference between the bidding credit received 
and the bidding credit for which it is eligible); and
    (D) A loss of eligibility in year 10 of the license term will result 
in a forfeiture of 25 percent of the value of the

[[Page 382]]

bidding credit (or in the case of eligibility changing to qualify for a 
lower bidding credit, 25 percent of the difference between the bidding 
credit received and the bidding credit for which it is eligible).
    (ii) For licenses initially granted before April 25, 2006, the 
amount of payments made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
will be reduced over time as follows:
    (A) A transfer in the first two years of the license term will 
result in a forfeiture of 100 percent of the value of the bidding credit 
(or in the case of very small businesses transferring to small 
businesses, 100 percent of the difference between the bidding credit 
received by the former and the bidding credit for which the latter is 
eligible);
    (B) A transfer in year 3 of the license term will result in a 
forfeiture of 75 percent of the value of the bidding credit;
    (C) A transfer in year 4 of the license term will result in a 
forfeiture of 50 percent of the value of the bidding credit;
    (D) A transfer in year 5 of the license term will result in a 
forfeiture of 25 percent of the value of the bidding credit; and
    (E) For a transfer in year 6 or thereafter, there will be no 
payment.
    (iii) These payments will have to be paid to the United States 
Treasury as a condition of approval of the assignment, transfer, 
ownership change, or reportable eligibility event (see Sec. 1.2114).
    (e) Unjust enrichment: partitioning and disaggregation--(1) 
Installment payments. Licensees making installment payments, that 
partition their licenses or disaggregate their spectrum to entities not 
meeting the eligibility standards for installment payments, will be 
subject to the provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in 
this section.
    (2) Bidding credits. Licensees that received a bidding credit that 
partition their licenses or disaggregate their spectrum to entities not 
meeting the eligibility standards for such a bidding credit, will be 
subject to the provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in 
this section.
    (3) Apportioning unjust enrichment payments. Unjust enrichment 
payments for partitioned license areas shall be calculated based upon 
the ratio of the population of the partitioned license area to the 
overall population of the license area and by utilizing the most recent 
census data. Unjust enrichment payments for disaggregated spectrum shall 
be calculated based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum 
disaggregated to the amount of spectrum held by the licensee.

Sec. 1.2113  Construction prior to grant of application.

    Subject to the provisions of this section, applicants for licenses 
awarded by competitive bidding may construct facilities to provide 
service prior to grant of their applications, but must not operate such 
facilities until the FCC grants an authorization. If the conditions 
stated in this section are not met, applicants must not begin to 
construct facilities for licenses subject to competitive bidding.
    (a) When applicants may begin construction. An applicant may begin 
construction of a facility upon release of the Public Notice listing the 
post-auction long-form application for that facility as acceptable for 
filing.
    (b) Notification to stop. If the FCC for any reason determines that 
construction should not be started or should be stopped while an 
application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally (followed 
by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not begin 
construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction 
immediately.
    (c) Assumption of risk. Applicants that begin construction pursuant 
to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own 
risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses 
resulting from:
    (1) Applications that are not granted;
    (2) Errors or delays in issuing public notices;
    (3) Having to alter, relocate or dismantle the facility; or
    (4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility 
into compliance with applicable laws, or FCC rules and orders.
    (d) Conditions. Except as indicated, all pre-grant construction is 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The application does not include a request for a waiver of one 
or more FCC rules;
    (2) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, the licensee has notified 
the appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA Form 7460-1), filed a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
FCC, PRB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325;
    (3) The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed 
facility would not have a significant environmental effect, in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.1301 through 1.1319;
    (4) Under applicable international agreements and rules in this 
part, individual coordination of the proposed channel assignment(s) with 
a foreign administration is not required; and

<R05>
Sec. 1.2114  Reporting of eligibility event.

    (a) A designated entity must seek Commission approval for all 
reportable eligibility events. A reportable eligibility event is:
    (1) Any spectrum lease (as defined in Sec. 1.9003) or resale 
arrangement (including wholesale agreements) with one entity or on a 
cumulative basis that might cause a licensee to lose eligibility for 
installment payments, a set-aside license, or a bidding credit (or for a 
particular level of bidding credit) under Sec. 1.2110 and applicable 
service-specific rules.
    (2) Any other event that would lead to a change in the eligibility 
of a licensee for designated entity benefits.
    (b) Documents listed on and filed with application. A designated 
entity filing an application pursuant to this section must--
    (1) List and summarize on the application all agreements and 
arrangements (including proposed agreements and arrangements) that give 
rise to or otherwise relate to a reportable eligibility event. In 
addition to a summary of each agreement or arrangement, this list must 
include the parties (including each party's affiliates, its controlling 
interests, the affiliates of its controlling interests, its spectrum 
lessees, and its spectrum resellers and wholesalers) to each agreement 
or arrangement, as well as the dates on which the parties entered into 
each agreement or arrangement.
    (2) File with the application a copy of each agreement and 
arrangement listed pursuant to this paragraph.
    (3) Maintain at its facilities or with its designated agents, for 
the term of the license, the lists, summaries, dates, and copies of 
agreements and arrangements required to be provided to the Commission 
pursuant to this section.
    (c) Application fees. The application reporting the eligibility 
event will be treated as a transfer of control for purposes of 
determining the applicable application fees as set forth in Sec. 
1.1102.
    (d) Streamlined approval procedures. (1) The eligibility event 
application will be placed on public notice once the application is

 Subpart R_Implementation of Section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act: 
 Procedures Governing Acceptance of Unconditional Gifts, Donations and 
                                Bequests

    Source: 59 FR 38128, July 27, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3000  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Telecommunications 
Authorization Act of 1992 which amended the Communications Act by 
creating section 4(g)(3), 47 U.S.C. 154(g)(3). The provisions of this 
subpart shall apply to gifts, donations and bequests made to the 
Commission itself. Travel reimbursement for attendance at, or 
participation in, government-sponsored meetings or events required to 
carry out the Commission's statutory or regulatory functions may also be 
accepted under this subpart. The acceptance of gifts by Commission 
employees, most notably gifts of food, drink and entertainment, is 
governed by the government-wide standards of employee conduct 
established at 5 CFR part 2635. Travel, subsistence and related expenses 
for non-government-sponsored meetings or events will continue to be 
accepted pursuant to the Government Employees Training Act, 41 U.S.C. 
4111 or 31 U.S.C. 1353, and its General Services Administration's 
implementing regulations, 41 CFR 304-1.8, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3001  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart:
    (a) The term agency means the Federal Communications Commission.
    (b) The term gift means any unconditional gift, donation or bequest 
of real, personal and other property (including voluntary and 
uncompensated services as authorized under 5 U.S.C. 3109).
    (c) The terms agency ethics official, designated agency ethics 
official, employee, market value, person, and prohibited source, have 
the same meaning as found in 5 CFR 2635.102, 2635.203.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3002  Structural rules and prohibitions.

    (a) General prohibitions. An employee shall not:
    (1) Directly or indirectly, solicit or coerce the offering of a 
gift, donation or bequest to the Commission from a regulated entity or 
other prohibited source; or
    (2) Accept gifts of cash pursuant to this subpart.
    (b) Referral of offers to designated agency ethics official. Any 
person who seeks to offer any gift to the Commission under the 
provisions of this subpart shall make such offer to the Commission's 
designated agency ethics official. In addition, any Commission employee 
who is contacted by a potential donor or the representative thereof for 
the purpose of discussing the possibility of making a gift, donation or 
bequest to the Commission shall immediately refer such person or persons 
to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. The designated 
agency ethics official shall, in consultation with other agency ethics 
officials, make a determination concerning whether acceptance of such 
offers would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. Agency ethics officials may also advise potential 
donors and their representatives of the types of equipment, property or 
services that may be of use to the Commission and the procedures for 
effectuating gifts set forth in this subpart. The Commission may, in its 
discretion, afford public notice before accepting any gift under 
authority of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3003  Mandatory factors for evaluating conflicts of interest.

    No gift shall be accepted under this subpart unless a determination 
is made that its acceptance would not create a conflict of interest or 
the appearance of a conflict of interest. In making conflict of interest 
determinations, designated agency ethics officials shall consider the 
following factors:
    (a) Whether the benefits of the intended gift will accrue to an 
individual employee and, if so--

[[Page 387]]

    (1) Whether the employee is responsible for matters affecting the 
potential donor that are currently before the agency; and
    (2) The significance of the employee's role in any such matters;
    (b) The nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the 
Commission affecting the intended donor;
    (c) The timing of the intended gift;
    (d) The market value of the intended gift;
    (e) The frequency of other gifts made by the same donor; and
    (f) The reason underlying the intended gift given in a written 
statement from the proposed donor.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3004  Public disclosure and reporting requirements.

    (a) Public disclosure of gifts accepted from prohibited sources. The 
Commission's Security Operations Office, Office of the Managing 
Director, shall maintain a written record of gifts accepted from 
prohibited sources by the Commission pursuant to section 4(g)(3) 
authority, which will include:
    (1) The identity of the prohibited source;
    (2) A description of the gift;
    (3) The market value of the gift;
    (4) Documentation concerning the prohibited source's reason for the 
gift as required in Sec. 1.3003(f);
    (5) A signed statement of verification from the prohibited source 
that the gift is unconditional and is not contingent on any promise or 
expectation that the Commission's receipt of the gift will benefit the 
proposed donor in any regulatory matter; and
    (6) The date the gift is accepted by the Commission.
    (b) Reporting Requirements for all gifts. The Commission shall file 
a semi-annual report to Congress listing the gift, donor and value of 
all gifts accepted from any donor under this subpart.

  Subpart S_Preemption of Restrictions That ``Impair'' the Ability To 
    Receive Television Broadcast Signals, Direct Broadcast Satellite 
   Services, or Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services or the 
  Ability To Receive or Transmit Fixed Wireless Communications Signals

    Source: 66 FR 2333, Jan. 11, 2001, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.4000  Restrictions impairing reception of television broadcast signals,

direct broadcast satellite services or multichannel multipoint distribution 
          services.

    (a)(1) Any restriction, including but not limited to any state or 
local law or regulation, including zoning, land-use, or building 
regulations, or any private covenant, contract provision, lease 
provision, homeowners' association rule or similar restriction, on 
property within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user where 
the user has a direct or indirect ownership or leasehold interest in the 
property that impairs the installation, maintenance, or use of:
    (i) An antenna that is:
    (A) Used to receive direct broadcast satellite service, including 
direct-to-home satellite service, or to receive or transmit fixed 
wireless signals via satellite, and
    (B) One meter or less in diameter or is located in Alaska;
    (ii) An antenna that is:
    (A) Used to receive video programming services via multipoint 
distribution services, including multichannel multipoint distribution 
services, instructional television fixed services, and local multipoint 
distribution services, or to receive or transmit fixed wireless signals 
other than via satellite, and
    (B) That is one meter or less in diameter or diagonal measurement;
    (iii) An antenna that is used to receive television broadcast 
signals; or
    (iv) A mast supporting an antenna described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), 
(a)(1)(ii), or (a)(1)(iii) of this section; is prohibited to the extent 
it so impairs, subject to paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 388]]

    (2) For purposes of this section, ``fixed wireless signals'' means 
any commercial non-broadcast communications signals transmitted via 
wireless technology to and/or from a fixed customer location. Fixed 
wireless signals do not include, among other things, AM radio, FM radio, 
amateur (``HAM'') radio, Citizen's Band (CB) radio, and Digital Audio 
Radio Service (DARS) signals.
    (3) For purposes of this section, a law, regulation, or restriction 
impairs installation, maintenance, or use of an antenna if it:
    (i) Unreasonably delays or prevents installation, maintenance, or 
use;
    (ii) Unreasonably increases the cost of installation, maintenance, 
or use; or
    (iii) Precludes reception or transmission of an acceptable quality 
signal.
    (4) Any fee or cost imposed on a user by a rule, law, regulation or 
restriction must be reasonable in light of the cost of the equipment or 
services and the rule, law, regulation or restriction's treatment of 
comparable devices. No civil, criminal, administrative, or other legal 
action of any kind shall be taken to enforce any restriction or 
regulation prohibited by this section except pursuant to paragraph (d) 
or (e) of this section. In addition, except with respect to restrictions 
pertaining to safety and historic preservation as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section, if a proceeding is initiated pursuant to paragraph 
(d) or (e) of this section, the entity seeking to enforce the antenna 
restrictions in question must suspend all enforcement efforts pending 
completion of review. No attorney's fees shall be collected or assessed 
and no fine or other penalties shall accrue against an antenna user 
while a proceeding is pending to determine the validity of any 
restriction. If a ruling is issued adverse to a user, the user shall be 
granted at least a 21-day grace period in which to comply with the 
adverse ruling; and neither a fine nor a penalty may be collected from 
the user if the user complies with the adverse ruling during this grace 
period, unless the proponent of the restriction demonstrates, in the 
same proceeding which resulted in the adverse ruling, that the user's 
claim in the proceeding was frivolous.
    (b) Any restriction otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this 
section is permitted if:
    (1) It is necessary to accomplish a clearly defined, legitimate 
safety objective that is either stated in the text, preamble, or 
legislative history of the restriction or described as applying to that 
restriction in a document that is readily available to antenna users, 
and would be applied to the extent practicable in a non-discriminatory 
manner to other appurtenances, devices, or fixtures that are comparable 
in size and weight and pose a similar or greater safety risk as these 
antennas and to which local regulation would normally apply; or
    (2) It is necessary to preserve a prehistoric or historic district, 
site, building, structure or object included in, or eligible for 
inclusion on, the National Register of Historic Places, as set forth in 
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 
470, and imposes no greater restrictions on antennas covered by this 
rule than are imposed on the installation, maintenance, or use of other 
modern appurtenances, devices, or fixtures that are comparable in size, 
weight, and appearance to these antennas; and
    (3) It is no more burdensome to affected antenna users than is 
necessary to achieve the objectives described in paragraphs (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (c) In the case of an antenna that is used to transmit fixed 
wireless signals, the provisions of this section shall apply only if a 
label is affixed to the antenna that:
    (1) Provides adequate notice regarding potential radiofrequency 
safety hazards, e.g., information regarding the safe minimum separation 
distance required between users and transceiver antennas; and
    (2) References the applicable FCC-adopted limits for radiofrequency 
exposure specified in Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter.
    (d) Local governments or associations may apply to the Commission 
for a waiver of this section under Sec. 1.3 of this chapter. Waiver 
requests must comply with the procedures in paragraphs (f) and (h) of 
this section and

[[Page 389]]

will be put on public notice. The Commission may grant a waiver upon a 
showing by the applicant of local concerns of a highly specialized or 
unusual nature. No petition for waiver shall be considered unless it 
specifies the restriction at issue. Waivers granted in accordance with 
this section shall not apply to restrictions amended or enacted after 
the waiver is granted. Any responsive pleadings must be served on all 
parties and filed within 30 days after release of a public notice that 
such petition has been filed. Any replies must be filed within 15 days 
thereafter.
    (e) Parties may petition the Commission for a declaratory ruling 
under Sec. 1.2 of this chapter, or a court of competent jurisdiction, 
to determine whether a particular restriction is permissible or 
prohibited under this section. Petitions to the Commission must comply 
with the procedures in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section and will 
be put on public notice. Any responsive pleadings in a Commission 
proceeding must be served on all parties and filed within 30 days after 
release of a public notice that such petition has been filed. Any 
replies in a Commission proceeding must be served on all parties and 
filed within 15 days thereafter.
    (f) Copies of petitions for declaratory rulings and waivers must be 
served on interested parties, including parties against whom the 
petitioner seeks to enforce the restriction or parties whose 
restrictions the petitioner seeks to prohibit. A certificate of service 
stating on whom the petition was served must be filed with the petition. 
In addition, in a Commission proceeding brought by an association or a 
local government, constructive notice of the proceeding must be given to 
members of the association or to the citizens under the local 
government's jurisdiction. In a court proceeding brought by an 
association, an association must give constructive notice of the 
proceeding to its members. Where constructive notice is required, the 
petitioner or plaintiff must file with the Commission or the court 
overseeing the proceeding a copy of the constructive notice with a 
statement explaining where the notice was placed and why such placement 
was reasonable.
    (g) In any proceeding regarding the scope or interpretation of any 
provision of this section, the burden of demonstrating that a particular 
governmental or nongovernmental restriction complies with this section 
and does not impair the installation, maintenance, or use of devices 
used for over-the-air reception of video programming services or devices 
used to receive or transmit fixed wireless signals shall be on the party 
that seeks to impose or maintain the restriction.
    (h) All allegations of fact contained in petitions and related 
pleadings before the Commission must be supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with actual knowledge thereof. An original and two 
copies of all petitions and pleadings should be addressed to the 
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW, 
Washington, DC 20554. Copies of the petitions and related pleadings will 
be available for public inspection in the Reference Information Center, 
Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, 445 12th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20554. Copies will be 
available for purchase from the Commission's contract copy center, and 
the Commission decisions will be available on the Internet.

violation of 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) by filing the original and two copies 
of the complaint on the Secretary of the Commission and serving a copy 
of the complaint by means of two commonly used overnight delivery 
services, each addressed to the chief executive officer of the satellite 
carrier at its principal place of business and each marked ``URGENT 
LITIGATION MATTER'' on the outer packaging. Service shall be deemed 
complete one business day after a copy of the complaint is provided to 
the delivery services for overnight delivery. On receipt of a complaint 
filed by a television broadcast station under this subsection, the 
Secretary of the Commission shall send the original complaint by United 
States mail, postage prepaid, receipt requested, addressed to the chief 
executive officer of the satellite carrier at its principal place of 
business.

<R05>
Sec. 1.6005  Exclusive defenses.

    (a) The defenses listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this 
section, are the only defenses available to a satellite carrier against 
which a complaint under this section is filed.
    (1) The satellite carrier did not retransmit the television 
broadcast station's signal to any person in the ``local market'' of the 
television broadcast station, as that term is defined in 17 U.S.C. 
122(j) (Designated Market Area as determined by Nielsen Media Research 
and county containing the station's community of license), during the 
time period specified in the complaint;
    (2) The television broadcast station had, in a writing signed by an 
officer of the television broadcast station, expressly authorized the 
retransmission of the station by the satellite carrier to each person in 
the ``local market'' of the television broadcast station, as that term 
is defined in 17 U.S.C. 122(j), to which the satellite carrier made such 
retransmissions for the entire time period during which it is alleged 
that a violation of 47 U.S.C. 325 (b)(1) has occurred;
    (3) The retransmission was made after January 1, 2002, and the 
television broadcast station had elected to assert the right to carriage 
under 47 U.S.C. 338 as against the satellite carrier for the relevant 
period; or
    (4) The television broadcast station whose signal is being 
retransmitted is a noncommercial television broadcast station.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.6006  Counting of violations.

    Each day of retransmission without consent of a particular 
television broadcast station to one or more persons in the local market 
of the station shall be considered a separate violation of 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 1.6007  Burden of proof.

    With respect to each alleged violation, the burden of proof shall be 
on a television broadcast station to establish that the satellite 
carrier retransmitted the station to at least one person in the local 
market of the station on the day in question. The burden of proof shall 
be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the 
defense under Sec. 1.6005(a)(1).

<R05>
Sec. 1.6008  Determinations.

    (a) In General. Within forty five (45) days after the filing of a 
complaint, the Commission shall issue a final determination in any 
proceeding brought under this subsection. The Commission's final 
determination shall specify the number of violations committed by the 
satellite carrier. The Commission shall hear witnesses only if it 
clearly appears, based on the written filings by the parties, that there 
is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the 
preceding sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on the 
written filings by the parties.
    (b) Discovery. The Commission may direct the parties to exchange 
pertinent documents, and if necessary, to take prehearing depositions, 
on such schedule as the Commission may approve, but only if the 
Commission first determines that such discovery is necessary to resolve 
a genuine dispute about material facts, consistent with the obligation 
to make a final determination within forty five (45) days. In this 
connection, the Commission may utilize the discovery or other 
evidentiary procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.311 through 1.364 of 
the Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6009  Relief.

    If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has 
retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one person in 
the local market of such station and has failed to meet its burden of 
proving one of the defenses under Sec. 1.6005 (a)(2) through (a)(4) 
with respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall:
    (a) Make a finding that the satellite carrier violated 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1) with respect to that station; and
    (b) Issue an order, within forty-five (45) days after the filing of 
the complaint, containing--
    (1) A cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier 
immediately to stop making any further retransmissions of the television 
broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station 
until such time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier 
is in compliance with 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to such station;
    (2) If the satellite carrier is found to have violated 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1) with respect to more than two television broadcast stations, a 
cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier to stop making 
any further retransmission of any television broadcast station to any 
person within the local market of the stations identified in the cease-
and-desist order, until such time as the Commission, after giving notice 
to the station, determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance 
with 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to such stations; and
    (3) An award to the complainant of that complainant's costs and 
reasonable attorney's fees. Such award shall be made only after the 
complainant submits appropriate documentation in support of its request.
    (c) Any cease-and-desist order issued hereunder shall include a 
statement of findings and the grounds therefor, shall specify the 
effective date of the order, and shall be served by the Commission upon 
the satellite carrier to which such order is directed.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6010  Reporting of remedial measures.

    Any satellite carrier found to have violated Section 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1) shall, upon receipt of the cease-and-desist order, immediately 
take all necessary steps to comply with the statute. Within two (2) days 
of receipt of the cease-and-desist order, the satellite carrier shall 
notify the Secretary of the Commission of steps taken to comply with the 
statute by written submission. The submission certified by the satellite 
carrier's chief executive officer shall also contain a copy of the 
pertinent cease-and-desist order, and shall be delivered to the 
Secretary of the Commission by means of one commonly used overnight 
delivery service, in addition to a copy delivered by United States mail.

                     General Policies and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 1.9010  De facto control standard for spectrum leasing arrangements.

    (a) Under the rules established for spectrum leasing arrangements in 
this subpart, the following standard is applied for purposes of 
determining whether a licensee retains de facto control under section 
310(d) of the Communications Act with regard to spectrum that it leases 
to a spectrum lessee.
    (b) A licensee will be deemed to have retained de facto control of 
leased spectrum if it enters into a spectrum leasing arrangement and 
acts as a spectrum manager with regard to portions of the licensed 
spectrum that it leases to a spectrum lessee, provided the licensee 
satisfies the following two conditions:
    (1) Licensee responsibility for lessee compliance with Commission 
policies and rules. The licensee must remain fully responsible for 
ensuring the spectrum

[[Page 399]]

lessee's compliance with the Communications Act and all applicable 
policies and rules directly related to the use of the leased spectrum.
    (i) Through contractual provisions and actual oversight and 
enforcement of such provisions, the licensee must act in a manner 
sufficient to ensure that the spectrum lessee operates in conformance 
with applicable technical and use rules governing the license 
authorization.
    (ii) The licensee must maintain a reasonable degree of actual 
working knowledge about the spectrum lessee's activities and facilities 
that affect its ongoing compliance with the Commission's policies and 
rules. These responsibilities include: Coordinating operations and 
modifications of the spectrum lessee's system to ensure compliance with 
Commission rules regarding non-interference with co-channel and adjacent 
channel licensees (and any authorized spectrum user); making all 
determinations as to whether an application is required for any 
individual spectrum lessee stations (e.g., those that require frequency 
coordination, submission of an Environmental Assessment under Sec. 
1.1307 of subpart I of this part, those that require international or 
Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) coordination, those that 
affect radio frequency quiet zones described in Sec. 1.924 of subpart F 
of this part, or those that require notification to the Federal Aviation 
Administration under part 17 of this chapter); and, ensuring that the 
spectrum lessee complies with the Commission's safety guidelines 
relating to human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) radiation (e.g., Sec. 
1.1307(b) and related rules of subpart I of this part). The licensee is 
responsible for resolving all interference-related matters, including 
conflicts between its spectrum lessee and any other spectrum lessee or 
licensee (or authorized spectrum user). The licensee may use agents 
(e.g., counsel, engineering consultants) when carrying out these 
responsibilities, so long as the licensee exercises effective control 
over its agents' actions.
    (iii) The licensee must be able to inspect the spectrum lessee's 
operations and must retain the right to terminate the spectrum leasing 
arrangement in the event the spectrum lessee fails to comply with the 
terms of the arrangement and/or applicable Commission requirements. If 
the licensee or the Commission determines that there is any violation of 
the Commission's rules or that the spectrum lessee's system is causing 
harmful interference, the licensee must immediately take steps to remedy 
the violation, resolve the interference, suspend or terminate the 
operation of the system, or take other measures to prevent further 
harmful interference until the situation can be remedied. If the 
spectrum lessee refuses to resolve the interference, remedy the 
violation, or suspend or terminate operations, either at the direction 
of the licensee or by order of the Commission, the licensee must use all 
reasonable legal means necessary to enforce compliance.
    (2) Licensee responsibility for interactions with the Commission, 
including all filings, required under the license authorization and 
applicable service rules directly related to the leased spectrum. The 
licensee remains responsible for the following interactions with the 
Commission:
    (i) The licensee must file the necessary notification with the 
Commission, as required under Sec. 1.9020(e).
    (ii) The licensee is responsible for making all required filings 
(e.g., applications, notifications, correspondence) associated with the 
license authorization that are directly affected by the spectrum 
lessee's use of the licensed spectrum. The licensee may use agents 
(e.g., counsel, engineering consultants) to complete these filings, so 
long as the licensee exercises effective control over its agents' 
actions and complies with any signature requirements for such filings.

Sec. 1.9020  Spectrum manager leasing arrangements.

    (a) Overview. Under the provisions of this section, a licensee (in 
any of the included services) and a spectrum lessee may enter into a 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement, without the need for prior 
Commission approval, provided that the licensee retains de jure

[[Page 400]]

control of the license and de facto control, as defined and explained in 
this subpart, of the leased spectrum. The licensee must notify the 
Commission of the spectrum leasing arrangement pursuant to the rules set 
forth in this section. The term of a spectrum manager leasing 
arrangement may be no longer than the term of the license authorization.
    (b) Rights and responsibilities of the licensee. (1) The licensee is 
directly and primarily responsible for ensuring the spectrum lessee's 
compliance with the Communications Act and applicable Commission 
policies and rules.
    (2) The licensee retains responsibility for maintaining its 
compliance with applicable eligibility and ownership requirements 
imposed on it pursuant to the license authorization.
    (3) The licensee must retain a copy of the spectrum leasing 
agreement and make it available upon request by the Commission.
    (c) Rights and responsibilities of the spectrum lessee. (1) The 
spectrum lessee must comply with the Communications Act and with 
Commission requirements associated with the license.
    (2) The spectrum lessee is responsible for establishing that it 
meets the eligibility and qualification requirements applicable to 
spectrum lessees under the rules set forth in this section.
    (3) The spectrum lessee must comply with any obligations that apply 
directly to it as a result of its own status as a service provider 
(e.g., Title II obligations if the spectrum lessee acts as a 
telecommunications carrier or acts as a common carrier).
    (4) In addition to the licensee being directly accountable to the 
Commission for ensuring the spectrum lessee's compliance with the 
Commission's operational rules and policies (as discussed in this 
subpart), the spectrum lessee is independently accountable to the 
Commission for complying with the Communications Act and Commission 
policies and rules, including those that apply directly to the spectrum 
lessee as a result of its own status as a service provider.
    (5) In leasing spectrum from a licensee, the spectrum lessee must 
accept Commission oversight and enforcement consistent with the license 
authorization. The spectrum lessee must cooperate fully with any 
investigation or inquiry conducted by either the Commission or the 
licensee, allow the Commission or the licensee to conduct on-site 
inspections of transmission facilities, and suspend operations at the 
direction of the Commission or the licensee and to the extent that such 
suspension would be consistent with the Commission's suspension 
policies.
    (6) The spectrum lessee must retain a copy of the spectrum leasing 
agreement and make it available upon request by the Commission.
    (d) Applicability of particular service rules and policies. Under a 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement, the service rules and policies 
apply in the following manner to the licensee and spectrum lessee:
    (1) Interference-related rules. The interference and radiofrequency 
(RF) safety rules applicable to use of the spectrum by the licensee as a 
condition of its license authorization also apply to the use of the 
spectrum leased by the spectrum lessee.
    (2) General eligibility rules. (i) The spectrum lessee must meet the 
same eligibility and qualification requirements that are applicable to 
the licensee under its license authorization, with the following 
exceptions. A spectrum lessee entering into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement involving a licensee in the Educational Broadband Service 
(see Sec. 27.1201 of this chapter) is not required to comply with the 
eligibility requirements pertaining to such a licensee so long as the 
spectrum lessee meets the other eligibility and qualification 
requirements applicable to part 27 services (see Sec. 27.12 of this 
chapter). A spectrum lessee entering into a spectrum leasing arrangement 
involving a licensee in the Public Safety Radio Services (see part 90, 
subpart B and Sec. 90.311(a)(1)(i) of this chapter) is not required to 
comply with the eligibility requirements pertaining to such a licensee 
so long as the spectrum lessee is an entity providing communications in 
support of public safety operations (see Sec. 90.523(b) of this 
chapter).
    (ii) The spectrum lessee must meet applicable foreign ownership 
eligibility

[[Page 401]]

requirements (see sections 310(a), 310(b) of the Communications Act).
    (iii) The spectrum lessee must satisfy any qualification 
requirements, including character qualifications, applicable to the 
licensee under its license authorization.
    (iv) The spectrum lessee must not be a person subject to the denial 
of Federal benefits under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (see Sec. 
1.2001 et seq. of subpart P of this part).
    (v) The licensee may reasonably rely on the spectrum lessee's 
certifications that it meets the requisite eligibility and qualification 
requirements contained in the notification required by this section.
    (3) Use restrictions. To the extent that the licensee is restricted 
from using the licensed spectrum to offer particular services under its 
license authorization, the use restrictions apply to the spectrum lessee 
as well.
    (4) Designated entity/entrepreneur rules. A licensee that holds a 
license pursuant to small business and/or entrepreneur provisions (see 
Sec. 1.2110 and Sec. 24.709 of this chapter) and continues to be 
subject to unjust enrichment requirements (see Sec. 1.2111 and Sec. 
24.714 of this chapter) and/or transfer restrictions (see Sec. 24.839 
of this chapter) may enter into a spectrum manager leasing arrangement 
with a spectrum lessee, regardless of whether the spectrum lessee meets 
the Commission's designated entity eligibility requirements (see Sec. 
1.2110) or its entrepreneur eligibility requirements to hold certain C 
and F block licenses in the broadband personal communications services 
(see Sec. 1.2110 and Sec. 24.709 of this chapter), so long as the 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement does not result in the spectrum 
lessee's becoming a ``controlling interest'' or ``affiliate'' (see Sec. 
1.2110) of the licensee such that the licensee would lose its 
eligibility as a designated entity or entrepreneur. To the extent there 
is any conflict between the revised de facto control standard for 
spectrum leasing arrangements, as set forth in this subpart, and the 
definition of controlling interest (including its de facto control 
standard) set forth in Sec. 1.2110, the latter definition governs for 
determining whether the licensee has maintained the requisite degree of 
ownership and control to allow it to remain eligible for the license or 
for other benefits such as bidding credits and installment payments.
    (5) Construction/performance requirements. Any performance or build-
out requirement applicable under a license authorization (e.g., a 
requirement that the licensee construct and operate one or more specific 
facilities, cover a certain percentage of geographic area, cover a 
certain percentage of population, or provide substantial service) always 
remains a condition of the license, and legal responsibility for meeting 
such obligation is not delegable to the spectrum lessee(s).
    (i) The licensee may attribute to itself the build-out or 
performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of 
complying with any applicable performance or build-out requirement.
    (ii) If a licensee relies on the activities of a spectrum lessee to 
meet the licensee's performance or build-out obligation, and the 
spectrum lessee fails to engage in those activities, the Commission will 
enforce the applicable performance or build-out requirements against the 
licensee, consistent with the applicable rules.
    (iii) If there are rules applicable to the license concerning the 
discontinuance of operation, the licensee is accountable for any such 
discontinuance and the rules will be enforced against the licensee 
regardless of whether the licensee was relying on the activities of a 
lessee to meet particular performance requirements.
    (6) Regulatory classification. If the regulatory status of the 
licensee (e.g., common carrier or non-common carrier status) is 
prescribed by rule, the regulatory status of the spectrum lessee is 
prescribed in the same manner, except that Sec. 20.9(a) of this chapter 
shall not preclude a licensee in the services covered by that rule from 
entering into a spectrum leasing arrangement with a spectrum lessee that 
chooses to operate on a Private Mobile Radio Service (PMRS), private, or 
non-commercial basis.
    (7) Regulatory fees. The licensee remains responsible for payment of 
the required regulatory fees that must be paid in advance of its license 
term (see

[[Page 402]]

Sec. 1.1152). Where, however, regulatory fees are paid annually on a 
per-unit basis (such as for Commercial Mobile Radio Services (CMRS) 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1152), the licensee and spectrum lessee are each 
required to pay fees for those units associated with its respective 
operations.
    (8) E911 requirements. If E911 obligations apply to the licensee 
(see Sec. 20.18 of this chapter), the licensee retains the obligations 
with respect to leased spectrum.
    (e) Notifications regarding spectrum manager leasing arrangements. A 
licensee that seeks to enter into a spectrum manager leasing arrangement 
must notify the Commission of the arrangement in advance of the spectrum 
lessee's commencement of operations. The spectrum manager lease 
notification will be processed pursuant either to the general 
notification procedures or the immediate processing procedures, as set 
forth herein. The licensee must submit the notification to the 
Commission by electronic filing using the Universal Licensing System 
(ULS) and FCC Form 608, except that a licensee falling within the 
provisions of Sec. 1.913(d) may file the notification either 
electronically or manually.
    (1) General notification procedures. Notifications of spectrum 
manager leasing arrangements will be processed pursuant the general 
notification procedures set forth in this paragraph unless they are 
submitted and qualify for the immediate processing procedures set forth 
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (i) To be accepted under these general notification procedures, the 
notification must be sufficiently complete and contain all information 
and certifications requested on the applicable form, FCC Form 608, 
including any information and certifications (including those of the 
spectrum lessee relating to eligibility, basic qualifications, and 
foreign ownership) required by the rules in this chapter and any rules 
pertaining to the specific service for which the notification is filed. 
No application fees are required for the filing of a spectrum manager 
leasing notification.
    (ii) The licensee must submit such notification at least 21 days in 
advance of commencing operations unless the arrangement is for a term of 
one year or less, in which case the licensee must provide notification 
to the Commission at least ten (10) days in advance of operation. If the 
licensee and spectrum lessee thereafter seek to extend this leasing 
arrangement for an additional term beyond the initial term, the licensee 
must provide the Commission with notification of the new spectrum 
leasing arrangement at least 21 days in advance of operation under the 
extended term.
    (iii) A notification filed pursuant to these general notification 
procedures will be placed on an informational public notice on a weekly 
basis (see Sec. 1.933(a)) once accepted, and is subject to 
reconsideration (see Sec. Sec. 1.106(f), 1.108, 1.113).
    (2) Immediate processing procedures. Notifications that meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section qualify for the 
immediate processing procedures.
    (i) To qualify for these immediate processing procedures, the 
notification must be sufficiently complete and contain all necessary 
information and certifications (including those relating to eligibility, 
basic qualifications, and foreign ownership) required for notifications 
processed under the general notification procedures set forth in 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, and also must establish, through 
certifications, that the following additional qualifications are met:
    (A) The license does not involve spectrum licensed in a Wireless 
Radio Service that may be used to provide interconnected mobile voice 
and/or data services under the applicable service rules and that would, 
if the spectrum leasing arrangement were consummated, create a 
geographic overlap with spectrum in any licensed Wireless Service 
(including the same service) in which the proposed spectrum lessee 
already holds a direct or indirect interest of 10% or more (see Sec. 
1.2112), either as a licensee or a spectrum lessee, and that could be 
used by the spectrum lessee to provide interconnected mobile voice and/
or data services;
    (B) The licensee is not a designated entity or entrepreneur subject 
to unjust enrichment requirements and/or

[[Page 403]]

transfer restrictions under applicable Commission rules (see Sec. Sec. 
1.2110 and 1.2111, and Sec. Sec. 24.709, 24.714, and 24.839 of this 
chapter); and,
    (C) The spectrum leasing arrangement does not require a waiver of, 
or declaratory ruling pertaining to, any applicable Commission rules.
    (ii) Provided that the notification establishes that the proposed 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement meets all of the requisite elements 
to qualify for these immediate processing procedures, ULS will reflect 
that the notification has been accepted. If a qualifying notification is 
filed electronically, the acceptance will be reflected in ULS on the 
next business day after filing of the notification; if filed manually, 
the acceptance will be reflected in ULS on the next business day after 
the necessary data from the manually filed notification is entered into 
ULS. Once the notification has been accepted, as reflected in ULS, the 
spectrum lessee may commence operations under the spectrum leasing 
arrangement, consistent with the term of the arrangement.
    (iii) A notification filed pursuant to these immediate processing 
procedures will be placed on an informational public notice on a weekly 
basis (see Sec. 1.933(a)) once accepted, and is subject to 
reconsideration (see Sec. Sec. 1.106(f), 1.108, 1.113).
    (f) Effective date of a spectrum manager leasing arrangement. The 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement will be deemed effective in the 
Commission's records, and for purposes of the application of the rules 
set forth in this section, as of the beginning date of the term as 
specified in the spectrum leasing notification.
    (g) Commission termination of a spectrum manager leasing 
arrangement. The Commission retains the right to investigate and 
terminate any spectrum manager leasing arrangement if it determines, 
post-notification, that the arrangement constitutes an unauthorized 
transfer of de facto control of the leased spectrum, is otherwise in 
violation of the rules in this chapter, or raises foreign ownership, 
competitive, or other public interest concerns. Information concerning 
any such termination will be placed on public notice.
    (h) Expiration, extension, or termination of a spectrum leasing 
arrangement. (1) Absent Commission termination or except as provided in 
paragraph (h)(2) or (h)(3) of this section, a spectrum leasing 
arrangement entered into pursuant to this section will expire on the 
termination date set forth in the spectrum leasing notification.
    (2) A spectrum leasing arrangement may be extended beyond the 
initial term set forth in the spectrum leasing notification provided 
that the licensee notifies the Commission of the extension in advance of 
operation under the extended term and does so pursuant to the general 
notification procedures or immediate processing procedures set forth in 
this section, whichever is applicable. If the general notification 
procedures are applicable, the licensee must notify the Commission at 
least 21 days in advance of operation under the extended term.
    (3) If a spectrum leasing arrangement is terminated earlier than the 
termination date set forth in the notification, either by the licensee 
or by the parties' mutual agreement, the licensee must file a 
notification with the Commission, no later than ten (10) days after the 
early termination, indicating the date of the termination. If the 
parties fail to put the spectrum leasing arrangement into effect, they 
must so notify the Commission consistent with the provisions of this 
section.
    (4) The Commission will place information concerning an extension or 
an early termination of a spectrum leasing arrangement on public notice.
    (i) Assignment of a spectrum leasing arrangement. The spectrum 
lessee may assign its spectrum leasing arrangement to another entity 
provided that the licensee has agreed to such an assignment, is in 
privity with the assignee, and notifies the Commission before the 
consummation of the assignment, pursuant to the applicable notification 
procedures set forth in this section. In the case of a non-substantial 
(pro forma) assignment that falls within the class of pro forma 
transactions for which prior Commission approval would not be required 
under Sec. 1.948(c)(1), the licensee must file notification of the 
assignment with the Commission, using FCC Form 608 and

[[Page 404]]

providing any necessary updates of ownership information, within 30 days 
of its completion. The Commission will place information related to the 
assignment, whether substantial or pro forma, on public notice.
    (j) Transfer of control of a spectrum lessee. The licensee must 
notify the Commission of any transfer of control of a spectrum lessee 
before the consummation of the transfer of control, pursuant to the 
applicable notification procedures of this section. In the case of a 
non-substantial (pro forma) transfer of control that falls within the 
class of pro forma transactions for which prior Commission approval 
would not be required under Sec. 1.948(c)(1), the licensee must file 
notification of the transfer of control with the Commission, using FCC 
Form 608 and providing any necessary updates of ownership information, 
within 30 days of its completion. The Commission will place information 
related to the transfer of control, whether substantial or pro forma, on 
public notice.
    (k) Revocation or automatic cancellation of a license or a spectrum 
lessee's operating authority. (1) In the event an authorization held by 
a licensee that has entered into a spectrum leasing arrangement is 
revoked or cancelled, the spectrum lessee will be required to terminate 
its operations no later than the date on which the licensee ceases to 
have any authority to operate under the license, except as provided in 
paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (2) In the event of a license revocation or cancellation, the 
Commission will consider a request by the spectrum lessee for special 
temporary authority (see Sec. 1.931) to provide the spectrum lessee 
with an opportunity to transition its users in order to minimize service 
disruption to business and other activities.
    (3) In the event of a license revocation or cancellation, and the 
required termination of the spectrum lessee's operations, the former 
spectrum lessee does not, as a result of its former status, receive any 
preference over any other party should the spectrum lessee seek to 
obtain the revoked or cancelled license.
    (l) Subleasing. A spectrum lessee may sublease the leased spectrum 
usage rights subject to the licensee's consent and the licensee's 
establishment of privity with the spectrum sublessee. The licensee must 
submit a notification regarding the spectrum subleasing arrangement in 
accordance with the applicable notification procedures set forth in this 
section.
    (m) Renewal. Although the term of a spectrum manager leasing 
arrangement may not be longer than the term of a license authorization, 
a licensee and spectrum lessee that have entered into an arrangement 
whose term continues to the end of the current term of the license 
authorization may, contingent on the Commission's grant of the license 
renewal, renew the spectrum leasing arrangement to extend into the term 
of the renewed license authorization. The Commission must be notified of 
the renewal of the spectrum leasing arrangement at the same time that 
the licensee submits its application for license renewal (see Sec. 
1.949). The spectrum lessee may operate under the extended term, without 
further action by the Commission, until such time as the Commission 
shall make a final determination with respect to the renewal of the 
license authorization and the extension of the spectrum leasing 
arrangement into the term of the renewed license authorization.

[68 FR 66277, Nov. 25, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 72027, Dec. 10, 2004; 
69 FR 77551, Dec. 27, 2004]

    Effective Date Note: At 69 FR 77551, Dec. 27, 2004, Sec. 
1.9020(e)(2) was revised. This paragraph contains information collection 
and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until 
approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 1.9030  Long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangements.

    (a) Overview. Under the provisions of this section, a licensee (in 
any of the included services) and a spectrum lessee may enter into a 
long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement in which the licensee 
retains de jure control of the license while de facto control of the 
leased spectrum is transferred to the spectrum lessee for the duration 
of the spectrum leasing arrangement, subject to prior Commission consent 
pursuant to the application procedures set forth in this section. A 
``long-term'' de facto

[[Page 405]]

transfer leasing arrangement has an individual term, or series of 
combined terms, of more than one year. The term of a long-term de facto 
transfer leasing arrangement may be no longer than the term of the 
license authorization.
    (b) Rights and responsibilities of the licensee. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the licensee is relieved 
of primary and direct responsibility for ensuring that the spectrum 
lessee's operations comply with the Communications Act and Commission 
policies and rules.
    (2) The licensee is responsible for its own violations, including 
those related to its spectrum leasing arrangement with the spectrum 
lessee, and for ongoing violations or other egregious behavior on the 
part of the spectrum lessee about which the licensee has knowledge or 
should have knowledge.
    (3) The licensee must retain a copy of the spectrum leasing 
agreement and make it available upon request by the Commission.
    (c) Rights and responsibilities of the spectrum lessee. (1) The 
spectrum lessee assumes primary responsibility for complying with the 
Communications Act and applicable Commission policies and rules.
    (2) The spectrum lessee is granted an instrument of authorization 
pertaining to the de facto transfer leasing arrangement that brings it 
within the scope of the Commission's direct forfeiture provisions under 
section 503(b) of the Communications Act.
    (3) The spectrum lessee is responsible for interacting with the 
Commission regarding the leased spectrum and for making all related 
filings (e.g., all applications and notifications, submissions of any 
materials required to support a required Environmental Assessment, any 
reports required by Commission rules and applicable to the lessee, 
information necessary to facilitate international or Interdepartment 
Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) coordination).
    (4) The spectrum lessee is required to maintain accurate information 
on file pursuant to Commission rules (see Sec. 1.65 of subpart A of 
this part).
    (5) The spectrum lessee must retain a copy of the spectrum leasing 
agreement and make it available upon request by the Commission.
    (d) Applicability of particular service rules and policies. Under a 
long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement, the service rules and 
policies apply in the following manner to the licensee and spectrum 
lessee:
    (1) Interference-related rules. The interference and radiofrequency 
(RF) safety rules applicable to use of the spectrum by the licensee as a 
condition of its license authorization also apply to the use of the 
spectrum leased by the spectrum lessee.
    (2) General eligibility rules. (i) The spectrum lessee must meet the 
same eligibility and qualification requirements that are applicable to 
the licensee under its license authorization. A spectrum lessee entering 
into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving a licensee in the 
Educational Broadband Service (see Sec. 27.1201 of this chapter) is not 
required to comply with the eligibility requirements pertaining to such 
a licensee so long as the spectrum lessee meets the other eligibility 
and qualification requirements applicable to part 27 services (see Sec. 
27.12 of this chapter). A spectrum lessee entering into a spectrum 
leasing arrangement involving a licensee in the Public Safety Radio 
Services (see part 90, subpart B and Sec. 90.311(a)(1)(i) of this 
chapter) is not required to comply with the eligibility requirements 
pertaining to such a licensee so long as the spectrum lessee is an 
entity providing communications in support of public safety operations 
(see Sec. 90.523(b) of this chapter).
    (ii) The spectrum lessee must meet applicable foreign ownership 
eligibility requirements (see sections 310(a), 310(b) of the 
Communications Act).
    (iii) The spectrum lessee must satisfy any qualification 
requirements, including character qualifications, applicable to the 
licensee under its license authorization.
    (iv) The spectrum lessee must not be a person subject to denial of 
Federal benefits under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (see Sec. 1.2001 
et seq. of subpart P of this part).
    (3) Use restrictions. To the extent that the licensee is restricted 
from using

[[Page 406]]

the licensed spectrum to offer particular services under its license 
authorization, the use restrictions apply to the spectrum lessee as 
well.
    (4) Designated entity/entrepreneur rules. (i) A licensee that holds 
a license pursuant to small business and/or entrepreneur provisions (see 
Sec. 1.2110 and Sec. 24.709 of this chapter) and continues to be 
subject to unjust enrichment requirements (see Sec. 1.2111 and Sec. 
24.714 of this chapter) and/or transfer restrictions (see Sec. 24.839 
of this chapter) may enter into a long-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangement with any entity under the streamlined processing procedures 
described in this section, subject to any applicable unjust enrichment 
payment obligations and/or transfer restrictions (see Sec. 1.2111 and 
Sec. 24.839 of this chapter).
    (ii) A licensee holding a license won in closed bidding (see Sec. 
24.709 of this chapter) may, during the first five years of the license 
term, enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement with an entity not 
eligible to hold such a license pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 
24.709(a) of this chapter so long as it has met its five-year 
construction requirement (see Sec. Sec. 24.203, 24.839(a)(6) of this 
chapter).
    (iii) The amount of any unjust enrichment payment will be determined 
by the Commission as part of its review of the application under the 
same rules that apply in the context of a license assignment or transfer 
of control (see Sec. 1.2111 and Sec. 24.714 of this chapter). If the 
spectrum leasing arrangement involves only part of the license area and/
or part of the bandwidth covered by the license, the unjust enrichment 
obligation will be apportioned as though the license were being 
partitioned and/or disaggregated (see Sec. 1.2111(e) and Sec. 
24.714(c) of this chapter). A licensee will receive no reduction in its 
unjust enrichment payment obligation for a spectrum leasing arrangement 
that ends prior to the end of the fifth year of the license term.
    (iv) A licensee that participates in the Commission's installment 
payment program (see Sec. 1.2110(g) may enter into a long-term de facto 
transfer leasing arrangement without triggering unjust enrichment 
obligations provided that the lessee would qualify for as favorable a 
category of installment payments. A licensee using installment payment 
financing that seeks to lease to an entity not meeting the eligibility 
standards for as favorable a category of installment payments must make 
full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest 
accrued through the effective date of the spectrum leasing arrangement 
(see Sec. 1.2111(c)). This requirement applies regardless of whether 
the licensee is leasing all or a portion of its bandwidth and/or license 
area.
    (5) Construction/performance requirements. Any performance or build-
out requirement applicable under a license authorization (e.g., a 
requirement that the licensee construct and operate one or more specific 
facilities, cover a certain percentage of geographic area, cover a 
certain percentage of population, or provide substantial service) always 
remains a condition of the license, and the legal responsibility for 
meeting such obligation is not delegable to the spectrum lessee(s).
    (i) The licensee may attribute to itself the build-out or 
performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of 
complying with any applicable build-out or performance requirement.
    (ii) If a licensee relies on the activities of a spectrum lessee to 
meet the licensee's performance or build-out obligation, and the 
spectrum lessee fails to engage in those activities, the Commission will 
enforce the applicable performance or build-out requirements against the 
licensee, consistent with the applicable rules.
    (iii) If there are rules applicable to the license concerning the 
discontinuance of operation, the licensee is accountable for any such 
discontinuance and the rules will be enforced against the licensee 
regardless of whether the licensee was relying on the activities of a 
lessee to meet particular performance requirements.
    (6) Regulatory classification. If the regulatory status of the 
licensee (e.g., common carrier or non-common carrier status) is 
prescribed by rule, the regulatory status of the spectrum lessee is 
prescribed in the same manner, except that Sec. 20.9(a) of this chapter 
shall not preclude a licensee in the

[[Page 407]]

services covered by that rule from entering into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement with a spectrum lessee that chooses to operate on a PMRS, 
private, or non-commercial basis.
    (7) Regulatory fees. The licensee remains responsible for payment of 
the required regulatory fees that must be paid in advance of its license 
term (see Sec. 1.1152). Where, however, regulatory fees are paid 
annually on a per-unit basis (such as for CMRS services pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1152), the licensee and spectrum lessee each are required to pay 
fees for those units associated with its respective operations.
    (8) E911 requirements. To the extent the licensee is required to 
meet E911 obligations (see Sec. 20.18 of this chapter), the spectrum 
lessee is required to meet those obligations with respect to the 
spectrum leased under the spectrum leasing arrangement insofar as the 
spectrum lessee's operations are encompassed within the E911 
obligations.
    (e) Applications for long-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangements. Applications for long-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangements will be processed either pursuant to the general approval 
procedures or the immediate approval procedures, as discussed herein. 
Spectrum leasing parties must submit the application by electronic 
filing using ULS and FCC Form 608, and obtain Commission consent prior 
to consummating the transfer of de facto control of the leased spectrum, 
except that parties falling within the provisions of Sec. 1.913(d) may 
file the application either electronically or manually.
    (1) General approval procedures. Applications for long-term de facto 
transfer leasing arrangements will be processed pursuant to the general 
approval procedures set forth in this paragraph unless they are 
submitted and qualify for the immediate approval procedures set forth in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (i) To be accepted for filing under these general approval 
procedures, the application must be sufficiently complete and contain 
all information and certifications requested on the applicable form, FCC 
Form 608, including any information and certifications (including those 
of the spectrum lessee relating to eligibility, basic qualifications, 
and foreign ownership) required by the rules in this chapter and any 
rules pertaining to the specific service for which the application is 
filed. In addition, the spectrum leasing application must include 
payment of the required application fee(s); for purposes of determining 
the applicable application fee(s), the application will be treated as a 
transfer of control (see Sec. 1.1102).
    (ii) Once accepted for filing, the application will be placed on 
public notice, except no prior public notice will be required for 
applications involving authorizations in the Private Wireless Services, 
as specified in Sec. 1.933(d)(9).
    (iii) Petitions to deny filed in accordance with section 309(d) of 
the Communications Act must comply with the provisions of Sec. 1.939, 
except that such petitions must be filed no later than 14 days following 
the date of the public notice listing the application as accepted for 
filing.
    (iv) No later than 21 days following the date of the public notice 
listing an application as accepted for filing, the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) will affirmatively consent to the 
application, deny the application, or determine to subject the 
application to further review. For applications for which no prior 
public notice is required, the Bureau will affirmatively consent to the 
application, deny the application, or determine to subject the 
application to further review no later than 21 days following the date 
on which the application has been filed and any required application fee 
has been paid (see Sec. 1.1102).
    (v) If the Bureau determines to subject the application to further 
review, it will issue a public notice so indicating. Within 90 days 
following the date of that public notice, the Bureau will either take 
action upon the application or provide public notice that an additional 
90-day period for review is needed.
    (vi) Consent to the application is not deemed granted until the 
Bureau affirmatively acts upon the application.
    (vii) Grant of consent to the application will be reflected in a 
public notice (see Sec. 1.933(a)) promptly issued after the grant, and 
is subject to reconsideration (see Sec. Sec. 1.106(f), 1.108, 1.113).
    (viii) If any petition to deny is filed, and the Bureau grants the 
application,

[[Page 408]]

the Bureau will deny the petition(s) and issue a concise statement of 
the reason(s) for denial, disposing of all substantive issues raised in 
the petition(s).
    (2) Immediate approval procedures. Applications that meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section qualify for the 
immediate approval procedures.
    (i) To qualify for the immediate approval procedures, the 
application must be sufficiently complete, contain all necessary 
information and certifications (including those relating to eligibility, 
basic qualifications, and foreign ownership), and include payment of the 
requisite application fee(s), as required for an application processed 
under the general approval procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i) 
of this section, and also must establish, through certifications, that 
the following additional qualifications are met:
    (A) The license does not involve spectrum licensed in a Wireless 
Radio Service that may be used to provide interconnected mobile voice 
and/or data services under the applicable service rules and that would, 
if the spectrum leasing arrangement were consummated, create a 
geographic overlap with spectrum in any licensed Wireless Service 
(including the same service) in which the proposed spectrum lessee 
already holds a direct or indirect interest of 10% or more (see Sec. 
1.2112), either as a licensee or a spectrum lessee, and that could be 
used by the spectrum lessee to provide interconnected mobile voice and/
or data services;
    (B) The licensee is not a designated entity or entrepreneur subject 
to unjust enrichment requirements and/or transfer restrictions under 
applicable Commission rules (see Sec. Sec. 1.2110 and 1.2111, and 
Sec. Sec. 24.709, 24.714, and 24.839 of this chapter); and,
    (C) The spectrum leasing arrangement does not require a waiver of, 
or declaratory ruling pertaining to, any applicable Commission rules.
    (ii) Provided that the application establishes that it meets all of 
the requisite elements to qualify for these immediate approval 
procedures, consent to the de facto transfer spectrum leasing 
arrangement will be reflected in ULS. If the application is filed 
electronically, consent will be reflected in ULS on the next business 
day after filing of the application; if filed manually, consent will be 
reflected in ULS on the next business day after the necessary data from 
the manually filed application is entered into ULS. Consent to the 
application is not deemed granted until the Bureau affirmatively acts 
upon the application, as reflected in ULS.
    (iii) Grant of consent to the application under these immediate 
approval procedures will be reflected in a public notice (see Sec. 
1.933(a)) promptly issued after grant, and is subject to reconsideration 
(see Sec. Sec. 1.106(f), 1.108, 1.113).
    (f) Effective date of a de facto transfer leasing arrangement. If 
the Commission consents to the de facto transfer leasing arrangement, 
the de facto transfer leasing arrangement will be deemed effective in 
the Commission's records, and for purposes of the application of the 
rules set forth in this section, on the date set forth in the 
application. If the Commission consents to the arrangement after that 
specified date, the spectrum leasing application will become effective 
on the date of the Commission affirmative consent.
    (g) Expiration, extension, or termination of spectrum leasing 
arrangement. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) or (g)(3) of 
this section, a spectrum leasing arrangement entered into pursuant to 
this section will expire on the termination date set forth in the 
application. The Commission's consent to the de facto transfer leasing 
application includes consent to return the leased spectrum to the 
licensee at the end of the term of the spectrum leasing arrangement.
    (2) A spectrum leasing arrangement may be extended beyond the 
initial term set forth in the spectrum leasing application pursuant to 
the applicable application procedures set forth in Sec. 1.9030(e). 
Where there is pending before the Commission at the date of termination 
of the spectrum leasing arrangement a proper and timely application 
seeking to extend the arrangement, the parties may continue to operate 
under the original spectrum leasing arrangement without further action 
by the Commission until such

[[Page 409]]

time as the Commission shall make a final determination with respect to 
the application.
    (3) If a spectrum leasing arrangement is terminated earlier than the 
termination date set forth in the notification, either by the licensee 
or by the parties' mutual agreement, the licensee must file a 
notification with the Commission, no later than ten (10) days after the 
early termination, indicating the date of the termination. If the 
parties fail to put the spectrum leasing arrangement into effect, they 
must so notify the Commission consistent with the provisions of this 
section.
    (4) The Commission will place information concerning an extension or 
an early termination of a spectrum leasing arrangement on public notice.
    (h) Assignment of spectrum leasing arrangement. The spectrum lessee 
may assign its lease to another entity provided that the licensee has 
agreed to such an assignment, there is privity between the licensee and 
the assignee, and the assignment is approved by the Commission pursuant 
to the same application and approval procedures set forth in this 
section. In the case of a non-substantial (pro forma) assignment that 
falls within the class of pro forma transactions for which prior 
Commission approval would not be required under Sec. 1.948(c)(1), the 
parties involved in the assignment must file notification of the 
assignment with the Commission, using FCC Form 608 and providing any 
necessary updates of ownership information, within 30 days of its 
completion. The Commission will place information related to the 
assignment, whether substantial or pro forma, on public notice.
    (i) Transfer of control of a spectrum lessee. A spectrum lessee 
seeking the transfer of control must obtain Commission consent using the 
same application and Commission consent procedures set forth in this 
section. In the case of a non-substantial (pro forma) transfer of 
control that falls within the class of pro forma transactions for which 
prior Commission approval would not be required under Sec. 1.948(c)(1), 
the parties involved in the transfer of control must file notification 
of the transfer of control with the Commission, using FCC Form 608 and 
providing any necessary updates of ownership information, within 30 days 
of its completion. The Commission will place information related to the 
transfer of control, whether substantial or pro forma, on public notice.
    (j) Revocation or automatic cancellation of a license or the 
spectrum lessee's operating authority. (1) In the event an authorization 
held by a licensee that has entered into a spectrum leasing arrangement 
is revoked or cancelled, the spectrum lessee will be required to 
terminate its operations no later than the date on which the licensee 
ceases to have authority to operate under the license, except as 
provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (2) In the event of a license revocation or cancellation, the 
Commission will consider a request by the spectrum lessee for special 
temporary authority (see Sec. 1.931) to provide the spectrum lessee 
with an opportunity to transition its users in order to minimize service 
disruption to business and other activities.
    (3) In the event of a license revocation or cancellation, and the 
required termination of the spectrum lessee's operations, the former 
spectrum lessee does not, as a result of its former status, receive any 
preference over any other party should the spectrum lessee seek to 
obtain the revoked or cancelled license.
    (k) Subleasing. A spectrum lessee may sublease spectrum usage rights 
subject to the following conditions. Parties entering into a spectrum 
subleasing arrangement are required to comply with the Commission's 
rules for obtaining approval for spectrum leasing arrangements provided 
in this subpart and are governed by those same policies. The application 
filed by parties to a spectrum subleasing arrangement must include 
written consent from the licensee to the proposed arrangement. Once a 
spectrum subleasing arrangement has been approved by the Commission, the 
sublessee becomes the party primarily responsible for compliance with 
Commission rules and policies.
    (l) Renewal. Although the term of a long-term de facto transfer 
spectrum leasing arrangement may not be longer than the term of a 
license authorization, a licensee and spectrum lessee

[[Page 410]]

that have entered into an arrangement whose term continues to the end of 
the current term of the license authorization may, contingent on the 
Commission's grant of the license renewal, extend the spectrum leasing 
arrangement into the term of the renewed license authorization. The 
Commission must be notified of the renewal of the spectrum leasing 
arrangement at the same time that the licensee submits its application 
for license renewal (see Sec. 1.949). The spectrum lessee may operate 
under the extended term, without further action by the Commission, until 
such time as the Commission shall make a final determination with 
respect to the renewal of the license authorization and the extension of 
the spectrum leasing arrangement into the term of the renewed license 
authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 1.9035  Short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangements.

    (a) Overview. Under the provisions of this section, a licensee (in 
any of the included services) and a spectrum lessee may enter into a 
short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement in which the licensee 
retains de jure control of the license while de facto control of the 
leased spectrum is transferred to the spectrum lessee for the duration 
of the spectrum leasing arrangement, subject to prior Commission consent 
pursuant to the application procedures set forth in this section. A 
``short-term'' de facto transfer leasing arrangement has an individual 
or combined term of not longer than one year. The term of a short-term 
de facto transfer leasing arrangement may be no longer than the term of 
the license authorization.
    (b) Rights and responsibilities of licensee. The rights and 
responsibilities applicable to a licensee that enters into a short-term 
de facto transfer leasing arrangement are the same as those applicable 
to a licensee that enters into a long-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangement, as set forth in Sec. 1.9030(b).
    (c) Rights and responsibilities of spectrum lessee. The rights and 
responsibilities applicable to a spectrum lessee that enters into a 
short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement are the same as those 
applicable to a spectrum lessee that enters into a long-term de facto 
transfer leasing arrangement, as set forth in Sec. 1.9030(c).
    (d) Applicability of particular service rules and policies. Under a 
short-term de facto leasing arrangement, the service rules and policies 
apply to the licensee and spectrum lessee in the same manner as under 
long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangements (see Sec. 1.9030(d)), 
except as provided herein:
    (1) Use restrictions and regulatory classification. Use restrictions 
applicable to the licensee also apply to the spectrum lessee except that 
Sec. 20.9(a) of this chapter shall not preclude a licensee in the 
services covered by that rule from entering into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement with a spectrum lessee that chooses to operate on a PMRS, 
private, or non-commercial basis, and except that a licensee with an 
authorization that restricts use of spectrum to non-commercial uses may 
enter into a short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement that 
allows the spectrum lessee to use the spectrum commercially.
    (2) Designated entity/entrepreneur rules. Unjust enrichment 
provisions (see Sec. 1.2111) and transfer restrictions (see Sec. 
24.839 of this chapter) do not apply with regard to a short-term de 
facto transfer leasing arrangement.
    (3) Construction/performance requirements. The licensee is not 
permitted to attribute to itself the activities of its spectrum lessee 
when seeking to establish that performance or build-out requirements 
applicable to the licensee have been met.
    (4) E911 requirements. If E911 obligations apply to the licensee 
(see Sec. 20.18 of this chapter), the licensee retains the obligations 
with respect to leased spectrum. A spectrum lessee entering into a 
short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement is not separately 
required

[[Page 411]]

to comply with any such obligations in relation to the leased spectrum.
    (e) Spectrum leasing application. Short-term de facto transfer 
leasing arrangements will be processed pursuant to immediate approval 
procedures, as discussed herein. Parties entering into a short-term de 
facto transfer leasing arrangement are required to file an electronic 
application with the Commission, using FCC Form 608, and obtain 
Commission consent prior to consummating the transfer of de facto 
control of the leased spectrum, except that parties falling within the 
provisions of Sec. 1.913(d) may file the application either 
electronically or manually.
    (1) To be accepted for filing under these immediate approval 
procedures, the application must be sufficiently complete and contain 
all information and certifications requested on the applicable form, FCC 
Form 608, including any information and certifications (including those 
relating to the spectrum lessee relating to eligibility, basic 
qualifications, and foreign ownership) required by the rules of this 
chapter and any rules pertaining to the specific service for which the 
application is required. In addition, the application must include 
payment of the required application fee; for purposes of determining the 
applicable application fee, the application will be treated as a 
transfer of control (see Sec. 1.1102). Finally, the spectrum leasing 
arrangement must not require a waiver of, or declaratory ruling, 
pertaining to any applicable Commission rules.
    (2) Provided that the application establishes that it meets all of 
the requisite elements to qualify for these immediate approval 
procedures, consent to the short-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing 
arrangement will be reflected in ULS. If the application is filed 
electronically, consent will be reflected in ULS on the next business 
day after filing of the application; if filed manually, consent will be 
reflected in ULS on the next business day after the necessary data from 
the manually filed application is entered into ULS. Consent to the 
application is not deemed granted until the Bureau affirmatively acts 
upon the application, as reflected in ULS.
    (3) Grant of consent to the application under these procedures will 
be reflected in a public notice (see Sec. 1.933(a)) promptly issued 
after grant, and is subject to reconsideration (see Sec. Sec. 1.106(f), 
1.108, 1.113).
    (f) Effective date of spectrum leasing arrangement. The spectrum 
leasing arrangement will be deemed effective in the Commission's 
records, and for purposes of the application of the rules set forth in 
this section, on the date set forth in the application. If the 
Commission consents to the arrangement after that specified date, the 
spectrum leasing application will become effective on the date of the 
Commission affirmative consent.
    (g) Restrictions on the use of short-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangements. (1) The licensee and spectrum lessee are not permitted to 
use the special rules and expedited procedures applicable to short-term 
de facto transfer leasing arrangements for arrangements that in fact 
will exceed one year, or that the parties reasonably expect to exceed 
one year.
    (2) The licensee and spectrum lessee must submit, in sufficient time 
prior to the expiration of the short-term de facto transfer spectrum 
leasing arrangement, the appropriate application under the rules and 
procedures applicable to long-term de facto leasing arrangements, and 
obtain Commission consent pursuant to those procedures.
    (h) Expiration, extension, or termination of the spectrum leasing 
arrangement. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) or (h)(3) of 
this section, a spectrum leasing arrangement entered into pursuant to 
this section will expire on the termination date set forth in the short-
term de facto transfer leasing arrangement. The Commission's approval of 
the short-term de facto transfer leasing application includes consent to 
return the leased spectrum to the licensee at the end of the term of the 
spectrum leasing arrangement.
    (2) Upon proper application (see paragraph (e) of this section), a 
short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement may be extended beyond 
the initial term set forth in the application provided that the initial 
term and extension(s) together would not result in a

[[Page 412]]

leasing arrangement that exceeds a total of one year.
    (3) If a spectrum leasing arrangement is terminated earlier than the 
termination date set forth in the notification, either by the licensee 
or by the parties' mutual agreement, the licensee must file a 
notification with the Commission, no later than ten (10) days after the 
early termination, indicating the date of the termination. If the 
parties fail to put the spectrum leasing arrangement into effect, they 
must so notify the Commission consistent with the provisions of this 
section.
    (i) Conversion of a short-term spectrum leasing arrangement into a 
long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement. (1) In the event the 
licensee and spectrum lessee involved in a short-term de facto transfer 
leasing arrangement seek to extend the spectrum leasing arrangement 
beyond the one-year limit for short-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangements, the parties may do so provided that they meet the 
conditions set forth in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section.
    (2) If a licensee that holds a license that continues to be subject 
to transfer restrictions and/or requirements relating to unjust 
enrichment pursuant to the Commission's small business and/or 
entrepreneur provisions (see Sec. 1.2110 and Sec. 24.709 of this 
chapter) seeks to extend a short-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangement with its spectrum lessee (or related entities, as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(b)(2)) beyond one year, it may convert its 
arrangement into a long-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing 
arrangement provided that it complies with the procedures for entering 
into a long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement and that it pays 
any unjust enrichment that would have been owed had the licensee filed a 
long-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing application at the time it 
applied for the initial short-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangement.
    (3) The licensee and spectrum lessee are not permitted to convert a 
short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement into a long-term de 
facto transfer leasing arrangement if the parties would have been 
restricted, in the first instance, from entering into a long-term de 
facto transfer leasing arrangement because of a transfer, use, or other 
restriction applicable to the particular service (see Sec. 1.9030).
    (j) Assignment of spectrum leasing arrangement. The rule applicable 
to long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangements (see Sec. 
1.9030(g)) applies in the same manner to short-term de facto transfer 
leasing arrangements.
    (k) Transfer of control of spectrum lessee. The rule applicable to 
long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangements (see Sec. 1.9030(h)) 
applies in the same manner to short-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangements.
    (l) Revocation or automatic cancellation of a license or the 
spectrum lessee's operating authority. The rule applicable to long-term 
de facto transfer leasing arrangements (see Sec. 1.9030(i)) applies in 
the same manner to short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangements.
    (m) Subleasing. A spectrum lessee that has entered into a short-term 
de facto transfer leasing arrangement is not permitted to enter into a 
spectrum subleasing arrangement.
    (n) Renewal. The rule applicable with regard to long-term de facto 
transfer leasing arrangements (see Sec. 1.9030(l)) applies in the same 
manner to short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangements, except that 
the renewal of the short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement to 
extend into the term of the renewed license authorization cannot enable 
the combined terms of the short-term de facto transfer leasing 
arrangements to exceed one year. The Commission must be notified of the 
renewal of the spectrum leasing arrangement at the same time that the 
licensee submits its application for license renewal (see Sec. 1.949).

Sec. 1.9040  Contractual requirements applicable to spectrum leasing arrangements.

    (a) Agreements between licensees and spectrum lessees concerning 
spectrum

[[Page 413]]

leasing arrangements entered into pursuant to the rules of this subpart 
must contain the following provisions:
    (1) The spectrum lessee must comply at all times with applicable 
rules set forth in this chapter and other applicable law, and the 
spectrum leasing arrangement may be revoked, cancelled, or terminated by 
the licensee or Commission if the spectrum lessee fails to comply with 
the applicable requirements;
    (2) If the license is revoked, cancelled, terminated, or otherwise 
ceases to be in effect, the spectrum lessee has no continuing authority 
or right to use the leased spectrum unless otherwise authorized by the 
Commission;
    (3) The spectrum leasing arrangement is not an assignment, sale, or 
transfer of the license itself;
    (4) The spectrum leasing arrangement shall not be assigned to any 
entity that is ineligible or unqualified to enter into a spectrum 
leasing arrangement under the applicable rules as set forth in this 
subpart;
    (5) The licensee shall not consent to an assignment of a spectrum 
leasing arrangement unless such assignment complies with applicable 
Commission rules and regulations.
    (b) Agreements between licensees that hold licenses subject to the 
Commission's installment payment program (see Sec. 1.2110 of subpart Q 
of this part and related service-specific rules) and spectrum lesseeys 
must contain the following additional provisions:
    (1) The express acknowledgement that the license remains subject to 
the Commission's priority lien and security interest in the license and 
related proceeds, consistent with the provisions set forth in Sec. 
1.9045; and
    (2) The agreement that the spectrum lessee shall not hold itself out 
to the public as the holder of the license and shall not hold itself out 
as a licensee by virtue of its having entered into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement.


<R05>
Sec. 1.9045  Requirements for spectrum leasing arrangements entered into by licensees participating in the installment payment program.

    (a) If a licensee that holds a license subject to the Commission's 
installment payment program (see Sec. 1.2110 of subpart Q of this part 
and related service-specific rules) enters into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement pursuant to the rules in this subpart, the licensee remains 
fully and solely responsible for the outstanding debt amount owed to the 
Commission. Nothing in a spectrum leasing arrangement, or arising from a 
spectrum lessee's bankruptcy or receivership, can modify the licensee's 
sole responsibility for its obligation to repay its entire debt 
obligation under the installment payment program pursuant to applicable 
Commission rules and regulations and the associated note(s) and security 
agreement(s).
    (b) If a licensee holds a license subject to the installment payment 
program rules (see Sec. 1.2110 and related service-specific rules), the 
licensee and any spectrum lessee must execute the Commission-approved 
financing documents. No licensee or potential spectrum lessee may file a 
spectrum leasing notification or application without having first 
executed such Commission-approved financing documentation. In addition, 
they must certify in the spectrum leasing notification or application 
that they have both executed such documentation.

<R05>
Sec. 1.9050  Who may sign spectrum leasing notifications and applications.

    Under the rules set forth in this subpart, certain notifications and 
applications to the Commission must be filed by licensees and spectrum 
lessees that enter into spectrum leasing arrangements. In addition, the 
rules require that certain notifications and applications be filed by 
the licensee and/or the spectrum lessee after they have entered into 
such arrangements. Whether the signature of the licensee, the spectrum 
lessee, or both, is required will depend on the particular notification 
or application involved, and whether the leasing arrangement concerns a 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement or a de facto transfer leasing 
arrangement.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
notifications, applications, amendments, and related statements of fact 
required by the Commission (including certifications) must be signed as 
follows (either electronically or manually, see paragraph (d) of this 
section):
    (1) By the licensee or spectrum lessee, if an individual;
    (2) By one of the partners if the licensee or lessee is a 
partnership;
    (3) By an officer, director, or duly authorized employee, if the 
licensee or lessee is a corporation; or
    (4) By a member who is an officer, if the licensee or lessee is an 
unincorporated association.
    (b) Notifications, applications, amendments, and related statements 
of fact required by the Commission may be signed by the licensee or 
spectrum lessee's attorney in case of the licensee's or lessee's 
physical disability or absence from the United States. The attorney 
shall, when applicable, separately set forth the reason why the 
application is not signed by the licensee or lessee. In addition, if any 
matter is stated on the basis of the attorney's belief only (rather than 
knowledge), the attorney shall separately set forth the reasons for 
believing that such statements are true. Only the original of 
notifications, applications, amendments, and related statements of fact 
need be signed.
    (c) Notifications, applications, amendments, and related statements 
of fact need not be signed under oath. Willful false statements made 
therein, however, are punishable by fine and imprisonment (see 18 U.S.C. 
section 1001), and by appropriate administrative sanctions, including 
revocation of license pursuant to section 312(a)(1) of the 
Communications Act of 1934 or revocation of the spectrum leasing 
arrangement.
    (d) ``Signed,'' as used in this section, means, for manually filed 
notifications and applications only, an original hand-written signature 
or, for electronically filed notifications and applications only, an 
electronic signature. An electronic signature shall consist of the name 
of the licensee or spectrum lessee transmitted electronically via ULS 
and entered on the application as a signature.


<R05>
Sec. 1.9055  Assignment of file numbers to spectrum leasing notifications and applications.

    Spectrum leasing notifications or applications submitted pursuant to 
the rules of this subpart are assigned file numbers and service codes in 
order to facilitate processing in the manner in which applications in 
subpart F are assigned file numbers (see Sec. 1.926 of subpart F of 
this part).


<R05>
Sec. 1.9060  Amendments, waivers, and dismissals affecting spectrum leasing notifications and applications.

    (a) Notifications and applications regarding spectrum leasing 
arrangements may be amended in accordance with the policies, procedures, 
and standards applicable to applications as set forth in subpart F of 
this part (see Sec. Sec. 1.927 and 1.929 of subpart F of this part).
    (b) The Commission may waive specific requirements of the rules 
affecting spectrum leasing arrangements and the use of leased spectrum, 
on its own motion or upon request, in accordance with the policies, 
procedures, and standards set forth in subpart F of this part (see Sec. 
1.925 of subpart F of this part).

[[Page 415]]

    (c) Notifications and pending applications regarding spectrum 
leasing arrangements may be dismissed in accordance with the policies, 
procedures, and standards applicable to applications as set forth in 
subpart F of this part (see Sec. 1.935 of subpart F of this part).


<R05>
Sec. 1.9080  Private commons.

    (a) Overview. A ``private commons'' arrangement is an arrangement, 
distinct from a spectrum leasing arrangement but permitted in the same 
services for which spectrum leasing arrangements are allowed, in which a 
licensee or spectrum lessee makes certain spectrum usage rights under a 
particular license authorization available to a class of third-party 
users employing advanced communications technologies that involve peer-
to-peer (device-to-device) communications and that do not involve use of 
the licensee's or spectrum lessee's end-to-end physical network 
infrastructure (e.g., base stations, mobile stations, or other related 
elements). In a private commons arrangement, the licensee or spectrum 
lessee authorizes users of certain communications devices employing 
particular technical parameters, as specified by the licensee or 
spectrum lessee, to operate under the license authorization. A private 
commons arrangement differs from a spectrum leasing arrangement in that, 
unlike spectrum leasing arrangements, a private commons arrangement does 
not involve individually negotiated spectrum access rights with entities 
that seek to provide network-based services to end-users. A private 
commons arrangement does not affect unlicensed operations in a 
particular licensed band to the extent that they are permitted pursuant 
to part 15.
    (b) Licensee/spectrum lessee responsibilities. As the manager of any 
private commons, the licensee or spectrum lessee:
    (1) Establishes the technical and operating terms and conditions of 
use by users of the private commons, including those relating to the 
types of communications devices that may be used within the private 
commons, consistent with the terms and conditions of the underlying 
license authorization;
    (2) Retains de facto control of the use of spectrum by users within 
the private commons, including maintaining reasonable oversight over the 
users' use of the spectrum in the private commons so as to ensure that 
the use of the spectrum, and communications equipment employed, comply 
with all applicable technical and service rules (including requirements 
relating to radiofrequency radiation) and maintaining the ability to 
ensure such compliance; and,
    (3) Retains direct responsibility for ensuring that the users of the 
private commons, and the equipment employed, comply with all applicable 
technical and service rules, including requirements relating to 
radiofrequency radiation and requirements relating to interference.
    (c) Notification requirements. Prior to permitting users to commence 
operations within a private commons, the licensee or spectrum lessee 
must notify the Commission, using FCC Form 608, that it is establishing 
a private commons arrangement. This notification must include 
information that describes: the location(s) or coverage area(s) of the 
private commons under the license authorization; the term of the 
arrangement; the general terms and conditions for users that would be 
gaining spectrum access to the private commons; the technical 
requirements and equipment that the licensee or spectrum lessee has 
approved for use within the private commons; and, the types of 
communications uses that are to be allowed within the private commons.

    (c) For a description of file number information, see The 
International Bureau Filing System File Number Format Public Notice, DA-
04-568 (released February 27, 2004).


<R05>
Sec. 1.10009  What are the steps for electronic filing?

    (a) Step 1: Register for an FCC Registration Number (FRN). (See 
subpart W, Sec. Sec. 1.8001 through 1.8004.)
    (1) If you already have an FRN, go to Step 2.
    (2) In order to process your electronic application, you must have 
an FRN. You may obtain an FRN either directly from the Commission 
Registration System (CORES) at http://www.fcc.gov/e-file/, or through 
IBFS as part of your filing process. If you need to know more about who 
needs an FRN, visit CORES at http://www.fcc.gov/e-file/.
    (3) If you are a(n):
    (i) Applicant,
    (ii) Transferee and assignee,
    (iii) Transferor and assignor,
    (iv) Licensee/Authorization Holder, or
    (v) Payer, you are required to have and use an FRN when filing 
applications and/or paying fees through IBFS.
    (4) We use your FRN to give you secured access to IBFS and to pre-
fill the application you file.
    (b) Step 2: Register with IBFS.
    (1) If you are already registered with IBFS, go to Step 3.
    (2) In order to complete and file your electronic application, you 
must register in IBFS, located at http://www.fcc.gov/ibfs.
    (3) You can register your account in:
    (i) Your name,
    (ii) Your company's name, or
    (iii) Your client's name.
    (4) IBFS will issue you an account number as part of the 
registration process. You will create your own password.
    (5) If you forget your password, send an e-mail to the IBFS helpline 
at ibfsinfo@fcc.gov or contact the helpline at (202) 418-2222 for 
assistance.
    (c) Step 3: Log into IBFS, select the application you want to file, 
provide the required FRN(s) and password(s) and fill out your 
application. You must completely fill out forms and provide all 
requested information as provided in parts 1, 25, 63 and 64 of this 
chapter.
    (1) You must provide an address where you can receive mail delivery 
by

[[Page 420]]

the United States Postal Service. You are also encouraged to provide an 
e-mail address. This information is used to contact you regarding your 
application and to request additional documentation, if necessary.
    (2) Reference to material on file. You must answer questions on 
application forms that call for specific technical data, or that require 
yes or no answers or other short answers. However, if documents or other 
lengthy showings are already on file with us and contain the required 
information, you may incorporate the information by reference, as long 
as:
    (i) The referenced information is filed in IBFS or, if manually 
filed, the information is more than one ``8\1/2\ inch by 11 inch'' page.
    (ii) The referenced information is current and accurate in all 
material respects; and
    (iii) The application states where we can find the referenced 
information as well as:
    (A) The application file number, if the reference is to previously-
filed applications
    (B) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal 
citation, if the reference is to a docketed proceeding.
    (d) Step 4: File your application. If you file your application 
successfully through IBFS, a confirmation screen will appear showing you 
the date and time of your filing and your submission ID. Print this 
verification for your records as proof of online filing.
    (e) Step 5: Pay for your application.
    (1) Most applications require that you pay a fee to us before we can 
begin processing your application. You can determine the amount of your 
fee in three ways:
    (i) You can refer to Sec. 1.1107,
    (ii) You can refer to the International and Satellite Services fee 
guide located at http://www.fcc.gov/fees/appfees.html, or
    (iii) You can run a draft Form 159 through IBFS, in association with 
a filed application, and the system will automatically enter your 
required fee on the form.
    (2) A complete FCC Form 159 must accompany all fee payments. You 
must provide the FRN for both the applicant and the payer. You also must 
include your IBFS Submission ID number on your FCC Form 159 in the box 
labeled ``FCC Code 2.'' In addition, for applications for transfer of 
control or assignment of license, call signs involved in the transaction 
must be entered into the ``FCC Code 1'' box on the FCC Form 159. (This 
may require the use of multiple rows on the FCC Form 159 for a single 
application where more than one call sign is involved.)
    (i) You may use a paper version of FCC Form 159, or
    (ii) You can generate a pre-filled FCC Form 159 from IBFS using your 
IBFS Submission ID. For specific instructions on using IBFS to generate 
your FCC Form 159, go to the IBFS Web site (http://www.fcc.gov/ibfs) and 
click on the ``Getting Started'' button.
    (3) You have 3 payment options:
    (i) Pay by credit card (through IBFS or by regular mail),
    (ii) Pay by check, bank draft or money order, or
    (iii) Pay by wire transfer or other electronic payments.
    (4) You have 14 calendar days from the date you file your 
application in IBFS to submit your fee payment to U.S. Bank. Your FCC 
Form 159 must be stamped ``received'' by U.S. Bank by the 14th day. If 
not, we will dismiss your application.
    (5) If you send your Form 159 and payment to U.S. Bank in paper 
form, you should mail your completed Form 159 and payment to the address 
specified in Sec. 1.1107 of the Commission's rules. If you file 
electronically, do not send copies of your application with your payment 
and Form 159.
    (6) For more information on fee payments, refer to Payment 
Instructions found on the IBFS Internet site at http://www.fcc.gov/ibfs.
    (7) Step 5 is not applicable if your application is fee exempt.

<R05>
Sec. 1.10010  Do I need to send paper copies with my electronic applications?

    (a) If you file electronically through IBFS, the electronic record 
is the official record.
    (b) If you file electronically, you do not need to submit paper 
copies of your application.

[[Page 421]]

    (c) If you submit paper copies of your application with your 
payment, we will consider them as copies and may not retain them.


<R05>
Sec. 1.10011  Who may sign applications?

    (a) ``Signed'' in this section refers to electronically filed 
applications. An electronic application is ``signed'' when there is an 
electronic signature. An electronic signature is the typed name of the 
person ``signing'' the application, which is then electronically 
transmitted via IBFS.
    (b) For all electronically filed applications, you (or the signor) 
must actually sign a paper copy of the application, and keep the signed 
original in your files for future reference.
    (c) You only need to sign the original of applications, amendments, 
and related statements of fact.
    (d) Sign applications, amendments, and related statements of fact as 
follows (either electronically or manually):
    (1) By you, if you are an individual;
    (2) By one of the partners, if you are a partnership;
    (3) By an officer, director, or duly authorized employee, if you are 
a corporation; or
    (4) By a member who is an officer, if you are an unauthorized 
association.
    (e) If you file applications, amendments, and related statements of 
fact on behalf of eligible government entities, an elected or appointed 
official who may sign under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction must 
sign the document. Eligible government entities are:
    (1) States and territories of the United States,
    (2) Political subdivisions of these states and territories,
    (3) The District of Columbia, and
    (4) Units of local government.
    (f) If you are either physically disabled or absent from the United 
States, your attorney may sign applications, amendments and related 
statements of facts on your behalf.
    (1) Your attorney must explain why you are not signing the 
documents.
    (2) If your attorney states any matter based solely on his belief 
(rather than knowledge), your attorney must explain his reasons for 
believing that such statements are true.
    (g) It is unnecessary to sign applications, amendments, and related 
statements of fact under oath. However, willful false statements are 
punishable by a fine and imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. 1001, and by 
administrative sanctions.


<R05>
Sec. 1.10012  When can I file on IBFS?

    IBFS is available 24 hours a day, seven (7) days a week for filing.


<R05>
Sec. 1.10013  How do I check the status of my application after I file it?

    You can check the status of your application through the ``Search 
Tools'' on the IBFS homepage. The IBFS homepage is located at 
www.fcc.gov/ibfs.


<R05>
Sec. 1.10014  What happens after officially filing my application?

    (a) We give you an IBFS file number.
    (b) We electronically route your application to an analyst who 
conducts an initial review of your application. If your application is 
incomplete, we will either dismiss the application, or contact you by 
telephone, letter or email to ask for additional information within a 
specific time. In cases where we ask for additional information, if we 
do not receive it within the specified time, we will dismiss your 
application. In either case, we will dismiss your application without 
prejudice, so that you may file again with a complete application.
    (c) If your application is complete, and we verify receipt of your 
payment, it will appear on an ``Accepted for Filing'' Public Notice, 
unless public notice is not required. An ``Accepted for Filing'' Public 
Notice gives the public a certain amount of time to comment on your 
filing. This period varies depending upon the type of application.
    (1) Certain applications do not have to go on an ``Accepted for 
Filing'' Public Notice prior to initiation of service, but instead are 
filed as notifications to the Commission of prior actions by the 
carriers as authorized by the rules. Examples include pro forma 
notifications of transfer of control and assignment and certain foreign 
carrier notifications.

[[Page 422]]

    (2) Each ``Accepted for Filing'' Public Notice has a report number. 
Examples of various types of applications and their corresponding report 
number (the ``x'' represents a sequential number) follow.

    (d) After the Public Notice, your application may undergo legal, 
technical and/or financial review as deemed necessary. In addition, some 
applications require coordination with other government agencies.
    (e) After review, we decide whether to grant or deny applications or 
whether to take other necessary action. Grants, denials and any other 
necessary actions are noted in the IBFS database. Some filings may not 
require any affirmative action, such as some Foreign Carrier Affiliation 
Notification Filings. Other filings, such as some International Section 
214 Applications, International Accounting Rate Change Filings and 
Requests for assignment of Data Network Identification Codes, may be 
granted automatically on a specific date unless the applicant is 
notified otherwise prior to that date, as specified in the rules.
    (f) We list most actions taken on public notices. Each ``Action

connected via a conference call when the facilities under surveillance 
maintain a circuit connection to the call.
    (4) Destination. A party or place to which a call is being made 
(e.g., the called party).
    (5) Dialed digit extraction. Capability that permits a LEA to 
receive on the call data channel a digits dialed by a subject after a 
call is connected to another carrier's service for processing and 
routing.
    (6) Direction. A party or place to which a call is re-directed or 
the party or place from which it came, either incoming or outgoing 
(e.g., a redirected-to party or redirected-from party).
    (7) IAP. Intercept access point is a point within a carrier's system 
where some of the communications or call-identifying information of an 
intercept subject's equipment, facilities, and services are accessed.
    (8) In-band and out-of-band signaling. Capability that permits a LEA 
to be informed when a network message that provides call identifying 
information (e.g., ringing, busy, call waiting signal, message light) is 
generated or sent by the IAP switch to a subject using the facilities 
under surveillance. Excludes signals generated by customer premises 
equipment when no network signal is generated.
    (9) J-STD-025. The standard, including the latest version, developed 
by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Alliance 
for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) for wireline, cellular, 
and broadband PCS carriers. This standard defines services and features 
to support lawfully authorized electronic surveillance, and specifies 
interfaces necessary to deliver intercepted communications and call-
identifying information to a LEA. Subsequently, TIA and ATIS published 
J-STD-025-A and J-STD-025-B.
    (10) Origin. A party initiating a call (e.g., a calling party), or a 
place from which a call is initiated.
    (11) Party hold, join, drop on conference calls. Capability that 
permits a LEA to identify the parties to a conference call conversation 
at all times.
    (12) Subject-initiated dialing and signaling information. Capability 
that permits a LEA to be informed when a subject using the facilities 
under surveillance uses services that provide call identifying 
information, such as call

[[Page 428]]

forwarding, call waiting, call hold, and three-way calling. Excludes 
signals generated by customer premises equipment when no network signal 
is generated.
    (13) Termination. A party or place at the end of a communication 
path (e.g. the called or call-receiving party, or the switch of a party 
that has placed another party on hold).
    (14) Timing information. Capability that permits a LEA to associate 
call-identifying information with the content of a call. A call-
identifying message must be sent from the carrier's IAP to the LEA's 
Collection Function within eight seconds of receipt of that message by 
the IAP at least 95% of the time, and with the call event time-stamped 
to an accuracy of at least 200 milliseconds.
    (b) In addition to the requirements in Sec. 1.20006, wireline, 
cellular, and PCS telecommunications carriers shall provide to a LEA the 
assistance capability requirements regarding wire and electronic 
communications and call identifying information covered by J-STD-025 
(current version), and, subject to the definitions in this section, may 
satisfy these requirements by complying with J-STD-025 (current 
version), or by another means of their own choosing. These carriers also 
shall provide to a LEA the following capabilities:
    (1) Content of subject-initiated conference calls;
    (2) Party hold, join, drop on conference calls;
    (3) Subject-initiated dialing and signaling information;
    (4) In-band and out-of-band signaling;
    (5) Timing information;
    (6) Dialed digit extraction, with a toggle feature that can 
activate/deactivate this capability.

Sec. 1.20008  Penalties.

    In the event of a telecommunications carrier's violation of this 
subchapter, the Commission shall enforce the penalties articulated in 47 
U.S.C. 503(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 and 47 CFR 1.80.


<R05>
 Sec. Appendix A to Part 1--A Plan of Cooperative Procedure in Matters 

and Cases Under the Provisions of Section 410 of the Communications Act 
                                 of 1934

    (Approved by the Federal Communications Commission October 25, 1938, 
and approved by the National Association of Railroad and Utilities 
Commissioners on November 17, 1938.)

   preliminary statement concerning the purpose and effect of the plan

    Section 410 of the Communications Act of 1934 authorizes cooperation 
between the Federal Communications Commission, hereinafter called the 
Federal Commission, and the State commissions of the several States, in 
the administration of said Act. Subsection (a) authorizes the reference 
of any matter arising in the administration of said Act to a board to be 
composed of a member or members from each of the States in which the 
wire, or radio communication affected by or involved in the proceeding 
takes place, or is proposed. Subsection (b) authorizes conferences by 
the Federal Commission with State commissions regarding the relationship 
between rate structures, accounts, charges, practices, classifications, 
and regulations of carriers subject to the jurisdiction of such State 
commissions and of said Federal Commission and joint hearings with State 
commissions in connection with any matter with respect to which the 
Federal Commission is authorized to act.
    Obviously, it is impossible to determine in advance what matters 
should be the subject of a conference, what matters should be referred 
to a board, and what matters should be heard at a joint hearing of State 
commissions and the Federal Commission. It is understood, therefore, 
that the Federal Commission or any State commission will freely suggest 
cooperation with respect to any proceedings or matter affecting any 
carrier subject to the jurisdiction of said Federal Commission and of a 
State commission, and concerning which it is believed that cooperation 
will be in the public interest.
    To enable this to be done, whenever a proceeding shall be instituted 
before any commission, Federal or State, in which another commission is 
believed to be interested, notice should be promptly given each such 
interested commission by the commission before which the proceeding has 
been instituted. Inasmuch, however, as failure to give notice as 
contemplated by the provisions of this plan will sometimes occur purely 
through inadvertence, any such failure should not operate to deter any 
commission from suggesting that any such proceeding be

[[Page 429]]

made the subject matter of cooperative action, if cooperation therein is 
deemed desirable.
    It is understood that each commission whether or not represented in 
the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, must 
determine its own course of action with respect to any proceeding in the 
light of the law under which, at any given time, it is called upon to 
act, and must be guided by its own views of public policy; and that no 
action taken by such Association can in any respect prejudice such 
freedom of action. The approval by the Association of this plan of 
cooperative procedure, which was jointly prepared by the Association's 
standing Committee on Cooperation between Federal and State commissions 
and said Federal Commission, is accordingly recommendatory only; but 
such plan is designed to be, and it is believed that it will be, a 
helpful step in the promotion of cooperative relations between the State 
commissions and said Federal Commission.

                   notice of institution of proceeding

    Whenever there shall be instituted before the Federal Commission any 
proceeding involving the rates of any telephone or telegraph carrier, 
the State commissions of the States affected thereby will be notified 
immediately thereof by the Federal Commission, and each notice given a 
State commission will advise such commission that, if it deems the 
proceeding one which should be considered under the cooperative 
provisions of the Act, it should either directly or through the National 
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, notify the Federal 
Commission as to the nature of its interest in said matter and request a 
conference, the creation of a joint board, or a joint hearing as may be 
desired, indicating its preference and the reasons therefor. Upon 
receipt of such request the Federal Commission will consider the same 
and may confer with the commission making the request and with other 
interested commission, or with representatives of the National 
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, in such manner as 
may be most suitable; and if cooperation shall appear to be practicable 
and desirable, shall so advise each interested State commission, 
directly, when such cooperation will be by joint conference or by 
reference to a joint board appointed under said sec. 410 (a), and, as 
hereinafter provided, when such cooperation will be by a joint hearing 
under said sec. 410(b).
    Each State commission should in like manner notify the Federal 
Commission of any proceeding instituted before it involving the toll 
telephone rates or the telegraph rates of any carrier subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Commission.

                  procedure governing joint conferences

    The Federal Commission, in accordance with the indicated procedure, 
will confer with any State commission regarding any matter relating to 
the regulation of public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of either 
commission. The commission desiring a conference upon any such matter 
should notify the other without delay, and thereupon the Federal 
Commission will promptly arrange for a conference in which all 
interested State commissions will be invited to be present.

             procedure governing matters referred to a board

    Whenever the Federal Commission, either upon its own motion or upon 
the suggestion of a State commission, or at the request of any 
interested party, shall determine that it is desirable to refer a matter 
arising in the administration of the Communications Act of 1934 to a 
board to be composed of a member or members from the State or States 
affected or to be affected by such matter, the procedure shall be as 
follows:
    The Federal Commission will send a request to each interested State 
commission to nominate a specified number of members to serve on such 
board.
    The representation of each State concerned shall be equal, unless 
one or more of the States affected chooses to waive such right of equal 
representation. When the member or members of any board have been 
nominated and appointed, in accordance with the provisions of the 
Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Commission will make an order 
referring the particular matter to such board, and such order shall fix 
the time and place of hearing, define the force and effect the action of 
the board shall have, and the manner in which its proceedings shall be 
conducted. The rules of practice and procedure, as from time to time 
adopted or prescribed by the Federal Commission, shall govern such 
board, as far as applicable.

                   procedure governing joint hearings

    Whenever the Federal Commission, either upon its own motion or upon 
suggestions made by or on behalf of any interested State commission or 
commissions, shall determine that a joint hearing under said sec. 410(b) 
is desirable in connection with any matter pending before said Federal 
Commission, the procedure shall be as follows:
    (a) The Federal Commission will notify the general solicitor of the 
National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners that said 
Association, or, if not more than eight States are within the territory 
affected by

[[Page 430]]

the proceeding, the State commissions interested, are invited to name 
Cooperating Commissioners to sit with the Federal Commission for the 
hearing and consideration of said proceeding.
    (b) Upon receipt of any notice from said Federal Commission inviting 
cooperation, if not more than eight States are involved, the general 
solicitor shall at once advise the State commissions of said States, 
they being represented in the membership of the association, of the 
receipt of such notice, and shall request each such commission to give 
advice to him in writing, before a date to be indicated by him in his 
communication requesting such advice (1) whether such commission will 
cooperate in said proceeding, (2) if it will, by what commissioner it 
will be represented therein.
    (c) Upon the basis of replies received, the general solicitor shall 
advise the Federal Commission what States, if any, are desirous of 
making the proceeding cooperative and by what commissioners they will be 
represented, and he shall give like advice to each State commission 
interested therein.
    (d) If more than eight States are interested in the proceeding, 
because within territory for which rates will be under consideration 
therein, the general solicitor shall advise the president of the 
association that the association is invited to name a cooperating 
committee of State commissioners representing the States interested in 
said proceeding.
    The president of the association shall thereupon advise the general 
solicitor in writing (1) whether the invitation is accepted on behalf of 
the association, and (2) the names of commissioners selected to sit as a 
cooperating committee. The president of the association shall have the 
authority to accept or to decline said invitation for the association, 
and to determine the number of commissioners who shall be named on the 
cooperating committee, provided that his action shall be concurred in by 
the chairman of the association's executive committee. In the event of 
any failure of the president of the association and chairman of its 
executive committee to agree, the second vice president of the 
association (or the chairman of its committee on cooperation between 
State and Federal commissions, if there shall be no second vice 
president) shall be consulted, and the majority opinion of the three 
shall prevail. Consultations and expressions of opinion may be by mail 
or telegraph.
    (e) If any proceeding, involving more than eight States, is pending 
before the Federal Commission, in which cooperation has not been invited 
by that Commission, which the association's president and the first and 
second vice presidents, or any two of them, consider should be made a 
cooperating proceeding, they may instruct the general solicitor to 
suggest to the Federal Commission that the proceeding be made a 
cooperative proceeding; and any State commission considering that said 
proceeding should be made cooperative may request the president of the 
association or the chairman of its executive committee to make such 
suggestion after consideration with the executive officers above named. 
If said Federal Commission shall assent to the suggestion, made as 
aforesaid, the president of the association shall have the same 
authority to proceed, and shall proceed in the appointment of a 
cooperating committee, as is provided in other cases involving more than 
eight States, wherein the Federal Commission has invited cooperation, 
and the invitation has been accepted.
    (f) Whenever any case is pending before the Federal Commission 
involving eight States or less, which a commission of any of said States 
considers should be made cooperative, such commission, either directly 
or through the general solicitor of the association, may suggest to the 
Federal Commission that the proceeding be made cooperative. If said 
Federal Commission accedes to such suggestion, it will notify the 
general solicitor of the association to that effect and thereupon the 
general solicitor shall proceed as is provided in such case when the 
invitation has been made by the Federal Commission without State 
commission suggestion.

        appointment of cooperating commissioners by the president

    In the appointment of any cooperating committee, the president of 
the association shall make appointments only from commissions of the 
States interested in the particular proceeding in which the committee is 
to serve. He shall exercise his best judgment to select cooperating 
commissioners who are especially qualified to serve upon cooperating 
committees by reason of their ability and fitness; and in no case shall 
he appoint a commissioner upon a cooperating committee until he shall 
have been advised by such commissioner that it will be practicable for 
him to attend the hearings in the proceeding in which the committee is 
to serve, including the arguments therein, and the cooperative 
conferences, which may be held following the submission of the 
proceeding, to an extent that will reasonably enable him to be informed 
upon the issues in the proceeding and to form a reasonable judgment in 
the matters to be determined.

                          tenure of cooperators

    (a) No State commissioner shall sit in a cooperative proceeding 
under this plan except a commissioner who has been selected by his 
commission to represent it in a proceeding involving eight States or 
less, or has been selected by the president of the association to

[[Page 431]]

sit in a case involving more than eight States, in the manner 
hereinbefore provided.
    (b) A commissioner who has been selected, as hereinbefore provided, 
to serve as a member of a cooperating committee in any proceeding, shall 
without further appointment, and without regard to the duration of time 
involved, continue to serve in said proceeding until the final 
disposition thereof, including hearings and conferences after any order 
or reopening, provided that he shall continue to be a State 
commissioner.
    (c) No member of a cooperating committee shall have any right or 
authority to designate another commissioner to serve in his place at any 
hearing or conference in any proceeding in which he has been appointed 
to serve.
    (d) Should a vacancy occur upon any cooperating committee, in a 
proceeding involving more than eight States, by reason of the death of 
any cooperating commissioner, or of his ceasing to be a State 
commissioner, or of other inability to serve, it shall be the duty of 
the president of the association to fill the vacancy by appointment, if, 
after communication with the chairman of the cooperating committee, it 
be deemed necessary to fill such vacancy.
    (e) In the event of any such vacancy occurring upon a cooperating 
committee involving not more than eight States, the vacancy shall be 
filled by the commission from which the vacancy occurs.

cooperating committee to determine respecting any report of statement of 
                              its attitude

    (a) Whenever a cooperating committee shall have concluded its work, 
or shall deem such course advisable, the committee shall consider 
whether it is necessary and desirable to make a report to the interested 
State commissions, and, if it shall determine to make a report, it shall 
cause the same to be distributed through the secretary of the 
association, or through the general solicitor to all interested 
commissions.
    (b) If a report of the Federal Commission will accompany any order 
to be made in said proceeding, the Federal Commission will state therein 
the concurrence or nonconcurrence of said cooperating committee in the 
decision or order of said Federal Commission.

       construction hereof in certain respects expressly provided

    It is understood and provided that no State or States shall be 
deprived of the right of participation and cooperation as hereinbefore 
provided because of nonmembership in the association. With respect to 
any such State or States, all negotiations herein specified to be 
carried on between the Federal Commission and any officer of such 
association shall be conducted by the Federal Commission directly with 
the chairman of the commission of such State or States.

  Sec. Appendix B to Part 1--Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the 
                    Collocation of Wireless Antennas

   Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless 
                                Antennas

    Executed by the Federal Communications Commission, the National 
  Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers and the Advisory 
                    Council on Historic Preservation

    Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) establishes 
rules and procedures for the licensing of wireless communications 
facilities in the United States and its Possessions and Territories; 
and,
    Whereas, the FCC has largely deregulated the review of applications 
for the construction of individual wireless communications facilities 
and, under this framework, applicants are required to prepare an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) in cases where the applicant determines 
that the proposed facility falls within one of certain environmental 
categories described in the FCC's rules (47 CFR 1.1307), including 
situations which may affect historical sites listed or eligible for 
listing in the National Register of Historic Places (``National 
Register''); and,
    Whereas, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 
U.S.C. 470 et seq.) (``the Act'') requires federal agencies to take into 
account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties and to 
afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) a 
reasonable opportunity to comment; and,
    Whereas, Section 800.14(b) of the Council's regulations, 
``Protection of Historic Properties'' (36 CFR 800.14(b)), allows for 
programmatic agreements to streamline and tailor the Section 106 review 
process to particular federal programs; and,
    Whereas, in August 2000, the Council established a 
Telecommunications Working Group to provide a forum for the FCC, 
Industry representatives, State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs) 
and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs), and the Council to 
discuss improved coordination of Section 106 compliance regarding 
wireless communications projects affecting historic properties; and,
    Whereas, the FCC, the Council and the Working Group have developed 
this Collocation Programmatic Agreement in accordance with 36 CFR 
800.14(b) to address the Section

[[Page 432]]

106 review process as it applies to the collocation of antennas 
(collocation being defined in Stipulation I.A below); and,
    Whereas, the FCC encourages collocation of antennas where 
technically and economically feasible, in order to reduce the need for 
new tower construction; and,
    Whereas, the parties hereto agree that the effects on historic 
properties of collocations of antennas on towers, buildings and 
structures are likely to be minimal and not adverse, and that in the 
cases where an adverse effect might occur, the procedures provided and 
referred to herein are proper and sufficient, consistent with Section 
106, to assure that the FCC will take such effects into account; and
    Whereas, the execution of this Nationwide Collocation Programmatic 
Agreement will streamline the Section 106 review of collocation 
proposals and thereby reduce the need for the construction of new 
towers, thereby reducing potential effects on historic properties that 
would otherwise result from the construction of those unnecessary new 
towers; and,
    Whereas, the FCC and the Council have agreed that these measures 
should be incorporated into a Nationwide Programmatic Agreement to 
better manage the Section 106 consultation process and streamline 
reviews for collocation of antennas; and,
    Whereas, since collocations reduce both the need for new tower 
construction and the potential for adverse effects on historic 
properties, the parties hereto agree that the terms of this Agreement 
should be interpreted and implemented wherever possible in ways that 
encourage collocation; and
    Whereas, the parties hereto agree that the procedures described in 
this Agreement are, with regard to collocations as defined herein, a 
proper substitute for the FCC's compliance with the Council's rules, in 
accordance and consistent with Section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act and its implementing regulations found at 36 CFR part 
800; and
    Whereas, the FCC has consulted with the National Conference of State 
Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO) and requested the President of 
NCSHPO to sign this Nationwide Collocation Programmatic Agreement in 
accordance with 36 CFR Section 800.14(b)(2)(iii); and,
    Whereas, the FCC sought comment from Indian tribes and Native 
Hawaiian Organizations regarding the terms of this Nationwide 
Programmatic Agreement by letters of January 11, 2001 and February 8, 
2001; and,
    Whereas, the terms of this Programmatic Agreement do not apply on 
``tribal lands'' as defined under Section 800.16(x) of the Council's 
regulations, 36 CFR 800.16(x) (``Tribal lands means all lands within the 
exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation and all dependent Indian 
communities.''); and,
    Whereas, the terms of this Programmatic Agreement do not preclude 
Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian Organizations from consulting directly 
with the FCC or its licensees, tower companies and applicants for 
antenna licenses when collocation activities off tribal lands may affect 
historic properties of religious and cultural significance to Indian 
tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations; and,
    Whereas, the execution and implementation of this Nationwide 
Collocation Programmatic Agreement will not preclude members of the 
public from filing complaints with the FCC or the Council regarding 
adverse effects on historic properties from any existing tower or any 
activity covered under the terms of this Programmatic Agreement.
    Now therefore, the FCC, the Council, and NCSHPO agree that the FCC 
will meet its Section 106 compliance responsibilities for the 
collocation of antennas as follows.

                              Stipulations

    The FCC, in coordination with licensees, tower companies and 
applicants for antenna licenses, will ensure that the following measures 
are carried out.

                             I. Definitions

    For purposes of this Nationwide Programmatic Agreement, the 
following definitions apply.
    A. ''Collocation'' means the mounting or installation of an antenna 
on an existing tower, building or structure for the purpose of 
transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications 
purposes.
    B. ''Tower'' is any structure built for the sole or primary purpose 
of supporting FCC-licensed antennas and their associated facilities.
    C.''Substantial increase in the size of the tower'' means:
    (1) The mounting of the proposed antenna on the tower would increase 
the existing height of the tower by more than 10%, or by the height of 
one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing 
antenna not to exceed twenty feet, whichever is greater, except that the 
mounting of the proposed antenna may exceed the size limits set forth in 
this paragraph if necessary to avoid interference with existing 
antennas; or
    (2) The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve the 
installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets 
for the technology involved, not to exceed four, or more than one new 
equipment shelter; or
    (3) The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve adding an 
appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge 
of the tower more than twenty feet,

[[Page 433]]

or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the 
appurtenance, whichever is greater, except that the mounting of the 
proposed antenna may exceed the size limits set forth in this paragraph 
if necessary to shelter the antenna from inclement weather or to connect 
the antenna to the tower via cable; or
    (4) The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve excavation 
outside the current tower site, defined as the current boundaries of the 
leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility 
easements currently related to the site.

                            II. Applicability

    A. This Nationwide Collocation Programmatic Agreement applies only 
to the collocation of antennas as defined in Stipulation I.A, above.
    B. This Nationwide Collocation Programmatic Agreement does not cover 
any Section 106 responsibilities that federal agencies other than the 
FCC may have with regard to the collocation of antennas.

 III. Collocation of Antennas on Towers Constructed on or Before March 
                                16, 2001

    A. An antenna may be mounted on an existing tower constructed on or 
before March 16, 2001 without such collocation being reviewed under the 
consultation process set forth under Subpart B of 36 CFR Part 800, 
unless:
    1. The mounting of the antenna will result in a substantial increase 
in the size of the tower as defined in Stipulation I.C, above; or
    2. The tower has been determined by the FCC to have an effect on one 
or more historic properties, unless such effect has been found to be not 
adverse through a no adverse effect finding, or if found to be adverse 
or potentially adverse, has been resolved, such as through a conditional 
no adverse effect determination, a Memorandum of Agreement, a 
programmatic agreement, or otherwise in compliance with Section 106 and 
Subpart B of 36 CFR Part 800; or
    3. The tower is the subject of a pending environmental review or 
related proceeding before the FCC involving compliance with Section 106 
of the National Historic Preservation Act; or
    4. The collocation licensee or the owner of the tower has received 
written or electronic notification that the FCC is in receipt of a 
complaint from a member of the public, a SHPO or the Council, that the 
collocation has an adverse effect on one or more historic properties. 
Any such complaint must be in writing and supported by substantial 
evidence describing how the effect from the collocation is adverse to 
the attributes that qualify any affected historic property for 
eligibility or potential eligibility for the National Register.

 IV. Collocation of Antennas on Towers Constructed After March 16, 2001

    A. An antenna may be mounted on an existing tower constructed after 
March 16, 2001 without such collocation being reviewed under the 
consultation process set forth under Subpart B of 36 CFR Part 800, 
unless:
    1. The Section 106 review process for the tower set forth in 36 CFR 
Part 800 and any associated environmental reviews required by the FCC 
have not been completed; or
    2. The mounting of the new antenna will result in a substantial 
increase in the size of the tower as defined in Stipulation I.C, above; 
or
    3. The tower as built or proposed has been determined by the FCC to 
have an effect on one or more historic properties, unless such effect 
has been found to be not adverse through a no adverse effect finding, or 
if found to be adverse or potentially adverse, has been resolved, such 
as through a conditional no adverse effect determination, a Memorandum 
of Agreement, a programmatic agreement, or otherwise in compliance with 
Section 106 and Subpart B of 36 CFR Part 800; or
    4. The collocation licensee or the owner of the tower has received 
written or electronic notification that the FCC is in receipt of a 
complaint from a member of the public, a SHPO or the Council, that the 
collocation has an adverse effect on one or more historic properties. 
Any such complaint must be in writing and supported by substantial 
evidence describing how the effect from the collocation is adverse to 
the attributes that qualify any affected historic property for 
eligibility or potential eligibility for the National Register.

V. Collocation of Antennas on Buildings and Non-Tower Structures Outside 
                          of Historic Districts

    A. An antenna may be mounted on a building or non-tower structure 
without such collocation being reviewed under the consultation process 
set forth under Subpart B of 36 CFR Part 800, unless:
    1. The building or structure is over 45 years old;\1\ or
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Suitable methods for determining the age of a building include, 
but are not limited to: (1) obtaining the opinon of a consultant who 
meets the Secretary of Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards 
(36 CFR Part 61) or (2) consulting public records.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The building or structure is inside the boundary of a historic 
district, or if the antenna is visible from the ground level of the 
historic district, the building or structure is within 250 feet of the 
boundary of the historic district; or
    3. The building or non-tower structure is a designated National 
Historic Landmark, or

[[Page 434]]

listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic 
Places based upon the review of the licensee, tower company or applicant 
for an antenna license; or
    4. The collocation licensee or the owner of the tower has received 
written or electronic notification that the FCC is in receipt of a 
complaint from a member of the public, a SHPO or the Council, that the 
collocation has an adverse effect on one or more historic properties. 
Any such complaint must be in writing and supported by substantial 
evidence describing how the effect from the collocation is adverse to 
the attributes that qualify any affected historic property for 
eligibility or potential eligibility for the National Register.
    B. Subsequent to the collocation of an antenna, should the SHPO/THPO 
or Council determine that the collocation of the antenna or its 
associated equipment installed under the terms of Stipulation V has 
resulted in an adverse effect on historic properties, the SHPO/THPO or 
Council may notify the FCC accordingly. The FCC shall comply with the 
requirements of Section 106 and 36 CFR Part 800 for this particular 
collocation.

                        VI. Reservation of Rights

    Neither execution of this Agreement, nor implementation of or 
compliance with any term herein shall operate in any way as a waiver by 
any party hereto, or by any person or entity complying herewith or 
affected hereby, of a right to assert in any court of law any claim, 
argument or defense regarding the validity or interpretation of any 
provision of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et

 Sec. Appendix C to Part 1--Nationwide Programmatic Agreement Regarding 
    the Section 106 National Historic Preservation Act Review Process

  Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for Review of Effects on Historic 
      Properties for Certain Undertakings Approved by the Federal 
                        Communications Commission

    Executed by the Federal Communications Commission, the National 
  Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers and the Advisory 
                    Council on Historic Preservation

                             September 2004

                              Introduction

    Whereas, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 
1966, as amended (``NHPA'') (codified at 16 U.S.C. 470f), requires 
federal agencies to take into account the effects of certain of their 
Undertakings on Historic Properties (see Section II, below), included in 
or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places 
(``National Register''), and to afford the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation (``Council'') a reasonable opportunity to comment with 
regard to such Undertakings; and
    Whereas, under the authority granted by Congress in the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), the 
Federal Communications Commission (``Commission'') establishes rules and 
procedures for the licensing of non-federal government communications 
services, and the registration of certain antenna structures in the 
United States and its Possessions and Territories; and
    Whereas, Congress and the Commission have deregulated or streamlined 
the application process regarding the construction of individual 
Facilities in many of the Commission's licensed services; and
    Whereas, under the framework established in the Commission's 
environmental rules, 47 CFR 1.1301-1.1319, Commission licensees and 
applicants for authorizations and antenna structure registrations are 
required to prepare, and the Commission is required to independently 
review and approve, a pre-construction Environmental Assessment (``EA'') 
in cases where a proposed tower or antenna may significantly affect the 
environment, including situations where a proposed tower or antenna may 
affect Historic Properties that are either listed in or eligible for 
listing in the National Register, including properties of religious and 
cultural importance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization 
(``NHO'') that meet the National Register criteria; and
    Whereas, the Council has adopted rules implementing Section 106 of 
the NHPA (codified at 36 CFR Part 800) and setting forth the process, 
called the ``Section 106 process,'' for complying with the NHPA; and
    Whereas, pursuant to the Commission's rules and the terms of this 
Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for Review of Effects on Historic 
Properties for Certain Undertakings Approved by the Federal 
Communications Commission (``Nationwide Agreement''), Applicants (see 
Section II.A.2) have been authorized, consistent with the terms of the 
memorandum from the Council to the Commission, titled ``Delegation of 
Authority for the Section 106 Review of Telecommunications Projects,'' 
dated September 21, 2000, to initiate, coordinate, and assist the 
Commission with compliance with many aspects of the Section 106 review 
process for their Facilities; and
    Whereas, in August 2000, the Council established a 
Telecommunications Working Group (the ``Working Group'') to provide a 
forum for the Commission, the Council, the National Conference of State 
Historic Preservation Officers (``Conference''), individual State 
Historic Preservation Officers (``SHPOs''), Tribal Historic Preservation 
Officers (``THPOs''), other tribal representatives, communications 
industry representatives, and other interested members of the public to 
discuss improved Section 106 compliance and to develop methods of 
streamlining the Section 106 review process; and
    Whereas, Section 214 of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470v) authorizes the 
Council to promulgate regulations implementing exclusions from Section 
106 review, and Section

[[Page 436]]

800.14(b) of the Council's regulations (36 CFR 800.14(b)) allows for 
programmatic agreements to streamline and tailor the Section 106 review 
process to particular federal programs, if they are consistent with the 
Council's regulations; and
    Whereas, the Commission, the Council, and the Conference executed on 
March 16, 2001, the Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the 
Collocation of Wireless Antennas (the ``Collocation Agreement''), in 
order to streamline review for the collocation of antennas on existing 
towers and other structures and thereby reduce the need for the 
construction of new towers (Attachment 1 to this Nationwide Agreement); 
and
    Whereas, the Council, the Conference, and the Commission now agree 
it is desirable to further streamline and tailor the Section 106 review 
process for Facilities that are not excluded from Section 106 review 
under the Collocation Agreement while protecting Historic Properties 
that are either listed in or eligible for listing in the National 
Register; and
    Whereas, the Working Group agrees that a nationwide programmatic 
agreement is a desirable and effective way to further streamline and 
tailor the Section 106 review process as it applies to Facilities; and
    Whereas, this Nationwide Agreement will, upon its execution by the 
Council, the Conference, and the Commission, constitute a substitute for 
the Council's rules with respect to certain Commission Undertakings; and
    Whereas, the Commission sought public comment on a draft of this 
Nationwide Agreement through a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking released on 
June 9, 2003;
    Whereas, the Commission has actively sought and received 
participation and comment from Indian tribes and NHOs regarding this 
Nationwide Agreement; and
    Whereas, the Commission has consulted with federally recognized 
Indian tribes regarding this Nationwide Agreement (see Report and Order, 
FCC 04-222, at ] 31); and
    Whereas, this Nationwide Agreement provides for appropriate public 
notification and participation in connection with the Section 106 
process; and
    Whereas, Section 101(d)(6) of the NHPA provides that federal 
agencies ``shall consult with any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization'' that attaches religious and cultural significance to 
properties of traditional religious and cultural importance that may be 
determined to be eligible for inclusion in the National Register and 
that might be affected by a federal undertaking (16 U.S.C. 470a(d)(6)); 
and
    Whereas, the Commission has adopted a ``Statement of Policy on 
Establishing a Government-to-Government Relationship with Indian 
Tribes'' dated June 23, 2000, pursuant to which the Commission: 
recognizes the unique legal relationship that exists between the federal 
government and Indian tribal governments, as reflected in the 
Constitution of the United States, treaties, federal statutes, Executive 
orders, and numerous court decisions; affirms the federal trust 
relationship with Indian tribes, and recognizes that this historic trust 
relationship requires the federal government to adhere to certain 
fiduciary standards in its dealings with Indian tribes; commits to 
working with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis 
consistent with the principles of tribal self-governance; commits, in 
accordance with the federal government's trust responsibility, and to 
the extent practicable, to consult with tribal governments prior to 
implementing any regulatory action or policy that will significantly or 
uniquely affect tribal governments, their land and resources; strives to 
develop working relationships with tribal governments, and will endeavor 
to identify innovative mechanisms to facilitate tribal consultations in 
the Commission's regulatory processes; and endeavors to streamline its 
administrative process and procedures to remove undue burdens that its 
decisions and actions place on Indian tribes; and
    Whereas, the Commission does not delegate under this Programmatic 
Agreement any portion of its responsibilities to Indian tribes and NHOs, 
including its obligation to consult under Section 101(d)(6) of the NHPA; 
and
    Whereas, the terms of this Nationwide Agreement are consistent with 
and do not attempt to abrogate the rights of Indian tribes or NHOs to 
consult directly with the Commission regarding the construction of 
Facilities; and
    Whereas, the execution and implementation of this Nationwide 
Agreement will not preclude Indian tribes or NHOs, SHPO/THPOs, local 
governments, or members of the public from filing complaints with the 
Commission or the Council regarding effects on Historic Properties from 
any Facility or any activity covered under the terms of the Nationwide 
Agreement; and
    Whereas, Indian tribes and NHOs may request Council involvement in 
Section 106 cases that present issues of concern to Indian tribes or 
NHOs (see 36 CFR Part 800, Appendix A, Section (c)(4)); and
    Whereas, the Commission, after consulting with federally recognized 
Indian tribes, has developed an electronic Tower Construction 
Notification System through which Indian tribes and NHOs may voluntarily 
identify the geographic areas in which Historic Properties to which they 
attach religious and cultural significance may be located, Applicants 
may ascertain which participating Indian tribes and NHOs have identified 
such an interest in the geographic area in which they propose to 
construct Facilities, and Applicants may voluntarily provide electronic 
notification of proposed Facilities construction

[[Page 437]]

for the Commission to forward to participating Indian tribes, NHOs, and 
SHPOs/THPOs; and
    Whereas, the Council, the Conference and the Commission recognize 
that Applicants' use of qualified professionals experienced with the 
NHPA and Section 106 can streamline the review process and minimize 
potential delays; and
    Whereas, the Commission has created a position and hired a cultural 
resources professional to assist with the Section 106 process; and
    Whereas, upon execution of this Nationwide Agreement, the Council 
may still provide advisory comments to the Commission regarding the 
coordination of Section 106 reviews; notify the Commission of concerns 
raised by consulting parties and the public regarding an Undertaking; 
and participate in the resolution of adverse effects for complex, 
controversial, or other non-routine projects;
    Now Therefore, in consideration of the above provisions and of the 
covenants and agreements contained herein, the Council, the Conference 
and the Commission (the ``Parties'') agree as follows:

         I. Applicability and Scope of This Nationwide Agreement

    A. This Nationwide Agreement (1) Excludes from Section 106 review 
certain Undertakings involving the construction and modification of 
Facilities, and (2) streamlines and tailors the Section 106 review 
process for other Undertakings involving the construction and 
modification of Facilities. An illustrative list of Commission 
activities in relation to which Undertakings covered by this Agreement 
may occur is provided as Attachment 2 to this Agreement.
    B. This Nationwide Agreement applies only to federal Undertakings as 
determined by the Commission (``Undertakings''). The Commission has sole 
authority to determine what activities undertaken by the Commission or 
its Applicants constitute Undertakings within the meaning of the NHPA. 
Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Commission from revisiting 
or affect the existing ability of any person to challenge any prior 
determination of what does or does not constitute an Undertaking. 
Maintenance and servicing of Towers, Antennas, and associated equipment 
are not deemed to be Undertakings subject to Section 106 review.
    C. This Agreement does not apply to Antenna Collocations that are 
exempt from Section 106 review under the Collocation Agreement (see 
Attachment 1). Pursuant to the terms of the Collocation Agreement, such 
Collocations shall not be subject to the Section 106 review process and 
shall not be submitted to the SHPO/THPO for review. This Agreement does 
apply to collocations that are not exempt from Section 106 review under 
the Collocation Agreement.
    D. This Agreement does not apply on ``tribal lands'' as defined 
under Section 800.16(x) of the Council's regulations, 36 CFR Sec. 
800.16(x) (``Tribal lands means all lands within the exterior boundaries 
of any Indian reservation and all dependent Indian communities.''). This 
Nationwide Agreement, however, will apply on tribal lands should a 
tribe, pursuant to appropriate tribal procedures and upon reasonable 
notice to the Council, Commission, and appropriate SHPO/THPO, elect to 
adopt the provisions of this Nationwide Agreement. Where a tribe that 
has assumed SHPO functions pursuant to Section 101(d)(2) of the NHPA (16 
U.S.C. 470(d)(2)) has agreed to application of this Nationwide Agreement 
on tribal lands, the term SHPO/THPO denotes the Tribal Historic 
Preservation Officer with respect to review of proposed Undertakings on 
those tribal lands. Where a tribe that has not assumed SHPO functions 
has agreed to application of this Nationwide Agreement on tribal lands, 
the tribe may notify the Commission of the tribe's intention to perform 
the duties of a SHPO/THPO, as defined in this Nationwide Agreement, for 
proposed Undertakings on its tribal lands, and in such instances the 
term SHPO/THPO denotes both the State Historic Preservation Officer and 
the tribe's authorized representative. In all other instances, the term 
SHPO/THPO denotes the State Historic Preservation Officer.
    E. This Nationwide Agreement governs only review of Undertakings 
under Section 106 of the NHPA. Applicants completing the Section 106 
review process under the terms of this Nationwide Agreement may not 
initiate construction without completing any environmental review that 
is otherwise required for effects other than historic preservation under 
the Commission's rules (See 47 CFR 1.1301-1.1319). Completion of the 
Section 106 review process under this Nationwide Agreement satisfies an 
Applicant's obligations under the Commission's rules with respect to 
Historic Properties, except for Undertakings that have been determined 
to have an adverse effect on Historic Properties and that therefore 
require preparation and filing of an Environmental Assessment (See 47 
CFR 1.1307(a)(4)).
    F. This Nationwide Agreement does not govern any Section 106 
responsibilities that agencies other than the Commission may have with 
respect to those agencies' federal Undertakings.

                             II. Definitions

    A. The following terms are used in this Nationwide Agreement as 
defined below:
    1. Antenna. An apparatus designed for the purpose of emitting radio 
frequency (``RF'') radiation, to be operated or operating from a fixed

sounds of all kinds, including the transmitting device and any on-site 
equipment, switches, wiring, cabling, power sources, shelters or 
cabinets associated with that antenna and added to a Tower, structure, 
or building as part of the original installation of the antenna. For 
most services, an Antenna will be mounted on or in, and is distinct 
from, a supporting structure such as a Tower, structure or building. 
However, in the case of AM broadcast stations, the entire Tower or group 
of Towers constitutes the Antenna for that station. For purposes of this 
Nationwide Agreement, the term Antenna does not include unintentional 
radiators, mobile stations, or devices authorized under Part 15 of the 
Commission's rules.
    2. Applicant. A Commission licensee, permittee, or registration 
holder, or an applicant or prospective applicant for a wireless or 
broadcast license, authorization or antenna structure registration, and 
the duly authorized agents, employees, and contractors of any such 
person or entity.
    3. Area of Potential Effects (``APE''). The geographic area or areas 
within which an Undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations 
in the character or use of Historic Properties, if any such properties 
exist.
    4. Collocation. The mounting or installation of an Antenna on an 
existing Tower, building, or structure for the purpose of transmitting 
radio frequency signals for telecommunications or broadcast purposes.
    5. Effect. An alteration to the characteristics of a Historic 
Property qualifying it for inclusion in or eligibility for the National 
Register.
    6. Experimental Authorization. An authorization issued to conduct 
experimentation utilizing radio waves for gathering scientific or 
technical operation data directed toward the improvement or extension of 
an established service and not intended for reception and use by the 
general public. ``Experimental Authorization'' does not include an 
``Experimental Broadcast Station'' authorized under Part 74 of the 
Commission's rules.
    7. Facility. A Tower or an Antenna. The term Facility may also refer 
to a Tower and its associated Antenna(s).
    8. Field Survey. A research strategy that utilizes one or more 
visits to the area where construction is proposed as a means of 
identifying Historic Properties.
    9. Historic Property. Any prehistoric or historic district, site, 
building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion 
in, the National Register maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. 
This term includes artifacts, records, and remains that are related to 
and located within such properties. The term includes properties of 
traditional religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or NHO 
that meet the National Register criteria.
    10. National Register. The National Register of Historic Places, 
maintained by the Secretary of the Interior's office of the Keeper of 
the National Register.
    11. SHPO/THPO Inventory. A set of records of previously gathered 
information, authorized by state or tribal law, on the absence, presence 
and significance of historic and archaeological resources within the 
state or tribal land.
    12. Special Temporary Authorization. Authorization granted to a

period at a specified variance from the terms of the station's permanent 
authorization or requirements of the Commission's rules applicable to 
the particular class or type of station.
    13. Submission Packet. The document to be submitted initially to the 
SHPO/THPO to facilitate review of the Applicant's findings and any 
determinations with regard to the potential impact of the proposed 
Undertaking on Historic Properties in the APE. There are two Submission 
Packets: (a) The New Tower Submission Packet (FCC Form 620) (See 
Attachment 3) and (b) The Collocation Submission Packet (FCC Form 621) 
(See Attachment 4). Any documents required to be submitted along with a 
Form are part of the Submission Packet.
    14. Tower. Any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of 
supporting Commission-licensed or authorized Antennas, including the on-
site fencing, equipment, switches, wiring, cabling, power sources, 
shelters, or cabinets associated with that Tower but not installed as 
part of an Antenna as defined herein.
    B. All other terms not defined above or elsewhere in this Nationwide 
Agreement shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Council's 
rules section on Definitions (36 CFR 800.16) or the Commission's rules 
(47 CFR Chapter I).
    C. For the calculation of time periods under this Agreement, 
``days'' mean ``calendar days.'' Any time period specified in the 
Agreement that ends on a weekend or a Federal or State holiday is 
extended until the close of the following business day.
    D. Written communications include communications by e-mail or 
facsimile.

           III. Undertakings Excluded From Section 106 Review

    Undertakings that fall within the provisions listed in the following 
sections III.A. through III.F. are excluded from Section 106 review by 
the SHPO/THPO, the Commission, and the Council, and, accordingly, shall 
not be submitted to the SHPO/THPO for review. The determination that an 
exclusion applies to an Undertaking should be made by an authorized 
individual within the Applicant's organization, and Applicants should 
retain documentation of their determination that

[[Page 439]]

an exclusion applies. Concerns regarding the application of these 
exclusions from Section 106 review may be presented to and considered by 
the Commission pursuant to Section XI.
    A. Enhancement of a tower and any associated excavation that does 
not involve a collocation and does not substantially increase the size 
of the existing tower, as defined in the Collocation Agreement. For 
towers constructed after March 16, 2001, this exclusion applies only if 
the tower has completed the Section 106 review process and any 
associated environmental reviews required by the Commission.
    B. Construction of a replacement for an existing communications 
tower and any associated excavation that does not substantially increase 
the size of the existing tower under elements 1-3 of the definition as 
defined in the Collocation Agreement (see Attachment 1 to this 
Agreement, Stipulation 1.c.1-3) and that does not expand the boundaries 
of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower by more than 30 
feet in any direction or involve excavation outside these expanded 
boundaries or outside any existing access or utility easement related to 
the site. For towers constructed after March 16, 2001, this exclusion 
applies only if the tower has completed the Section 106 review process 
and any associated environmental reviews required by the Commission's 
rules.
    C. Construction of any temporary communications Tower, Antenna 
structure, or related Facility that involves no excavation or where all 
areas to be excavated will be located in areas described in Section 
VI.D.2.c.i below, including but not limited to the following:
    1. A Tower or Antenna authorized by the Commission for a temporary 
period, such as any Facility authorized by a Commission grant of Special 
Temporary Authority (``STA'') or emergency authorization;
    2. A cell on wheels (COW) transmission Facility;
    3. A broadcast auxiliary services truck, TV pickup station, remote 
pickup broadcast station (e.g., electronic newsgathering vehicle) 
authorized under Part 74 or temporary fixed or transportable earth 
station in the fixed satellite service (e.g., satellite newsgathering 
vehicle) authorized under Part 25;
    4. A temporary ballast mount Tower;
    5. Any Facility authorized by a Commission grant of an experimental 
authorization.
    For purposes of this Section III.C, the term ``temporary'' means 
``for no more than twenty-four months duration except in the case of 
those Facilities associated with national security.''
    D. Construction of a Facility less than 200 feet in overall height 
above ground level in an existing industrial park, \1\ commercial strip 
mall, \2\ or shopping center \3\ that occupies a total land area of 
100,000 square feet or more, provided that the industrial park, strip 
mall, or shopping center is not located within the boundaries of or 
within 500 feet of a Historic Property, as identified by the Applicant 
after a preliminary search of relevant records. Proposed Facilities 
within this exclusion must complete the process of participation of 
Indian tribes and NHOs pursuant to Section IV of this Agreement. If as a 
result of this process the Applicant or the Commission identifies a 
Historic Property that may be affected, the Applicant must complete the 
Section 106 review process pursuant to this Agreement notwithstanding 
the exclusion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A tract of land that is planned, developed, and operated as an 
integrated facility for a number of individual industrial uses, with 
consideration to transportation facilities, circulation, parking, 
utility needs, aesthetics and compatibility.
    \2\ A structure or grouping of structures, housing retail business, 
set back far enough from the street to permit parking spaces to be 
placed between the building entrances and the public right of way.
    \3\ A group of commercial establishments planned, constructed, and

on-site, provision for goods delivery separated from customer access, 
aesthetic considerations and protection from the elements, and 
landscaping and signage in accordance with an approved plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    E. Construction of a Facility in or within 50 feet of the outer 
boundary of a right-of-way designated by a Federal, State, local, or 
Tribal government for the location of communications Towers or above-
ground utility transmission or distribution lines and associated 
structures and equipment and in active use for such purposes, provided:
    1. The proposed Facility would not constitute a substantial increase 
in size, under elements 1-3 of the definition in the Collocation 
Agreement, over existing structures located in the right-of-way within 
the vicinity of the proposed Facility, and;
    2. The proposed Facility would not be located within the boundaries 
of a Historic Property, as identified by the Applicant after a 
preliminary search of relevant records.
    Proposed Facilities within this exclusion must complete the process 
of participation of Indian tribes and NHOs pursuant to Section IV of 
this Agreement. If as a result of this process the Applicant or the 
Commission identifies a Historic Property that may be affected, the 
Applicant must complete the Section 106 review process pursuant to this 
Agreement notwithstanding the exclusion.

[[Page 440]]

    F. Construction of a Facility in any area previously designated by 
the SHPO/THPO at its discretion, following consultation with appropriate 
Indian tribes and NHOs, as having limited potential to affect Historic 
Properties. Such designation shall be documented by the SHPO/THPO and 
made available for public review.

IV. Participation of Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations in 
                      Undertakings Off Tribal Lands

    A. The Commission recognizes its responsibility to carry out 
consultation with any Indian tribe or NHO that attaches religious and 
cultural significance to a Historic Property if the property may be 
affected by a Commission undertaking. This responsibility is founded in 
Sections 101(d)(6)(a-b) and 106 of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470a(d)(6)(a-b) 
and 470f), the regulations of the Council (36 CFR Part 800), the 
Commission's environmental regulations (47 CFR 1.1301-1.1319), and the 
unique legal relationship that exists between the federal government and 
Indian Tribal governments, as reflected in the Constitution of the 
United States, treaties, federal statutes, Executive orders, and 
numerous court decisions. This historic trust relationship requires the 
federal government to adhere to certain fiduciary standards in its 
dealings with Indian Tribes. (Commission Statement of Policy on 
Establishing a Government-to-Government Relationship with Indian 
Tribes).
    B. As an initial step to enable the Commission to fulfill its duty 
of consultation, Applicants shall use reasonable and good faith efforts 
to identify any Indian tribe or NHO that may attach religious and 
cultural significance to Historic Properties that may be affected by an 
Undertaking. Applicants should be aware that frequently, Historic 
Properties of religious and cultural significance to Indian tribes and 
NHOs are located on ancestral, aboriginal, or ceded lands of such tribes 
and organizations and Applicants should take this into account when 
complying with their responsibilities. Where an Indian tribe or NHO has 
voluntarily provided information to the Commission's Tower Construction 
Notification System regarding the geographic areas in which Historic 
Properties of religious and cultural significance to that Indian tribe 
or NHO may be located, reference to the Tower Construction Notification 
System shall constitute a reasonable and good faith effort at 
identification with respect to that Indian tribe or NHO. In addition, 
such reasonable and good faith efforts may include, but are not limited 
to, seeking relevant information from the relevant SHPO/THPO, Indian 
tribes, state agencies, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (``BIA''), or, 
where applicable, any federal agency with land holdings within the state 
(e.g., the U.S. Bureau of Land Management). Although these agencies can 
provide useful information in identifying potentially affected Indian 
tribes, contacting BIA, the SHPO or other federal and state agencies is 
not a substitute for seeking information directly from Indian tribes 
that may attach religious and cultural significance to a potentially 
affected Historic Property, as described below.
    C. After the Applicant has identified Indian tribes and NHOs that 
may attach religious and cultural significance to potentially affected 
Historic Properties, the Commission has the responsibility, and the 
Commission imposes on the Applicant the obligation, to ensure that 
contact is made at an early stage in the planning process with such 
Indian tribes and NHOs in order to begin the process of ascertaining 
whether such Historic Properties may be affected. This initial contact 
shall be made by the Commission or the Applicant, in accordance with the 
wishes of the Indian tribe or NHO. This contact shall constitute only an 
initial effort to contact the Indian tribe or NHO, and does not in 
itself fully satisfy the Applicant's obligations or substitute for 
government-to-government consultation unless the Indian tribe or NHO 
affirmatively disclaims further interest or the Indian tribe or NHO has 
otherwise agreed that such contact is sufficient. Depending on the 
preference of the Indian tribe or NHO, the means of initial contact may 
include, without limitation:
    1. Electronic notification through the Commission's Tower 
Construction Notification System;
    2. Written communication from the Commission at the request of the 
Applicant;
    3. Written, e-mail, or telephonic notification directly from the 
Applicant to the Indian tribe or NHO;
    4. Any other means that the Indian Tribe or NHO has informed the 
Commission are acceptable, including through the adoption of best 
practices pursuant to Section IV.J, below; or
    5. Any other means to which an Indian tribe or NHO and an Applicant 
have agreed pursuant to Section IV.K, below.
    D. The Commission will use its best efforts to ascertain the 
preferences of each Indian tribe and NHO for initial contact, and to 
make these preferences available to Applicants in a readily accessible 
format. In addition, the Commission will use its best efforts to 
ascertain, and to make available to Applicants, any locations or types 
of construction projects, within the broad geographic areas in which 
Historic Properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian 
tribe or NHO may be located, for which the Indian tribe or NHO does not 
expect notification. To the extent they are comfortable doing so, the 
Commission encourages Indian tribes and

[[Page 441]]

NHOs to accept the Tower Construction Notification System as an 
efficient and thorough means of making initial contact.
    E. In the absence of any contrary indication of an Indian tribe's or 
NHO's preference, where an Applicant does not have a pre-existing 
relationship with an Indian tribe or NHO, initial contact with the 
Indian tribe or NHO shall be made through the Commission. Unless the 
Indian tribe or NHO has indicated otherwise, the Commission may make 
this initial contact through the Tower Construction Notification System. 
An Applicant that has a pre-existing relationship with an Indian tribe 
or NHO shall make initial contact in the manner that is customary to 
that relationship or in such other manner as may be accepted by the 
Indian tribe or NHO. An Applicant shall copy the Commission on any 
initial written or electronic direct contact with an Indian tribe or 
NHO, unless the Indian tribe or NHO has agreed through a best practices 
agreement or otherwise that such copying is not necessary.
    F. Applicants' direct contacts with Indian tribes and NHOs, where 
accepted by the Indian tribe or NHO, shall be made in a sensitive manner 
that is consistent with the reasonable wishes of the Indian tribe or 
NHO, where such wishes are known or can be reasonably ascertained. In 
general, unless an Indian tribe or NHO has provided guidance to the 
contrary, Applicants shall follow the following guidelines:
    1. All communications with Indian tribes shall be respectful of 
tribal sovereignty;
    2. Communications shall be directed to the appropriate 
representative designated or identified by the tribal government or 
other governing body;
    3. Applicants shall provide all information reasonably necessary for 
the Indian tribe or NHO to evaluate whether Historic Properties of 
religious and cultural significance may be affected. The parties 
recognize that it may be neither feasible nor desirable to provide 
complete information about the project at the time of initial contact, 
particularly when initial contact is made early in the process. Unless 
the Indian tribe or NHO affirmatively disclaims interest, however, it 
shall be provided with complete information within the earliest 
reasonable time frame;
    4. The Applicant must ensure that Indian tribes and NHOs have a 
reasonable opportunity to respond to all communications. Ordinarily, 30 
days from the time the relevant tribal or NHO representative may 
reasonably be expected to have received an inquiry shall be considered a 
reasonable time. Should a tribe or NHO request additional time to 
respond, the Applicant shall afford additional time as reasonable under 
the circumstances. However, where initial contact is made automatically 
through the Tower Construction Notification System, and where an Indian 
tribe or NHO has stated that it is not interested in reviewing proposed 
construction of certain types or in certain locations, the Applicant 
need not await a response to contact regarding proposed construction 
meeting that description;
    5. Applicants should not assume that failure to respond to a single 
communication establishes that an Indian tribe or NHO is not interested 
in participating, but should make a reasonable effort to follow up.
    G. The purposes of communications between the Applicant and Indian 
tribes or NHOs are: (1) To ascertain whether Historic Properties of 
religious and cultural significance to the Indian tribe or NHO may be 
affected by the undertaking and consultation is therefore necessary, and 
(2) where possible, with the concurrence of the Indian tribe or NHO, to 
reach an agreement on the presence or absence of effects that may 
obviate the need for consultation. Accordingly, the Applicant shall 
promptly refer to the Commission any request from a federally recognized 
Indian tribe for government-to-government consultation. The Commission 
will then carry out government-to-government consultation with the 
Indian tribe. Applicants shall also seek guidance from the Commission in 
the event of any substantive or procedural disagreement with an Indian 
tribe or NHO, or if the Indian tribe or NHO does not respond to the 
Applicant's inquiries. Applicants are strongly advised to seek guidance 
from the Commission in cases of doubt.
    H. If an Indian tribe or NHO indicates that a Historic Property of 
religious and cultural significance to it may be affected, the Applicant 
shall invite the commenting tribe or organization to become a consulting 
party. If the Indian tribe or NHO agrees to become a consulting party, 
it shall be afforded that status and shall be provided with all of the 
information, copies of submissions, and other prerogatives of a 
consulting party as provided for in 36 CFR 800.2.
    I. Information regarding Historic Properties to which Indian tribes 
or NHOs attach religious and cultural significance may be highly 
confidential, private, and sensitive. If an Indian tribe or NHO requests 
confidentiality from the Applicant, the Applicant shall honor this 
request and shall, in turn, request confidential treatment of such 
materials or information in accordance with the Commission's rules and 
Section 304 of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470w-3(a)) in the event they are 
submitted to the Commission. The Commission shall provide such 
confidential treatment consistent with its rules and applicable federal 
laws. Although the Commission will strive to protect the privacy 
interests of all parties, the Commission cannot guarantee its own 
ability or the ability of Applicants to protect confidential, private, 
and sensitive information from disclosure under all circumstances.

[[Page 442]]

    J. In order to promote efficiency, minimize misunderstandings, and 
ensure that communications among the parties are made in accordance with 
each Indian tribe or NHO's reasonable preferences, the Commission will 
use its best efforts to arrive at agreements regarding best practices 
with Indian tribes and NHOs and their representatives. Such best 
practices may include means of making initial contacts with Indian 
tribes and NHOs as well as guidelines for subsequent discussions between 
Applicants and Indian tribes or NHOs in fulfillment of the requirements 
of the Section 106 process. To the extent possible, the Commission will 
strive to achieve consistency among best practice agreements with Indian 
tribes and NHOs. Where best practices exist, the Commission encourages 
Applicants to follow those best practices.
    K. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit or limit 
Applicants and Indian tribes or NHOs from entering into or continuing 
pre-existing arrangements or agreements governing their contacts, 
provided such arrangements or agreements are otherwise consistent with 
federal law and no modification is made in the roles of other parties to 
the process under this Nationwide Agreement without their consent. 
Documentation of such alternative arrangements or agreements should be 
filed with the Commission.

             V. Public Participation and Consulting Parties

    A. On or before the date an Applicant submits the appropriate 
Submission Packet to the SHPO/THPO, as prescribed by Section VII, below, 
the Applicant shall provide the local government that has primary land 
use jurisdiction over the site of the planned Undertaking with written 
notification of the planned Undertaking.
    B. On or before the date an Applicant submits the appropriate 
Submission Packet to the SHPO/THPO, as prescribed by Section VII, below, 
the Applicant shall provide written notice to the public of the planned 
Undertaking. Such notice may be accomplished (1) through the public 
notification provisions of the relevant local zoning or local historic 
preservation process for the proposed Facility; or (2) by publication in 
a local newspaper of general circulation. In the alternative, an 
Applicant may use other appropriate means of providing public notice, 
including seeking the assistance of the local government.
    C. The written notice to the local government and to the public 
shall include: (1) The location of the proposed Facility including its 
street address; (2) a description of the proposed Facility including its 
height and type of structure; (3) instruction on how to submit comments 
regarding potential effects on Historic Properties; and (4) the name, 
address, and telephone number of a contact person.
    D. A SHPO/THPO may make available lists of other groups, including 
Indian tribes, NHOs and organizations of Indian tribes or NHOs, which 
should be provided notice for Undertakings to be located in particular 
areas.
    E. If the Applicant receives a comment regarding potentially 
affected Historic Properties, the Applicant shall consider the comment 
and either include it in the initial submission to the SHPO/THPO, or, if 
the initial submission has already been made, immediately forward the 
comment to the SHPO/THPO for review. An Applicant need not submit to the 
SHPO/THPO any comment that does not substantially relate to potentially 
affected Historic Properties.
    F. The relevant SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes and NHOs that attach 
religious and cultural significance to Historic Properties that may be 
affected, and the local government are entitled to be consulting parties 
in the Section 106 review of an Undertaking. The Council may enter the 
Section 106 process for a given Undertaking, on Commission invitation or 
on its own decision, in accordance with 36 CFR Part 800, Appendix A. An 
Applicant shall consider all written requests of other individuals and 
organizations to participate as consulting parties and determine which 
should be consulting parties. An Applicant is encouraged to grant such 
status to individuals or organizations with a demonstrated legal or 
economic interest in the Undertaking, or demonstrated expertise or 
standing as a representative of local or public interest in historic or 
cultural resources preservation. Any such individual or organization 
denied consulting party status may petition the Commission for review of 
such denial. Applicants may seek assistance from the Commission in 
identifying and involving consulting parties. All entities granted 
consulting party status shall be identified to the SHPO/THPO as part of 
the Submission Packet.
    G. Consulting parties are entitled to: (1) Receive notices, copies 
of submission packets, correspondence and other documents provided to 
the SHPO/THPO in a Section 106 review; and (2) be provided an 
opportunity to have their views expressed and taken into account by the 
Applicant, the SHPO/THPO and, where appropriate, by the Commission.

        VI. Identification, Evaluation, and Assessment of Effects

    A. In preparing the Submission Packet for the SHPO/THPO and 
consulting parties pursuant to Section VII of this Nationwide Agreement 
and Attachments 3 and 4, the Applicant shall: (1) Define the area of 
potential effects (APE); (2) identify Historic Properties

[[Page 443]]

within the APE; (3) evaluate the historic significance of identified 
properties as appropriate; and (4) assess the effects of the Undertaking 
on Historic Properties. The standards and procedures described below 
shall be applied by the Applicant in preparing the Submission Packet, by 
the SHPO/THPO in reviewing the Submission Packet, and where appropriate, 
by the Commission in making findings.
    B. Exclusion of Specific Geographic Areas from Review.
    The SHPO/THPO, consistent with relevant State or tribal procedures, 
may specify geographic areas in which no review is required for direct 
effects on archeological resources or no review is required for visual 
effects.
    C. Area of Potential Effects.
    1. The term ``Area of Potential Effects'' is defined in Section 
II.A.3 of this Nationwide Agreement. For purposes of this Nationwide 
Agreement, the APE for direct effects and the APE for visual effects are 
further defined and are to be established as described below.
    2. The APE for direct effects is limited to the area of potential 
ground disturbance and any property, or any portion thereof, that will 
be physically altered or destroyed by the Undertaking.
    3. The APE for visual effects is the geographic area in which the 
Undertaking has the potential to introduce visual elements that diminish 
or alter the setting, including the landscape, where the setting is a 
character-defining feature of a Historic Property that makes it eligible 
for listing on the National Register.
    4. Unless otherwise established through consultation with the SHPO/
THPO, the presumed APE for visual effects for construction of new 
Facilities is the area from which the Tower will be visible:
    a. Within a half mile from the tower site if the proposed Tower is 
200 feet or less in overall height;
    b. Within \3/4\ of a mile from the tower site if the proposed Tower 
is more than 200 but no more than 400 feet in overall height; or
    c. Wthin 1 \1/2\ miles from the proposed tower site if the proposed 
Tower is more than 400 feet in overall height.
    5. In the event the Applicant determines, or the SHPO/THPO 
recommends, that an alternative APE for visual effects is necessary, the 
Applicant and the SHPO/THPO may mutually agree to an alternative APE.
    6. If the Applicant and the SHPO/THPO, after using good faith 
efforts, cannot reach an agreement on the use of an alternative APE, 
either the Applicant or the SHPO/THPO may submit the issue to the 
Commission for resolution. The Commission shall make its determination 
concerning an alternative APE within a reasonable time.
    D. Identification and Evaluation of Historic Properties.
    1. Identification and Evaluation of Historic Properties Within the 
APE for Visual Effects.
    a. Except to identify Historic Properties of religious and cultural 
significance to Indian tribes and NHOs, Applicants shall identify 
Historic Properties within the APE for visual effects by reviewing the 
following records. Applicants are required to review such records only 
to the extent they are available at the offices of the SHPO/THPO or can 
be found in publicly available sources identified by the SHPO/THPO. With 
respect to these properties, Applicants are not required to undertake a 
Field Survey or other measures other than reviewing these records in 
order to identify Historic Properties:
    i. Properties listed in the National Register;
    ii. Properties formally determined eligible for listing by the 
Keeper of the National Register;
    iii. Properties that the SHPO/THPO certifies are in the process of 
being nominated to the National Register;
    iv. Properties previously determined eligible as part of a consensus 
determination of eligibility between the SHPO/THPO and a Federal Agency 
or local government representing the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD); and
    v. Properties listed in the SHPO/THPO Inventory that the SHPO/THPO 
has previously evaluated and found to meet the National Register 
criteria, and that are identified accordingly in the SHPO/THPO 
Inventory.
    b. At an early stage in the planning process and in accordance with 
Section IV of this Nationwide Agreement, the Commission or the 
Applicant, as appropriate, shall gather information from Indian tribes 
or NHOs identified pursuant to Section IV.B to assist in identifying 
Historic Properties of religious and cultural significance to them 
within the APE for visual effects. Such information gathering may 
include a Field Survey where appropriate.
    c. Based on the sources listed above and public comment received 
pursuant to Section V of this Nationwide Agreement, the Applicant shall 
include in its Submission Packet a list of properties it has identified 
as apparent Historic Properties within the APE for visual effects.
    i. During the review period described in Section VII.A, the SHPO/
THPO may identify additional properties included in the SHPO/THPO 
Inventory and located within the APE that the SHPO/THPO considers 
eligible for listing on the National Register, and notify the Applicant 
pursuant to Section VII.A.4.
    ii. The SHPO/THPO may also advise the Applicant that previously 
identified properties on the list no longer qualify for inclusion in the 
National Register.
    d. Applicants are encouraged at their discretion to use the services 
of professionals

[[Page 444]]

who meet the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification 
Standards when identifying Historic Properties within the APE for visual 
effects.
    e. Applicants are not required to evaluate the historic significance 
of properties identified pursuant to Section VI.D.1.a., but may rely on 
the previous evaluation of these properties. Applicants may, at their 
discretion, evaluate whether such properties are no longer eligible for 
inclusion in the National Register and recommend to the SHPO/THPO their 
removal from consideration. Any such evaluation shall be performed by a 
professional who meets the Secretary of the Interior's Professional 
Qualification Standards.
    2. Identification and Evaluation of Historic Properties Within the 
APE for Direct Effects.
    a. In addition to the properties identified pursuant to Section 
VI.D.1, Applicants shall make a reasonable good faith effort to identify 
other above ground and archeological Historic Properties, including 
buildings, structures, and historic districts, that lie within the APE 
for direct effects. Such reasonable and good faith efforts may include a 
Field Survey where appropriate.
    b. Identification and evaluation of Historic Properties within the 
APE for direct effects, including any finding that an archeological 
Field Survey is not required, shall be undertaken by a professional who 
meets the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification 
Standards. Identification and evaluation relating to archeological 
resources shall be performed by a professional who meets the Secretary 
of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards in archeology.
    c. Except as provided below, the Applicant need not undertake a 
Field Survey for archeological resources where:
    i. the depth of previous disturbance exceeds the proposed 
construction depth (excluding footings and other anchoring mechanisms) 
by at least 2 feet as documented in the Applicant's siting analysis; or
    ii. geomorphological evidence indicates that cultural resource-
bearing soils do not occur within the project area or may occur but at 
depths that exceed 2 feet below the proposed construction depth.
    d. At an early stage in the planning process and in accordance with 
Section IV of this Nationwide Agreement, the Commission or the 
Applicant, as appropriate, shall gather information from Indian tribes 
or NHOs identified pursuant to Section IV.B to assist in identifying 
archeological Historic Properties of religious and cultural significance 
to them within the APE for direct effects. If an Indian tribe or NHO 
provides evidence that supports a high probability of the presence of 
intact archeological Historic Properties within the APE for direct 
effects, the Applicant shall conduct an archeological Field Survey 
notwithstanding Section VI.D.2.c.
    e. Where the Applicant pursuant to Sections VI.D.2.c and VI.D.2.d 
finds that no archeological Field Survey is necessary, it shall include 
in its Submission Packet a report substantiating this finding. During 
the review period described in Section VII.A, the SHPO/THPO may, based 
on evidence that supports a high probability of the presence of intact 
archeological Historic Properties within the APE for direct effects, 
notify the Applicant that the Submission Packet is inadequate without an 
archeological Field Survey pursuant to Section VII.A.4.
    f. The Applicant shall conduct an archeological Field Survey within 
the APE for direct effects if neither of the conditions in Section 
VI.D.2.c applies, or if required pursuant to Section VI.D.2.d or e. The 
Field Survey shall be conducted in consul-tation with the SHPO/THPO and 
consulting Indian tribes or NHOs.
    g. The Applicant, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO and appropriate 
Indian tribes or NHOs, shall apply the National Register criteria (36 
CFR Part 63) to properties identified within the APE for direct effects 
that have not previously been evaluated for National Register 
eligibility, with the exception of those identified pursuant to Section 
VI.D.1.a.
    3. Dispute Resolution. Where there is a disagreement regarding the 
identification or eligibility of a property, and after attempting in 
good faith to resolve the issue the Applicant and the SHPO/THPO continue 
to disagree, the Applicant or the SHPO/THPO may submit the issue to the 
Commission. The Commission shall handle such submissions in accordance 
with 36 CFR 800.4(c)(2).
    E. Assessment of Effects
    1. Applicants shall assess effects of the Undertaking on Historic 
Properties using the Criteria of Adverse Effect (36 CFR 800.5(a)(1)).
    2. In determining whether Historic Properties in the APE may be 
adversely affected by the Undertaking, the Applicant should consider 
factors such as the topography, vegetation, known presence of Historic 
Properties, and existing land use.
    3. An Undertaking will have a visual adverse effect on a Historic 
Property if the visual effect from the Facility will noticeably diminish 
the integrity of one or more of the characteristics qualifying the 
property for inclusion in or eligibility for the National Register. 
Construction of a Facility will not cause a visual adverse effect except 
where visual setting or visual elements are character-defining features 
of eligibility of a Historic Property located within the APE.
    4. For collocations not excluded from review by the Collocation 
Agreement or this Agreement, the assessment of effects will

[[Page 445]]

consider only effects from the newly added or modified Facilities and 
not effects from the existing Tower or Antenna.
    5. Assessment pursuant to this Agreement shall be performed by 
professionals who meet the Secretary of the Interior's Professional 
Qualification Standards.

                             VII. Procedures

                     A. Use of the Submission Packet

    1. For each Undertaking within the scope of this Nationwide 
Agreement, the Applicant shall initially determine whether there are no 
Historic Properties affected, no adverse effect on Historic Properties, 
or an adverse effect on Historic Properties. The Applicant shall prepare 
a Submission Packet and submit it to the SHPO/THPO and to all consulting 
parties, including any Indian tribe or NHO that is participating as a 
consulting party.
    2. The SHPO/THPO shall have 30 days from receipt of the requisite 
documentation to review the Submission Packet.
    3. If the SHPO/THPO receives a comment or objection, in accordance 
with Section V.E, more than 25 but less than 31 days following its 
receipt of the initial submission, the SHPO/THPO shall have five 
calendar days to consider such comment or objection before the Section 
106 process is complete or the matter may be submitted to the 
Commission.
    4. If the SHPO/THPO determines the Applicant's Submission Packet is 
inadequate, or if the SHPO/THPO identifies additional Historic 
Properties within the APE, the SHPO/THPO will immediately notify the 
Applicant and describe any deficiencies. The SHPO/THPO may close its 
file without prejudice if the Applicant does not resubmit an amended 
Submission Packet within 60 days following the Applicant's receipt of 
the returned Submission Packet. Resubmission of the Submission Packet to 
the SHPO/THPO commences a new 30 day period for review.

          B. Determinations of No Historic Properties Affected

    1. If the SHPO/THPO concurs in writing with the Applicant's 
determination of no Historic Properties affected, it is deemed that no 
Historic Properties exist within the APE or the Undertaking will have no 
effect on any Historic Properties located within the APE. The Section 
106 process is then complete, and the Applicant may proceed with the 
project, unless further processing for reasons other than Section 106 is 
required.
    2. If the SHPO/THPO does not provide written notice to the Applicant 
that it agrees or disagrees with the Applicant's determination of no 
Historic Properties affected within 30 days following receipt of a 
complete Submission Packet, it is deemed that no Historic Properties 
exist within the APE or the Undertaking will have no effect on Historic 
Properties. The Section 106 process is then complete and the Applicant 
may proceed with the project, unless further processing for reasons 
other than Section 106 is required.
    3. If the SHPO/THPO provides written notice within 30 days following 
receipt of the Submission Packet that it disagrees with the Applicant's 
determination of no Historic Properties affected, it should provide a 
short and concise explanation of exactly how the criteria of eligibility 
and/or criteria of Adverse Effect would apply. The Applicant and the 
SHPO/THPO should engage in further discussions and make a reasonable and 
good faith effort to resolve their disagreement.
    4. If the SHPO/THPO and Applicant do not resolve their disagreement, 
the Applicant may at any time choose to submit the matter, together with 
all relevant documents, to the Commission, advising the SHPO/THPO 
accordingly.

                 C. Determinations of No Adverse Effect

    1. If the SHPO/THPO concurs in writing with the Applicant's 
determination of no adverse effect, the Facility is deemed to have no 
adverse effect on Historic Properties. The Section 106 process is then 
complete and the Applicant may proceed with the project, unless further 
processing for reasons other than Section 106 is required.
    2. If the SHPO/THPO does not provide written notice to the Applicant 
that it agrees or disagrees with the Applicant's determination of no 
adverse effect within thirty days following its receipt of a complete 
Submission Packet, the SHPO/THPO is presumed to have concurred with the 
Applicant's determination. The Applicant shall, pursuant to procedures 
to be promulgated by the Commission, forward a copy of its Submission 
Packet to the Commission, together with all correspondence with the 
SHPO/THPO and any comments or objections received from the public, and 
advise the SHPO/THPO accordingly. The Section 106 process shall then be 
complete unless the Commission notifies the Applicant otherwise within 
15 days after the Commission receives the Submission Packet and 
accompanying material electronically or 25 days after the Commission 
receives this material by other means.
    3. If the SHPO/THPO provides written notice within 30 days following 
receipt of the Submission Packet that it disagrees with the Applicant's 
determination of no adverse effect, it should provide a short and 
concise explanation of the Historic Properties it believes to be 
affected and exactly how the criteria of Adverse Effect would apply. The 
Applicant and the SHPO/THPO should engage in further discussions and 
make a reasonable and good faith effort to resolve their disagreement.

    4. If the SHPO/THPO and Applicant do not resolve their dispute, the 
Applicant may at any time choose to submit the matter, together with all 
relevant documents, to the Commission, advising the SHPO/THPO 
accordingly.
    5. Whenever the Applicant or the Commission concludes, or a SHPO/
THPO advises, that a proposed project will have an adverse effect on a 
Historic Property, after applying the criteria of Adverse Effect, the 
Applicant and the SHPO/THPO are encouraged to investigate measures that 
would avoid the adverse effect and permit a conditional ``No Adverse 
Effect'' determination.
    6. If the Applicant and SHPO/THPO mutually agree upon conditions 
that will result in no adverse effect, the Applicant shall advise the 
SHPO/THPO in writing that it will comply with the conditions. The 
Applicant can then make a determination of no adverse effect subject to 
its implementation of the conditions. The Undertaking is then deemed 
conditionally to have no adverse effect on Historic Properties, and the 
Applicant may proceed with the project subject to compliance with those 
conditions. Where the Commission has previously been involved in the 
matter, the Applicant shall notify the Commission of this resolution.

                   D. Determinations of Adverse Effect

    1. If the Applicant determines at any stage in the process that an 
Undertaking would have an adverse effect on Historic Properties within 
the APE(s), or if the Commission so finds, the Applicant shall submit to 
the SHPO/THPO a plan designed to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the 
adverse effect.
    2. The Applicant shall forward a copy of its submission with its 
mitigation plan and the entire record to the Council and the Commission. 
Within fifteen days following receipt of the Applicant's submission, the 
Council shall indicate whether it intends to participate in the 
negotiation of a Memorandum of Agreement by notifying both the Applicant 
and the Commission.
    3. Where the Undertaking would have an adverse effect on a National 
Historic Landmark, the Commission shall request the Council to 
participate in consultation and shall invite participation by the 
Secretary of the Interior.
    4. The Applicant, SHPO/THPO, and consulting parties shall negotiate 
a Memorandum of Agreement that shall be sent to the Commission for 
review and execution.
    5. If the parties are unable to agree upon mitigation measures, they 
shall submit the matter to the Commission, which shall coordinate 
additional actions in accordance with the Council's rules, including 36 
CFR 800.6(b)(1)(v) and 800.7.

                       E. Retention of Information

    The SHPO/THPO shall, subject to applicable state or tribal laws and 
regulations, and in accordance with its rules and procedures governing 
historic property records, retain the information in the Submission 
Packet pertaining to the location and National Register eligibility of 
Historic Properties and make such information available to Federal 
agencies and Applicants in other Section 106 reviews, where disclosure 
is not prevented by the confidentiality standards in 36 CFR 800.11(c).

                      F. Removal of Obsolete Towers

    Applicants that construct new Towers under the terms of this 
Nationwide Agreement adjacent to or within the boundaries of a Historic 
Property are encouraged to disassemble such Towers should they become 
obsolete or remain vacant for a year or more.

                       VIII. Emergency Situations

    Unless the Commission deems it necessary to issue an emergency 
authorization in accordance with its rules, or the Undertaking is 
otherwise excluded from Section 106 review pursuant to the Collocation 
Agreement or Section III of this Agreement, the procedures in this 
Agreement shall apply.

               IX. Inadvertent or Post-Review Discoveries

    A. In the event that an Applicant discovers a previously 
unidentified site within the APE that may be a Historic Property that 
would be affected by an Undertaking, the Applicant shall promptly notify 
the Commission, the SHPO/THPO and any potentially affected Indian tribe 
or NHO, and within a reasonable time shall submit to the Commission, the 
SHPO/THPO and any potentially affected Indian tribe or NHO, a written 
report evaluating the property's eligibility for inclusion in the 
National Register. The Applicant shall seek the input of any potentially 
affected Indian tribe or NHO in preparing this report. If found during 
construction, construction must cease until evaluation has been 
completed.
    B. If the Applicant and SHPO/THPO concur that the discovered 
resource is eligible for listing in the National Register, the Applicant 
will consult with the SHPO/THPO, and Indian tribes or NHOs as 
appropriate, to evaluate measures that will avoid, minimize, or mitigate 
adverse effects. Upon agreement regarding such measures, the Applicant 
shall implement them and notify the Commission of its action.
    C. If the Applicant and SHPO/THPO cannot reach agreement regarding 
the eligibility of a property, the matter will be referred to the 
Commission for review in accordance with Section VI.D.3. If the 
Applicant and the

[[Page 447]]

SHPO/THPO cannot reach agreement on measures to avoid, minimize, or 
mitigate adverse effects, the matter shall be referred to the Commission 
for appropriate action.
    D. If the Applicant discovers any human or burial remains during 
implementation of an Undertaking, the Applicant shall cease work 
immediately, notify the SHPO/THPO and Commission, and adhere to 
applicable State and Federal laws regarding the treatment of human or 
burial remains.

          X. Construction Prior to Compliance With Section 106

    A. The terms of Section 110(k) of the National Historic Preservation 
Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2(k)) (``Section 110(k)'') apply to Undertakings 
covered by this Agreement. Any SHPO/THPO, potentially affected Indian 
tribe or NHO, the Council, or a member of the public may submit a 
complaint to the Commission alleging that a facility has been 
constructed or partially constructed after the effective date of this 
Agreement in violation of Section 110(k). Any such complaint must be in 
writing and supported by substantial evidence specifically describing 
how Section 110(k) has been violated. Upon receipt of such complaint the 
Commission will assume responsibility for investigating the 
applicability of Section 110(k) in accordance with the provisions 
herein.
    B. If upon its initial review, the Commission concludes that a 
complaint on its face demonstrates a probable violation of Section 
110(k), the Commission will immediately notify and provide the relevant 
Applicant with copies of the Complaint and order that all construction 
of a new tower or installation of any new collocations immediately cease 
and remain suspended pending the Commission's resolution of the 
complaint.
    C. Within 15 days of receipt, the Commission will review the 
complaint and take appropriate action, which the Commission may 
determine, and which may include the following:
    1. Dismiss the complaint without further action if the complaint 
does not establish a probable violation of Section 110(k) even if the 
allegations are taken as true;
    2. Provide the Applicant with a copy of the complaint and request a 
written response within a reasonable time;
    3. Request from the Applicant a background report which documents 
the history and chronology of the planning and construction of the 
Facility;
    4. Request from the Applicant a summary of the steps taken to comply 
with the requirements of Section 106 as set forth in this Nationwide 
Agreement, particularly the application of the Criteria of Adverse 
Effect;
    5. Request from the Applicant copies of any documents regarding the 
planning or construction of the Facility, including correspondence, 
memoranda, and agreements;
    6. If the Facility was constructed prior to full compliance with the 
requirements of Section 106, request from the Applicant an explanation 
for such failure, and possible measures that can be taken to mitigate 
any resulting adverse effects on Historic Properties.
    D. If the Commission concludes that there is a probable violation of 
Section 110(k) (i.e., that ``with intent to avoid the requirements of 
Section 106, [an Applicant] has intentionally significantly adversely 
affected a Historic Property''), the Commission shall notify the 
Applicant and forward a copy of the documentation set forth in Section 
X.C. to the Council and, as appropriate, the SHPO/THPO and other 
consulting parties, along with the Commission's opinion regarding the 
probable violation of Section 110(k). The Commission will consider the 
views of the consulting parties in determining a resolution, which may 
include negotiating a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that will resolve 
any adverse effects. The Commission, SHPO/THPO, Council, and Applicant 
shall sign the MOA to evidence acceptance of the mitigation plan and 
conclusion of the Section 106 review process.
    E. Nothing in Section X or any other provision of this Agreement 
shall preclude the Commission from continuing or instituting enforcement 
proceedings under the Communications Act and its rules against an 
Applicant that has constructed a Facility prior to completing required 
review under this Agreement. Sanctions for violations of the 
Commission's rules may include any sanctions allowed under the 
Communications Act and the Commission's rules.
    F. The Commission shall provide copies of all concluding reports or 
orders for all Section 110(k) investigations conducted by the Commission 
to the original complainant, the Applicant, the relevant local 
government, and other consulting parties.
    G. Facilities that are excluded from Section 106 review pursuant to 
the Collocation Agreement or Section III of this Agreement are not 
subject to review under this provision. Any parties who allege that such 
Facilities have violated Section 110(k) should notify the Commission in 
accordance with the provisions of Section XI, Public Comments and 
Objections.

                   XI. Public Comments and Objections

    Any member of the public may notify the Commission of concerns it 
has regarding the application of this Nationwide Agreement within a 
State or with regard to the review of individual Undertakings covered or 
excluded under the terms of this Agreement. Comments related to

Sec. 2.102  Assignment of frequencies.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the assignment of 
frequencies and bands of frequencies to all stations and classes of 
stations and the licensing and authorizing of the use of all such 
frequencies between 9 kHz and 275 GHz, and the actual use of such 
frequencies for radiocommunication or for any other purpose, including 
the transfer of energy by radio, shall be in accordance with the Table 
of Frequency Allocations in Sec. 2.106.
    (b) On the condition that harmful interference will not be caused to 
services operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations 
the following exceptions to paragraph (a) of this section may be 
authorized:
    (1) In individual cases the Commission may, without rule making 
proceedings, authorize on a temporary basis only, the use of frequencies 
not in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations for projects 
of short duration or emergencies where the Commission finds that 
important or exceptional circumstances require such utilization. Such 
authorizations are not intended to develop a service to be operated on 
frequencies other than those allocated such service.
    (2) A station for the development of techniques or equipment to be 
employed by services set forth in column 5 of the Table of Frequency 
Allocations may be authorized the use of frequencies allocated to those 
services or classes of stations.
    (3) Experimental stations, pursuant to part 5 of this chapter, may 
be authorized the use of any frequency or frequency band not exclusively 
allocated to the passive services (including the radio astronomy 
service).
    (4) In the event a band is reallocated so as to delete its 
availability for use by a particular service, the Commission may provide 
for the further interim use of the band by stations in that service for 
a temporary, specific period of time.
    (c) Non-Federal stations may be authorized to use Federal 
frequencies in the bands above 25 MHz if the Commission finds, after 
consultations with the

[[Page 464]]

appropriate Federal agency or agencies, that such use is necessary for 
coordination of Federal and non-Federal activities: Provided, however, 
that:
    (1) Non-Federal operation on Federal frequencies shall conform with 
the conditions agreed upon by the Commission and NTIA (the more 
important of which are contained in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and 
(c)(4) of this section);
    (2) Such operations shall be in accordance with NTIA rules governing 
the service to which the frequencies involved are allocated;
    (3) Such operations shall not cause harmful interference to Federal 
stations and, should harmful interference result, that the interfering 
non-Federal operation shall immediately terminate; and
    (4) Non-Federal operation has been certified as necessary by the 
Federal agency involved and this certification has been furnished, in 
writing, to the non-Federal licensee with which communication is 
required.
    (d) Aircraft stations may communicate with stations of the maritime 
mobile service. They shall then conform to those provisions of the 
international Radio Regulations which relate to the maritime mobile 
service. For this purpose aircraft stations should use the frequencies 
allocated to the maritime mobile service. However, having regard to 
interference which may be caused by aircraft stations at high altitudes, 
maritime mobile frequencies in the bands above 30 MHz shall not be used 
by aircraft stations in any specific area without the prior agreement of 
all administrations of the area in which interference is likely to be 
caused. In particular, aircraft stations operating in Region 1 should 
not use frequencies in the bands above 30 MHz allocated to the maritime 
mobile service by virtue of any agreement between administrations in 
that Region.
    (e) Non-Federal services operating on frequencies in the band 25-50 
MHz must recognize that it is shared with various services of other 
countries; that harmful interference may be caused by skywave signals 
received from distant stations of all services of the United States and 
other countries radiating power on frequencies in this band; and that no 
protection from such harmful interference generally can be expected. 
Persons desiring to avoid such harmful interference should consider 
operation on available frequencies higher in the radio spectrum not 
generally subject to this type of difficulty.
    (f) The stations of a service shall use frequencies so separated 
from the limits of a band allocated to that service as not to cause 
harmful interference to allocated services in immediately adjoining 
frequency bands.
    (g) In the bands above 25 MHz which are allocated to the non-Federal 
land mobile service, fixed stations may be authorized on the following 
conditions:
    (1) That such stations are authorized in the service shown in Column 
5 of the Table of Frequency Allocations in the band in question;
    (2) That harmful interference will not be caused to services 
operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations.
    (h) Special provisions regarding the use of spectrum allocated to 
the fixed and land mobile services below 25 MHz by non-Federal stations.
    (1) Only in the following circumstances will authority be extended 
to stations in the fixed service to operate on frequencies below 25 MHz.
    (i) With respect to aeronautical fixed stations, only when a showing 
can be made that more suitable facilities are not available.
    (ii) With respect to fixed stations, except aeronautical fixed 
stations, only to:
    (A) Provide communication circuits in emergency and/or disaster 
situations, where safety of life and property are concerned;
    (B) Provide standby and/or backup facilities to satellite and cable 
circuits used for international public correspondence;
    (C) Provide standby and/or backup communications circuits to regular 
domestic communication circuits which have been disrupted by disasters 
and/or emergencies;
    (D) Provide communication circuits wholly within the State of Alaska 
and the United States insular areas in the Pacific; and
    (E) Provide communication circuits to support operations which are 
highly important to the national interest and

[[Page 465]]

where other means of telecommunication are unavailable.
    (2) Only in the following circumstances will authority be extended 
to stations in the land mobile service to operate below 25 MHz.
    (i) Provide communication circuits in emergency and/or disaster 
situations, where safety of life and property are concerned;
    (ii) Provide standby and/or backup communications circuits to 
regular domestic communication circuits which have been disrupted by 
disasters and/or emergencies;
    (iii) Provide communication circuits wholly within the State of 
Alaska and the United States insular areas in the Pacific; and
    (iv) Provide communication circuits to support operations which are 
highly important to the national interest and where other means of 
telecommunication are unavailable.
    (3) Except in the State of Alaska and the United States Pacific 
insular areas, the Commission does not intend to seek international 
protection for assignments made pursuant to paragraphs (h) (1)(ii) and 
(2) of this section; this results in the following constraints upon the 
circuits/assignments.
    (i) The Commission will not accept responsibility for protection of 
the circuits from harmful interference caused by foreign operations.
    (ii) In the event that a complaint of harmful interference resulting 
from operation of these circuits is received from a foreign source, the 
offending circuit(s) must cease operation on the particular frequency 
concerned.
    (iii) In order to accommodate the situations described in paragraphs 
(h)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, equipments shall be capable of 
transmitting and receiving on any frequency in the bands assigned to the 
particular operation and capable of immediate change among the 
frequencies.

Sec. 2.104  International Table of Frequency Allocations.

    (a) The International Table of Frequency Allocations is subdivided 
into the Region 1 Table (column 1 of Sec. 2.106), the Region 2 Table 
(column 2 of Sec. 2.106), and the Region 3 Table (column 3 of Sec. 
2.106). The International Table is included for informational purposes 
only.
    (b) Regions. For the allocation of frequencies the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) has divided the world into three Regions 
\1\ as shown in Figure 1 of this section and described as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ It should be noted that where the words ``regions'' or 
``regional'' are without a capital ``R,'' they do not relate to the 
three Regions here defined for purposes of frequency allocation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Region 1. Region 1 includes the area limited on the east by line 
A (lines A, B and C are defined below) and on the west by line B, 
excluding any of the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran which 
lies between these limits. It also includes the whole of the territory 
of Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Kazakhstan, 
Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey and 
Ukraine and the area to the north of the Russian Federation which lies 
between lines A and C.
    (2) Region 2. Region 2 includes the area limited on the east by line 
B and on the west by line C.
    (3) Region 3. Region 3 includes the area limited on the east by line 
C and on the west by line A, except any of the territory of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey and Ukraine and 
the area to the north of the Russian Federation. It also includes that 
part of the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran lying outside of 
those limits.
    (4) The lines A, B and C are defined as follows:
    (i) Line A. Line A extends from the North Pole along meridian 
40[deg] East of Greenwich to parallel 40[deg] North; thence by great 
circle arc to the intersection of meridian 60[deg] East and the Tropic 
of Cancer; thence along the meridian 60[deg] East to the South Pole.
    (ii) Line B. Line B extends from the North Pole along meridian 
10[deg] West of Greenwich to its intersection with parallel 72[deg] 
North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 
50[deg] West and parallel 40[deg] North; thence by great circle arc to 
the intersection of meridian 20[deg] West and parallel 10[deg] South; 
thence along meridian 20[deg] West to the South Pole.
    (iii) Line C. Line C extends from the North Pole by great circle arc 
to the intersection of parallel 65[deg]30[min] North with the 
international boundary in Bering Strait; thence by great circle arc to 
the intersection of meridian 165[deg] East of Greenwich and parallel 
50[deg] North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of 
meridian 170[deg] West and parallel 10[deg] North; thence along parallel 
10[deg] North to its intersection with meridian 120[deg] West; thence 
along meridian 120[deg] West to the South Pole.
    (c) Areas. To further assist in the international allocation of the 
radio spectrum, the ITU has established five special geographical areas 
and they are defined as follows:
    (1) The term ``African Broadcasting Area'' means:
    (i) African countries, parts of countries, territories and groups of 
territories situated between the parallels 40[deg] South and 30[deg] 
North;
    (ii) Islands in the Indian Ocean west of meridian 60[deg] East of 
Greenwich, situated between the parallel 40[deg] South and the great 
circle arc joining the points 45[deg] East, 11[deg]30[min] North and 
60[deg] East, 15[deg] North; and
    (iii) Islands in the Atlantic Ocean east of line B, situated between 
the parallels 40[deg] South and 30[deg] North.
    (2) The ``European Broadcasting Area'' is bounded on the west by the

[[Page 467]]

western boundary of Region 1, on the east by the meridian 40[deg] East 
of Greenwich and on the south by the parallel 30[deg] North so as to 
include the northern part of Saudi Arabia and that part of those 
countries bordering the Mediterranean within these limits. In addition, 
Iraq, Jordan and that part of the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, 
Turkey and Ukraine lying outside the above limits are included in the 
European Broadcasting Area.
    (3) The ``European Maritime Area'' is bounded to the north by a line 
extending along parallel 72[deg] North from its intersection with 
meridian 55[deg] East of Greenwich to its intersection with meridian 
5[deg] West, then along meridian 5[deg] West to its intersection with 
parallel 67[deg] North, thence along parallel 67[deg] North to its 
intersection with meridian 32[deg] West; to the west by a line extending 
along meridian 32[deg] West to its intersection with parallel 30[deg] 
North; to the south by a line extending along parallel 30[deg] North to 
its intersection with meridian 43[deg] East; to the east by a line 
extending along meridian 43[deg] East to its intersection with parallel 
60[deg] North, thence along parallel 60[deg] North to its intersection 
with meridian 55[deg] East and thence along meridian 55[deg] East to its 
intersection with parallel 72[deg] North.
    (4) The ``Tropical Zone'' (see Figure 1 of this section) is defined 
as:
    (i) The whole of that area in Region 2 between the Tropics of Cancer 
and Capricorn.
    (ii) The whole of that area in Regions 1 and 3 contained between the 
parallels 30[deg] North and 35[deg] South with the addition of:
    (A) The area contained between the meridians 40[deg] East and 
80[deg] East of Greenwich and the parallels 30[deg] North and 40[deg] 
North; and
    (B) That part of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya north of parallel 30[deg] 
North.
    (iii) In Region 2, the Tropical Zone may be extended to parallel 
33[deg] North, subject to special agreements between the countries 
concerned in that Region (see Article 6 of the ITU Radio Regulations).
    (5) A sub-Region is an area consisting of two or more countries in 
the same Region.
    (d) Categories of services and allocations. (1) Primary and 
secondary services. Where, in a box of the International Table in Sec. 
2.106, a band is indicated as allocated to more than one service, either 
on a worldwide or Regional basis, such services are listed in the 
following order:
    (i) Services the names of which are printed in ``capitals'' 
(example: FIXED); these are called ``primary'' services; and
    (ii) Services the names of which are printed in ``normal 
characters'' (example: Mobile); these are called ``secondary'' services 
(see paragraph (d)(3) of this section).
    (2) Additional remarks shall be printed in normal characters 
(example: MOBILE except aeronautical mobile).
    (3) Stations of a secondary service:
    (i) Shall not cause harmful interference to stations of primary 
services to which frequencies are already assigned or to which 
frequencies may be assigned at a later date;
    (ii) Cannot claim protection from harmful interference from stations 
of a primary service to which frequencies are already assigned or may be 
assigned at a later date; and
    (iii) Can claim protection, however, from harmful interference from 
stations of the same or other secondary service(s) to which frequencies 
may be assigned at a later date.
    (4) Where a band is indicated in a footnote of the International 
Table as allocated to a service ``on a secondary basis'' in an area 
smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, this is a secondary 
service (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section).
    (5) Where a band is indicated in a footnote of the International 
Table as allocated to a service ``on a primary basis'', in an area 
smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, this is a primary 
service only in that area or country.
    (e) Additional allocations. (1) Where a band is indicated in a 
footnote of the International Table as ``also allocated'' to a service 
in an area smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, this is an 
``additional'' allocation, i.e. an allocation which is added in this 
area or

[[Page 468]]

in this country to the service or services which are indicated in the 
International Table.
    (2) If the footnote does not include any restriction on the service 
or services concerned apart from the restriction to operate only in a 
particular area or country, stations of this service or these services 
shall have equality of right to operate with stations of the other 
primary service or services indicated in the International Table.
    (3) If restrictions are imposed on an additional allocation in 
addition to the restriction to operate only in a particular area or 
country, this is indicated in the footnote of the International Table.
    (f) Alternative allocations. (1) Where a band is indicated in a 
footnote of the International Table as ``allocated'' to one or more 
services in an area smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, 
this is an ``alternative'' allocation, i.e. an allocation which 
replaces, in this area or in this country, the allocation indicated in 
the Table.
    (2) If the footnote does not include any restriction on stations of 
the service or services concerned, apart from the restriction to operate 
only in a particular area or country, these stations of such a service 
or services shall have an equality of right to operate with stations of 
the primary service or services, indicated in the International Table, 
to which the band is allocated in other areas or countries.
    (3) If restrictions are imposed on stations of a service to which an 
alternative allocation is made, in addition to the restriction to 
operate only in a particular country or area, this is indicated in the 
footnote.
    (g) Miscellaneous provisions. (1) Where it is indicated in the 
International Table that a service or stations in a service may operate 
in a specific frequency band subject to not causing harmful interference 
to another service or to another station in the same service, this means 
also that the service which is subject to not causing harmful 
interference cannot claim protection from harmful interference caused by 
the other service or other station in the same service.
    (2) Where it is indicated in the International Table that a service 
or stations in a service may operate in a specific frequency band 
subject to not claiming protection from another service or from another 
station in the same service, this means also that the service which is 
subject to not claiming protection shall not cause harmful interference 
to the other service or other station in the same service.
    (3) Except if otherwise specified in a footnote, the term ``fixed 
service'', where appearing in the International Table, does not include 
systems using ionospheric scatter propagation.
    (h) Description of the International Table of Frequency Allocations. 
(1) The heading of the International Table includes three columns, each 
of which corresponds to one of the Regions (see paragraph (b) of this 
section). Where an allocation occupies the whole of the width of the 
Table or only one or two of the three columns, this is a worldwide 
allocation or a Regional allocation, respectively.
    (2) The frequency band referred to in each allocation is indicated 
in the left-hand top corner of the part of the Table concerned.
    (3) Within each of the categories specified in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, services are listed in alphabetical order according to the 
French language. The order of listing does not indicate relative 
priority within each category.
    (4) In the case where there is a parenthetical addition to an 
allocation in the International Table, that service allocation is 
restricted to the type of operation so indicated.
    (5) The footnote references which appear in the International Table 
below the allocated service or services apply to more than one of the 
allocated services, or to the whole of the allocation concerned.
    (6) The footnote references which appear to the right of the name of 
a service are applicable only to that particular service.
    (7) In certain cases, the names of countries appearing in the 
footnotes have been simplified in order to shorten the text.

<R05>
Sec. 2.105  United States Table of Frequency Allocations.

    (a) The United States Table of Frequency Allocations (United States 
Table) is subdivided into the Federal Table of Frequency Allocations 
(Federal Table, column 4 of Sec. 2.106) and the non-Federal Table of 
Frequency Allocations (non-Federal Table, column 5 of Sec. 2.106). The 
United States Table is based on the Region 2 Table because the relevant 
area of jurisdiction is located primarily in Region 2 \1\ (i.e., the 50 
States, the District of Columbia, the Caribbean insular areas, \2\ and 
some of the Pacific insular areas). \3\ The Federal Table is 
administered by NTIA \4\ and the non-Federal Table is administered by 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 2.104(b) for definitions of the ITU Regions.
    \2\ The operation of stations in the U.S. insular areas located in 
Region 2 is generally governed by the United States Table. The U.S. 
insular areas located in Region 2 are comprised of the Caribbean insular 
areas and two of the eleven Pacific insular areas. The Caribbean insular 
areas are Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Navassa 
Island. The Pacific insular areas located in Region 2 are Johnston Atoll 
and Midway Atoll.
    \3\ The operation of stations in the Pacific insular areas located 
in Region 3 is generally governed by the Region 3 Table (i.e., column 3 
of Sec. 2.106). The Pacific insular areas located in Region 3 are 
American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Baker Island, 
Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Kingman Reef, Palmyra Island, and Wake 
Island.
    \4\ Section 305(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. 
See Public Law 102-538, 106 Stat. 3533 (1992).
    \5\ The Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) In the United States, radio spectrum may be allocated to either 
Federal or non-Federal use exclusively, or for shared use. In the case 
of shared use, the type of service(s) permitted need not be the same 
[e.g., Federal FIXED, non-Federal MOBILE]. The terms used to designate 
categories of services and allocations \6\ in columns 4 and 5 of Sec. 
2.106 correspond to the terms in the ITU Radio Regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The radio services are defined in 47 CFR 2.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Category of services. (1) Any segment of the radio spectrum may 
be allocated to the Federal and/or non-Federal sectors either on an 
exclusive or shared basis for use by one or more radio services. In the 
case where an allocation has been made to more than one service, such 
services are listed in the following order:
    (i) Services, the names of which are printed in ``capitals'' 
[example: FIXED]; these are called ``primary'' services;
    (ii) Services, the names of which are printed in ``normal 
characters'' [example: Mobile]; these are called ``secondary'' services.
    (2) Stations of a secondary service:
    (i) Shall not cause harmful interference to stations of primary 
services to which frequencies are already assigned or to which 
frequencies may be assigned at a later date;
    (ii) Cannot claim protection from harmful interference from stations 
of a primary service to which frequencies are already assigned or may be 
assigned at a later date; and
    (iii) Can claim protection, however, from harmful interference from 
stations of the same or other secondary service(s) to which frequencies 
may be assigned at a later date.
    (d) Format of the United States Table. (1) The frequency band 
referred to in each allocation, column 4 for Federal operations and 
column 5 for non-Federal operations, is indicated in the left-hand top 
corner of the column. If there is no service or footnote indicated for a 
band of frequencies in column 4, then the Federal sector has no access 
to that band except as provided for by Sec. 2.103. If there is no 
service or footnote indicated for a band of frequencies in column 5, 
then the non-Federal sector has no access to that band except as 
provided for by Sec. 2.102.
    (2) When the Federal Table and the non-Federal Table are exactly the 
same for a shared band, the line between columns 4 and 5 is deleted and 
the allocations are shown once.
    (3) The Federal Table, given in column 4, is included for 
informational purposes only.
    (4) In the case where there is a parenthetical addition to an 
allocation in the United States Table [example: FIXED-SATELLITE (space-
to-earth)], that service allocation is restricted to the type of 
operation so indicated.

[[Page 471]]

    (5) The following symbols are used to designate footnotes in the 
United States Table:
    (i) Any footnote consisting of ``5.'' followed by one or more 
digits, e.g., 5.53, denotes an international footnote. Where an 
international footnote is applicable, without modification, to both 
Federal and non-Federal operations, the Commission places the footnote 
in both the Federal Table and the non-Federal Table (columns 4 and 5) 
and the international footnote is binding on both Federal users and non-
Federal licensees. If, however, an international footnote pertains to a 
service allocated only for Federal or non-Federal use, the international 
footnote will be placed only in the affected Table. For example, 
footnote 5.142 pertains only to the amateur service, and thus, footnote 
5.142 is shown only in the non-Federal Table.
    (ii) Any footnote consisting of the letters ``US'' followed by one 
or more digits, e.g., US7, denotes a stipulation affecting both Federal 
and non-Federal operations. United States footnotes appear in both the 
Federal Table and the non-Federal Table.
    (iii) Any footnote consisting of the letters ``NG'' followed by one 
or more digits, e.g., NG2, denotes a stipulation applicable only to non-
Federal operations. Non-Federal footnotes appear solely in the non-
Federal Table (column 5).
    (iv) Any footnote consisting of the letter ``G'' followed by one or 
more digits, e.g., G2, denotes a stipulation applicable only to Federal 
operations. Federal footnotes appear solely in the Federal Table (column 
4).
    (6) The coordinates of latitude and longitude that are listed in 
United States, Federal, and non-Federal footnotes are referenced to the 
North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
    (e) Rule Part Cross References. If a frequency or frequency band has 
been allocated to a radiocommunication service in the non-Federal Table, 
then a cross reference may be added for the pertinent FCC Rule part 
(column 6 of Sec. 2.106). For example, the band 849-851 MHz is 
allocated to the aeronautical mobile service for non-Federal use, rules 
for the use of the 849-851 MHz band have been added to Part 22--Public 
Mobile Services (47 CFR part 22), and a cross reference, Public Mobile 
(22), has been added in column 6 of Sec. 2.106. The exact use that can 
be made of any given frequency or frequency band (e.g., channelling 
plans, allowable emissions, etc.) is given in the FCC Rule part(s) so 
indicated. The FCC Rule parts in this column are not allocations and are 
provided for informational purposes only. This column also may contain 
explanatory notes for informational purposes only.
    (f) The FCC Online Table of Frequency Allocations is updated shortly 
after a final rule that amends Sec. 2.106 is released. The address for 
the FCC Radio Spectrum Home Page, which includes the FCC Online Table 
and the FCC Allocation History File, is http://www.fcc.gov/oet/spectrum.

                         International Footnotes

    5.53 Administrations authorizing the use of frequencies below 9 kHz 
shall ensure that no harmful interference is caused thereby to the 
services to which the bands above 9 kHz are allocated.
    5.54 Administrations conducting scientific research using 
frequencies below 9

[[Page 537]]

kHz are urged to advise other administrations that may be concerned in 
order that such research may be afforded all practicable protection from 
harmful interference.
    5.55 Additional allocation: in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, 
Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and 
Turkmenistan, the band 14-17 kHz is also allocated to the 
radionavigation service on a primary basis.
    5.56 The stations of services to which the bands 14-19.95 kHz and 
20.05-70 kHz and in Region 1 also the bands 72-84 kHz and 86-90 kHz are 
allocated may transmit standard frequency and time signals. Such 
stations shall be afforded protection from harmful interference. In 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, the Russian Federation, Georgia, 
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Slovakia, the Czech Rep., Tajikistan 
and Turkmenistan, the frequencies 25 kHz and 50 kHz will be used for 
this purpose under the same conditions.
    5.57 The use of the bands 14-19.95 kHz, 20.05-70 kHz and 70-90 kHz 
(72-84 kHz and 86-90 kHz in Region 1) by the maritime mobile service is 
limited to coast radiotelegraph stations (A1A and F1B only). 
Exceptionally, the use of class J2B or J7B emissions is authorized 
subject to the necessary bandwidth not exceeding that normally used for 
class A1A or F1B emissions in the band concerned.
    5.58 Additional allocation: In Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Russian 
Federation, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and

    5.59 Different category of service: in Bangladesh and Pakistan, the 
allocation of the bands 70-72 kHz and 84-86 kHz to the fixed and 
maritime mobile services is on a primary basis (see No. 5.33).
    5.60 In the bands 70-90 kHz (70-86 kHz in Region 1) and 110-130 kHz 
(112-130 kHz in Region 1), pulsed radionavigation systems may be used on 
condition that they do not cause harmful interference to other services 
to which these bands are allocated.
    5.61 In Region 2, the establishment and operation of stations in the 
maritime radionavigation service in the bands 70-90 kHz and 110-130 kHz 
shall be subject to agreement obtained under No. 9.21 with 
administrations whose services, operating in accordance with the Table, 
may be affected. However, stations of the fixed, maritime mobile and 
radiolocation services shall not cause harmful interference to stations 
in the maritime radionavigation service established under such 
agreements.
    5.62 Administrations which operate stations in the radionavigation 
service in the band 90-110 kHz are urged to coordinate technical and 
operating characteristics in such a way as to avoid harmful interference 
to the services provided by these stations.
    5.64 Only classes A1A or F1B, A2C, A3C, F1C or F3C emissions are 
authorized for stations of the fixed service in the bands allocated to 
this service between 90 kHz and 160 kHz (148.5 kHz in Region 1) and for 
stations of the maritime mobile service in the bands allocated to this 
service between 110 kHz and 160 kHz (148.5 kHz in Region 1). 
Exceptionally, class J2B or J7B emissions are also authorized in the 
bands between 110 kHz and 160 kHz (148.5 kHz in Region 1) for stations 
of the maritime mobile service.
    5.65 Different category of service: in Bangladesh, the allocation of 
the bands 112-117.6 kHz and 126-129 kHz to the fixed and maritime mobile 
services is on a primary basis (see No. 5.33).
    5.66 Different category of service: in Germany, the allocation of 
the band 115-117.6 kHz to the fixed and maritime mobile services is on a 
primary basis (see No. 5.33) and to the radionavigation service on a 
secondary basis (see No. 5.32).
    5.67 Additional allocation: in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Mongolia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Romania and Turkmenistan, the band 130-148.5 kHz is also 
allocated to the radionavigation service on a secondary basis. Within 
and between these countries this service shall have an equal right to 
operate.
    5.68 Alternative allocation: In Angola, Burundi, Congo (Rep. of 
the), Malawi, the Dem. Rep. of the Congo, Rwanda and South Africa, the 
band 160-200 kHz is allocated to the fixed service on a primary basis.
    5.69 Additional allocation: in Somalia, the band 200-255 kHz is also 
allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation service on a primary 
basis.
    5.70 Alternative allocation: In Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, 
the Central African Rep., Congo (Rep. of the), Ethiopia, Lesotho, 
Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Oman, the Dem. Rep. of 
the Congo, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Chad, Zambia and 
Zimbabwe, the band 200-283.5 kHz is allocated to the aeronautical 
radionavigation service on a primary basis.
    5.71 Alternative allocation: in Tunisia, the band 255-283.5 kHz is

Philippines, Kyrgyzstan, the Dem. People's Rep. of Korea, Sri Lanka, 
Thailand and Viet Nam, the allocation to the fixed service in the band 
31-31.3 GHz may also be used by systems using high altitude platform 
stations (HAPS) in the ground-to-HAPS direction. The use of the band 31-
31.3 GHz by systems using HAPS is limited to the territory of the 
countries listed above and shall not cause harmful interference to, nor 
claim protection from, other types of fixed-service systems, systems in 
the mobile service and systems operated under No. 5.545. Furthermore, 
the development of these services shall not be constrained by HAPS. 
Systems using HAPS in the band 31-31.3 GHz shall not cause harmful 
interference to the radio astronomy service having a primary allocation 
in the band 31.3-31.8 GHz, taking into account the protection criterion 
as given in Recommendation ITU-R RA.769. In order to ensure the 
protection of satellite passive services, the level of unwanted power 
density into a HAPS ground station antenna in the band 31.3-31.8 GHz 
shall be limited to -106 dB(W/MHz) under clear-sky conditions, and may 
be increased up to -100 dB(W/MHz) under rainy conditions to take account 
of rain attenuation, provided the effective impact on the passive 
satellite does not exceed the impact under clear-sky conditions as given 
above. See Resolution 145 (WRC-03).
    5.544 In the band 31-31.3 GHz the power flux-density limits 
specified in Article 21, Table 21-4 shall apply to the space research 
service.
    5.545 Different category of service: In Armenia, Azerbaijan,

applications in the fixed service (see Resolutions 75 (WRC-2000) and 79 
(WRC-2000)). Administrations should take this into account when 
considering regulatory provisions in relation to these bands. Because of 
the potential deployment of high-density applications in the fixed-
satellite service in the bands 39.5-40 GHz and 40.5-42 GHz (see No. 
5.516B), administrations should further take into account potential 
constraints to high-density applications in the fixed service, as 
appropriate.
    5.547A Administrations should take practical measures to minimize 
the potential interference between stations in the fixed service and 
airborne stations in the radionavigation service in the 31.8-33.4 GHz 
band, taking into account the operational needs of the airborne radar 
systems.
    5.547B Alternative allocation: in the United States, the band 31.8-
32 GHz is allocated to the radionavigation and space research (deep 
space) (space-to-Earth) services on a primary basis.

on a primary basis.
    5.547E Alternative allocation: in the United States, the band 33-
33.4 GHz is allocated to the radionavigation service on a primary basis.
    5.548 In designing systems for the inter-satellite service in the 
band 32.3-33 GHz, for the radionavigation service in the band 32-33 GHz, 
and for the space research service (deep space) in the band 31.8-32.3 
GHz, administrations shall take all necessary measures to prevent 
harmful interference between these services, bearing in mind the safety 
aspects of the radionavigation service (see Recommendation 707).

Radiocommunication Bureau before 4 January 2004; or
--Was notified before the date of receipt of the complete Appendix 4 
information for coordination or notification, as appropriate, for the 
space station to which the limits apply.

    Other radio astronomy stations notified after these dates may seek 
an agreement with administrations that have authorized the space

stations. In Region 2, Resolution 743 (WRC-03) shall apply. The limits 
in this footnote may be exceeded at the site of a radio astronomy 
station of any country whose administration so agreed.
    5.552 The allocation of the spectrum for the fixed-satellite service 
in the bands 42.5-43.5 GHz and 47.2-50.2 GHz for Earth-to-space 
transmission is greater than that in the band 37.5-39.5 GHz for space-
to-Earth transmission in order to accommodate feeder links to

provisions of the Commission's Rules and Regulations, Part 87, Aviation 
Services; (b) Use of the frequency is required for coordination of 
activities with Commission licensees operating on this frequency; and 
(c) Federal stations will not be authorized for operation at fixed 
locations.
    US81 The band 38-38.25 MHz is used by both Federal and non-Federal 
radio astronomy observatories. No new fixed or mobile assignments are to 
be made and Federal stations in the band 38-38.25 MHz will be moved to 
other bands on a case-by-case basis, as required, to protect radio 
astronomy observations from harmful interference. As an exception, 
however, low powered military transportable and mobile stations used for 
tactical and training purposes will continue to use the band. To the 
extent practicable, the latter operations will be adjusted to relieve 
such interference as may be caused to radio astronomy observations. In 
the event of harmful interference from such local operations, radio 
astronomy observatories may contact local military commands directly, 
with a view to effecting relief. A list of military commands, areas of 
coordination, and points of contact for purposes of relieving 
interference may be obtained upon request from the Office of Engineering 
and Technology, FCC, Washington, DC 20554.

case basis. Operators shall take all practical steps to keep the carrier 
frequency close to 450 MHz.
    US90 In the band 2025-2110 MHz, the power flux-density at the 
Earth's surface produced by emissions from a space station in the space 
operation, Earth exploration-satellite, or space research service that 
is transmitting in the space-to-space direction, for all conditions and 
all methods of modulation, shall not exceed the following values in any 
4 kHz sub-band:
    (a) -154 dBW/m\2\ for angles of arrival above the horizontal plane 
([delta]) of 0[deg] to 5[deg],
    (b) -154 + 0.5([delta] - 5) dBW/m\2\ for [delta] of 5[deg] to 
25[deg], and

    US93 In the conterminous United States, the frequency 108.0 MHz may 
be authorized for use by VOR test facilities, the operation of which is 
not essential for the safety of life or property, subject to the 
condition that no interference is caused to the reception of FM 
broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz. In the event 
that such interference does occur, the licensee or other agency 
authorized to operate the facility shall discontinue operation on 108 
MHz and shall not resume operation until the interference has been 
eliminated or the complaint otherwise satisfied. VOR test facilities 
operating on 108 MHz will not be protected against interference caused 
by FM broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz nor shall 
the authorization of a VOR test facility on 108 MHz preclude the 
Commission from authorizing additional FM broadcasting stations.
    US99 In the band 1668.4-1670 MHz, the meteorological aids service 
(radiosonde) will avoid operations to the maximum extent practicable. 
Whenever it is necessary to operate radiosondes in the band 1668.4-1670 
MHz within the United States, notification of the operations shall be 
sent as far in advance as possible to the Electromagnetic Management 
Unit, Room 1030, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Blvd., 
Arlington, VA 22230.

priority in the United States and its insular areas. Radiolocation land 
stations making use of LORAN type equipment may be authorized to both 
Federal and non-Federal licensees on a secondary basis for offshore 
radiolocation activities only at specific locations and subject to such 
technical and operational conditions (e.g., power, emission, pulse rate 
and phase code, hours of operation), including on-the-air testing, as 
may be required on a case-by-case basis to ensure protection of the 
LORAN radionavigation system from harmful interference and to ensure 
mutual compatibility among radiolocation operators. Such authorizations 
to stations in the radiolocation service are further subject to showing 
of need for service which is not currently provided and which the 
Federal Government is not yet prepared to render by way of the 
radionavigation service.
    US106 The frequency 156.75 MHz is available for assignment to 
Federal and non-Federal stations for environmental communications in 
accordance with an agreed plan.

    US300 The frequencies 169.445, 169.505, 170.245, 170.305, 171.045, 
171.105, 171.845 and 171.905 MHz are available for wireless microphone 
operations on a secondary basis to Federal and non-Federal operations.
    US301 Except as provided in NG30, broadcast auxiliary stations 
licensed as of November 21, 1984, to operate in the band 942-944 MHz may 
continue to operate on a co-equal primary basis to other stations and 
services operating in the band in accordance with the Table of Frequency 
Allocations.
    US303 In the band 2285-2290 MHz, non-Federal space stations in the 
space research, space operations and Earth exploration-satellite 
services may be authorized to transmit to the Tracking and Data Relay 
Satellite System subject to such conditions as may be applied on a case-
by-case basis. Such transmissions shall not cause harmful interference 
to authorized Federal stations. The power flux-density at the Earth's 
surface from such non-Federal stations shall not exceed-144 to -154 dBW/
m2/4 kHz, depending on angle of arrival, in accordance with ITU Radio 
Regulation 21.16.
    US307 The band 5150-5216 MHz is also allocated to the fixed-
satellite service (space-to-Earth) for feeder links in conjunction with 
the radiodetermination-satellite service operating in the bands 1610-
1626.5 MHz and 2483.5-2500 MHz. The total power flux-density at the 
Earth[min]s surface shall in no case exceed -159 dBW/m\2\ per 4 kHz for 
all angles of arrival.
    US308 In the bands 1549.5-1558.5 MHz and 1651-1660 MHz, those 
requirements of the aeronautical mobile-satellite (R) service that 
cannot be accommodated in the bands 1545-1549.5 MHz, 1558.5-1559 MHz, 
1646.5-1651 MHz, and 1660-1660.5 MHz shall have priority access with 
real-time preemptive capability for communications in the mobile-
satellite service. Systems not interoperable with the aeronautical 
mobile-satellite (R) service shall operate on a secondary basis. Account 
shall be taken of the priority of safety-related communications in the 
mobile-satellite service.
    US309 In the bands 1545-1559 MHz, transmissions from terrestrial 
aeronautical stations directly to aircraft stations, or between aircraft 
stations, in the aeronautical mobile (R) service are also authorized 
when such transmissions are used to extend or supplement the satellite-
to-aircraft links. In the band 1646.5-1660.5 MHz, transmissions from 
aircraft stations in the aeronautical mobile (R) service directly to 
terrestrial aeronautical stations, or between aircraft stations, are 
also authorized when such transmissions are used to extend or supplement 
the aircraft-to-satellite links.
    US310 In the band 14.896-15.121 GHz, non-Federal space stations in 
the space research service may be authorized on a secondary basis to 
transmit to Tracking and Data Relay Satellites subject to such 
conditions as may be applied on a case-by-case basis. Such transmissions 
shall not cause harmful interference to authorized Federal stations. The 
power flux-density (pfd) produced by such non-Federal stations at the 
Earth[min]s surface in any 1 MHz band for all conditions and methods of 
modulation shall not exceed:

-124 dB(W/m\2\ for 0[deg] < [thetas] <= 5[deg]
-124 + ([thetas] -5)/2 dB(W/m\2\) for 5[deg] < [thetas] <= 25[deg]
-114 dB(W/m\2\) for 25[deg] < [thetas] <= 90[deg]

where [thetas] is the angle of arrival of the radio-frequency wave 
(degrees above the horizontal). These limits relate to the pfd and 
angles of arrival which would be obtained under free-space propagation 
conditions.
    US311 Radio astronomy observations may be made in the bands 1350-
1400 MHz, 1718.8-1722.2 MHz, and 4950-4990 MHz on an unprotected basis

    In the bands 1350-1400 MHz and 4950-4990 MHz, every practicable 
effort will be made to avoid the assignment of frequencies to stations 
in the fixed and mobile services that could interfere with radio 
astronomy observations within the geographic areas given above. In 
addition, every practicable effort will be made to avoid assignment of 
frequencies in these bands to stations in the aeronautical mobile 
service which operate outside of those geographic areas, but which may 
cause harmful interference to the listed observatories. Should such 
assignments result in harmful interference to these observatories, the 
situation will be remedied to the extent practicable.
    US312 The frequency 173.075 MHz may also be authorized on a primary 
basis to non-Federal stations in the Public Safety Radio Pool, limited 
to police licensees, for stolen vehicle recovery systems (SVRS). As of 
May 27, 2005, new SVRS licenses shall be issued for an authorized 
bandwidth not to exceed 12.5 kHz. Stations that operate as part of a 
stolen vehicle recovery system that was authorized and in operation 
prior to May 27, 2005 may operate with an authorized bandwidth not to 
exceed 20 kHz until May 27, 2019. After that date, all SVRS shall 
operate with an authorized bandwidth not to exceed 12.5 kHz.
    US315 In the bands 1530-1544 MHz and 1626.5-1645.5 MHz, maritime 
mobile-satellite distress and safety communications, e.g., GMDSS, shall 
have priority access with real-time preemptive capability in the mobile-
satellite service. Communications of mobile-satellite system stations 
not participating in the GMDSS shall operate on a secondary basis to 
distress and safety communications of stations operating in the GMDSS. 
Account shall be taken of the priority of safety-related communications 
in the mobile-satellite service.
    US316 The band 2900-3000 MHz is also allocated to the meteorological 
aids service on a primary basis for Federal use. Operations in this 
service are limited to Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) systems 
where accommodation in the band 2700-2900 MHz is not technically 
practical and are subject to coordination with existing authorized 
stations.
    US319 In the bands 137-138 MHz, 148-149.9 MHz, 149.9-150.05 MHz, 
399.9-400.05 MHz, 400.15-401 MHz, 1610-1626.5 MHz, and 2483.5-2500 MHz, 
Federal stations in the mobile-satellite service shall be limited to 
earth stations operating with non-Federal space stations.
    US320 The use of the bands 137-138 MHz, 148-150.05 MHz, 399.9-400.05 
MHz, and 400.15-401 MHz by the mobile-satellite service is limited to 
non-voice, non-geostationary satellite systems and may include satellite 
links between land earth stations at fixed locations.
    US323 In the band 148-149.9 MHz, no individual mobile earth station 
shall transmit on the same frequency being actively used by fixed and 
mobile stations and shall transmit no more than 1% of the time during 
any 15 minute period; except, individual mobile earth stations in this 
band that do not avoid frequencies actively being used by the fixed and 
mobile services shall not exceed a power density of -16 dBW/4 kHz and 
shall transmit no more than 0.25% of the time during any 15

[[Page 589]]

minute period. Any single transmission from any individual mobile earth 
station operating in this band shall not exceed 450 ms in duration and 
consecutive transmissions from a single mobile earth station on the same 
frequency shall be separated by at least 15 seconds. Land earth stations 
in this band shall be subject to electromagnetic compatibility analysis 
and coordination with terrestrial fixed and mobile stations.
    US324 In the band 400.15-401 MHz, Federal and non-Federal satellite 
systems shall be subject to electromagnetic compatibility analysis and 
coordination.
    US325 In the band 148-149.9 MHz fixed and mobile stations shall not 
claim protection from land earth stations in the mobile-satellite 
service that have been previously coordinated; Federal fixed and mobile 
stations exceeding 27 dBW EIRP, or an emission bandwidth greater than 38 
kHz, will be coordinated with existing mobile-satellite service space 
stations.
    US327 The band 2310-2360 MHz is allocated to the broadcasting-
satellite service (sound) and complementary terrestrial broadcasting 
service on a primary basis. Such use is limited to digital audio 
broadcasting and is subject to the provisions of Resolution 528.
    US334 In the band 17.8-20.2 GHz, Federal space stations in both 
geostationary (GSO) and non-geostationary satellite orbits (NGSO) and 
associated earth stations in the fixed-satellite service (space-to-
Earth) may be authorized on a primary basis. For a Federal geostationary 
satellite network to operate on a primary basis, the space station shall 
be located outside the arc, measured from east to west, 70[deg] West 
longitude to 120[deg] West longitude. Coordination between Federal 
fixed-satellite systems and non-Federal space and terrestrial systems 
operating in accordance with the United States Table of Frequency 
Allocations is required.
    (a) In the sub-band 17.8-19.7 GHz, the power flux-density (pfd) at 
the surface of the Earth produced by emissions from a Federal GSO space 
station or from a Federal space station in a NGSO constellation of 50 or 
fewer satellites, for all conditions and for all methods of modulation, 
shall not exceed the following values in any 1 MHz band:
    (1) -115 dB(W/m\2\) for angles of arrival above the horizontal plane 
([delta]) between 0[deg] and 5[deg],
    (2) -115 + 0.5([delta]-5) dB(W/m\2\) for [delta] between 5[deg] and 
25[deg], and
    (3) -105 dB(W/m\2\) for [delta] between 25[deg] and 90[deg].
    (b) In the sub-band 17.8-19.3 GHz, the pfd at the surface of the 
Earth produced by emissions from a Federal space station in an NGSO 
constellation of 51 or more satellites, for all conditions and for all 
methods of modulation, shall not exceed the following values in any 1 
MHz band:
    (1) -115 - X dB(W/m\2\) for [delta] between 0[deg] and 5[deg],
    (2) -115 - X + ((10 + X)/20)([delta]-5) dB(W/m\2\) for [delta] 
between 5[deg] and 25[deg], and
    (3) -105 dB(W/m\2\) for [delta] between 25[deg] and 90[deg]; where X 
is defined as a function of the number of satellites, n, in an NGSO 
constellation as follows:

For n <= 288, X = (5/119) (n-50) dB; and
For n <ls-thn-eq> 288, X = (1/69) (n + 402) dB.

    US335 In the band 220-222 MHz, Federal and non-Federal use of the 
fixed and land mobile services is restricted as follows:
    (a) The sub-bands 220-220.55/221.0-221.55, 220.6-220.8/221.6-221.8, 
220.85-220.9/221.85-221.9 and 220.925-221/221.925-222 MHz (Channels 1-
110, 121-160, 171-180 and 186-200, respectively) are available for 
exclusive non-Federal use. These sub-bands are also available for 
temporary fixed geophysical telemetry operations on a secondary basis to 
the fixed and land mobile services.
    (b) The sub-bands 220.55-220.6/221.55-221.6 MHz (Channels 111-120) 
are available for exclusive Federal use.
    (c) The sub-bands 220.8-220.85/221.8-221.85 and 220.9-220.925/221.9-
221.925 MHz (Channels 161-170 and 181-185, respectively) are available 
for shared Federal and non-Federal use.
    US337 In the band 13.75-13.8 GHz, the FCC shall coordinate earth 
stations in the fixed-satellite service with NTIA on a case-by-case 
basis in order to minimize harmful interference to the Tracking and Data 
Relay Satellite System's forward space-to-space link (TDRSS forward 
link-to-LEO).
    US338 The following provisions shall apply in the band 2305-2320 
MHz:
    (a) In the sub-band 2305-2310 MHz, space-to-Earth operations are 
prohibited.
    (b) Within 145 km of Goldstone, CA (35[deg]25[min]33[sec] N., 
116[deg]53[min]23[sec] W.), Wireless Communications Service (WCS) 
licensees operating base stations in the band 2305-2320 MHz shall, prior 
to operation of those base stations, achieve a mutually satisfactory 
coordination agreement with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA).
    Note: NASA operates a deep space facility in Goldstone in the band 
2290-2300 MHz.
    US339 The bands 2310-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz are also available for 
aeronautical telemetering and associated telecommand operations for 
flight testing of manned or unmanned aircraft, missiles or major 
components thereof on a secondary basis to the Wireless Communications 
Service. The following two frequencies are shared on a co-equal basis by 
Federal and non-Federal stations for telemetering and associated 
telecommand operations of expendable and re-usable launch vehicles 
whether or not such operations involve flight testing: 2312.5 and 2352.5 
MHz. Other mobile telemetering uses may be provided on a non-
interference basis to the above uses. The broadcasting-satellite service 
(sound) during implementation

[[Page 590]]

should also take cognizance of the expendable and reusable launch 
vehicle frequencies 2312.5 and 2352.5 MHz, to minimize the impact on 
this mobile service use to the extent possible.
    US340 The band 2-30 MHz is available on a non-interference basis to 
Federal and non-Federal maritime and aeronautical stations for the 
purposes of measuring the quality of reception on radio channels. See 47 
CFR 87.149 for the list of protected frequencies and bands within this 
frequency range. Actual communications shall be limited to those 
frequencies specifically allocated to the maritime mobile and 
aeronautical mobile services.

are allocated (*indicates radio astronomy use for spectral line 
observations), all practicable steps shall be taken to protect the radio 
astronomy service from harmful interference. Emissions from spaceborne 
or airborne stations can be particularly serious sources of interference 
to the radio astronomy service (see ITU Radio Regulations at Nos. 4.5 
and 4.6 and Article 29).
    US343 Differential-Global-Positioning-System (DGPS) Stations, 
limited to ground-based transmitters, may be authorized on a primary 
basis in the bands 108-117.975 and 1559-1610 MHz for the specific 
purpose of transmitting DGPS information intended for aircraft 
navigation. Such use shall be in accordance with ITU Resolution 413 
(WRC-03).
    US344 In the band 5091-5250 MHz, the FCC shall coordinate earth 
stations in the fixed-satellite service (Earth-to-space) with NTIA (see 
Recommendation ITU-R S.1342). In order to better protect the operation 
of the international standard system (microwave landing system) in the 
band 5000-5091 MHz, non-Federal tracking and telecommand operations 
should be conducted in the band 5150-5250 MHz.
    US345 In the band 401-406 MHz, the mobile, except aeronautical 
mobile, service is allocated on a secondary basis and is limited to, 
with the exception of military tactical mobile stations, Medical Device 
Radiocommunication Service (MedRadio) operations. MedRadio stations are 
authorized by rule on the condition that harmful interference is not 
caused to stations in the meteorological aids, meteorological-satellite, 
and Earth exploration-satellite services, and that MedRadio stations 
accept interference from stations in the meteorological aids, 
meteorological-satellite, and Earth exploration-satellite services.
    US346 Except as provided for below and by US222, Federal use of the 
band 2025-2110 MHz by the space operation service (Earth-to-space), 
Earth exploration-satellite service (Earth-to-space), and space research 
service (Earth-to-space) shall not constrain the deployment of the 
Television Broadcast Auxiliary Service, the Cable Television Relay 
Service, or the Local Television Transmission Service. To facilitate 
compatible operations between non-Federal terrestrial receiving stations 
at fixed sites and Federal earth station transmitters, coordination is 
required. To facilitate compatible operations between non-Federal 
terrestrial transmitting stations and Federal spacecraft receivers, the 
terrestrial transmitters in the band 2025-2110 MHz shall not be high-
density systems (see Recommendations ITU-R SA.1154 and ITU-R F.1247). 
Military satellite control stations at the following sites shall operate 
on a co-equal, primary basis with non-Federal operations:

    US347 In the band 2025-2110 MHz, non-Federal Earth-to-space and 
space-to-space transmissions may be authorized in the space research and 
Earth exploration-satellite services subject to such conditions as may 
be applied on a case-by-case basis. Such transmissions shall not cause 
harmful interference to Federal and non-Federal stations operating in 
accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations.
    US348 The band 3650-3700 MHz is also allocated to the Federal 
radiolocation service on a primary basis at the following sites: St. 
Inigoes, MD (38[deg]10[min] N, 76[deg]23[min] W); Pascagoula, MS 
(30[deg]22[min] N, 88[deg]29[min] W); and Pensacola, FL 
(30[deg]21[min]28[sec] N, 87[deg]16[min]26[sec] W). The FCC shall 
coordinate all non-Federal operations within 80 km of these sites with 
NTIA on a case-by-case basis.
    US349 The band 3650-3700 MHz is also allocated to the Federal 
radiolocation service on a non-interference basis for use by ship 
stations located at least 44 nautical miles in off-shore ocean areas on 
the condition that harmful interference is not caused to non-Federal 
operations.
    US350 In the band 1427-1432 MHz, Federal use of the land mobile 
service and non-Federal use of the fixed and land mobile services is 
limited to telemetry and telecommand operations as described further:
    (a) Medical operations. The use of the band 1427-1432 MHz for 
medical telemetry and telecommand operations (medical operations) shall

    US356 In the band 13.75-14 GHz, an earth station in the fixed-
satellite service shall have a minimum antenna diameter of 4.5 m and the 
e.i.r.p. of any emission should be at least 68 dBW and should not exceed 
85 dBW. In addition the e.i.r.p., averaged over one second, radiated by 
a station in the radiolocation service shall not exceed 59 dBW. 
Receiving space stations in the fixed-satellite service shall not claim 
protection from radiolocation transmitting stations operating in 
accordance with the United States Table of Frequency Allocations. ITU 
Radio Regulation No. 5.43A does not apply.
    US357 In the band 13.75-14 GHz, geostationary space stations in the 
space research service for which information for advance publication has 
been received by the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau (Bureau) prior to 31 
January 1992 shall operate on an equal basis with stations in the fixed-
satellite service; after that date, new geostationary space stations in 
the space research service will operate on a secondary basis. Until 
those geostationary space stations in the space research service for 
which information for advance publication has been received by the 
Bureau prior to 31 January 1992 cease to operate in this band:
    a. The e.i.r.p. density of emissions from any earth station in the 
fixed-satellite service operating with a space station in geostationary-
satellite orbit shall not exceed 71 dBW in any 6 MHz band from 13.77 to 
13.78 GHz;
    b. The e.i.r.p. density of emissions from any earth station in the 
fixed-satellite service operating with a space station in non-

[[Page 593]]

geostationary-satellite orbit shall not exceed 51 dBW in any 6 MHz band 
from 13.77 to 13.78 GHz.
    Automatic power control may be used to increase the e.i.r.p. density 
in any 6 MHz band in these frequency ranges to compensate for rain 
attenuation, to the extent that the power flux-density at the fixed-
satellite service space station does not exceed the value resulting from 
use by an earth station of an e.i.r.p. of 71 dBW or 51 dBW, as 
appropriate, in any 6 MHz band in clear-sky conditions.
    US359 In the band 15.43-15.63 GHz, use of the fixed-satellite 
service (Earth-to-space) is limited to non-Federal feeder links of non-
geostationary systems in the mobile-satellite service. The FCC shall 
coordinate Earth stations in this band with NTIA (see Annex 3 of 
Recommendation ITU-R S.1340).
    US360 The band 33-36 GHz is also allocated to the fixed-satellite 
service (space-to-Earth) on a primary basis for Federal use. 
Coordination between Federal fixed-satellite service systems and non-
Federal systems operating in accordance with the United States Table of 
Frequency Allocations is required.
    US361 In the band 1432-1435 MHz, Federal stations in the fixed and 
mobile services may operate indefinitely on a primary basis at the 23 
sites listed below. All other Federal stations in the fixed and mobile 
services shall operate in the band 1432-1435 MHz on a primary basis 
until reaccommodated in accordance with the National Defense 
Authorization Act of 1999.

shipborne air defense radiolocation installations will be fully 
coordinated with the meteorological aids and aeronautical 
radionavigation services. The military air defense installations will be 
moved from the band 2700-2900 MHz at the earliest practicable date. 
Until such time as military air defense installations can be 
accommodated satisfactorily elsewhere in the spectrum, such operations 
will, insofar as practicable, be adjusted to meet the requirements of 
the aeronautical radionavigation service.
    G19 Use of the band 9000-9200 MHz by military fixed and shipborne 
air defense radiolocation installations will be fully coordinated with 
the aeronautical radionavigation service, recognizing fully the safety 
aspects of the latter. Military air defense installations will be

a primary basis to the mobile-satellite service, limited to military 
operations.
    G104 In the bands 7450-7550 and 8175-8215 MHz, it is agreed that 
although the military space radio communication systems, which include 
earth stations near the proposed meteorological-satellite installations 
will precede the meteorological-satellite installations, engineering 
adjustments to either the military or the meteorological-satellite 
systems or both will be made as mutually required to assure compatible 
operations of the systems concerned.
    G109 All assignments in the band 157.0375-157.1875 MHz are subject 
to adjustment to other frequencies in this band as long term U.S. 
maritime VHF planning develops, particularly that planning incident to 
support of the National VHF-FM Radiotelephone Safety and Distress System 
(See Doc. 15624/1-1.9.111/1.9.125).
    G110 Federal ground-based stations in the aeronautical

effective August 10, 1995, for mixed Federal and non-Federal use under 
Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.
    G127 Federal Travelers Information Stations (TIS) on 1610 kHz have 
coprimary status with AM Broadcast assignments. Federal TIS authorized 
as of August 4, 1994, preclude subsequent assignment for conflicting 
allotments.
    G128 Use of the band 56.9-57 GHz by inter-satellite systems is 
limited to transmissions between satellites in geostationary orbit, to 
transmissions between satellites in geostationary satellite orbit and 
those in high-Earth orbit, to transmissions from satellites in 
geostationary satellite orbit to those in low-Earth orbit, and to

those in low-Earth orbit. For links between satellites in the 
geostationary satellite orbit, the single entry power flux-density at 
all altitudes from 0 km to 1000 km above the Earth's surface, for all 
conditions and for all methods of modulation, shall not exceed -147 dB 
(W/m\2\/100 MHz) for all angles of arrival.
    G129 Federal wind profilers are authorized to operate on a primary 
basis in the radiolocation service in the frequency band 448-450 MHz

meteorological purposes operating in the band 5600-5650 MHz, shall not 
cause harmful interference to, nor claim protection from, Federal 
stations in the maritime radionavigation service.
    G132 Use of the radionavigation-satellite service in the band 1215-

radio astronomy stations desiring international recognition of their use 
of specific radio astronomy frequencies or bands of frequencies for 
reception, should file the

[[Page 604]]

following information with the Commission for inclusion in the Master 
International Frequency Register:
    (1) The center of the frequency band observed, in kilohertz up to 
28,000 kHz inclusive, in megahertz above 28,000 kHz to 10,500 MHz 
inclusive and in gigahertz above 10,500 MHz.
    (2) The date (actual or foreseen, as appropriate) when reception of 
the frequency band begins.
    (3) The name and location of the station, including geographical 
coordinates in degrees and minutes.
    (4) The width of the frequency band (in kHz) observed by the 
station.
    (5) The antenna type and dimensions, effective area and angular 
coverage in azimuth and elevation.
    (6) The regular hours of reception (in UTC) of the observed 
frequency.
    (7) The overall receiving system noise temperature (in kelvins) 
referred to the output of the receiving antenna.
    (8) The class of observations to be taken. Class A observations are 
those in which the sensitivity of the equipment is not a primary factor. 
Class B observations are those of such a nature that they can be made 
only with advanced low-noise receivers using the best techniques.
    (9) The name and mailing address of the operator.
    (b) The permanent discontinuance of observations, or any change to 
the information above, should also be filed with the Commission.
    (c) Observations being conducted on frequencies or frequency bands 
not allocated to the radio astronomy service should be reported as in 
paragraph (a) of this section for information purposes. Information in 
this category will not be submitted for entry in the Master 
International Frequency Register and protection from interference will

Sec. 2.108  Policy regarding the use of the fixed-satellite allocations in the 3.6-3.7, 4.5-4.8, and 5.85-5.925 GHz bands.

    The use of the fixed-satellite allocations in the United States in 
the above bands will be governed by footnote US245. Use of the fixed-
satellite service allocations in these bands is for the international 
fixed-satellite service, that is, for international inter-continental 
communications. Case-by-case electromagnetic compatibility analysis is 
required with all users of the bands. It is anticipated that one earth 
station on each coast can be successfully coordinated. Specific 
locations of these earth stations depend upon service requirements and 
case-by-case EMC analyses that demonstrate compatible operations.

symbol for that emission, as given above, shall be preceded by the 
necessary bandwidth of the emission as indicated in Sec. 2.202(b)(1).

[49 FR 48697, Dec. 14, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 2.202  Bandwidths.

    (a) Occupied bandwidth. The frequency bandwidth such that, below its 
lower and above its upper frequency limits, the mean powers radiated are 
each equal to 0.5 percent of the total mean power radiated by a given 
emission. In some cases, for example multichannel frequency-division 
systems, the percentage of 0.5 percent may lead to certain difficulties 
in the practical application of the definitions of occupied and 
necessary bandwidth; in such cases a different percentage may prove 
useful.
    (b) Necessary bandwidth. For a given class of emission, the minimum 
value of the occupied bandwidth sufficient to ensure the transmission of 
information at the rate and with the quality required for the system 
employed, under specified conditions. Emissions useful

[[Page 606]]

for the good functioning of the receiving equipment as, for example, the 
emission corresponding to the carrier of reduced carrier systems, shall 
be included in the necessary bandwidth.
    (1) The necessary bandwidth shall be expressed by three numerals and 
one letter. The letter occupies the position of the decimal point and 
represents the unit of bandwidth. The first character shall be neither 
zero nor K, M or G.
    (2) Necessary bandwidths:

between 0.001 and 999 Hz shall be expressed in Hz (letter H);
between 1.00 and 999 kHz shall be expressed in kHz (letter K);
between 1.00 and 999 MHz shall be expressed in MHz (letter M);
between 1.00 and 999 GHz shall be expressed in GHz (letter G).

    (3) Examples:

0.002 Hz--H002
0.1 Hz--H100
25.3 Hz--25H3
400 Hz--400H
2.4 kHz--2K40
6 kHz--6K00
12.5 kHz--12K5
180.4 kHz--180K
180.5 kHz--181K
180.7 kHz--181K
1.25 MHz--1M25
2 MHz--2M00
10 MHz--10M0
202 MHz--202M
5.65 GHz--5G65

    (c) The necessary bandwidth may be determined by one of the 
following methods:
    (1) Use of the formulas included in the table, in paragraph (g) of 
this section, which also gives examples of necessary bandwidths and 
designation of corresponding emissions;
    (2) For frequency modulated radio systems which have a substantially 
linear relationship between the value of input voltage to the modulator 
and the resulting frequency deviation of the carrier and which carry 
either single sideband suppressed carrier frequency division multiplex 
speech channels or television, computation in accordance with provisions 
of paragraph (f) of this section and formulas and methods indicated in 
the table, in paragraph (g) of this section;
    (3) Computation in accordance with Recommendations of the 
International Radio Consultative Committee (C.C.I.R.);
    (4) Measurement in cases not covered by paragraph (c) (1), (2), or 
(3) of this section.
    (d) The value so determined should be used when the full designation 
of an emission is required. However, the necessary bandwidth so 
determined is not the only characteristic of an emission to be 
considered in evaluating the interference that may be caused by that 
emission.
    (e) In the formulation of the table in paragraph (g) of this 
section, the following terms are employed:

B<INF>n</INF> = Necessary bandwidth in hertz
B = Modulation rate in bauds
N = Maximum possible number of black plus white elements to be 
transmitted per second, in facsimile
M = Maximum modulation frequency in hertz
C = Sub-carrier frequency in hertz
D = Peak frequency deviation, i.e., half the difference between the 
maximum and minimum values of the instantaneous frequency. The 
instantaneous frequency in hertz is the time rate of change in phase in 
radians divided by 2
t = Pulse duration in seconds at half-amplitude
t<INF>r</INF> = Pulse rise time in seconds between 10% and 90% of 
maximum amplitude
K = An overall numerical factor which varies according to the emission 
and which depends upon the allowable signal distortion.
N<INF>c</INF> = Number of baseband telephone channels in radio systems 
employing multichannel multiplexing
P = Continuity pilot sub-carrier frequency (Hz) (continuous signal 
utilized to verify performance of frequency-division multiplex systems).

    (f) Determination of values of D and B<INF>n</INF> for systems 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section:
    (1) Determination of D in systems for multichannel telephony:
    (i) The rms value of the per-channel deviation for the system shall 
be specified. (In the case of systems employing preemphasis or phase 
modulation, this value of per-channel deviation shall be specified at 
the characteristic baseband frequency.)
    (ii) The value of D is then calculated by multiplying the rms value 
of the per-channel deviation by the appropriate factors, as follows:

Where X represents the average power in a message circuit in dBmO; Nc is the number of circuits in the
  multiplexed message load; 3.76 corresponds to a peak load factor of 11.5 dB.

    (2) The necessary bandwidth (B<INF>n</INF>) normally is considered 
to be numerically equal to:
    (i) 2M+2DK, for systems having no continuity pilot subcarrier or 
having a continuity pilot subcarrier whose frequency is not the highest 
modulating the main carrier;
    (ii) 2P+2DK, for systems having a continuity pilot subcarrier whose 
frequency exceeds that of any other signal modulating the main carrier, 
unless the conditions set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section are 
met.
    (3) As an exception to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
necessary bandwidth (B<INF>n</INF>) for such systems is numerically 
equal to 2P or 2M+2DK, whichever is greater, provided the following 
conditions are met:
    (i) The modulation index of the main carrier due to the continuity 
pilot subcarrier does not exceed 0.25, and
    (ii) In a radio system of multichannel telephony, the rms frequency 
deviation of the main carrier due to the continuity pilot subcarrier 
does not exceed 70 percent of the rms value of the per-channel 
deviation, or, in a radio system for television, the rms deviation of 
the main carrier due to the pilot does not exceed 3.55 percent of the 
peak deviation of the main carrier.

       Subpart E_Distress, Disaster, and Emergency Communications


<R05>
Sec. 2.401  Distress messages.

    Each station licensee shall give absolute priority to 
radiocommunications or signals relating to ships or aircraft in 
distress; shall cease all sending on frequencies which will interfere 
with hearing a radiocommunication or signal of distress and except when 
engaged in answering or aiding the ship or aircraft in distress, shall 
refrain from sending any radiocommunications or signals until there is 
assurance that no interference will be caused with the 
radiocommunications or signals relating thereto; and shall assist the 
ship or aircraft in distress, so far as possible, by complying with its 
instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 2.402  Control of distress traffic.

    The control of distress traffic is the responsibility of the mobile 
station in distress or of the mobile station which, by the application 
of the provisions of Sec. 2.403, has sent the distress call. These 
stations may, however, delegate the control of the distress traffic to 
another station.


<R05>
Sec. 2.403  Retransmission of distress message.

    Any station which becomes aware that a mobile station is in distress 
may transmit the distress message in the following cases:
    (a) When the station in distress is not itself in a position to 
transmit the message.
    (b) In the case of mobile stations, when the master or the person in 
charge of the ship, aircraft, or other vehicles carrying the station 
which intervenes believes that further help is necessary.
    (c) In the case of other stations, when directed to do so by the 
station in control of distress traffic or when it has reason to believe 
that a distress call which it has intercepted has not been received by 
any station in a position to render aid.


<R05>
Sec. 2.404  Resumption of operation after distress.

    No station having been notified to cease operation shall resume 
operation on frequency or frequencies which may cause interference until 
notified by the station issuing the original notice that the station 
involved will not interfere with distress traffic as it is then being 
routed or until the receipt of a general notice that the need for 
handling distress traffic no longer exists.


<R05>
Sec. 2.405  Operation during emergency.

    The licensee of any station (except amateur, standard broadcast, FM 
broadcast, noncommercial educational FM broadcast, or television 
broadcast) may, during a period of emergency in which normal 
communication facilities are disrupted as a result of hurricane, flood, 
earthquake, or similar disaster, utilize such station for emergency 
communication service in communicating in a manner other than that 
specified in the instrument of authorization: Provided:
    (a) That as soon as possible after the beginning of such emergency 
use, notice be sent to the Commission at Washington, D.C., and to the 
Engineer in Charge of the district in which the station is located, 
stating the nature of the emergency and the use to which the station is 
being put, and
    (b) That the emergency use of the station shall be discontinued as 
soon as substantially normal communication facilities are again 
available, and
    (c) That the Commission at Washington, D.C., and the Engineer in 
Charge shall be notified immediately when such special use of the 
station is terminated: Provided further,
    (d) That in no event shall any station engage in emergency 
transmission on frequencies other than, or with power

[[Page 615]]

in excess of, that specified in the instrument of authorization or as 
otherwise expressly provided by the Commission, or by law: And provided 
further,
    (e) That any such emergency communication undertaken under this 
section shall terminate upon order of the Commission.

    Note: Part 73 of this chapter contains provisions governing 
emergency operation of standard, FM, noncommercial educational FM, and 
television broadcast stations. Part 97 of this chapter contains such 
provisions for amateur stations.

    Any common carrier subject to the Communications Act may render to 
any agency of the United States Government free service in connection 
with the preparation for the national defense. Every such carrier 
rendering any such free service shall make and file, in duplicate, with 
the Commission, on or before the 31st day of July and on or before the 
31st day of January in each year, reports covering the periods of 6 
months ending on the 30th day of June and the 31st day of December, 
respectively, next prior to said dates. These reports shall show the 
names of the agencies to which free service was rendered pursuant to 
this rule, the general character of the communications handled for each 
agency, and the charges in dollars which would have accrued to the 
carrier for such service rendered to each agency if charges for all such 
communications had been collected at the published tariff rates.


<R05>
Sec. 2.407  National defense; emergency authorization.

    The Federal Communications Commission may authorize the licensee of 
any radio station during a period of national emergency to operate its 
facilities upon such frequencies, with such power and points of 
communication, and in such a manner beyond that specified in the station 
license as may be requested by the Army, Navy, or Air Force.

controlling circuits. The FCC Identifier assigned to any transmitter 
section shall be preceded by the term TX FCC ID, the FCC Identifier 
assigned to any receiver section shall be preceded by the term RX FCC ID 
and the identifier assigned to any remaining section(s) shall be 
preceded by the term FCC ID.
    (2) Where telephone equipment subject to part 68 of this chapter, 
and a radiofrequency device subject to equipment authorization 
requirements are assembled in a common enclosure, the nameplate/label 
shall display the FCC Registration Number in the format specified in 
part 68 and the FCC Identifier in the format specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (3) Applications filed on or after May 1, 1981, and applications 
filed earlier requesting equipment authorization using the single system 
of identification pursuant to section (a)(1) will receive a review of 
the identification portion by the Commission's Laboratory

[[Page 623]]

with respect to nameplate/label design within 30 days after receipt at 
the Laboratory. Failure by the Laboratory to reject a nameplate design 
proposed in any particular application within this time period will 
constitute de-facto acceptance of the nameplate/label design for that 
particular equipment. Such de facto acceptance will be limited to the 
equipment covered by the particular application and will not be 
considered to establish a precedent for other applications. This review 
deadline applies only to the proposed nameplate/label design, not to the 
remainder of the application.
    (4) For a transceiver, the receiver portion of which is subject to 
verification pursuant to Sec. 15.101 of this chapter, the FCC 
Identifier required for the transmitter portion shall be preceded by the 
term FCC ID.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) In order to validate the grant of equipment authorization, the 
nameplate or label shall be permanently affixed to the equipment and 
shall be readily visible to the purchaser at the time of purchase.
    (1) As used here, permanently affixed means that the required 
nameplate data is etched, engraved, stamped, indelibly printed, or 
otherwise permanently marked on a permanently attached part of the 
equipment enclosure. Alternatively, the required information may be 
permanently marked on a nameplate of metal, plastic, or other material 
fastened to the equipment enclosure by welding, riveting, etc., or with 
a permanent adhesive. Such a nameplate must be able to last the expected 
lifetime of the equipment in the environment in which the equipment will 
be operated and must not be readily detachable.
    (2) As used here, readily visible means that the nameplate or 
nameplate data must be visible from the outside of the equipment 
enclosure. It is preferable that it be visible at all times during 
normal installation or use, but this is not a prerequisite for grant of 
equipment authorization.
    (e) A software defined radio may be equipped with a means such as a 
user display screen to display the FCC identification number normally 
contained in the nameplate or label. The information must be readily 
accessible, and the user manual must describe how to access the 
electronic display.
    (f) Where it is shown that a permanently affixed nameplate is not 
desirable or is not feasible, an alternative method of positively 
identifying the equipment may be used if approved by the Commission. The 
proposed alternative method of identification and the justification for 
its use must be included with the application for equipment 
authorization.

    Note: As an example, a device intended to be implanted within the 
body of a test animal or person would probably require an alternate 
method of identification.

    (g) The term FCC ID and the coded identification assigned by the 
Commission shall be in a size of type large enough to be readily 
legible, consistent with the dimensions of the equipment and its 
nameplate. However, the type size for the FCC Identifier is not required 
to be larger than eight-point.

Sec. 2.926  FCC identifier.

    (a) A grant of equipment authorization issued by the Commission will 
list the validated FCC Identifier consisting of the grantee code 
assigned by the FCC pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and the 
equipment product code assigned by the grantee pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section. See Sec. 2.925.
    (b) The grantee code assigned pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section is assigned permanently to applicants/grantees and is valid only 
for the party specified as the applicant/grantee in the code 
assignment(s).
    (c) A grantee code will have three characters consisting of Arabic 
numerals, capital letters, or combination thereof. A prospective grantee 
or his authorized representative may receive a grantee code 
electronically via the Internet at https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/
cf/eas/index.cfm. The code may be obtained at any time prior to 
submittal of the application for equipment authorization. However, the 
fee required

[[Page 624]]

by Sec. 1.1103 of this chapter must be submitted and validated within 
30 days of the issuance of the grantee code, or the code will be removed 
from the Commission's records and a new grantee code will have to be 
obtained.
    (1) After assignment of a grantee code each grantee will continue to 
use the same grantee code for subsequent equipment authorization 
applications.
    In the event the grantee name is changed or ownership is 
transferred, the circumstances shall be reported to the Commission so 
that a new grantee code can be assigned, if appropriate. See Sec. Sec. 
2.934 and 2.935 for additional information.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) The equipment product code assigned by the grantee shall consist 
of a series of Arabic numerals, capital letters or a combination 
thereof, and may include the dash or hyphen (-). The total of Arabic 
numerals, capital letters and dashes or hyphens shall not exceed 14 and 
shall be one which has not been previously used in conjunction with:
    (1) The same grantee code, or
    (2) An application denied pursuant to Sec. 2.919 of this chapter.
    (e) No FCC Identifier may be used on equipment to be marketed unless 
that specific identifier has been validated by a grant of equipment 
authorization issued by the Commission. This shall not prohibit 
placement of an FCC identifier on a transceiver which includes a 
verified receiver subject to Sec. 15.101, provided that the transmitter 
portion of such transceiver is covered by a valid grant of type 
acceptance or certification. The FCC Identifier is uniquely assigned to 
the grantee and may not be placed on the equipment without authorization 
by the grantee. See Sec. 2.803 for conditions applicable to the display 
at trade shows of equipment which has not been granted equipment 
authorization where such grant is required prior to marketing. Labelling 
of such equipment may include model or type numbers, but shall not 
include a purported FCC Identifier.

Sec. 2.951  Cross reference.

    The provisions of Sec. 2.901, et seq., shall apply to equipment 
subject to verification.


<R05>
Sec. 2.952  Limitation on verification.

    (a) Verification signifies that the manufacturer or importer has 
determined that the equipment has been shown to be capable of compliance 
with the applicable technical standards if no unauthorized change is 
made in the equipment and if the equipment is properly maintained and 
operated. Compliance with these standards shall not be construed to be a 
finding by the manufacturer or importer with respect to matters not 
encompassed by the Commission's rules.
    (b) Verification of the equipment by the manufacturer or importer is 
effective until a termination date is otherwise established by the 
Commission.
    (c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use 
or make reference to a verification in a deceptive or misleading manner 
or convey the impression that such verification reflects more than a 
determination by the manufacturer or importer that the device or product 
has been shown to be capable of compliance with the applicable technical 
standards of the Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 2.953  Responsibility for compliance.

    (a) In verifying compliance, the responsible party, as defined in 
Sec. 2.909 warrants that each unit of equipment marketed under the 
verification procedure will be identical to the unit tested and found 
acceptable with the standards and that the records maintained by the 
responsible party continue to reflect the equipment being produced under 
such verification within the variation that can be expected due to 
quantity production and testing on a statistical basis.
    (b) The importer of equipment subject to verification may upon 
receiving a written statement from the manufacturer that the equipment 
complies with the appropriate technical standards rely on the 
manufacturer or independent testing agency to verify compliance. The 
test records required by Sec. 2.955 however should be in the English 
language and made available to the Commission upon a reasonable request, 
in accordance with Sec. 2.956.
    (c) In the case of transfer of control of equipment, as in the case 
of sale or merger of the grantee, the new manufacturer or importer shall 
bear the responsibility of continued compliance of the equipment.
    (d) Verified equipment shall be reverified if any modification or 
change adversely affects the emanation characteristics of the modified 
equipment. The party designated in Sec. 2.909 bears responsibility for 
continued compliance of subsequently produced equipment.

Sec. 2.954  Identification.

    Devices subject only to verification shall be uniquely identified by 
the person responsible for marketing or importing the equipment within 
the United States. However, the identification shall not be of a format 
which could be confused with the FCC Identifier required on certified, 
notified or type accepted equipment. The importer or manufacturer shall 
maintain adequate identification records to facilitate positive 
identification for each verified device.

in those technical regulations, as well as compliance with applicable 
parts of the ISO/IEC Standard 17025 and Guide 65, shall be taken into 
consideration.
    (5) A TCB shall participate in any consultative activities, 
identified by the Commission or NIST, to facilitate a common 
understanding and interpretation of applicable regulations.
    (6) The Commission will provide public notice of the specific 
methods that will be used to accredit TCBs, consistent with these 
qualification criteria.
    (7) A TCB shall be reassessed for continued accreditation on 
intervals not exceeding two years.
    (d) Sub-contractors. (1) In accordance with the provisions of sub-
clause 4.4 of ISO/IEC Guide 65, the testing of a product, or a portion 
thereof, may be performed by a sub-contractor of a designated TCB, 
provided the laboratory has been assessed by the TCB as competent and in 
compliance with the applicable provisions of ISO/IEC Guide 65 and other 
relevant standards and guides.
    (2) When a subcontractor is used, the TCB shall be responsible for 
the test results and shall maintain appropriate oversight of the 
subcontractor to ensure reliability of the test results. Such oversight 
shall include periodic audits of products that have been tested.
    (e) Designation of a TCB. (1) The Commission will designate as a TCB 
any organization that meets the qualification criteria and is accredited 
by NIST or its recognized accreditor.
    (2) The Commission will withdraw the designation of a TCB if the 
TCB's accreditation by NIST or its recognized accreditor is withdrawn, 
if the Commission determines there is just cause for withdrawing the 
designation, or if the TCB requests that it no longer hold the 
designation. The Commission will provide a TCB with 30 days notice of 
its intention to withdraw the designation and provide the TCB with an 
opportunity to respond.
    (3) A list of designated TCBs will be published by the Commission.
    (f) Scope of responsibility. (1) A TCB shall certify equipment in 
accordance with the Commission's rules and policies.
    (2) A TCB shall accept test data from any source, subject to the

    (3) A TCB may establish and assess fees for processing certification 
applications and other tasks as required by the Commission.
    (4) A TCB may rescind a grant of certification within 30 days of 
grant for administrative errors. After that time, a grant can only be 
revoked by the Commission through the procedures in Sec. 2.939 of this 
part. A TCB shall notify both the applicant and the Commission when a 
grant is rescinded.
    (5) A TCB may not:
    (i) Grant a waiver of the rules, or certify equipment for which the 
Commission rules or requirements do not exist or for which the 
application of the rules or requirements is unclear.
    (ii) Take enforcement actions; or
    (iii) Authorize a transfer of control of a grantee.
    (6) All TCB actions are subject to Commission review.
    (g) Post-certification requirements. (1) A TCB shall supply an 
electronic copy of each approved application form and grant of 
certification to the Commission.
    (2) In accordance with ISO/IEC Guide 65, a TCB is required to 
conduct appropriate post-market surveillance activities. These 
activities shall be based on type testing a few samples of the total 
number of product types which the certification body has certified. 
Other types of surveillance activities of a product that has been 
certified are permitted, provided they are no more onerous than testing 
type. The Commission may at any time request a list of products 
certified by the certification body and may request and receive copies 
of product evaluation reports. The Commission may also request that a 
TCB perform post-market surveillance, under Commission guidelines, of a 
specific product it has certified.
    (3) If during post market surveillance of a certified product, a TCB 
determines that a product fails to comply

[[Page 635]]

with the applicable technical regulations, the Telecommunication 
Certification Body shall immediately notify the grantee and the

of the action taken by the grantee to correct the situation.
    (4) Where concerns arise, the TCB shall provide a copy of the 
application file to the Commission within 30 calendar days of a request 
for the file made by the Commission to the TCB and the manufacturer. 
Where appropriate, the file should be accompanied by a request for 
confidentiality for any material that may qualify for confidential 
treatment under the Commission's Rules. If the application file is not 
provided within 30 calendar days, a statement shall be provided to the 
Commission as to why it cannot be provided.
    (h) In case of a dispute with respect to designation or recognition 
of a TCB and the testing or certification of products by a TCB, the 
Commission will be the final arbiter. Manufacturers and designated TCBs 
will be afforded at least 30 days to comment before a decision is 
reached. In the case of a TCB designated or recognized, or a product 
certified pursuant to an effective bilateral or multilateral mutual 
recognition agreement or arrangement (MRA) to which the United States is 
a party, the Commission may limit or withdraw its recognition of a TCB 
designated by an MRA party and revoke the certification of products 
using testing or certification provided by such a TCB. The Commission 
shall consult with the Office of the United States Trade Representative 
(USTR), as necessary, concerning any disputes arising under an MRA for 
compliance with the Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988 (Section 1371-
1382 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988).

Sec. 2.1043  Changes in certificated equipment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, changes 
to the basic frequency determining and stabilizing circuitry (including 
clock or data rates), frequency multiplication stages, basic modulator 
circuit or maximum power or field strength ratings shall not be 
performed without application for and authorization of a new grant of 
certification. Variations in electrical or mechanical construction, 
other than these indicated items, are permitted provided the variations 
either do not affect the characteristics required to be reported to the 
Commission or the variations are made in compliance with the other 
provisions of this section. Changes to the software installed in a 
transmitter that do not affect the radio frequency emissions do not 
require a filing with the Commission and may be made by parties other 
than the holder of the grant of certification.

[[Page 638]]

    (b) Three classes of permissive changes may be made in certificated 
equipment without requiring a new application for and grant of 
certification. None of the classes of changes shall result in a change 
in identification.
    (1) A Class I permissive change includes those modifications in the 
equipment which do not degrade the characteristics reported by the 
manufacturer and accepted by the Commission when certification is 
granted. No filing with the Commission is required for a Class I 
permissive change.
    (2) A Class II permissive change includes those modifications which 
degrade the performance characteristics as reported to the Commission at 
the time of the initial certification. Such degraded performance must 
still meet the minimum requirements of the applicable rules. When a 
Class II permissive change is made by the grantee, the grantee shall 
supply the Commission with complete information and the results of tests 
of the characteristics affected by such change. The modified equipment 
shall not be marketed under the existing grant of certification prior to 
acknowledgement by the Commission that the change is acceptable.
    (3) A Class III permissive change includes modifications to the 
software of a software defined radio transmitter that change the 
frequency range, modulation type or maximum output power (either 
radiated or conducted) outside the parameters previously approved, or 
that change the circumstances under which the transmitter operates in 
accordance with Commission rules. When a Class III permissive change is 
made, the grantee shall supply the Commission with a description of the 
changes and test results showing that the equipment complies with the 
applicable rules with the new software loaded, including compliance with 
the applicable RF exposure requirements. The modified software shall not 
be loaded into the equipment, and the equipment shall not be marketed 
with the modified software under the existing grant of certification, 
prior to acknowledgement by the Commission that the change is 
acceptable. Class III changes are permitted only for equipment in which 
no Class II changes have been made from the originally approved device.

    Note to paragraph (b)(3): Any software change that degrades spurious 
and out-of-band emissions previously reported to the Commission at the 
time of initial certification would be considered a change in frequency 
or modulation and would require a Class III permissive change or new 
equipment authorization application.

    (4) Class I and Class II permissive changes may only be made by the 
holder of the grant of certification, except as specified below.
    (c) A grantee desiring to make a change other than a permissive 
change shall file an application on FCC Form 731 accompanied by the 
required fees. The grantee shall attach a description of the change(s) 
to be made and a statement indicating whether the change(s) will be made 
in all units (including previous production) or will be made only in 
those units produced after the change is authorized.
    (d) A modification which results in a change in the identification 
of a device with or without change in circuitry requires a new 
application for, and grant of certification. If the changes affect the 
characteristics required to be reported, a complete application shall be 
filed. If the characteristics required to be reported are not changed 
the abbreviated procedure of Sec. 2.933 may be used.
    (e) Equipment that has been certificated or formerly type accepted 
for use in the Amateur Radio Service pursuant to the requirements of 
part 97 of this chapter may be modified without regard to the conditions 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, provided the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) Any person performing such modifications on equipment used under 
part 97 of this chapter must possess a valid amateur radio operator 
license of the class required for the use of the equipment being 
modified.
    (2) Modifications made pursuant to this paragraph are limited to 
equipment used at licensed amateur radio stations.
    (3) Modifications specified or performed by equipment manufacturers 
or suppliers must be in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 639]]

    (4) Modifications specified or performed by licensees in the Amateur 
Radio Service on equipment other than that at specific licensed amateur 
radio stations must be in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (5) The station licensee shall be responsible for ensuring that 
modified equipment used at his station will comply with the applicable 
technical standards in part 97 of this chapter.
    (f) For equipment other than that operating under parts 15 or 18, 
when a Class II permissive change is made by other than the grantee of 
certification, the information and data specified in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section shall be supplied by the person making the change. The 
modified equipment shall not be operated under an authorization of the 
Commission prior to acknowledgement by the Commission that the change is 
acceptable.
    (g) The interconnection of a certificated or formerly type accepted 
AM broadcast stereophonic exciter-generator with a certificated or 
formerly type accepted AM broadcast transmitter in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions and upon completion of measurements showing 
that the modified transmitter meets the emission limitation requirements 
of Sec. 73.44 is defined as a Class I permissive change for compliance 
with this section.
    (h) The interconnection of a multiplexing exciter with a 
certificated or formerly type accepted AM broadcast transmitter in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions without electrical or 
mechanical modification of the transmitter circuits and completion of 
equipment performance measurements showing the transmitter meets the 
minimum performance requirements applicable thereto is defined as a 
Class I permissive change for compliance with this section.
    (i) The addition of TV broadcast subcarrier generators to a 
certificated or formerly type accepted TV broadcast transmitter or the 
addition of FM broadcast subcarrier generators to a type accepted FM 
broadcast transmitter, provided the transmitter exciter is designed for 
subcarrier operation without mechanical or electrical alterations to the 
exciter or other transmitter circuits.
    (j) The addition of TV broadcast stereophonic generators to a 
certificated or formerly type accepted TV broadcast transmitter or the 
addition of FM broadcast stereophonic generators to a certificated or 
formerly type accepted FM broadcast transmitter, provided the 
transmitter exciter is designed for stereophonic sound operation without 
mechanical or electrical alterations to the exciter or other transmitter 
circuits.
    (k) The addition of subscription TV encoding equipment for which the 
FCC has granted advance approval under the provisions of Sec. 2.1400 in 
subpart M and Sec. 73.644(c) of part 73 to a certificated or formerly 
type accepted transmitter is considered a Class I permissive change.
    (l) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, broadcast 
licensees or permittees are permitted to modify certificated or formerly 
type accepted equipment pursuant to Sec. 73.1690 of the FCC's rules.

ambient temperature as follows:
    (1) From -30[deg] to +50[deg] centigrade for all equipment except 
that specified in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) From -20[deg] to +50[deg] centigrade for equipment to be 
licensed for use in the Maritime Services under part 80 of this chapter, 
except for Class A, B, and S Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacons 
(EPIRBS), and equipment to be licensed for use above 952 MHz at 
operational fixed stations in all services, stations in the Local 
Television Transmission Service and Point-to-Point Microwave Radio 
Service under part 21 of this chapter, equipment licensed for use aboard 
aircraft in the Aviation Services under part 87 of this chapter, and 
equipment authorized for use in the Family Radio Service under part 95 
of this chapter.
    (3) From 0[deg] to +50[deg] centigrade for equipment to be licensed 
for use in the Radio Broadcast Services under part 73 of this chapter.
    (b) Frequency measurements shall be made at the extremes of the 
specified temperature range and at intervals of not more than 10[deg] 
centigrade through the range. A period of time sufficient to stabilize 
all of the components of the oscillator circuit at each temperature 
level shall be allowed prior to frequency measurement. The short term 
transient effects on the frequency of the transmitter due to keying 
(except for broadcast transmitters) and any heating element cycling 
normally occurring at each ambient temperature level also shall be 
shown. Only the portion or portions of the transmitter containing the 
frequency determining and stabilizing circuitry need be subjected to the 
temperature variation test.
    (c) In addition to all other requirements of this section, the 
following information is required for equipment incorporating heater 
type crystal oscillators to be used in mobile stations, for which type 
acceptance is first requested after March 25, 1974, except for battery 
powered, hand carried, portable equipment having less than 3 watts mean 
output power.
    (1) Measurement data showing variation in transmitter output 
frequency from a cold start and the elapsed time necessary for the 
frequency to stabilize within the applicable tolerance. Tests shall be 
made after temperature stabilization at each of the ambient temperature 
levels; the lower temperature limit, 0[deg] centigrade and +30[deg] 
centigrade with no primary power applied.
    (2) Beginning at each temperature level specified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the frequency shall be measured within one 
minute after application of primary power to the transmitter and at 
intervals of no more than one minute thereafter until ten minutes have 
elapsed or until sufficient measurements are obtained to indicate 
clearly that the frequency has stabilized within the applicable 
tolerance, whichever time period is greater. During each test, the 
ambient temperature shall not be allowed to rise more than 10[deg] 
centigrade above the respective beginning ambient temperature level.
    (3) The elapsed time necessary for the frequency to stabilize within 
the applicable tolerance from each beginning ambient temperature level 
as determined from the tests specified in this

[[Page 645]]

paragraph shall be specified in the instruction book for the transmitter 
furnished to the user.
    (4) When it is impracticable to subject the complete transmitter to 
this test because of its physical dimensions or power rating, only its 
frequency determining and stabilizing portions need be tested.
    (d) The frequency stability shall be measured with variation of 
primary supply voltage as follows:
    (1) Vary primary supply voltage from 85 to 115 percent of the 
nominal value for other than hand carried battery equipment.
    (2) For hand carried, battery powered equipment, reduce primary 
supply voltage to the battery operating end point which shall be 
specified by the manufacturer.
    (3) The supply voltage shall be measured at the input to the cable 
normally provided with the equipment, or at the power supply terminals 
if cables are not normally provided. Effects on frequency of transmitter 
keying (except for broadcast transmitters) and any heating element 
cycling at the nominal supply voltage and at each extreme also shall be 
shown.
    (e) When deemed necessary, the Commission may require tests of 
frequency stability under conditions in addition to those specifically 
set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. (For 
example measurements showing the effect of proximity to large metal 
objects, or of various types of antennas, may be required for portable 
equipment.)

Sec. 2.1057  Frequency spectrum to be investigated.

    (a) In all of the measurements set forth in Sec. Sec. 2.1051 and 
2.1053, the spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest radio 
frequency signal generated in the equipment, without going below 9 kHz, 
up to at least the frequency shown below:
    (1) If the equipment operates below 10 GHz: to the tenth harmonic of 
the highest fundamental frequency or to 40 GHz, whichever is lower.
    (2) If the equipment operates at or above 10 GHz and below 30 GHz: 
to the fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 100 
GHz, whichever is lower.
    (3) If the equipment operates at or above 30 GHz: to the fifth 
harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 200 GHz, whichever 
is lower.
    (b) Particular attention should be paid to harmonics and 
subharmonics of the carrier frequency as well as to those frequencies 
removed from the carrier by multiples of the oscillator frequency. 
Radiation at the frequencies of multiplier stages should also be 
checked.
    (c) The amplitude of spurious emissions which are attenuated more 
than 20 dB below the permissible value need not be reported.
    (d) Unless otherwise specified, measurements above 40 GHz shall be 
performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz.

subject to a Declaration of Conformity.

[61 FR 31046, June 19, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 2.1072  Limitation on Declaration of Conformity.

    (a) The Declaration of Conformity signifies that the responsible 
party, as defined in Sec. 2.909, has determined that the equipment has 
been shown to comply with the applicable technical standards if no 
unauthorized change is made in the equipment and if the equipment is 
properly maintained and operated. Compliance with these standards shall 
not be construed to be a finding by the responsible party with respect 
to matters not encompassed by the Commission's rules.
    (b) A Declaration of Conformity by the responsible party is 
effective until a termination date is otherwise established by the 
Commission.
    (c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use 
or make reference to a Declaration of Conformity in a deceptive or 
misleading manner or convey the impression that such a Declaration of 
Conformity reflects more than a determination by the responsible party 
that the device or product has been shown to be capable of complying 
with the applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.

<R05>
Sec. 2.1073  Responsibilities.

    (a) The responsible party, as defined in Sec. 2.909, must warrant 
that each unit of equipment marketed under a Declaration of Conformity 
is identical to the unit tested and found acceptable with the standards 
and that the records maintained by the responsible party continue to 
reflect the equipment being produced under the Declaration of Conformity 
within the variation that can be expected due to quantity production and 
testing on a statistical basis.
    (b) The responsible party, if different from the manufacturer, may 
upon receiving a written statement from the manufacturer that the 
equipment complies with the appropriate technical standards rely on the 
manufacturer or independent testing agency to determine compliance. 
However, the test records required by Sec. 2.1075 shall be in the 
English language and shall be made available to the Commission upon a 
reasonable request in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2.1076.
    (c) In the case of transfer of control of the equipment, as in the 
case of sale or merger of the responsible party, the new responsible 
party shall bear the responsibility of continued compliance of the 
equipment.
    (d) Equipment shall be retested to demonstrate continued compliance 
with the applicable technical standards if any modifications or changes 
that could adversely affect the emanation characteristics of the 
equipment are made by the responsible party. The responsible party bears 
responsibility for the continued compliance of subsequently produced 
equipment.
    (e) If any modifications or changes are made by anyone other than 
the responsible party for the Declaration of Conformity, the party 
making the modifications or changes, if located within the U.S., becomes 
the new responsible party. The new responsible party must comply with 
all provisions for the Declaration of Conformity, including having test 
data on file demonstrating that the product continues to comply with all 
of the applicable technical standards.

                    Radiofrequency Radiation Exposure


<R05>
Sec. 2.1091  Radiofrequency radiation exposure evaluation: mobile devices.

    (a) Requirements of this section are a consequence of Commission 
responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate 
the environmental significance of its actions. See subpart I of part 1 
of this chapter, in particular Sec. 1.1307(b).
    (b) For purposes of this section, a mobile device is defined as a 
transmitting device designed to be used in other than fixed locations 
and to generally

[[Page 649]]

be used in such a way that a separation distance of at least 20 
centimeters is normally maintained between the transmitter's radiating 
structure(s) and the body of the user or nearby persons. In this 
context, the term ``fixed location'' means that the device is physically 
secured at one location and is not able to be easily moved to another 
location. Transmitting devices designed to be used by consumers or 
workers that can be easily re-located, such as wireless devices 
associated with a personal computer, are considered to be mobile devices 
if they meet the 20 centimeter separation requirement.
    (c) Mobile devices that operate in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service, the Personal Communications Services, the Satellite 
Communications Services, the General Wireless Communications Service, 
the Wireless Communications Service, the Maritime Services and the 
Specialized Mobile Radio Service authorized under subpart H of part 22 
of this chapter, parts 24, 25, 26 and 27 of this chapter, part 80 of 
this chapter (ship earth stations devices only) and part 90 of this 
chapter are subject to routine environmental evaluation for RF exposure 
prior to equipment authorization or use if they operate at frequencies 
of 1.5 GHz or below and their effective radiated power (ERP) is 1.5 
watts or more, or if they operate at frequencies above 1.5 GHz and their 
ERP is 3 watts or more. Unlicensed personal communications service 
devices, unlicensed millimeter wave devices and unlicensed NII devices 
authorized under Sec. Sec. 15.253, 15.255, and 15.257, and subparts D 
and E of part 15 of this chapter are also subject to routine 
environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment 
authorization or use if their ERP is 3 watts or more or if they meet the 
definition of a portable device as specified in Sec. 2.1093(b) 
requiring evaluation under the provisions of that section. All other 
mobile and unlicensed transmitting devices are categorically excluded 
from routine environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment 
authorization or use, except as specified in Sec. Sec. 1.1307(c) and 
1.1307(d) of this chapter. Applications for equipment authorization of 
mobile and unlicensed transmitting devices subject to routine 
environmental evaluation must contain a statement confirming compliance 
with the limits specified in paragraph (d) of this section as part of 
their application. Technical information showing the basis for this 
statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (d) The limits to be used for evaluation are specified in Sec. 
1.1310 of this chapter. All unlicensed personal communications service 
(PCS) devices and unlicensed NII devices shall be subject to the limits 
for general population/uncontrolled exposure.
    (1) For purposes of analyzing mobile transmitting devices under the 
occupational/controlled criteria specified in Sec. 1.1310 of this 
chapter, time-averaging provisions of the guidelines may be used in 
conjunction with typical maximum duty factors to determine maximum 
likely exposure levels.
    (2) Time-averaging provisions may not be used in determining typical 
exposure levels for devices intended for use by consumers in general 
population/uncontrolled environments as defined in Sec. 1.1310 of this 
chapter. However, ``source-based'' time-averaging based on an inherent 
property or duty-cycle of a device is allowed. An example of this is the 
determination of exposure from a device that uses digital technology 
such as a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) scheme for transmission 
of a signal. In general, maximum average power levels must be used to 
determine compliance.
    (3) If appropriate, compliance with exposure guidelines for devices 
in this section can be accomplished by the use of warning labels and by 
providing users with information concerning minimum separation distances 
from transmitting structures and proper installation of antennas.
    (4) In some cases, e.g., modular or desktop transmitters, the 
potential conditions of use of a device may not allow easy 
classification of that device as either mobile or portable (also see 
Sec. 2.1093). In such cases, applicants are responsible for determining 
minimum distances for compliance for the intended use and installation 
of the device based on evaluation of either specific absorption rate 
(SAR), field

[[Page 650]]

strength or power density, whichever is most appropriate.

Sec. 2.1093  Radiofrequency radiation exposure evaluation: portable devices.

    (a) Requirements of this section are a consequence of Commission 
responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate 
the environmental significance of its actions. See subpart I of part 1 
of this chapter, in particular Sec. 1.1307(b).
    (b) For purposes of this section, a portable device is defined as a 
transmitting device designed to be used so that the radiating 
structure(s) of the device is/are within 20 centimeters of the body of 
the user.
    (c) Portable devices that operate in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service, the Personal Communications Service (PCS), the Satellite 
Communications Services, the General Wireless Communications Service, 
the Wireless Communications Service, the Maritime Services, the 
Specialized Mobile Radio Service, the 4.9 GHz Band Service, the Wireless 
Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) and the Medical Device 
Radiocommunication Service (MedRadio), authorized under subpart H of 
part 22 of this chapter, parts 24, 25, 26, 27, 80 and 90 of this 
chapter, subparts H and I of part 95 of this chapter, and unlicensed 
personal communication service, unlicensed NII devices and millimeter 
wave devices authorized under subparts D and E, 15.253, 15.255 and 
15.257 of this chapter are subject to routine environmental evaluation 
for RF exposure prior to equipment authorization or use. All other 
portable transmitting devices are categorically excluded from routine 
environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment 
authorization or use, except as specified in 1.1307(c) and 1.1307(d) of 
this chapter. Applications for equipment authorization of portable 
transmitting devices subject to routine environmental evaluation must 
contain a statement confirming compliance with the limits specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section as part of their application. Technical 
information showing the basis for this statement must be submitted to 
the Commission upon request.
    (d) The limits to be used for evaluation are based generally on 
criteria published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
for localized specific absorption rate (``SAR'') in Section 4.2 of 
``IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to 
Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz,'' ANSI/IEEE 
C95.1-1992, Copyright 1992 by the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers, Inc., New York, New York 10017. These criteria 
for SAR evaluation are similar to those recommended by the National 
Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in ``Biological 
Effects and Exposure Criteria for Radiofrequency Electromagnetic 
Fields,'' NCRP Report No. 86, Section 17.4.5. Copyright NCRP, 1986, 
Bethesda, Maryland 20814. SAR is a measure of the rate of energy 
absorption due to exposure to an RF transmitting source. SAR values have 
been related to threshold levels for potential biological hazards. The 
criteria to be used are specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section and shall apply for portable devices transmitting in the 
frequency range from 100 kHz to 6 GHz. Portable devices that transmit at 
frequencies above 6 GHz are to be evaluated in terms of the MPE limits 
specified in Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter. Measurements and calculations 
to demonstrate compliance with MPE field strength or power density 
limits for devices operating above 6 GHz should be made at a minimum 
distance of 5 cm from the radiating source.
    (1) Limits for Occupational/Controlled exposure: 0.4 W/kg as 
averaged over the whole-body and spatial peak SAR not exceeding 8 W/kg 
as averaged over any 1 gram of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in the 
shape of a cube). Exceptions are the hands, wrists, feet and ankles 
where the spatial peak SAR shall not exceed 20 W/kg, as averaged over an 
10 grams of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in the shape of a cube). 
Occupational/Controlled limits apply when persons are exposed as a 
consequence of their employment provided

[[Page 651]]

these persons are fully aware of and exercise control over their 
exposure. Awareness of exposure can be accomplished by use of warning 
labels or by specific training or education through appropriate means, 
such as an RF safety program in a work environment.
    (2) Limits for General Population/Uncontrolled exposure: 0.08 W/kg 
as averaged over the whole-body and spatial peak SAR not exceeding 1.6 
W/kg as averaged over any 1 gram of tissue (defined as a tissue volume 
in the shape of a cube). Exceptions are the hands, wrists, feet and 
ankles where the spatial peak SAR shall not exceed 4 W/kg, as averaged 
over any 10 grams of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in the shape of 
a cube). General Population/Uncontrolled limits apply when the general 
public may be exposed, or when persons that are exposed as a consequence 
of their employment may not be fully aware of the potential for exposure 
or do not exercise control over their exposure. Warning labels placed on 
consumer devices such as cellular telephones will not be sufficient 
reason to allow these devices to be evaluated subject to limits for 
occupational/controlled exposure in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) Compliance with SAR limits can be demonstrated by either 
laboratory measurement techniques or by computational modeling. 
Methodologies and references for SAR evaluation are described in 
numerous technical publications including ``IEEE Recommended Practice 
for the Measurement of Potentially Hazardous Electromagnetic Fields--RF 
and Microwave,'' IEEE C95.3-1991.
    (4) For purposes of analyzing portable transmitting devices under 
the occupational/controlled criteria, the time-averaging provisions of 
the MPE guidelines identified in Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter can be 
used in conjunction with typical maximum duty factors to determine 
maximum likely exposure levels.
    (5) Time-averaging provisions of the MPE guidelines identified in 
Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter may not be used in determining typical 
exposure levels for portable devices intended for use by consumers, such 
as hand-held cellular telephones, that are considered to operate in 
general population/uncontrolled environments as defined above. However, 
``source-based'' time-averaging based on an inherent property or duty-
cycle of a device is allowed. An example of this would be the 
determination of exposure from a device that uses digital technology 
such as a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) scheme for transmission 
of a signal. In general, maximum average power levels must be used to 
determine compliance.

Subpart K_Importation of Devices Capable of Causing Harmful Interference


<R05>
Sec. 2.1201  Purpose.

    (a) In order to carry out its responsibilities under the 
Communications Act and the various treaties and international 
regulations, and in order to promote efficient use of the radio 
spectrum, the Commission has developed technical standards for radio 
frequency equipment. The technical standards applicable to individual 
types of equipment are found in that part of the rules governing the 
service wherein the equipment is to be operated. In addition to the 
technical standards, the rules governing the service may require that 
such equipment receive an equipment authorization from the Commission as 
a prerequisite for marketing and importing this equipment into the 
U.S.A. The marketing rules, Sec. 2.801 et seq., were adopted pursuant 
to the authority in section 302 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended (47 U.S.C. 302).
    (b) The rules in this section set out the conditions under which 
radio frequency devices as defined in Sec. 2.801 that are capable of 
causing harmful interference to radio communications may be imported 
into the U.S.A.
    (c) Nothing in this section prevents importers from shipping goods 
into foreign trade zones or Customs bonded warehouses, such as is the 
prescribed procedure under Sec. 2.1204(a)(5). Radio frequency devices 
capable of causing

[[Page 652]]

harmful interference, however, cannot be withdrawn from these areas 
except in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Sec. 2.1202  Exclusions.

    The provisions of this section do not apply to the importation of:
    (a) Cameras, musical greeting cards, quartz watches and clocks, 
modules of quartz watches and clocks, hand-held calculators and 
electronic games, and other similar unintentional radiators which 
utilize low level battery power and which do not contain provisions for 
operation while connected to AC power lines.
    (b) Unintentional radiators which are exempted from technical 
standards and other requirements as specified in Sec. 15.103 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Radio frequency devices manufactured and assembled in the U.S.A. 
that meet applicable FCC technical standards and which have not been 
modified or received further assembly.
    (d) Radio frequency devices previously properly imported that have 
been exported for repair and re-imported for use.
    (e) Subassemblies, parts, or components of radio frequency devices 
unless they constitute an essentially completed device which requires 
only the addition of cabinets, knobs, speakers, or similar minor 
attachments before marketing or use. Form 740 information will be 
required to be submitted for computer circuit boards that are actually 
peripheral devices as defined in Sec. 15.3(r) of this chapter and all 
devices that, by themselves, are subject to FCC marketing rules.

Subpart N_FCC Procedure for Testing Class A, B and S Emergency Position 
                    Indicating Radiobeacons (EPIRBs)

    Source: 56 FR 11683, Mar. 20, 1991, unless otherwise noted.

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 2.1501  Introduction.

    The procedure described herein sets forth uniform methods for 
testing Class A, B and S Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacons 
(EPIRBs) for compliance with the applicable portions of the FCC Rules 
and Regulations. Other methods and test results may be used provided 
they are fully documented and deemed by the Commission to yield results 
equivalent to the procedures set forth in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1503  Test environment.

    (a) Measurement sites. Radiated emission tests for peak effective 
radiated power (PERP), spurious emissions and power in the test mode are 
to be performed on an open field test site as shown in Figure 1. The 
site is to be located on level ground with an obstruction-free, 60 m by 
52 m, elliptical area. The site is to be equipped with an antenna mast 
capable of adjustment from 1 to 4 m. The center of a metal ground plane 
at least one wavelength in diameter at 121.5 MHz (2.47 m) is to be 
located 30 m from the receiving antenna. The ground plane is to have 
provisions for mounting removable quarter-wave verticle elements to 
produce a monopole antenna at both 121.5 and 243 MHz with the VSWR of 
less than 1.5.

    Note: It is desirable that the level of radiated ambient EME at the 
test site be at least 6 dB below the FCC limits applicable to the EPIRB. 
It is, of course, not always possible to meet this condition. If the 
ambient field strength at some frequencies within the specified 
measurement ranges is too high, it is recommended that one or more of 
the following corrective steps be employed:
    (1) Perform measurements in critical frequency bands during hours 
when broadcast and other radio stations are off-the-air and ambients 
from industrial equipment are lower.
    (2) Insofar as is possible, orient the axis of an open area test 
site to discriminate against strong ambient signals.
    (3) Vary the bandwidth of the measuring instrument to separate 
ambient EME from emissions from the EPIRB.

    (b) Temperature. Except as otherwise noted, the ambient temperature 
during testing is to be within the range of 4 to 35 [deg]C (40 to 95 
[deg]F).


<R05>
Sec. 2.1505  Test instrumentation and equipment.

    (a) Receiver (field intensity meter). A calibrated field intensity 
meter (FIM) with a frequency range of 30 to 1000 MHz is required for 
measuring radiated

[[Page 656]]

emission levels. This instrument should be capable of making peak 
measurements with a bandwidth of 100 kHz.
    (b) Spectrum analyzer. Spectral measurements are to be made with a 
spectrum analyzer with a minimum resolution bandwidth no greater than 10 
Hz. The video filter, if used, should have a bandwidth wide enough so as 
to not affect peak readings. A linear video output is desirable for 
performing measurements of modulation characteristics.
    (c) Storage oscilloscope. Measurements of modulation characteristics 
are to be made using a calibrated storage oscilloscope. This instrument 
is to be DC coupled and capable of manually triggered single sweeps.
    (d) Frequency counter. A frequency counter with an accuracy of at 
least 5 parts per million is required for measuring the carrier 
frequency.
    (e) Signal generator. A calibrated signal generator with an output 
of at least 75 mW at 121.5 and 243 MHz is required for generating a 
reference signal for site calibration.
    (f) Antenna. Radiated emissions are to be measured with calibrated, 
tuned, half-wave dipole antennas covering the frequency range of 30 to 
1000 MHz.
    (g) Temperature chamber. Tests which call for subjecting the EPIRB 
to temperature levels other than the ambient temperature are to be 
performed in a temperature test chamber which can be adjusted to stable 
temperatures from -20 to +55 [deg]C. This chamber is to be of sufficient 
size to accommodate the EPIRB under test.
    (h) Vibration table. A vibration table capable of vibrating the 
EPIRB with a sinusoidal motion is required. The table must be capable of 
varying the frequency of vibration either linearly or logarithmically 
over a range of 4 to 33 Hz with maximum peak amplitudes of up to 2.5 mm.
    (i) Salt fog chamber. A chamber capable of producing salt fog at a 
temperature of 35 [deg]C for 48 hours is required. This chamber is to be 
of sufficient size to accommodate the EPIRB under test.
    (j) Drop test facility. A facility which will permit dropping an 
EPIRB from a height of 20 m into water is required. The water must be 
deep enough so that the EPIRB will not touch bottom when dropped.

              Environmental and Operational Test Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 2.1507  Test frequencies.

    Testing of an EPIRB for compliance outside a shielded room on a 
distress frequency is prohibited, since this may interfere with 
emergency communications. Therefore, all compliance testing outside a 
shielded room should be conducted on one of the pairs of alternate 
frequencies specified below:

121.600/243.200 MHz
121.650/243.300 MHz
121.700/243.400 MHz
121.750/243.500 MHz
121.800/243.600 MHz
121.850/243.700 MHz
121.900/243.800 MHz


The above frequencies are to be used for limited testing of EPIRBs for 
compliance with FCC Rules, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The testing shall not cause harmful interference to authorized 
communications on these frequencies.
    (b) The testing shall be coordinated with the nearest FCC district 
office.

For simplicity, 121.5 MHz and 243 MHz will be used throughout this test 
procedure to indicate the alternate test frequency.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1509  Environmental and duration tests.

    The environmental and operational tests in Sec. 2.1509 (a) through 
(e) are to be conducted on a single test unit in the order given below. 
This sequence of tests also includes the electrical tests in Sec. Sec. 
2.1511, 2.1513 and 2.1515 of this part. The test unit is not to be 
adjusted, nor is the battery to be replaced during these tests, and a 
log of battery on-time should be maintained. The above tests are to be 
performed on the same test unit. The tests in Sec. 2.1509 (f) through 
(i) may be run in any sequence or may be performed on separate test 
units.
    (a) Vibration test.

    Step (1) Secure the EPIRB to the vibration table. The EPIRB is not 
to be operated and should not activate while being vibrated.

[[Page 657]]

    Step (2) Subject the EPIRB to sinusoidal motion parallel to one of 
the three major orthogonal axes under the following conditions:

 
         A. Frequency (Hz)                   Peak amplitude (mm)
 
                      4-10                                    2.5
                     10-15                                    0.8
                     15-25                                    0.4
                     25-33                                    0.2
 

    B. The frequency is to be changed either linearly or logarithmically 
with time between 4 Hz and 33 Hz such that a complete cycle (4 Hz to 33 
Hz to 4 Hz) takes approximately 5 minutes.
    C. The EPIRB is to be vibrated for at least 30 minutes or six 
complete cycles.
    Step (3) Remount the EPIRB, if necessary, and repeat step 2 for each 
of the other two major orthogonal axes.
    Step (4) Upon completion of the test, perform an exterior mechanical 
inspection and verify operation by turning the unit on and observing the 
RF power indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a 
receiver. Record test results.

    (b) Thermal shock tests. These tests are to be performed on EPIRBs 
which are required or intended to float. (1) Low temperature thermal 
shock test.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in a temperature chamber for at least 3 
hours at -20 [deg]C or colder. The EPIRB is not to be operated while 
being cooled.
    Step (2) Immediately place the EPIRB in water that has been 
maintained at +10 [deg]C or warmer.
    Step (3) After 15 minutes, perform as exterior mechanical inspection 
and verify operation by turning the unit on and observing the RF power 
indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a receiver. 
Record test results.

    (2) High temperature thermal shock test.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in a temperature chamber for at least 3 
hours at +55 degrees C or warmer. The EPIRB is not to be operated while 
being heated.
    Step (2) Immediately float the EPIRB in water that is maintained at 
+25 degrees C or colder.
    Step (3) After 15 minutes, perform an exterior mechanical inspection 
and verify operation by turning the unit on and observing the RF power 
indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a receiver. 
Record test results.

    (c) Salt fog test.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in a salt fog chamber for a period of at 
least 2 hours at a temperature of 35 [deg]C (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
[deg]C) before exposing it to salt fog. The EPIRB is to be turned off 
during this test.
    Step (2) With the chamber temperature maintained at 35 [deg]C, 
introduce salt fog at the saturation point for 48 hours. The salt fog is 
to be prepared from a 5% (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1%) salt (sodium 
chloride solution. For detailed guidance on the preparation of the 
solution and the apparatus for generating salt fog, refer to MIL-STD-
810D (19 July 1983), method 509.2.
    Step (3) Upon completion of the salt fog exposure, the EPIRB is to 
be airdried at room temperature for 12 hours and operation verified by 
turning the unit on and observing the RF power indicator on the unit or 
monitoring the transmission with a receiver. Record observations.

    (d) Drop test. This test is to be performed on EPIRB which are 
required or intended to float.

    Step (1) Turn the EPIRB on, log the time and drop it three times 
into water from a height of 20 meters. The water is to be deep enough so 
that the EPIRB does not touch bottom when dropped. Each drop should be 
initiated from a different orientation as follows: antenna vertical up; 
antenna vertical down; antenna horizontal.
    Step (2) Upon completion of the drop test, an exterior mechanical 
inspection is to be performed and operation verified by observing the RF 
power indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a 
receiver. Record observations. Turn the test unit off and log the total 
on-time.

    (e) Forty-eight hour operational test. This test includes the 
battery life test and all the electrical tests given in Sec. Sec. 
2.1511, 2.1513 and 2.1515 of this part, at various temperatures. The 
tests are to be performed on the same EPIRB in the sequence specified 
herein. Be sure to record the on-time of the unit during each test. No 
more than 8 hours of total on-time is permitted before commencing step 
4. When operating the EPIRB in the environmental chamber, a non-
radiating load may be substituted for the antenna provided it is 
electrically equivalent to the standard antenna and does not reduce the 
battery current drain.

    Step (1) Perform the radiated emissions test in Sec. 2.1511 of this 
part.
    Step (2) Perform the modulation characteristic tests in Sec. 2.1513 
of this part.
    Step (3) Perform the spectral tests in Sec. 2.1515 of this part.
    Step (4) With the EPIRB off, place unit in an environmental chamber 
at a temperature of -20 [deg]C for at least 2 hours.

[[Page 658]]

    Step (5) With the EPIRB in the chamber, repeat the carrier frequency 
test in Sec. 2.1515(d) of this part. (Leave the EPIRB turned on.)
    Step (6) Near the end of 48 hours of total on-time for the EPIRB, 
repeat the carrier frequency test in Sec. 2.1515(d) of this part.
    Step (7) At the end of 48 hours of total on-time, remove EPIRB from 
the chamber and immediately repeat the PERP test for the fundamental 
emissions in Sec. 2.1511(c) of this part. The unit should be maintained 
at -20 [deg]C to the extent possible for this test.

    (f) Float free and activation test. This test is required only for 
Class A EPIRBs.

    Step (1) The EPIRB is to be installed in the automatic release 
mechanism and the assembly is to be mounted on a fixture simulating a 
deck or bulkhead as per manufacturer' installation instructions.
    Step (2) Submerge the fixture in water in its normal mounted 
orientation. The EPIRB must float free before reaching a depth of 4 
meters and should automatically activate. Activation is to be verified 
by observing the RF power indicator on the unit or monitoring the 
transmission with a receiver.
If the EPIRB is equipped with an automatically deployable antenna, the 
antenna must properly deploy during each immersion. Record observations.

    (g) Stability and buoyancy test. This test is to be performed on 
EPIRBs which are required or intended to float. This test is to be 
conducted in fresh water.

    Step (1) With the antenna deployed in its normal operating position, 
submerge the EPIRB in a horizontal position just below the surface of 
the water.
    Step (2) Release the EPIRB and observe the amount of time required 
for it to come to an upright position. It must reach its upright 
position within one second from each position.
The EPIRB must have a reserve buoyancy of at least 5% of its gross 
weight. It must also float upright in calm water with the base of the 
antenna a minimum of 5 cm above the water. Record the time required for 
the test unit to right itself.

    (h) Temperature/frequency test. The frequency stability shall be 
measured over an ambient temperature from -20[deg] to +55 [deg]C at 
intervals of not more than 10 [deg]C. A period of time sufficient to 
stabilize all of the components of the oscillator circuit at each 
temperture level shall be allowed prior to frequency measurement.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in the environmental test chamber.
    Step (2) Adjust the temperature in the chamber to +20 [deg]C and 
allow sufficient time for the oscillator to stabilize at that 
temperature.
    Step (3) Measure the carrier frequency in accordance with the 
procedure in Sec. 2.1515(d) of this part. Record the carrier frequency 
in Hertz. The carrier frequency at +20 [deg]C is the reference for 
determining the frequency tolerance.
    Step (4) Increase the temperature in the chamber to +55 [deg]C and 
allow sufficient time for the oscillator to stabilize at that 
temperature. Measure the carrier frequency using the procedure in Sec. 
2.1515(d) of this part.
    Step (5) Reduce the temperature in the chamber in 10 [deg]C maximum 
increments until -20 [deg]C is reached. At each new temperature, allow 
sufficient time for the oscillator to stabilize at that temperature. 
Measure the temperature and frequency in each case and plot the 
frequency vs temperature from -20[deg] to +55 [deg]C.

    (i) Leakage and immersion test.

    Step (1) Completely submerge the EPIRB in water for 48 hours. The 
EPIRB is to be turned off during this test.
    Step (2) Remove the EPIRB from the water and wipe dry.
    Step (3) Verify operation by briefly turning the EPIRB on and 
observing the RF power indicator on the unit or monitoring the 
transmission with a receiver.
    Step (4) Open the EPIRB for examination. There is to be no water 
inside the unit. Record observations.

Sec. 2.1511  Measurements of radiated emissions.

    The Commission's Rules require that the peak efficetive radiated 
power (PERP) of a Class A, B or S EPIRB not be less than 75 mW under 
certain specified conditions. The PERP of an EPIRB transmitter is 
determined by comparing its level to a reference PERP generated by a 
standard quarter-wave monopole antenna located on a one wavelength 
minimum diameter metal ground plane. The Rules also require that all 
spurious and harmonic emissions be attenuated by a specified amount with 
respect to the reference PERP. In addition, there is a limit on the PERP 
of radiated emissions with the switch in the test mode. These 
measurements are to be made in accordance with the following procedure.
    (a) General set-up instructions. Measurements of radiated 
electromagnetic

[[Page 659]]

emissions (EME) are to be performed on the 30 meter open field test site 
described in Sec. 2.1503(a) of this part and on one of the pair of 
frequencies listed in Sec. 2.1507 of this part. A receiver, tuned 
dipole antennas and a calibrated signal generator as described in Sec. 
2.1505 of this part are required. The EPIRB should be powered by its own 
internal battery with its standard antenna attached and deployed.
    (b) Set-up for radiated EME tests.

    Step (1) Place a 121.5 MHz quarter-wave vertical antenna element at 
the center of the ground plane and connect the output of the calibrated 
signal generator to the antenna.
    Step (2) Mount the tuned dipole antenna on the antenna mast, tune 
the elements to 121.5 MHz and connect the antenna to the receiver.
    Step (3) After an appropriate warm up, turn the receiver to the 
frequency of the test unit, set the detector to peak mode and the 
bandwidth to 100 kHz.

    (Note: It is sometimes helpful to monitor the receiver audio output 
with a speaker. The EPIRB signal may be identified by its distinctive 
modulation.)

    (c) Radiated EME tests.

           Fundamental emissions-peak effective radiated power

    Step (1) Turn on the signal generator and adjust the output to 75 mW 
at 121.5 MHz.
    Step (2) Vary the antenna height from one to four meters in both 
vertical and horizontal polarization. Record the highest receiver 
reading in dBm as the reference level.
    Step (3) Disconnect the signal generator and replace the quarter-
wave vertical element on the ground plane with the EPIRB under test. The 
EPIRB is to be positioned directly on the surface of and in the center 
of the metal ground plane.
    Step (4) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (5) Vary the receive antenna height from one to four meters in 
both vertical and horizontal polarization. Record the highest receiver 
reading in dBm and the instrument settings, antenna height and direction 
for maximum radiation, antenna polarization and conversion factors, if 
any, associated with that reading.
    Step (6) Repeat Step 5 with the EPIRB switch in the test position. 
Return the switch to the normal operation position.
    Step (7) Rotate the EPIRB 30 degrees and repeat Steps 5 and 6. 
Repeat this step for all successive 30 degrees segments of a full, 360 
degree rotation of the EPIRB.
    Step (8) Repeat Sec. 2.1511(b) and Steps 1 through 7 for 243 MHz.
    Step (9) Compute the peak effective radiated power for the maximum 
level of each measured emission using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.001

where:

dBm<INF>meas</INF> is the measured receiver reading in dBm, and
dBm<INF>ref</INF> is the reference receiver reading found in step 2 of 
Sec. 2.1511(c).
    Step (10) Record the PERP in mW. The FCC limit for minimum power in 
the normal operation mode (i.e., with the EPIRB switch in the normal 
operating position) is 75 mW. The FCC limit for maximum power in the 
test mode is 0.0001 mW.

                           Spurious emissions

    Step (11) Reset the signal generator to operate at 121.5 MHz.
    Step (12) For each spurious and harmonic emission to be measured, 
retune the receive antenna to the appropriate frequency and repeat Steps 
5 and 7.
    Step (13) Determine the FCC limit on power for spurious emissions on 
the frequency of each measured emission as follows:
    The rules require that spurious emissions be attenuated at least 30 
decibels below the transmit power level. Therefore, the maximum received 
power limit for a spurious emission can be calculated from the formula:

dBm<INF>spur</INF> = dBm<INF>meas</INF>+AF<INF>121.5</INF>-
AF<INF>spurfreq</INF>-30

where:

dBm<INF>meas</INF> = measured receiver reading (Section 2.1511(c), step 
5).
AF<INF>121.5</INF> = tuned dipole antenna factor at 121.5 MHz.
AF<INF>spurfreq</INF> = tuned dipole antenna factor at spurious freq.
    Step (14) Record in dB below the fundamental emissions the level of 
all spurious and harmonic emissions within 10 dB of the FCC limits.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1513  Measurements of modulation characteristics.

    (a) Set-up. Test of modulation characteristics are to be performed 
in an RF shielded room.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB directly on a metal ground plane, such as 
the shielded room floor.
    Step (2) Place a suitable receiving antenna at a convenient distance 
from the EPIRB and connect it to the input of the spectrum analyzer or 
receiver to observe the radiated signal from the EPIRB.
    Step (3) Set the spectrum analyzer or receiver controls as follows:

[[Page 660]]

I.F. bandwidth: 300 kHz minimum
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Amplitude scale: Linear
Frequency: 121.5 MHz
Scan width: 0 Hz
    Step (4) Connect the detected output of the spectrum analyzer or 
receiver to the input of the storage oscilloscope.
    Step (5) Set the oscilloscope controls as necessary to allow the 
demodulated waveform to be viewed. The input signal is to be DC coupled.

    (b) Measurement of Audio Frequencies.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (2) Trigger the oscilloscope and store at least one complete 
cycle of the audio waveform.
    Step (3) Measure the period (T) of the waveform. The period is the 
time difference between the half voltage points at the beginning and end 
of one complete cycle of the waveform. See Figure 2.
    Step (4) Calculate the frequency (F), where:

F=1/T.

    Step (5) Repeat Steps 2 through 4 until the highest and lowest audio 
frequencies are found.

    Note: The lowest and highest frequencies may occur several cycles 
before or after the transition from low to high frequency.)

    Step (6) Determine the audio frequency range (F<INF>range</INF>), 
where:

F<INF>range</INF>=F<INF>high</INF>-F<INF>low</INF>

    Step (7) Record instrument settings and the lowest and highest audio 
frequencies. Record the audio frequency range in Hertz.
    Step (8) Repeat Steps 1-7, above, for 243 MHz.

    (c) Modulation factor.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (2) Trigger the oscilloscope and store at least one complete 
cycle of the audio waveform. The input signal is to be DC coupled or 
erroneous results will be obtained.
    Step (3) Measure the maximum voltage (V<INF>max</INF>), and the 
minimum voltage (V<INF>min</INF>) for the cycle. The modulation factor 
(M) is calculated from the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.002

    See Figure 2.
    Step (4) Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the lowest modulation factor is 
found.
    Step (5) Record instrument settings and the lowest modulation 
factor, expressed as a ratio between 0 and 1.
    Step (6) Repeat the above measurements for 243 MHz.

    (d) Modulation duty cycle.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (2) Trigger the oscilloscope and store at least one complete 
cycle of the audio waveform.
    Step (3) Measure the period (T) of the waveform. The period is the 
time difference between the half voltage points at the beginning and end 
of one cycle of the waveform. See Figure 2.
    Step (4) Measure the pulse width (t<INF>p</INF>) of the waveform. 
The pulse width is the time difference between the half voltage points 
on the rising and falling portions of the waveform. See Figure 2.
    Step (5) Calculate the duty cycle (D) as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.003
    
    Step (6) Repeat Steps 2 through 5 a sufficient number of times to 
determine the highest and lowest duty cycles.
    Step (7) Record instrument settings and the highest and lowest duty 
cycles in percent.
    Step (8) Repeat Steps 1-7 for 243 MHz.

    (e) Sweep repetition rate.

    Step (1) Connect a speaker to the detected output of the spectrum 
analyzer or receiver so the audio frequencies are audible. 
Alternatively, an FM radio tuned to 108 MHz placed in the vicinity of 
the EPIRB may be used.
    Step (2) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (3) Time the number of audio sweeps (N) for a one minute 
interval.
    Step (4) Calculate the audio sweep rate (R) using R=N/60.
    Step (5) Record instrument settings and the sweep repetition rate in 
Hertz.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1515  Spectral measurements.

    (a) Set-up. Spectral measurements are to be performed in a shielded 
room.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB directly on a metal ground plane, such as 
the shielded room floor. The EPIRB should be powered by its own internal 
battery with its standard antenna attached and deployed.
    Step (2) Place a suitable receiving antenna at a convenient distance 
from the EPIRB and connect it to the input of the spectrum analyzer to 
observe the radiated signal from the EPIRB. A signal generator and 
frequency counter capable of operating at 121.5 and 243 MHz are also 
required for these tests.

    (b) Occupied bandwidth test.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB and observe the fundamental frequency on 
a spectrum

[[Page 661]]

analyzer. Adjust location of receiving antenna and spectrum analyzer 
controls to obtain a suitable signal level (i.e., a level which will not 
overload the spectrum analyzer, but is far enough above the noise floor 
to allow determination of whether or not the sidebands are attenuated by 
at least the amount required in the rules).
    Step (2) Set spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 10 kHz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 100 ms./div.
Amplitude scale: 10 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 Hz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (3) Record the signal level in dbm.
    Step (4) Calculate the mean power reference level by adding 10 
log<INF>10</INF> (D), where D is the modulation duty cycle determined in 
section 2.1513(d) of this part, to the recorded signal level.
    Step (5) Set spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 100 Hz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 10 sec./div.
Amplitude scale: 10 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 kHz/div.

    Step (6) Check the modulation sidebands for compliance with the 
required attenuation below the mean power reference level specified in 
Sec. 80.211 of the rules.
    Step (7) Record how the test was performed, instrument settings and 
the occupied bandwidth in kHz and the 3 dB bandwidth of the carrier in 
Hz. (See Sec. 2.1517 of this part).
    Step (8) Repeat Steps 1 through 7 for the signal at 243 MHz.

    (c) Signal enhancement test. The setup specified in Sec. 2.1515(a) 
is to be used in this method of measuring signal enhancement. Other 
methods may be used if shown to give results equivalent to or more 
accurate than this method.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB and locate the carrier frequency at 
121.5 MHz on the spectrum analyzer. Adjust location of receiving antenna 
and spectrum analyzer controls to obtain a suitable signal level (i.e., 
a level which will not overload the analyzer, but is far enough above 
the noise floor to allow sidebands at least 40 dB below the carrier to 
be viewed).
    Step (2) Set the spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 10 kHz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 100 ms./div.
Amplitude scale: 5 dB/div.
Scan width: 10 kHz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (3) Record the amplitude in dBm.
    Step (4) Calculate the total power output by adding 10 log(D), where 
D is the modulation duty cycle determined in Sec. 2.1513(d) of this 
part, to the recorded signal level.
    Step (5) Set the spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 60 Hz or less
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 10 sec./div.
Amplitude scale: 5 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 Hz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (6) Measure and record the carrier power dBm as displayed on 
the spectrum analyzer.
    Step (7) Calculate the ratio of carrier power to total power from 
Steps 4 and 6 using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.004

dB<INF>C</INF> = carrier power in step 6
dB<INF>T</INF> = total power in step 4

    Step (8) Record instrument settings, sample calculation and the 
percent of power within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 Hz at 121.5 MHz or 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>60 Hz at 243 MHz of the carrier frequency.
    Step (9) Repeat the above measurement Steps 1 through 8 for 243 MHz. 
For the higher frequency, the I.F. bandwidth in step 5 must be 120 Hz or 
less.

    (d) Carrier frequency test. The setup specified in Sec. 2.1515(a) 
is to be used in measuring the carrier frequency.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB and locate the 121.5 MHz signal on the 
spectrum analyzer. Adjust location of receiving antenna and spectrum 
analyzer controls to obtain a suitable signal level.
    Step (2) Set the spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 100 Hz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 10 sec./div.
Amplitude scale: 10 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 Hz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (3) Combine the output of the signal generator with the EPIRB 
signal at the input to the spectrum analyzer.
    Step (4) Adjust amplitude and frequency of signal generator output 
to determine center of carrier frequency component.
    Step (5) Measure signal generator frequency with frequency counter 
with accuracy of 5 PPM or better and record as carrier frequency.
    Step (6) If applicable, change the type of modulation of the EPIRB 
and record the shift in carrier frequency as observed on the spectrum 
analyzer display.

[[Page 662]]

    Step (7) Repeat the above measurement Steps 1 through 6 for 243 MHz.

Sec. 3.1  Scope, basis, purpose.

    By these rules the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is 
delineating its responsibilities in certifying and monitoring accounting 
authorities in the maritime mobile and maritime mobile-satellite radio 
services. These entities settle accounts for public correspondence due 
to foreign administrations for messages transmitted at sea by or between 
maritime mobile stations located on board ships subject to U.S. registry 
and utilizing foreign coast and coast earth station facilities. These 
rules are intended to ensure that settlements of accounts for U.S. 
licensed ship radio stations are conducted in accordance with the 
International Telecommunication Regulations (ITR), taking into account 
the applicable ITU-T Recommendations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ At the ITU Additional Plenipotentiary Conference in Geneva 
(December, 1992), the structure, working methods and construct of the 
basic ITU treaty instrument were modified. The result is that the names 
of the sub-entities of the ITU have changed (e.g., the CCITT has become 
the Telecommunication Standardization Sector--ITU-T and Recognized

things, it is used to perform accounting settlements in the maritime 
mobile and the maritime mobile-satellite services.
    (n) Maritime Mobile Service. A mobile service between coast stations 
and ship stations, or between ship stations, or between associated on-
board communication stations. Survival craft stations and emergency 
position- indicating radiobeacon stations may also participate in this 
service.

                               Eligibility


<R05>
Sec. 3.10  Basic qualifications.

    (a) Applicants must meet the requirements and conditions contained 
in these rules in order to be certified as an accounting authority. No 
individual

[[Page 669]]

or other entity, including accounting authorities approved by other 
administrations, may act as a United States accounting authority and 
settle accounts of U.S. licensed vessels in the maritime mobile or 
maritime mobile-satellite services without a certification from the 
Federal Communications Commission. Accounting authorities with interim 
certification as of the effective date of this rule must submit to the 
application process discussed in Sec. 3.20. They will be 
``grandfathered'', i.e, granted permanent certification provided they 
demonstrate their eligibility and present a proper application.
    (b) U.S. citizenship is not required of individuals in order to 
receive certification from the Commission to be an accounting authority. 
Likewise, joint ventures need not be organized under the laws of the 
United States in order to be eligible to perform settlements for U.S. 
licensed vessels. See, however, Sec. 3.11.
    (c) Prior experience in maritime accounting, general commercial 
accounting, international shipping or any other related endeavor will be 
taken into consideration by the Commission in certifying accounting 
authorities. The lack of such expertise, however, will not automatically 
disqualify an individual, partnership, corporation or other entity from 
becoming an accounting authority.
    (d) Applicants must provide formal financial statements or 
documentation proving all assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
    (e) Applicants must offer their services to any member of the public 
making a reasonable request therefor, without undue discrimination 
against any customer or class of customer, and fees charged for 
providing such services shall be reasonable and non-discriminatory. This 
requirement will be waived for applicants who settle their own accounts 
only and are eligible to be ``grandfathered'' during the initial 
application period. However, should the need for additional accounting 
authorities be proven, these accounting authorities will be required to 
offer their services to the public or relinquish their certification.

[61 FR 20165, May 6, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 40776, July 28, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 3.11  Location of settlement operation.

    (a) Within the United States. A certified accounting authority 
maintaining all settlement operations, as well as associated 
documentation, within the United States will be assigned an AAIC with a 
``US'' prefix.
    (b) Outside the United States. A certified accounting authority 
maintaining settlement operations outside the United States will be 
assigned the same AAIC as that originally assigned to such entity by the 
administration of the country of origin. However, in no case will an 
entity be certified as an accounting authority for settlement of U.S. 
licensed vessel accounts unless the entity is requesting to conduct a 
settlement operation in the United States or has already been issued an 
AAIC by another administration.

                         Application Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 3.20  Application form.

    Written application must be made to the Federal Communications 
Commission on FCC Form 44, ``Application For Certification As An 
Accounting Authority'' in order to be considered for certification as an 
accounting authority. No other application form may be used. No 
consideration will be given to applicants not submitting applications in 
accordance with these rules or in accordance with any other instructions 
the Commission may issue. FCC Form 44 may be obtained from the 
Commission by writing to the address shown in Sec. 3.61.


<R05>
Sec. 3.21  Order of consideration.

    (a) Accounting Authority applications will be processed on a first-
come, first-served basis. When applications are received on the same 
day, the application with the earliest mailing date, as evidenced by the 
postmark, will be processed first. Interim accounting authorities 
seeking permanent certifications through the ``grandfathering'' process 
will not compete with other applicants during the first 60 days 
following the effective date of these rules which is allowed for 
submission of their applications. After the ``grandfathering'' process 
is completed, all other applicants will be

[[Page 670]]

processed as in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (b) At any given time, there will be no more than 25 certified 
accounting authorities with a minimum of 15 ``US'' AAICs reserved for 
use by accounting authorities conducting settlement operations within 
the United States. The Commission will retain all valid applications 
received after the maximum number of accounting authorities have been 
approved and will inform such applicants that should an AAIC become 
available for reassignment in the future, the Commission will 
conditionally certify as an accounting authority the oldest of the 
qualified pending applicants, as determined by the order of receipt. 
Final certification would be conditional upon filing of an amended 
application (if necessary). The Commission will inform the applicant of 
his/her conditional selection in writing to confirm the applicant's 
continued interest in becoming an accounting authority.


<R05>
Sec. 3.22  Number of accounting authority identification codes per applicant.

    (a) No entity will be entitled to or assigned more than one AAIC.
    (b) AAICs may not be reassigned, sold, bartered or transferred and 
do not convey upon sale or absorption of a company or firm without the 
express written approval of the Commission. Only the FCC may certify 
accounting authorities and assign U.S. AAICs for entities settling 
accounts of U.S. licensed vessels in the maritime mobile and maritime 
mobile-satellite services.
    (c) Accounting authorities who are ``grandfathered'' during the 
initial application period may retain their interim AAIC.


<R05>
Sec. 3.23  Legal applicant.

    The application shall be signed by the individual, partner or 
primary officer of a corporation who is legally able to obligate the 
entity for which he or she is a representative.


<R05>
Sec. 3.24  Evidence of financial responsibility.

    All applicants must provide evidence of sound financial status. To 
the extent that the applicant is a business, formal financial statements 
will be required. Other applicants may submit documentation proving all 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses which supports their ability to 
meet their personal obligations. Applicants must provide any additional 
information deemed necessary by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3.25  Number of copies.

    One original and one copy of FCC Form 44, ``Application For 
Certification As An Accounting Authority'' will be required. Only 
applications mailed to the Commission on official, Commission approved 
application forms will be considered. Applications should be mailed at 
least 90 days prior to planned commencement of settlement activities to 
allow time for the Commission to review the application and to allow for 
the informal public comment period.


<R05>
Sec. 3.26  Where application is to be mailed.

    All applications shall be mailed to the Accounting Authority 
Certification Officer in Washington, D.C. The designated address will be 
provided on the FCC Form 44, ``Application for Certification As An 
Accounting Authority''.


<R05>
Sec. 3.27  Amended application.

    Changes in circumstances that cause information previously supplied 
to the FCC to be incorrect or incomplete and that could affect the 
approval process, require the submission of an amended application. The 
amended application should be mailed to the Commission immediately 
following such change. See also Sec. Sec. 3.24 and 3.51.


<R05>
Sec. 3.28  Denial of privilege.

    (a) The Commission, in its sole discretion, may refuse to grant an 
application to become an accounting authority for any of the following 
reasons:
    (1) Failure to provide evidence of acceptable financial 
responsibility;
    (2) If the applicant, in the opinion of the FCC reviewing official, 
does not possess the qualifications necessary to the proper functioning 
of an accounting authority;
    (3) Application is not personally signed by the proper official(s);

[[Page 671]]

    (4) Applicant does not provide evidence that accounting operations 
will take place in the United States or its territories and the 
applicant does not already possess an AAIC issued by another 
administration;
    (5) Application is incomplete, the applicant fails to provide 
additional information requested by the Commission or the applicant 
indicates that it cannot meet a particular provision; or
    (6) When the Commission determines that the grant of an 
authorization is contrary to the public interest.
    (b) These rules provide sufficient latitude to address defects in 
applications. Entities seeking review should follow procedures set forth 
in Sec. 1.106 or Sec. 1.115 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 3.29  Notifications.

    (a) The Commission will publish the name of an applicant in a Public 
Notice before granting certification and will invite informal public 
comment on the qualifications of the applicant from any interested 
parties. Comments received will be taken into consideration by the 
Commission in making its determination as to whether to approve an 
applicant as an accounting authority. Thirty days will be allowed for 
submission of comments.
    (b) The Commission will notify each applicant in writing as to 
whether the applicant has been approved as an accounting authority. If 
the application is not approved, the Commission will provide a brief 
statement of the grounds for denial.
    (c) The names and addresses of all newly certified accounting 
authorities will be published in a Public Notice issued by the 
Commission. Additionally, the Commission will notify the ITU within 30 
days of any changes to its approved list of accounting authorities.

                          Settlement Operations


<R05>
Sec. 3.40  Operational requirements.

    All accounting authorities must conduct their operations in 
conformance with the provisions contained in this section and with 
relevant rules and guidance issued from time to time by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3.41  Amount of time allowed before initial settlements.

    An accounting authority must begin settling accounts no later than 
six months from the date of certification. Failure to commence 
settlement operations is cause for suspension or cancellation of an 
accounting authority certification.


<R05>
Sec. 3.42  Location of processing facility.

    Settlement of maritime mobile and maritime mobile-satellite service 
accounts must be performed within the United States by all accounting 
authorities possessing the ``US'' prefix. Other accounting authorities 
approved by the Commission may settle accounts either in the U.S. or 
elsewhere. See also Sec. Sec. 3.11 and 3.21(b).


<R05>
Sec. 3.43  Applicable rules and regulations.

    Accounting authority operations must be conducted in accordance with 
applicable FCC rules and regulations, the International 
Telecommunication Regulations (ITR), and other international rules, 
regulations, agreements, and, where appropriate, ITU-T Recommendations. 
In particular, the following must be adhered to or taken into account in 
the case of ITU-T.
    (a) The latest basic treaty instrument(s) of the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU);
    (b) Binding agreements contained in the Final Acts of World 
Administrative Radio Conferences and/or World International 
Telecommunication Conferences;
    (c) ITU Radio Regulations;
    (d) ITU International Telecommunication Regulations (ITR);
    (e) ITU-T Recommendations (particularly D.90 and D.195); and
    (f) FCC Rules and Regulations (47 CFR part 3).


<R05>
Sec. 3.44  Time to achieve settlements.

    All maritime telecommunications accounts should be timely paid in 
accordance with applicable ITU Regulations, Article 66 and International 
Telecommunication Regulations (Melbourne, 1988). Accounting authorities 
are deemed to be responsible for remitting, in a timely manner, all 
valid

[[Page 672]]

amounts due to foreign administrations or their agents.


<R05>
Sec. 3.45  Amount of charges.

    Accounting Authorities may charge any reasonable fee for their 
settlement services. Settlements themselves, however, must adhere to the 
standards set forth in these rules and must be in accordance with the 
International Telecommunication Regulations (ITR) taking into account 
the applicable ITU-T Recommendations and other guidance issued by the 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3.46  Use of gold francs.

    An accounting authority must accept accounts presented to it from 
foreign administrations in gold francs. These gold francs must be 
converted on the date of receipt of the bill to the applicable Special 
Drawing Right (SDR) rate (as published by the International Monetary 
Fund) on that date utilizing the linking coefficient of 3.061 gold 
francs = 1 SDR. An equivalent amount in U.S. dollars must be paid to the 
foreign administration. Upon written concurrence by the FCC, an 
accounting authority may make separate agreements, in writing, with 
foreign administrations or their agents for alternative settlement 
methods, in accordance with ITU-T Recommendation D.195.


<R05>
Sec. 3.47  Use of SDRs.

    An accounting authority must accept accounts presented to it from 
foreign administrations in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). These SDRs 
must be converted to dollars on the date of receipt by the accounting 
authority and an equivalent amount in US dollars must be paid to the 
foreign administration. The conversion rate will be the applicable rate 
published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the date of 
receipt of the account from the foreign administration. Upon written 
concurrence by the FCC, any accounting authority may make separate 
agreements, in writing, with foreign administrations or their agents for 
alternative settlement methods, provided account is taken of ITU-T 
Recommendation D.195.


<R05>
Sec. 3.48  Cooperation with the Commission.

    Accounting authorities must cooperate fully with the FCC in all 
respects concerning international maritime settlements issues, including 
the resolution of questions of fact or other issues arising as a result 
of settlement operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3.49  Agreement to be audited.

    Accounting authorities accept their certifications on condition that 
they are subject to audit of their settlement activities by the 
Commission or its representative. Additionally, the Commission reserves 
the right to verify any statement(s) made or any materials submitted to 
the Commission under these rules. Verification may involve discussions 
with ship owners or others as well as the requirement to submit 
additional information to the Commission. Failure to respond 
satisfactorily to any audit findings is grounds for forfeiture or 
suspension or cancellation of authority to act as an accounting 
authority for U.S. vessels.


<R05>
Sec. 3.50  Retention of settlement records.

    Accounting authorities must maintain, for the purpose of compliance 
with these rules, all settlement records for a period of at least seven 
years following settlement of an account with a foreign administration 
or agent.


<R05>
Sec. 3.51  Cessation of operations.

    The FCC must be notified immediately should an accounting authority 
plan to relinquish its certification or cease to perform settlements as 
authorized. Additionally, the Commission must be advised in advance of 
any proposed transfer of control of an accounting authority's firm or 
organization, by any means, to another entity.
    (a) When an accounting authority is transferred, merged or sold, the 
new entity must apply for certification in its own right if it is 
interested in becoming an accounting authority. Provided the new 
applicant is eligible and completes the application process 
satisfactorily, the AAIC will be transferred to the new applicant. In 
the case of a merger of two accounting authorities, the merged entity 
must decide which AAIC to retain.

[[Page 673]]

    (b) Section 3.21(a) will be waived for these applicants.
    (c) The applicant must comply with application process including 
public comment.
    (d) The applicant must certify acceptance of all accounts and must 
furnish a list of the accounts to the Commission at the time of 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 3.52  Complaint/inquiry resolution procedures.

    (a) Accounting authorities must maintain procedures for resolving 
complaints and/or inquiries from its contractual customers (vessels for 
which it performs settlements), the FCC, the ITU, and foreign 
administrations or their agents. These procedures must be available to 
the Commission upon request.
    (b) If a foreign administration requests assistance in collection of 
accounts from ships licensed by the FCC, the appropriate accounting 
authority will provide all information requested by the Commission in a 
timely manner to enable the Commission to determine the cause of the 
complaint and to resolve the issue. If accounts are in dispute, the 
Commission will determine the amount due the foreign administration, 
accounting authority or ROA, and may direct the accounting authority to 
pay the accounts to the foreign administration. If the accounting 
authority does not pay the disputed accounts within a reasonable 
timeframe, the Commission may take action to levy a forfeiture, cancel 
the AAIC privilege and/or to revoke any operating authority or licenses 
held by that accounting authority. (See also Sec. 3.72).


<R05>
Sec. 3.53  FCC notification of refusal to provide telecommunications service to U.S. registered vessel(s).

    An accounting authority must inform the FCC immediately should it 
receive notice from any source that a foreign administration or facility 
is refusing or plans to refuse legitimate public correspondence to or 
from any U.S. registered vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 3.54  Notification of change in address.

    The Commission must be notified in writing within 15 days of any 
change in address of an accounting authority. Such written notification 
should be sent to the address shown in Sec. 3.61.

                         Reporting Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 3.60  Reports.

    (a) Initial Inventory of Vessels. Within 60 days after receiving 
final approval from the FCC to be an accounting authority, each 
certified accounting authority must provide to the FCC an initial list 
of vessels for which it is performing settlements. This list should 
contain only U.S. registered vessels. Such list shall be typewritten or 
computer generated, be annotated to indicate it is the initial inventory 
and be in the general format of the following and provide the 
information shown:

 
                Vessel Name                           Call Sign
 
 
 

    (b) Semi-Annual Additions/Modifications/Deletions to Vessel 
Inventory. Beginning with the period ending on the last day of March or 
September following submission of an accounting authority's Initial 
Inventory of Vessels (See paragraph (a) of this section.) and each semi-
annual period thereafter, each accounting authority is required to 
submit to the FCC a report on additions, modifications or deletions to 
its list of vessels for which it is performing or intending to perform 
settlements, whether or not settlements actually have taken place. The 
list should contain only U.S. registered vessels. The report shall be 
typewritten or computer generated and be in the following general 
format:

                  Additions to Current Vessel Inventory
 
           Vessel Name                 Call Sign        Effective Date
 
 
 


                                    Modifications to Current Vessel Inventory
 
      Previous Vessel Name        Previous Call Sign    New Vessel Name      New Call Sign      Effective Date

           Vessel Name                 Call Sign        Effective Date
 
 
 


[[Page 674]]


The preceding report must be received by the Commission no later than 15 
days following the end of the period (March or September) for which the 
report pertains. Modifications refer to changes to call sign or ship 
name of vessels for which the accounting authority settles accounts and 
for which fbasic information has previously been provided to the 
Commission. Reports are to be submitted even if there have been no 
additions, modifications or deletions to vessel inventories since the 
previous report. If there are no changes to an inventory, this should be 
indicated on the report.
    (c) End of Year Inventory. By February 1st of each year, each 
accounting authority must submit an end-of-year inventory report listing 
vessels for which the accounting authority performed settlements as of 
the previous December 31st. The list should contain only U.S. registered 
vessels. The report must be typewritten or computer generated and 
prepared in the same general format as that shown in paragraph (a) of 
this section except it should be annotated to indicate it is the End of 
Year inventory.
    (d) Annual Statistical Report of Settlement Operations. By February 
1st of each year, each accounting authority settling accounts for U.S. 
registered vessels must submit to the FCC an Annual Statistical Report, 
FCC Form 45, which details the number and dollar amount of settlements, 
by foreign administration, during the preceding twelve months. 
Information contained in this report provides statistical data that will 
enable the Commission to monitor operations to ensure adherence to these 
rules and to appropriate international settlement procedures. FCC Form 
45 can be obtained by writing to the address in 3.61 of these rules.

<R05>
Sec. 3.71  Warnings.

    The Commission may issue written warnings or forfeitures to 
accounting authorities which are found not to be operating in accordance 
with established rules and regulations. Warnings will generally be 
issued for violations which do not seriously or immediately affect 
settlement functions or international relations. Continued or unresolved 
violations may lead to further enforcement action by the Commission, 
including any or all legally available sanctions, including but not 
limited to, forfeitures (Communications Act of 1934, Sec. 503), 
suspension or cancellation of the accounting authority certification.


<R05>
Sec. 3.72  Grounds for further enforcement action.

    (a) The Commission may take further enforcement action, including 
forfeiture, suspension or cancellation of an accounting authority 
certification, if it is determined that the public interest so requires. 
Reasons for which such action may be taken include, inter alia:
    (1) Failure to initiate settlements within six months of 
certification or failure to perform settlements during any subsequent 
six month period;
    (2) Illegal activity or fraud;
    (3) Non-payment or late payment to a foreign administration or 
agent;
    (4) Failure to follow ITR requirements and procedures;
    (5) Failure to take into account ITU-T Recommendations;
    (6) Failure to follow FCC rules and regulations;

[[Page 675]]

    (7) Bankruptcy; or
    (8) Providing false or incomplete information to the Commission or 
failure to comply with or respond to requests for information.
    (b) Prior to taking any of the enforcement actions in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Commission will give notice of its intent to take 
the specified action and the grounds therefor, and afford a 30-day 
period for a response in writing; provided that, where the public 
interest so requires, the Commission may temporarily suspend a 
certification pending completion of these procedures. Responses must be 
forwarded to the Accounting Authority Certification Officer. See Sec. 
3.61.


<R05>
Sec. 3.73  Waiting period after cancellation.

    An accounting authority whose certification has been cancelled must 
wait a minimum of three years before reapplying to be an accounting 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 3.74  Ship stations affected by suspension, cancellation or relinquishment.

    (a) Whenever the accounting authority privilege has been suspended, 
cancelled or relinquished, the accounting authority is responsible for 
immediately notifying all U.S. ship licensees for which it was 
performing settlements of the circumstances and informing them of the 
requirement contained in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Those ship stations utilizing an accounting authority's AAIC for 
which the subject accounting authority certification has been suspended, 
cancelled or relinquished, should make contractual arrangements with 
another properly authorized accounting authority to settle its accounts.
    (c) The Commission will notify the ITU of all accounting authority 
suspensions, cancellations and relinquishments, and
    (d) The Commission will publish a Public Notice detailing all 
accounting authority suspensions, cancellations and relinquishments.


<R05>
Sec. 3.75  Licensee's failure to make timely payment.

    Failure to remit proper and timely payment to the Commission or to 
an accounting authority may result in one or more of the following 
actions against the licensee:
    (a) Forfeiture or other authorized sanction.
    (b) The refusal by foreign countries to accept or refer public 
correspondence communications to or from the vessel or vessels owned, 
operated or licensed by the person or entity failing to make payment. 
This action may be taken at the request of the Commission or 
independently by the foreign country or coast station involved.
    (c) Further action to recover amounts owed utilizing any or all 
legally available debt collection procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 3.76  Licensee's liability for payment.

    The U.S. ship station licensee bears ultimate responsibility for 
final payment of its accounts. This responsibility cannot be superseded 
by the contractual agreement between the ship station licensee and the 
accounting authority. In the event that an accounting authority does not 
remit proper and timely payments on behalf of the ship station licensee:
    (a) The ship station licensee will make arrangements for another 
accounting authority to perform future settlements, and
    (b) The ship station licensee will settle any outstanding accounts 
due to foreign entities.
    (c) The Commission will, upon request, take all possible steps, 
within the limits of applicable national law, to ensure settlement of 
the accounts of the ship station licensee. As circumstances warrant, 
this may include issuing warnings to ship station licensees when it 
becomes apparent that an accounting authority is failing to settle 
accounts. See also Sec. Sec. 3.70 through 3.74.

        Reporting Requirements for Disruptions to Communications


<R05>
Sec. 4.3  Communications providers covered by the requirements of this part.

    (a) Cable communications providers are cable service providers that 
also provide circuit-switched telephony. Also included are affiliated 
and non-affiliated entities that maintain or provide communications 
networks or services used by the provider in offering telephony.
    (b) Communications provider is an entity that provides for a fee to 
one or more unaffiliated entities, by radio, wire, cable, satellite, 
and/or lightguide: two-way voice and/or data communications, paging 
service, and/or SS7 communications.
    (c) IXC or LEC tandem facilities refer to tandem switches (or their 
equivalents) and interoffice facilities used in the provision of 
interexchange or local exchange communications.
    (d) Satellite communications providers use space stations as a means 
of providing the public with communications, such as telephony and 
paging. Also included are affiliated and non-affiliated entities that 
maintain or provide communications networks or services used by the 
provider in offering such communications. ``Satellite operators'' refer 
to entities that operate space stations but do not necessarily provide 
communications services directly to end users.
    (e) Signaling System 7 (SS7) is a signaling system used to control 
telecommunications networks. It is frequently used to ``set up,'' 
process, control, and terminate circuit-switched telecommunications, 
including but not limited to domestic and international telephone calls 
(irrespective of whether the call is wholly or in part wireless, 
wireline, local, long distance, or is carried over cable or satellite 
infrastructure), SMS text messaging services, 8XX number type services, 
local number portability, VoIP signaling gateway services, 555 number 
type services, and most paging services. For purposes of this rule part, 
SS7 refers to both the SS7 protocol and the packet networks through 
which signaling information is transported and switched or routed. It 
includes future modifications to the existing SS7 architecture that will 
provide the functional equivalency of the SS7 services and network 
elements that exist as of August 4, 2004. SS7 communications providers 
are subject to the provisions of this part 4 regardless of whether or 
not they provide service directly to end users. Also subject to part 4 
of the Commission's rules

[[Page 677]]

are affiliated and non-affiliated entities that maintain or provide 
communications networks or services used by the SS7 provider in offering 
SS7 communications.
    (f) Wireless service providers include Commercial Mobile Radio 
Service communications providers that use cellular architecture and CMRS 
paging providers. In particular, they include Cellular Radio Telephone 
Service (part 22 of the Commission's Rules) providers; Personal 
Communications Service (PCS) (part 24) providers; those Special Mobile 
Radio Service (part 90) providers that meet the definition of ``covered 
CMRS'' providers pursuant to Sec. Sec. 20.18(a), 52.21, and 52.31 of 
the Commission's rules, those private paging (part 90) providers that 
are treated as CMRS providers (see Sec. 20.9 of this chapter); and 
narrowband PCS providers (part 24) of this chapter. Also included are 
affiliated and non-affiliated entities that maintain or provide 
communications networks or services used by the provider in offering 
such communications.
    (g) Wireline communications providers offer terrestrial 
communications through direct connectivity, predominantly by wire, 
coaxial cable, or optical fiber, between the serving central office (as 
defined in the appendix to part 36 of this chapter) and end user 
location(s). Also included are affiliated and non-affiliated entities 
that maintain or provide communications networks or services used by the 
provider in offering such communications.
    (h) Exclusion of equipment manufacturers or vendors. Excluded from 
the requirements of this part 4 are those equipment manufacturers or 
vendors that do not maintain or provide communications networks or 
services used by communications providers in offering communications.


<R05>
Sec. 4.5  Definitions of outage, special offices and facilities, and 911 special facilities.

    (a) Outage is defined as a significant degradation in the ability of 
an end user to establish and maintain a channel of communications as a 
result of failure or degradation in the performance of a communications 
provider's network.
    (b) Special offices and facilities are defined as major military 
installations, key government facilities, nuclear power plants, and 
those airports that are listed as current primary (PR), commercial 
service (CM), and reliever (RL) airports in the FAA's National Plan of 
Integrated Airports Systems (NPIAS) (as issued at least one calendar 
year prior to the outage). The member agencies of the National 
Communications System (NCS) will determine which of their locations are 
``major military installations'' and ``key government facilities.'' 911 
special facilities are addressed separately in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (c) All outages that potentially affect communications for at least 
30 minutes with any airport that qualifies as a ``special office and 
facility'' pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be reported in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 4.11 and 4.13.
    (d) A mission-affecting outage is defined as an outage that is 
deemed critical to national security/emergency preparedness (NS/EP) 
operations of the affected facility by the National Communications 
System member agency operating the affected facility.
    (e) An outage that potentially affects a 911 special facility occurs 
whenever:
    (1) There is a loss of communications to PSAP(s) potentially 
affecting at least 900,000 user-minutes and: The failure is neither at 
the PSAP(s) nor on the premises of the PSAP(s); no reroute for all end 
users was available; and the outage lasts 30 minutes or more; or
    (2) There is a loss of 911 call processing capabilities in one or 
more E-911 tandems/selective routers for at least 30 minutes duration; 
or
    (3) One or more end-office or MSC switches or host/remote clusters 
is isolated from 911 service for at least 30 minutes and potentially 
affects at least 900,000 user-minutes; or
    (4) There is a loss of ANI/ALI (associated name and location 
information) and/or a failure of location determination equipment, 
including Phase II equipment, for at least 30 minutes and potentially 
affecting at least 900,000 user-minutes (provided that the ANI/ALI or 
location determination equipment was then currently deployed and

[[Page 678]]

in use, and the failure is neither at the PSAP(s) or on the premises of 
the PSAP(s)).


<R05>
Sec. 4.7  Definitions of metrics used to determine the general outage-reporting threshold criteria.

    (a) Administrative numbers are defined as the telephone numbers used 
by communications providers to perform internal administrative or 
operational functions necessary to maintain reasonable quality of 
service standards.
    (b) Assigned numbers are defined as the telephone numbers working in 
the Public Switched Telephone Network under an agreement such as a 
contract or tariff at the request of specific end users or customers for 
their use. This excludes numbers that are not yet working but have a 
service order pending.
    (c) Assigned telephone number minutes are defined as the 
mathematical result of multiplying the duration of an outage, expressed 
in minutes, by the sum of the number of assigned numbers (defined in 
paragraph (b) of this section) potentially affected by the outage and 
the number of administrative numbers (defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section) potentially affected by the outage. ``Assigned telephone number 
minutes'' can alternatively be calculated as the mathematical result of 
multiplying the duration of an outage, expressed in minutes, by the 
number of working telephone numbers potentially affected by the outage, 
where working telephone numbers are defined as the telephone numbers, 
including DID numbers, working immediately prior to the outage.
    (d) DS3 minutes are defined as the mathematical result of 
multiplying the duration of an outage, expressed in minutes, by the 
number of previously operating DS3 circuits that were affected by the 
outage.
    (e) User minutes are defined as:
    (1) Assigned telephone number minutes (as defined in paragraph (c) 
of this section), for telephony and for those paging networks in which 
each individual user is assigned a telephone number;
    (2) The mathematical result of multiplying the duration of an 
outage, expressed in minutes, by the number of end users potentially 
affected by the outage, for all other forms of communications.
    (f) Working telephone numbers are defined to be the sum of all 
telephone numbers that can originate, or terminate telecommunications. 
This includes, for example, all working telephone numbers on the 
customer's side of a PBX, or Centrex, or similar arrangement.


<R05>
Sec. 4.9  Outage reporting requirements--threshold criteria.

    (a) Cable. All cable communications providers shall submit 
electronically a Notification to the Commission within 120 minutes of 
discovering that they have experienced on any facilities that they own, 
operate, lease, or otherwise utilize, an outage of at least 30 minutes 
duration that:
    (1) Potentially affects at least 900,000 user minutes of telephony 
service;
    (2) Affects at least 1,350 DS3 minutes;
    (3) Potentially affects any special offices and facilities (in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Sec. 4.5); or
    (4) Potentially affects a 911 special facility (as defined in 
paragraph (e) of Sec. 4.5), in which case they also shall notify, as 
soon as possible by telephone or other electronic means, any official 
who has been designated by the management of the affected 911 facility 
as the provider's contact person for communications outages at that 
facility, and they shall convey to that person all available information 
that may be useful to the management of the affected facility in 
mitigating the effects of the outage on callers to that facility. (DS3 
minutes and user minutes are defined in paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec. 
4.7.) Not later than 72 hours after discovering the outage, the provider 
shall submit electronically an Initial Communications Outage Report to 
the Commission. Not later than thirty days after discovering the outage, 
the provider shall submit electronically a Final Communications Outage 
Report to the Commission. The Notification and the Initial and Final 
reports shall comply with all of the requirements of Sec. 4.11.
    (b) IXC or LEC tandem facilities. In the case of IXC or LEC tandem 
facilities, providers must, if technically possible,

[[Page 679]]

use real-time blocked calls to determine whether criteria for reporting 
an outage have been reached. Providers must report IXC and LEC tandem 
outages of at least 30 minutes duration in which at least 90,000 calls 
are blocked or at least 1,350 DS3-minutes are lost. For interoffice 
facilities which handle traffic in both directions and for which blocked 
call information is available in one direction only, the total number of 
blocked calls shall be estimated as twice the number of blocked calls 
determined for the available direction. Providers may use historic 
carried call load data for the same day(s) of the week and the same 
time(s) of day as the outage, and for a time interval not older than 90 
days preceding the onset of the outage, to estimate blocked calls 
whenever it is not possible to obtain real-time blocked call counts. 
When using historic data, providers must report incidents where at least 
30,000 calls would have been carried during a time interval with the 
same duration of the outage. (DS3 minutes are defined in paragraph (d) 
of Sec. 4.7.) In situations where, for whatever reason, real-time and 
historic carried call load data are unavailable to the provider, even 
after a detailed investigation, the provider must determine the carried 
call load based on data obtained in the time interval between the onset 
of the outage and the due date for the final report; this data must 
cover the same day of the week, the same time of day, and the same 
duration as the outage. Justification that such data accurately 
estimates the traffic that would have been carried at the time of the 
outage had the outage not occurred must be available on request. If 
carried call load data cannot be obtained through any of the methods 
described, for whatever reason, then the provider shall report the 
outage.
    (c) Satellite. (1) All satellite operators shall submit 
electronically a Notification to the Commission within 120 minutes of 
discovering that they have experienced on any facilities that they own, 
operate, lease, or otherwise utilize, of an outage of at least 30 
minutes duration that manifests itself as a failure of any of the 
following key system elements: One or more satellite transponders, 
satellite beams, inter-satellite links, or entire satellites. In 
addition, all Mobile-Satellite Service (``MSS'') satellite operators 
shall submit electronically a Notification to the Commission within 120 
minutes of discovering that they have experienced on any facilities that 
they own, operate, lease, or otherwise utilize, of an outage of at least 
30 minutes duration that manifests itself as a failure of any gateway 
earth station, except in the case where other earth stations at the 
gateway location are used to continue gateway operations within 30 
minutes of the onset of the failure.
    (2) All satellite communications providers shall submit 
electronically a Notification to the Commission within 120 minutes of 
discovering that they have experienced on any facilities that they own, 
operate, lease, or otherwise utilize, an outage of at least 30 minutes 
duration that manifests itself as:
    (i) A loss of complete accessibility to at least one satellite or 
transponder;
    (ii) A loss of a satellite communications link that potentially 
affects at least 900,000 user-minutes (as defined in Sec. 4.7(d)) of 
either telephony service or paging service;
    (iii) Potentially affecting any special offices and facilities (in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Sec. 4.5) other than 
airports; or
    (iv) Potentially affecting a 911 special facility (as defined in (e) 
of Sec. 4.5), in which case they also shall notify, as soon as possible 
by telephone or other electronic means, any official who has been 
designated by the management of the affected 911 facility as the 
provider's contact person for communications outages at that facility, 
and they shall convey to that person all available information that may 
be useful to the management of the affected facility in mitigating the 
effects of the outage on callers to that facility.
    (3) Not later than 72 hours after discovering the outage, the 
operator and/or provider shall submit electronically an Initial 
Communications Outage Report to the Commission. Not later than thirty 
days after discovering the outage, the operator and/or provider shall 
submit electronically a Final Communications Outage Report to the 
Commission.

[[Page 680]]

    (4) The Notification and the Initial and Final reports shall comply 
with all of the requirements of Sec. 4.11.
    (5) Excluded from these outage-reporting requirements are those 
satellites, satellite beams, inter-satellite links, MSS gateway earth 
stations, satellite networks, and transponders that are used exclusively 
for intra-corporate or intra-organizational private telecommunications 
networks, for the one-way distribution of video or audio programming, or 
for other non-covered services (that is, when they are never used to 
carry common carrier voice or paging communications).
    (d) Signaling system 7. Signaling System 7 (SS7) providers shall 
submit electronically a Notification to the Commission within 120 
minutes of discovering that they have experienced on any facilities that 
they own, operate, lease, or otherwise utilize an outage of at least 30 
minutes duration that is manifested as the generation of at least 90,000 
blocked calls based on real-time traffic data or at least 30,000 lost 
calls based on historic carried loads. In cases where a third-party SS7 
provider cannot directly estimate the number of blocked calls, the 
third-party SS7 provider shall use 500,000 real-time lost MTP messages 
as a surrogate for 90,000 real-time blocked calls, or 167,000 lost MTP 
messages on a historical basis as a surrogate for 30,000 lost calls 
based on historic carried loads. Historic carried load data or the 
number of lost MTP messages on a historical basis shall be for the same 
day(s) of the week and the same time(s) of day as the outage, and for a 
time interval not older than 90 days preceding the onset of the outage. 
In situations where, for whatever reason, real-time and historic data 
are unavailable to the provider, even after a detailed investigation, 
the provider must determine the carried load based on data obtained in 
the time interval between the onset of the outage and the due date for 
the final report; this data must cover the same day of the week and the 
same time of day as the outage. If this cannot be done, for whatever 
reason, the outage must be reported. Justification that such data 
accurately estimates the traffic that would have been carried at the 
time of the outage had the outage not occurred must be available on 
request. Finally, whenever a pair of STPs serving any communications 
provider becomes isolated from a pair of interconnected STPs that serve 
any other communications provider, for at least 30 minutes duration, 
each of these communications providers shall submit electronically a 
Notification to the Commission within 120 minutes of discovering such 
outage. Not later than 72 hours after discovering the outage, the 
provider(s) shall submit electronically an Initial Communications Outage 
Report to the Commission. Not later than thirty days after discovering 
the outage, the provider(s) shall submit electronically a Final 
Communications Outage Report to the Commission. The Notification and the 
Initial and Final reports shall comply with all of the requirements of 
Sec. 4.11.
    (e) Wireless. All wireless service providers shall submit 
electronically a Notification to the Commission within 120 minutes of 
discovering that they have experienced on any facilities that they own, 
operate, lease, or otherwise utilize, an outage of at least 30 minutes 
duration:
    (1) Of a Mobile Switching Center (MSC);
    (2) That potentially affects at least 900,000 user minutes of either 
telephony and associated data (2nd generation or lower) service or 
paging service;
    (3) That affects at least 1,350 DS3 minutes;
    (4) That potentially affects any special offices and facilities (in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Sec. 4.5) other than 
airports through direct service facility agreements; or
    (5) That potentially affects a 911 special facility (as defined in 
(e) of Sec. 4.5), in which case they also shall notify, as soon as 
possible by telephone or other electronic means, any official who has 
been designated by the management of the affected 911 facility as the 
provider's contact person for communications outages at that facility, 
and they shall convey to that person all available information that may 
be useful to the management of the affected facility in mitigating the 
effects of the outage on callers to that facility. (DS3 minutes and user 
minutes are defined

[[Page 681]]

in paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec. 4.7.) In determining the number of 
users potentially affected by a failure of a switch, a concentration 
ratio of 8 shall be applied. For providers of paging service solely, 
however, the following outage criteria shall apply instead of those in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. Notification must be 
submitted if the failure of a switch for at least 30 minutes duration 
potentially affects at least 900,000 user-minutes. Not later than 72 
hours after discovering the outage, the provider shall submit 
electronically an Initial Communications Outage Report to the 
Commission. Not later than thirty days after discovering the outage, the 
provider shall submit electronically a Final Communications Outage 
Report to the Commission. The Notification and the Initial and Final 
reports shall comply with all of the requirements of Sec. 4.11.
    (f) Wireline. All wireline communications providers shall submit 
electronically a Notification to the Commission within 120 minutes of 
discovering that they have experienced on any facilities that they own, 
operate, lease, or otherwise utilize, an outage of at least 30 minutes 
duration that:
    (1) Potentially affects at least 900,000 user minutes of either 
telephony or paging;
    (2) Affects at least 1,350 DS3 minutes;
    (3) Potentially affects any special offices and facilities (in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of Sec. 4.5); or
    (4) Potentially affects a 911 special facility (as defined in 
paragraph (e) of Sec. 4.5), in which case they also shall notify, as 
soon as possible by telephone or other electronic means, any official 
who has been designated by the management of the affected 911 facility 
as the provider's contact person for communications outages at that 
facility, and the provider shall convey to that person all available 
information that may be useful to the management of the affected 
facility in mitigating the effects of the outage on efforts to 
communicate with that facility. (DS3 minutes and user minutes are 
defined in paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec. 4.7.) Not later than 72 hours 
after discovering the outage, the provider shall submit electronically 
an Initial Communications Outage Report to the Commission. Not later 
than thirty days after discovering the outage, the provider shall submit 
electronically a Final Communications Outage Report to the Commission. 
The Notification and the Initial and Final reports shall comply with all 
of the requirements of Sec. 4.11.


<R05>
Sec. 4.11  Notification and initial and final communications outage reports that must be filed by communications providers.

    Notification and Initial and Final Communications Outage Reports 
shall be submitted by a person authorized by the communications provider 
to submit such reports to the Commission. The person submitting the 
Final report to the Commission shall also be authorized by the provider 
to legally bind the provider to the truth, completeness, and accuracy of 
the information contained in the report. Each Final report shall be 
attested by the person submitting the report that he/she has read the 
report prior to submitting it and on oath deposes and states that the 
information contained therein is true, correct, and accurate to the best 
of his/her knowledge and belief and that the communications provider on 
oath deposes and states that this information is true, complete, and 
accurate. The Notification shall provide: The name of the reporting 
entity; the date and time of onset of the outage; a brief description of 
the problem; service effects; the geographic area affected by the 
outage; and a contact name and contact telephone number by which the 
Commission's technical staff may contact the reporting entity. The 
Initial and Final Reports shall contain the information required in this 
part 4. The Initial report shall contain all pertinent information then 
available on the outage and shall be submitted in good faith. The Final 
report shall contain all pertinent information on the outage, including 
any information that was not contained in, or that has changed from that 
provided in, the Initial report. The Notification and the Initial and 
Final Communications Outage Reports are to be submitted electronically 
to the Commission. ``Submitted electronically'' refers to submission of 
the information using Commission-approved

[[Page 682]]

Web-based outage report templates. If there are technical impediments to 
using the Web-based system during the Notification stage, then a written 
Notification to the Commission by e-mail, FAX, or courier may be used; 
such Notification shall contain the information required. All hand-
delivered Notifications and Initial and Final Communications Outage 
Reports, shall be addressed to the Federal Communications Commission, 
The Office of Secretary, Attention: Chief, Public Safety & Homeland 
Security Bureau. Electronic filing shall be effectuated in accordance 
with procedures that are specified by the Commission by public notice.

[71 FR 69037, Nov. 29, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 4.13  Reports by the National Communications System (NCS) and by special 

offices and facilities, and related responsibilities of communications providers.

    Reports by the National Communications System (NCS) and by special 
offices and facilities (other than 911 special offices and facilities) 
of outages potentially affecting them (see paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
Sec. 4.5) shall be made according to the following procedures:
    (a) When there is a mission-affecting outage, the affected facility 
will report the outage to the NCS and call the communications provider 
in order to determine if the outage is expected to last 30 minutes. If 
the outage is not expected to, and does not, last 30 minutes, it will 
not be reported to the Commission. If it is expected to last 30 minutes 
or does last 30 minutes, the NCS, on the advice of the affected special 
facility and in the exercise of its judgment, will either:
    (1) Forward a report of the outage to the Commission, supplying the 
information for initial reports affecting special facilities specified 
in this section of the Commission's Rules;
    (2) Forward a report of the outage to the Commission, designating 
the outage as one affecting ``special facilities,'' but reporting it at 
a level of detail that precludes identification of the particular 
facility involved; or
    (3) Hold the report at the NCS due to the critical nature of the 
application.
    (b) If there is to be a report to the Commission, an electronic, 
written, or oral report will be given by the NCS within 120 minutes of 
an outage to the Commission's Duty Officer, on duty 24 hours a day in 
the FCC's Communications and Crisis Management Center in Washington, DC. 
Notification may be served at such other facility designated by the 
Commission by public notice or (at the time of the emergency) by public 
announcement only if there is a telephone outage or similar emergency in 
Washington, DC. If the report is oral, it is to be followed by an 
electronic or written report not later than the next business day. Those 
providers whose service failures are in any way responsible for the 
outage must consult and cooperate in good faith with NCS upon its 
request for information.
    (c) Additionally, if there is to be a report to the Commission, the 
communications provider will provide a written report to the NCS, 
supplying the information for final reports for special facilities 
required by this section of the Commission's rules. The communications 
provider's final report to the NCS will be filed within 28 days after 
the outage, allowing the NCS to then file the report with the Commission 
within 30 days after the outage. If the outage is reportable as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, and the NCS determines that 
the final report can be presented to the Commission without jeopardizing 
matters of national security or emergency preparedness, the NCS will 
forward the report as provided in either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of 
this section to the Commission.

Sec. 5.59  Forms to be used.

    (a) Application for experimental radio license. Entities requesting 
an experimental authorization must submit FCC Form 442 (application). A 
single FCC Form 442 may be used for several radio components of an 
experimental program, however, unrelated experimental programs should be 
filed on separate applications.
    (b) Application for modification of experimental license. An 
application for modification of experimental authorization shall be 
submitted on FCC Form 442. A blanket application may be submitted for 
modification of a group of authorizations of the same class as long as 
the scope of the modifications are specified in the application. The 
individual authorizations covered by such an application shall be 
clearly identified therein. However, application for modification to 
change location of an experimental authorization shall be filed as a 
separate application.
    (c) Application for renewal of experimental authorization. 
Application for renewal of station license shall be submitted on FCC 
Form 405. A blanket application may be submitted for renewal of a group 
of station licenses in the same class in those cases in which the 
renewal requested is in exact accordance with the terms of the existing 
authorizations. The individual stations covered by such applications 
shall be clearly identified thereon. Unless otherwise directed by the 
Commission, each application for renewal of license shall be filed at 
least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the license to be renewed.
    (d) Application for consent to assign an experimental authorization. 
Application on FCC Form 702 shall be submitted when the legal right to 
control the use and operation of a station is to be transferred as a 
result of a voluntary act (contract or other agreement) or an 
involuntary act (death or legal disability) of the grantee of a station 
authorization or by involuntary assignment of the physical property 
constituting the station under a court decree in bankruptcy proceedings, 
or other court order, or by operation of law in any other manner. Such 
application must be accompanied by the FCC Form 442 of which only the 
certification need be signed by the proposed assignee. No other 
information is required to be submitted on this form.
    (e) Application for consent to transfer control of Corporation 
holding experimental authorization. Application for consent to transfer 
control shall be submitted on FCC Form 703 whenever it is proposed to 
change the control of a corporation holding a station authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 5.61  Procedure for obtaining a special temporary authorization.

    (a) The Commission may issue a special temporary authorization under 
this part in cases in which a need is shown for operation of a station 
for six months or less, provided such operation is not in conflict with 
the Commission's rules in this part. In cases in which an applicant sets 
forth compelling reasons why a special temporary authorization must be 
granted expeditiously, preference will be given to processing the 
application.
    (b) Extensions of a special temporary authorization will be granted 
provided that an application for a regular experimental license has been 
filed at least 15 days prior to the expiration of the licensee's 
temporary authority. When such an application is timely filed, 
operations may continue in accordance with the other terms and 
conditions of the temporary authority pending disposition of the 
application, unless the applicant is notified otherwise by the 
Commission.
    (c) An application for special temporary authorization shall be 
filed electronically through the Office of Engineering and Technology 
Web site https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/cf/els/index.cfm effective 
January 1, 2004 and shall contain the following information:
    (1) Name, address, phone number (also e-mail address and facsimile 
number, if available) of the applicant.
    (2) Description of why an STA is needed.

[[Page 687]]

    (3) Description of the operation to be conducted and its purpose.
    (4) Time and dates of proposed operation.
    (5) Class(es) of station (fixed, mobile, fixed and mobile) and call 
sign of station (if applicable).
    (6) Description of the location(s) and, if applicable, geographical 
coordinates of the proposed operation.
    (7) Equipment to be used, including name of manufacturer, model and 
number of units.
    (8) Frequency(ies) desired.
    (9) Maximum effective radiated power (ERP) or equivalent 
isotrophically radiated power (EIRP).
    (10) Emission designator (see Sec. 2.201 of this chapter) or 
describe emission (bandwidth, modulation, etc.)
    (11) Overall height of antenna structure above the ground (if 
greater than 6 meters above the ground or an existing structure, see 
part 17 of this Chapter concerning notification to the FAA).

FR 59336, Oct. 15, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 5.63  Supplementary statements required.

    (a) Each applicant for an authorization in the Experimental Radio 
Service must enclose with the application a narrative statement 
describing in detail the program of research and experimentation 
proposed, the specific objectives sought to be accomplished; and how the 
program of experimentation has a reasonable promise of contribution to 
the development, extension, or expansion, or utilization of the radio 
art, or is along lines not already investigated. An applicant may 
request non-disclosure of proprietary information submitted under this 
part. These requests should follow the procedures for submission set 
forth in Sec. 0.459 of this chapter.
    (b) If the authorization is to be used for the purpose of fulfilling 
the requirements of a contract with an agency of the United States 
Government, the applicant shall submit a narrative statement describing 
the project, the name of the contracting agency, and the contract 
number.
    (c) If the authorization is to be used for the sole purpose of 
developing equipment for exportation to be employed by stations under 
the jurisdiction of a foreign government, the applicant shall submit a 
narrative statement describing the project, any associated contract 
number, and the name of the foreign government concerned.
    (d) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be 
applicable to applications for an authorization in the Experimental 
Radio Service to be used for communications essential to a research 
project in which other means of communications are inadequate or not 
available. In such cases, applicants shall include as part of the 
application for an authorization the following:
    (1) A description of the nature of the research project being 
conducted.
    (2) A showing that communications facilities are necessary for the 
research project involved.
    (3) A showing that existing communications facilities are inadequate 
or unavailable.
    (e) Except where the satellite system has already been authorized by 
the FCC, applicants for an experimental authorization involving a 
satellite system must submit a description of the design and operational 
strategies the satellite system will use to mitigate orbital debris, 
including the following information:
    (1) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and 
limited the amount of debris released in a planned manner during normal 
operations, and has assessed and limited the probability of the space 
station becoming a source of debris by collisions with small debris or 
meteoroids that could cause loss of control and prevent post-mission 
disposal;
    (2) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and 
limited the probability of accidental explosions during and after 
completion of mission operations. This statement must include a 
demonstration that debris generation will not result from the conversion 
of energy sources on board the spacecraft into energy that fragments the 
spacecraft. Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic 
energy. This demonstration should address whether stored energy will be 
removed

[[Page 688]]

at the spacecraft's end of life, by depleting residual fuel and leaving 
all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system, leaving all 
batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any remaining 
source of stored energy, or through other equivalent procedures 
specifically disclosed in the application;
    (3) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and 
limited the probability of the space station becoming a source of debris 
by collisions with large debris or other operational space stations. 
Where a space station will be launched into a low-Earth orbit that is 
identical, or very similar, to an orbit used by other space stations, 
the statement must include an analysis of the potential risk of 
collision and a description of what measures the space station operator 
plans to take to avoid in-orbit collisions. If the space station 
operator is relying on coordination with another system, the statement 
must indicate what steps have been taken to contact, and ascertain the 
likelihood of successful coordination of physical operations with, the 
other system. The statement must disclose the accuracy--if any--with 
which orbital parameters of non-geostationary satellite orbit space 
stations will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and 
the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system 
is not able to maintain orbital tolerances, i.e., it lacks a propulsion 
system for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the 
debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the 
anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite 
or satellites. Where a space station requests the assignment of a 
geostationary-Earth orbit location, it must assess whether there are any 
known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at, 
the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that 
location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective 
satellites might overlap. If so, the statement must include a statement 
as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be 
taken to prevent collisions;
    (4) A statement detailing the post-mission disposal plans for the 
space station at end of life, including the quantity of fuel--if any--
that will be reserved for post-mission disposal maneuvers. For 
geostationary-Earth orbit space stations, the statement must disclose 
the altitude selected for a post-mission disposal orbit and the 
calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude. The 
statement must also include a casualty risk assessment if planned post-
mission disposal involves atmospheric re-entry of the space station. In 
general, an assessment should include an estimate as to whether portions 
of the spacecraft will survive re-entry and reach the surface of the 
Earth, as well as an estimate of the resulting probability of human 
casualty.

<R05>
Sec. 5.65  Defective applications.

    (a) Applications that are defective with respect to completeness of 
answers to required questions, execution or other matters of a purely 
formal character may not be received for filing by the Commission, and 
may be returned to the applicant with a brief statement as to the 
omissions.
    (b) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any 
documents or information not included in the prescribed application 
form, a failure to comply with such request will constitute a defect in 
the application.
    (c) Applications that are not in accordance with the Commission's 
rules, regulations, or other requirements will be considered defective 
unless accompanied either by:
    (1) a petition to amend any rule, regulation, or requirement with 
which the application is in conflict; or
    (2) a request of the applicant for waiver of, or an exception to, 
any rule, regulation, or requirement with which the application is in 
conflict. Such request shall show the nature of the waiver or exception 
desired and set forth the reasons in support thereof.

[[Page 689]]


<R05>
Sec. 5.67  Amendment or dismissal of applications.

    (a) Any application may be amended or dismissed without prejudice 
upon request of the applicant prior to the time the application is 
granted. Each amendment to, or request for dismissal of an application 
shall be signed, authenticated, and submitted in the same manner and 
with the same number of copies as required for the original application. 
All subsequent correspondence or other material that the applicant 
desires to have incorporated as a part of an application already filed 
shall be submitted in the form of an amendment to the application.
    (b) Failure to prosecute an application, or failure to respond to 
official correspondence or request for additional information, will be 
cause for dismissal. Such dismissal will be without prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 5.69  Partial grants.

    In cases in which the Commission grants an application in part, or 
with any privileges, terms, or conditions other than those requested, or 
subject to any interference that may result to a station if designated 
application or applications are subsequently granted, the action of the 
Commission shall be considered as a grant of such application unless the 
applicant shall, within 30 days from the date on which such grant is 
made or from its effective date if a later date is specified, file with 
the Commission a written request rejecting the grant as made. Upon 
receipt of such request, the Commission will coordinate with the 
applicant in an attempt to resolve problems arising from the grant.


<R05>
Sec. 5.71  License period.

    (a) The regular license period for stations in the Experimental 
Radio Service is either 2 or 5 years. An applicant desiring to apply for 
a 5-year license must provide justification for its need for a license 
of that duration. A license may be renewed upon an adequate showing of 
need.
    (b) A license will not be granted for a period longer than that 
which is required for completion of the experimental project. If such 
period is estimated to be less than 2 years, or between 2-5 years, a 
statement to that effect by the applicant may facilitate grant of the 
application. See also Sec. 5.69 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.73  Experimental report.

    (a) Unless specifically stated as a condition of the authorization, 
licensees are not required to file a report on the results of the 
experimental program carried on under this subpart.
    (b) The Commission may, as a condition of authorization, request the 
licensee to forward periodic reports in order to evaluate the progress 
of the experimental program.
    (c) An applicant may request that the Commission withhold from the 
public certain reports and associated material and the Commission will 
do so unless the public interest requires otherwise. These requests 
should follow the procedures for submission set forth in Sec. 0.459 of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 5.75  Number of licenses required.

    An application for a station embracing widely divergent and 
unrelated experimentations will normally require a separate license for 
each experiment. However, if the experiments are related or conducted by 
the same manufacturer, an applicant may apply for a blanket license 
encompassing the entire experimental program. If a blanket license is 
granted, licensees will be required to notify the Commission of the 
specific details of each individual experiment, including location, 
number of base and mobile units, power, emission designator, and any 
other pertinent technical information not specified by the blanket 
license.


<R05>
Sec. 5.77  Change in equipment and emission characteristics.

    (a) A change may be made in a licensed transmitter without specific 
authorization from the Commission provided that the change does not 
result in operations inconsistent with any term of the outstanding 
authorization for the station involved.
    (b) Discrete changes in emission characteristics may be made without 
specific authorization from the Commission provided that the Commission 
is given written notification demonstrating that such changes will not

[[Page 690]]

exceed the maximum emissions envelope established in the existing 
authorization. Changes made pursuant to such notification that become a 
permanent part of the licensee's experimental program must be listed in 
the licensee's next application for renewal.
    (c) Prior authorization from the Commission is required before the 
following antenna changes may be made at a station at a fixed location:
    (1) Any change that will either increase the height of a structure 
supporting the radiating portion of the antenna or decrease the height 
of a lighted antenna structure.
    (2) Any change in the location of an antenna when such relocation 
involves a change in the geographic coordinates of latitude or longitude 
by as much as one second, or when such relocation involves a change in 
street address.


<R05>
Sec. 5.79  Transfer and assignment of station authorization.

    A station authorization, the frequencies authorized to be used by 
the grantee of such authorization, and the rights therein granted by 
such authorization shall not be transferred, assigned, or in any manner 
either voluntarily or involuntarily disposed of, unless the Commission 
shall, after securing full information, decide that such a transfer is 
in the public interest and give its consent in writing. Requests for 
authority to transfer or assign a station authorization shall be 
submitted on the forms prescribed by Sec. 5.59 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.81  Discontinuance of station operation.

    In case of permanent discontinuance of operation of a fixed or land 
station in the Experimental Radio Service, or in case of permanent 
discontinuance of operation of all transmitter units listed in the 
license for a mobile station in the Experimental Radio Service, the 
licensee shall forward the station license to the Commission's Office of 
Engineering and Technology for cancellation.


<R05>
Sec. 5.83  Cancellation provisions.

    The applicant for a station in the Experimental Radio Services 
accepts the license with the express understanding: (a) that the 
authority to use the frequency or frequencies assigned is granted upon 
an experimental basis only and does not confer any right to conduct an 
activity of a continuing nature; and
    (b) that said grant is subject to change or cancellation by the 
Commission at any time without hearing if in its discretion the need for 
such action arises. However, a petition for reconsideration or 
application for review may be filed to such Commission action.


<R05>
Sec. 5.85  Frequencies and policy governing their assignment.

    (a) Stations operating in the Experimental Radio Service may be 
authorized to use any government or non-government frequency designated 
in the Table of Frequency Allocations set forth in part 2 of this 
chapter, provided that the need for the frequency requested is fully 
justified by the applicant.
    (b) Each frequency or band of frequencies available for assignment 
to stations in the Experimental Radio Service is available on a shared 
basis only, and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any one 
applicant, and such use may also be restricted to one or more specified 
geographical areas. Not more than one frequency in a band of frequencies 
will normally be assigned for the use of a single applicant unless a 
showing is made demonstrating that need for the assignment of additional 
frequencies is essential to the proposed program of experimentation.
    (c) Frequency assignments will be made only on the condition that 
harmful interference will not be caused to any station operating in 
accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocation of part 2 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Use of Public Safety Frequencies. Applicants in the Experimental 
Radio Service must avoid use of public safety frequencies except when a 
compelling showing can be made that use of such frequencies is in the 
public interest. Public safety frequencies are identified in subpart B 
(Public Safety Radio Services) and subpart C (Special Emergency Radio 
Service) of part 90 of this Chapter. In addition, subpart S of part 90 
of

[[Page 691]]

this chapter contains rules for the assignment of frequencies that may 
be used by Public Safety Radio Services in the 806-824 MHz and 851-869 
MHz bands. If an experimental license to use public safety radio 
frequencies is granted, the authorization will be conditioned to require 
coordination between the experimental licensee and the appropriate 
frequency coordinator and/or all of the public safety licensees in its 
intended area of operation.
    (e) The Commission may, at its discretion, condition any 
experimental license or STA on the requirement that before commencing 
operation, the new licensee coordinate its proposed facility with other 
licensees that may receive interference as a result of the new 
licensee's operations.
    (f) Protection of FCC monitoring stations. (1) Applicants are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need 
to protect FCC monitoring stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of such stations are listed in Sec. 0.121(b) 
of this chapter. Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that 
will produce on any frequency a direct wave fundamental field strength 
of greater than 10 mV/m in the authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 
dBW/m\2\ power flux density assuming a free space characteristic 
impedance of 120[pi] ohms) at the referenced coordinates, may be 
examined to determine the extent of possible interference. Depending on 
the theoretical field strength value or other ambient radio field signal 
levels at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring 
station may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field strength 
exceeds 10 mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m\2\) at the reference coordinates, or if 
there is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the 
threshold value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any 
protection necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may 
communicate with the Technology Division, Compliance and Information 
Bureau, telephone (202) 418-1210, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC 20554.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data that indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iii) Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station.
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of this Chapter and also meets the criteria outlined in 
paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Commission.

in authorizations issued under this section:

27.23-27.28 MHz.
460-461 MHz.
462.525-467.475 MHz.
2402-2483.5 MHz.
10.00-10.50 GHz.

    (c) Operations under this section are limited to 4 watts equivalent 
isotropically radiated power (EIRP). The Commission may authorize a 
greater power if a satisfactory showing is made that such greater power 
is necessary and that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent 
interference.
    (d) The frequency of operation must be measured or checked prior to 
each time of operation.
    (e) Subject to the provisions of (b), (c) and (d), the provisions in 
subpart C of this part are waived insofar as such provisions require a 
station authorized under this section to observe the technical and 
operating restrictions set forth therein.
    (f) The licensee holding an authorization issued under this section 
shall maintain a record of operation containing the following 
information:
    (1) A brief description of the experimentation being conducted.
    (2) The date and time of each period of operation.
    (3) The frequency of operation as measured or checked at the 
beginning of each period of operation.
    (g) The record of operation shall be retained for one month after 
the termination of the authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 7.20  Review and disposition of informal complaints.

    (a) Where it appears from the defendant's answer, or from other 
communications with the parties, that an informal complaint has been 
satisfied, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider the informal 
complaint closed, without response to the complainant or defendant. In 
all other cases, the Commission shall inform the parties of its review 
and disposition of a complaint filed under this subpart. Where 
practicable, this information, the nature of which is specified in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, shall be transmitted to the 
complainant and defendant in the manner requested by the complainant, 
(e.g., letter, facsimile transmission, telephone (voice/TRS/TTY), 
Internet e-mail, ASCII text, audio-cassette recording, or braille).
    (b) In the event the Commission determines, based on a review of the 
information provided in the informal complaint and the defendant's 
answer thereto, that no further action is required by the Commission 
with respect

[[Page 707]]

to the allegations contained in the informal complaint, the informal 
complaint shall be closed and the complainant and defendant shall be 
duly informed of the reasons therefor. A complainant unsatisfied with 
the defendant's response to the informal complaint and the staff 
decision to terminate action on the informal complaint may file a formal 
complaint with the Commission, as specified in Sec. 7.22 of this 
subpart.
    (c) In the event the Commission determines, based on a review of the 
information presented in the informal complaint and the defendant's 
answer thereto, that a material and substantial question remains as to 
the defendant's compliance with the requirements of this subpart, the 
Commission may conduct such further investigation or such further 
proceedings as may be necessary to determine the defendant's compliance 
with the requirements of this subpart and to determine what, if any, 
remedial actions and/or sanctions are warranted.
    (d) In the event that the Commission determines, based on a review 
of the information presented in the informal complaint and the 
defendant's answer thereto, that the defendant has failed to comply with 
or is presently not in compliance with the requirements of this subpart, 
the Commission may order or prescribe such remedial actions and/or 
sanctions as are authorized under the Act and the Commission's rules and 
which are deemed by the Commission to be appropriate under the facts and 
circumstances of the case.

requirements under Sec. Sec. 1.720 through 1.736 for good cause shown; 
provided, however, that such waiver authority may not be exercised in a 
manner that relieves, or has the effect of relieving, a complainant of 
the obligation under Sec. Sec. 1.720 and 1.728 of this chapter to 
allege facts which, if true, are sufficient to constitute a violation or 
violations of section 255 of the Act or this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 7.22  Formal complaints based on unsatisfied informal complaints.

    A formal complaint filing based on an unsatisfied informal complaint

ninety days from the date that the Commission notifies the complainant 
of its disposition of the informal complaint and based on the same 
operative facts as those alleged in the informal complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 7.23  Actions by the Commission on its own motion.

    The Commission may on its own motion conduct such inquiries and hold 
such proceedings as it may deem necessary to enforce the requirements of 
this part and Section 255 of the Communications Act. The procedures to 
be followed by the Commission shall, unless specifically prescribed in

Sec. 9.3  Definitions.

    ANI. Automatic Number Identification, as such term is defined in 
Sec. 20.3 of this chapter.
    Appropriate local emergency authority. An emergency answering point 
that has not been officially designated as a Public Safety Answering 
Point (PSAP), but has the capability of receiving 911 calls and either 
dispatching emergency services personnel or, if necessary, relaying the 
call to another emergency service provider. An appropriate local 
emergency authority may include, but is not limited to, an existing 
local law enforcement authority, such as the police, county sheriff, 
local emergency medical services provider, or fire department.
    Automatic Location Information (ALI). Information transmitted while 
providing E911 service that permits emergency service providers to 
identify the geographic location of the calling party.
    CMRS. Commercial Mobile Radio Service, as defined in Sec. 20.9 of 
this chapter.
    Interconnected VoIP service. An interconnected Voice over Internet 
protocol (VoIP) service is a service that:
    (1) Enables real-time, two-way voice communications;
    (2) Requires a broadband connection from the user's location;
    (3) Requires Internet protocol-compatible customer premises 
equipment (CPE); and
    (4) Permits users generally to receive calls that originate on the 
public switched telephone network and to terminate calls to the public 
switched telephone network.
    PSAP. Public Safety Answering Point, as such term is defined in 
Sec. 20.3 of this chapter.
    Pseudo Automatic Number Identification (Pseudo-ANI). A number, 
consisting of the same number of digits as ANI, that is not a North 
American Numbering Plan telephone directory number and may be used in 
place of an ANI to convey special meaning. The special meaning assigned 
to the pseudo-ANI is determined by agreements, as necessary, between the 
system originating the call, intermediate systems handling and routing 
the call, and the destination system.
    Registered Location. The most recent information obtained by an 
interconnected VoIP service provider that identifies the physical 
location of an end user.
    Statewide default answering point. An emergency answering point 
designated by the State to receive 911 calls for either the entire State 
or those portions of the State not otherwise served by a local PSAP.
    Wireline E911 Network. A dedicated wireline network that:
    (1) Is interconnected with but largely separate from the public 
switched telephone network;
    (2) Includes a selective router; and
    (3) Is utilized to route emergency calls and related information to 
PSAPs, designated statewide default answering points, appropriate local 
emergency authorities or other emergency answering points.

<R05>
Sec. 9.5  E911 Service.

    (a) Scope of Section. The following requirements are only applicable 
to providers of interconnected VoIP services. Further, the following 
requirements apply only to 911 calls placed by users whose Registered 
Location is in a geographic area served by a Wireline E911 Network 
(which, as defined in Sec. 9.3, includes a selective router).
    (b) E911 Service. As of November 28, 2005:
    (1) Interconnected VoIP service providers must, as a condition of 
providing service to a consumer, provide that consumer with E911 service 
as described in this section;
    (2) Interconnected VoIP service providers must transmit all 911 
calls, as well as ANI and the caller's Registered Location for each 
call, to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or 
appropriate local emergency

[[Page 709]]

authority that serves the caller's Registered Location and that has been 
designated for telecommunications carriers pursuant to Sec. 64.3001 of 
this chapter, provided that ``all 911 calls'' is defined as ``any voice 
communication initiated by an interconnected VoIP user dialing 911;''
    (3) All 911 calls must be routed through the use of ANI and, if 
necessary, pseudo-ANI, via the dedicated Wireline E911 Network; and
    (4) The Registered Location must be available to the appropriate 
PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local 
emergency authority from or through the appropriate automatic location 
information (ALI) database.
    (c) Service Level Obligation. Notwithstanding the provisions in 
paragraph (b) of this section, if a PSAP, designated statewide default 
answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority is not capable 
of receiving and processing either ANI or location information, an 
interconnected VoIP service provider need not provide such ANI or 
location information; however, nothing in this paragraph affects the 
obligation under paragraph (b) of this section of an interconnected VoIP 
service provider to transmit via the Wireline E911 Network all 911 calls 
to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or 
appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller's 
Registered Location and that has been designated for telecommunications 
carriers pursuant to Sec. 64.3001 of this chapter.
    (d) Registered Location Requirement. As of November 28, 2005, 
interconnected VoIP service providers must:
    (1) Obtain from each customer, prior to the initiation of service, 
the physical location at which the service will first be utilized; and
    (2) Provide their end users one or more methods of updating their 
Registered Location, including at least one option that requires use 
only of the CPE necessary to access the interconnected VoIP service. Any 
method utilized must allow an end user to update the Registered Location 
at will and in a timely manner.
    (e) Customer Notification. Each interconnected VoIP service provider 
shall:
    (1) Specifically advise every subscriber, both new and existing, 
prominently and in plain language, of the circumstances under which E911 
service may not be available through the interconnected VoIP service or 
may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional E911 service. 
Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, relocation of the 
end user's IP-compatible CPE, use by the end user of a non-native 
telephone number, broadband connection failure, loss of electrical 
power, and delays that may occur in making a Registered Location 
available in or through the ALI database;
    (2) Obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgement by every 
subscriber, both new and existing, of having received and understood the 
advisory described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and
    (3) Distribute to its existing subscribers warning stickers or other 
appropriate labels warning subscribers if E911 service may be limited or 
not available and instructing the subscriber to place them on or near 
the equipment used in conjunction with the interconnected VoIP service. 
Each interconnected VoIP provider shall distribute such warning stickers 
or other appropriate labels to each new subscriber prior to the 
initiation of that subscriber's service.
    (f) Compliance Letter. All interconnected VoIP providers must submit 
a letter to the Commission detailing their compliance with this section 
no later than November 28, 2005.

    (1) If the owner or controller makes the requested capability 
available to a CMRS provider, the owner or controller must make that 
capability available to the interconnected VoIP provider. An owner or 
controller makes

[[Page 710]]

a capability available to a CMRS provider if the owner or controller 
offers that capability to any CMRS provider.
    (2) If the owner or controller does not make the requested 
capability available to a CMRS provider within the meaning of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, the owner or controller must make that 
capability available to a requesting interconnected VoIP provider only 
if that capability is necessary to enable the interconnected VoIP 
provider to provide 911 or E911 service in compliance with the 
Commission's rules.
    (b) Rates, terms, and conditions. The rates, terms, and conditions 
on which a capability is provided to an interconnected VoIP provider 
under paragraph (a) of this section shall be reasonable. For purposes of 
this paragraph, it is evidence that rates, terms, and conditions are 
reasonable if they are:
    (1) The same as the rates, terms, and conditions that are made 
available to CMRS providers, or
    (2) In the event such capability is not made available to CMRS 
providers, the same rates, terms, and conditions that are made available 
to any telecommunications carrier or other entity for the provision of 
911 or E911 service.
    (c) Permissible use. An interconnected VoIP provider that obtains 
access to a capability pursuant to this section may use that capability 
only for the purpose of providing 911 or E911 service in accordance with

based security mechanisms such as a

[[Page 714]]

firewall, and support the defined CMAS ``C'' interface and associated 
protocols between the Federal alert gateway and the CMS provider 
gateway.
    (d) Geographic targeting. The CMS provider gateway must determine 
whether the provider has elected to transmit an Alert Message within a 
specified alert area and, if so, map the Alert Message to an associated 
set of transmission sites.
    (e) Message management--(1) Formatting. The CMS provider gateway is 
not required to perform any formatting, reformatting, or translation of 
an Alert Message, except for transcoding a text, audio, video, or 
multimedia file into the format supported by mobile devices.
    (2) Reception. The CMS provider gateway must support a mechanism to 
stop and start Alert Message deliveries from the Federal alert gateway 
to the CMS provider gateway.
    (3) Prioritization. The CMS provider gateway must process an Alert 
Message on a first in-first out basis except for Presidential Alerts, 
which must be processed before all non-Presidential alerts.
    (4) Distribution. A Participating CMS provider must deploy one or 
more CMS provider gateways to support distribution of Alert Messages and 
to manage Alert Message traffic.
    (5) Retransmission. The CMS provider gateway must manage and execute

Sec. 10.350  CMAS testing requirements.

    This section specifies the testing that will be required, no later 
than the date of deployment of the CMAS, of CMAS components.
    (a) Required Monthly Tests. Testing of the CMAS from the Federal 
Alert Gateway to each Participating CMS Provider's infrastructure shall 
be conducted monthly.
    (1) A Participating CMS Provider's Gateway shall support the ability 
to receive a required monthly test (RMT) message initiated by the 
Federal Alert Gateway Administrator.
    (2) Participating CMS Providers shall schedule the distribution of 
the RMT to their CMAS coverage area over a 24 hour period commencing 
upon receipt of the RMT at the CMS Provider Gateway. Participating CMS 
Providers shall determine the method to distribute the RMTs, and may 
schedule over the 24 hour period the delivery of RMTs over geographic 
subsets of their coverage area to manage traffic loads and to 
accommodate maintenance windows.
    (3) A Participating CMS Provider may forego an RMT if the RMT is 
pre-empted by actual alert traffic or if an unforeseen condition in the 
CMS Provider infrastructure precludes distribution of the RMT. A 
Participating CMS Provider Gateway shall indicate such an unforeseen 
condition by a response code to the Federal Alert Gateway.
    (4) The RMT shall be initiated only by the Federal Alert Gateway 
Administrator using a defined test message. Real event codes or alert 
messages shall not be used for the CMAS RMT message.
    (5) A Participating CMS Provider shall distribute an RMT within its 
CMAS coverage area within 24 hours of receipt by the CMS Provider 
Gateway unless pre-empted by actual alert traffic or unable due to an 
unforeseen condition.
    (6) A Participating CMS Provider may provide mobile devices with the 
capability of receiving RMT messages.
    (7) A Participating CMS Provider must retain an automated log of RMT 
messages received by the CMS Provider Gateway from the Federal Alert 
Gateway.
    (b) Periodic C Interface Testing. In addition to the required 
monthly tests, a Participating CMS Provider must participate in periodic 
testing of the interface between the Federal Alert Gateway and its CMS 
Provider Gateway. This periodic interface testing is not intended to 
test the CMS Provider's infrastructure nor the mobile devices but rather 
is required to ensure the availability/viability of both gateway 
functions. Each CMS Provider Gateway shall send an acknowledgement to 
the Federal Alert Gateway upon receipt of such an interface test 
message. Real event codes or alert messages shall not be used for this 
periodic interface testing.

<R05>
Sec. 10.400  Classification.

    A Participating CMS Provider is required to receive and transmit 
three classes of Alert Messages: Presidential Alert; Imminent Threat 
Alert; and

[[Page 716]]

Child Abduction Emergency/AMBER Alert.
    (a) Presidential Alert. A Presidential Alert is an alert issued by 
the President of the United States or the President's authorized 
designee.
    (b) Imminent Threat Alert. An Imminent Threat Alert is an alert that 
meets a minimum value for each of three CAP elements: Urgency, Severity, 
and Certainty.
    (1) Urgency. The CAP Urgency element must be either Immediate (i.e., 
responsive action should be taken immediately) or Expected (i.e., 
responsive action should be taken soon, within the next hour).
    (2) Severity. The CAP Severity element must be either Extreme (i.e., 
an extraordinary threat to life or property) or Severe (i.e., a 
significant threat to life or property).
    (3) Certainty. The CAP Certainty element must be either Observed 
(i.e., determined to have occurred or to be ongoing) or Likely (i.e., 
has a probability of greater than 50 percent).
    (c) Child Abduction Emergency/AMBER Alert. (1) An AMBER Alert is an 
alert initiated by a local government official based on the U.S. 
Department of Justice's five criteria that should be met before an alert 
is activated:
    (i) Law enforcement confirms a child has been abducted;
    (ii) The child is 17 years or younger;
    (iii) Law enforcement believes the child is in imminent danger of 
serious bodily harm or death;
    (iv) There is enough descriptive information about the victim and 
the abduction to believe an immediate broadcast alert will help; and
    (v) The child's name and other data have been entered into the 
National Crime Information Center.
    (2) There are four types of AMBER Alerts: Family Abduction; Non-
family Abduction; Lost, Injured or Otherwise Missing; and Endangered 
Runaway.
    (i) Family Abduction. A Family Abduction (FA) alert involves an 
abductor who is a family member of the abducted child such as a parent, 
aunt, grandfather, or stepfather.
    (ii) Nonfamily Abduction. A Nonfamily Abduction (NFA) alert involves 
an abductor unrelated to the abducted child, either someone unknown to 
the child and/or the child's family or an acquaintance/friend of the 
child and/or the child's family.
    (iii) Lost, Injured, or Otherwise Missing. A Lost, Injured, or 
Otherwise Missing (LIM) alert involves a case where the circumstances of 
the child's disappearance are unknown.
    (iv) Endangered Runaway. An Endangered Runaway (ERU) alert involves 
a missing child who is believed to have run away and in imminent danger.


<R05>
Sec. 10.410  Prioritization.

    A Participating CMS Provider is required to transmit Presidential 
Alerts upon receipt. Presidential Alerts preempt all other Alert 
Messages. A Participating CMS Provider is required to transmit Imminent 
Threat Alerts and AMBER Alerts on a first in-first out (FIFO) basis.


<R05>
Sec. 10.420  Message elements.

    A CMAS Alert Message processed by a Participating CMS Provider shall 
include five mandatory CAP elements--Event Type; Area Affected; 
Recommended Action; Expiration Time (with time zone); and Sending

    A CMAS Alert Message processed by a Participating CMS Provider must 
not exceed 90 characters of alphanumeric text.


<R05>
Sec. 10.440  Embedded reference prohibition.

    A CMAS Alert Message processed by a Participating CMS Provider must 
not include an embedded Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is a 
reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet, or an embedded 
telephone number. This prohibition does not apply to Presidential 
Alerts.


<R05>
Sec. 10.450  Geographic targeting.

    This section establishes minimum requirements for the geographic 
targeting of Alert Messages. A Participating CMS Provider will determine 
which of its network facilities, elements, and locations will be used to 
geographically target Alert Messages. A Participating CMS Provider must

[[Page 717]]

transmit any Alert Message that is specified by a geocode, circle, or 
polygon to an area not larger than the provider's approximation of 
coverage for the Counties or County Equivalents with which that geocode, 
circle, or polygon intersects. If, however, the propagation area of a 
provider's transmission site exceeds a single County or County 
Equivalent, a Participating CMS Provider may transmit an Alert Message 
to an area not exceeding the propagation area.

Sec. 11.21  State and Local Area plans and FCC Mapbook.

    EAS plans contain guidelines which must be followed by EAS 
Participants' personnel, emergency officials, and National Weather 
Service (NWS) personnel to activate the EAS. The plans include the EAS 
header codes and messages that will be transmitted by key EAS sources 
(NP, LP, SP and SR). State and local plans contain unique methods of EAS 
message distribution such as the use of the Radio Broadcast Data System 
(RBDS). The plans must be reviewed and approved by the Chief, Public 
Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, prior to implementation to ensure 
that they are consistent with national plans, FCC regulations, and EAS 
operation.
    (a) The State plan contains procedures for State emergency 
management and other State officials, the NWS, and EAS Participants' 
personnel to transmit emergency information to the public during a State 
emergency using the EAS, including mandatory messages initiated by a 
state governor or his/her designee. The State plan must specify how 
state-level and geographically targeted EAS messages initiated by a 
state governor or his/her designee will be transmitted to all EAS 
Participants who provide services in the state, and must include 
specific and detailed information describing how such messages will be 
aggregated, designated as mandatory, and delivered to EAS Participants. 
State EAS plans should include a data table, in computer readable form, 
clearly showing

[[Page 725]]

monitoring assignments and the specific primary and backup path for the 
emergency action notification (``EAN'') from the PEP to each station in 
the plan.

<R05>
Sec. 11.31  EAS protocol.

    (a) The EAS uses a four part message for an emergency activation of 
the EAS. The four parts are: Preamble and EAS Header Codes; audio 
Attention Signal; message; and, Preamble and EAS End Of Message (EOM) 
Codes.
    (1) The Preamble and EAS Codes must use Audio Frequency Shift Keying 
at a rate of 520.83 bits per second to transmit the codes. Mark 
frequency is 2083.3 Hz and space frequency is 1562.5 Hz. Mark and space 
time must be 1.92 milliseconds. Characters are ASCII seven bit 
characters as defined in ANSI X3.4-1977 ending with an eighth null bit 
(either 0 or 1) to constitute a full eight-bit byte.
    (2) The Attention Signal must be made up of the fundamental 
frequencies of 853 and 960 Hz. The two tones must be transmitted 
simultaneously. The Attention Signal must be transmitted after the EAS 
header codes.
    (3) The message may be audio, video or text.
    (b) The ASCII dash and plus symbols are required and may not be used 
for any other purpose. Unused characters must be ASCII space characters. 
FM or TV call signs must use a slash ASCII character number 47 (/) in 
lieu of a dash.
    (c) The EAS protocol, including any codes, must not be amended, 
extended or abridged without FCC authorization. The EAS protocol and 
message format are specified in the following representation.

Examples are provided in FCC Public Notices.

[PREAMBLE]ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-(one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-(one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-(at least a one 
second pause)
(transmission of 8 to 25 seconds of Attention Signal)
(transmission of audio, video or text messages)
(at least a one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]NNNN (one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]NNNN (one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]NNNN (at least one second pause)

    [PREAMBLE] This is a consecutive string of bits (sixteen bytes of AB 
hexadecimal [8 bit byte 10101011]) sent to clear the system, set AGC and 
set asynchronous decoder clocking cycles. The preamble must be 
transmitted before each header and End Of Message code.
    ZCZC--This is the identifier, sent as ASCII characters ZCZC to 
indicate the start of ASCII code.
    ORG--This is the Originator code and indicates who originally 
initiated the activation of the EAS. These codes are specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    EEE--This is the Event code and indicates the nature of the EAS 
activation. The codes are specified in paragraph (e) of this section. 
The Event codes must be compatible with the codes used by the NWS 
Weather Radio Specific Area Message Encoder (WRSAME).
    PSSCCC--This the Location code and indicates the geographic area 
affected by the EAS alert. There may be 31 Location codes in an EAS 
alert. The Location code uses the Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) numbers as described by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
in National Institute of Standards and Technology publication FIPS PUB 
6-4. Each state is assigned an SS number as specified in paragraph (f) 
of this section. Each county and some cities are assigned a CCC number. 
A CCC number of 000 refers to an entire State or Territory. P defines 
county subdivisions as follows: 0 = all or an unspecified portion of a 
county, 1 = Northwest, 2 = North, 3 = Northeast, 4 = West, 5 = Central, 
6 = East, 7 = Southwest, 8 = South, 9 = Southeast. Other numbers may be 
designated later for special applications.

[[Page 726]]

The use of county subdivisions will probably be rare and generally for 
oddly shaped or unusually large counties. Any subdivisions must be 
defined and agreed to by the local officials prior to use.
    +TTTT--This indicates the valid time period of a message in 15 
minute segments up to one hour and then in 30 minute segments beyond one 
hour; i.e., +0015, +0030, +0045, +0100, +0430 and +0600.
    JJJHHMM--This is the day in Julian Calendar days (JJJ) of the year 
and the time in hours and minutes (HHMM) when the message was initially 
released by the originator using 24 hour Universal Coordinated Time 
(UTC).
    LLLLLLLL--This is the identification of the EAS Participant, NWS 
office, etc., transmitting or retransmitting the message. These codes 
will be automatically affixed to all outgoing messages by the EAS 
encoder.
    NNNN--This is the End of Message (EOM) code sent as a string of four 
ASCII N characters.

    (d) The only originator codes are:

Sec. 11.33  EAS Decoder.

    (a) An EAS Decoder must at a minimum be capable of decoding the EAS 
protocol described in Sec. 11.31, provide the EAS monitoring functions 
described in Sec. 11.52, and the following minimum specifications:
    (1) Inputs. Decoders must have the capability to receive at least 2 
audio inputs from EAS monitoring assignments, and one data input (RS-
232C with standard protocol and 1200 baud rate). The data input may be 
used to monitor other communications modes such as Radio Broadcast Data 
System (RBDS), NWR, satellite, public switched telephone network, or any 
other source that uses the EAS protocol.
    (2) Valid codes. There must be a means to determine if valid EAS 
header codes are received and to determine if preselected header codes 
are received.
    (3) Storage. Decoders must provide the means to:
    (i) Record and store, either internally or externally, at least two 
minutes of audio or text messages. A decoder manufactured without an 
internal means to record and store audio or text must be equipped with a 
means (such as an audio or digital jack connection) to couple to an 
external recording and storing device.
    (ii) Store at least ten preselected event and originator header 
codes, in addition to the seven mandatory event/originator codes for 
tests and national activations, and store any preselected location codes 
for comparison with incoming header codes. A non-preselected header code 
that is manually transmitted must be stored for comparison with later 
incoming header codes. The header codes of the last ten received valid 
messages which still have valid time periods must be stored for 
comparison with the incoming valid header codes for later messages. 
These last received header codes will be deleted from storage as their 
valid time periods expire.
    (4) Display and logging. A visual message shall be developed from 
any valid header codes for tests and national activations and any 
preselected header codes received. The message shall include the 
Originator, Event, Location, the valid time period of the message and 
the local time the message was transmitted. The message shall be in the 
primary language of the EAS Participant and be fully displayed on the 
decoder and readable in normal light and darkness. All existing and new 
models of EAS decoders manufactured after August 1, 2003 must provide a 
means to permit the selective display and logging of EAS messages 
containing header codes for state and local EAS events. Effective May 
16, 2002, analog radio and television broadcast stations, analog cable 
systems and wireless cable systems may upgrade their decoders on an 
optional basis to

[[Page 729]]

include a selective display and logging capability for EAS messages 
containing header codes for state and local events. EAS Participants 
that install or replace their decoders after February 1, 2004 must 
install decoders that provide a means to permit the selective display 
and logging of EAS messages containing header codes for state and local 
EAS events.
    (5) Indicators. EAS decoders must have a distinct and separate aural 
or visible means to indicate when any of the following conditions 
occurs:
    (i) Any valid EAS header codes are received as specified in Sec. 
11.33(a)(10).
    (ii) Preprogrammed header codes, such as those selected in 
accordance with Sec. 11.52(d)(2) are received.
    (iii) A signal is present at each audio input that is specified in 
Sec. 11.33(a)(1).
    (6) Program Data Retention. The program data must be retained even 
with power removed.
    (7) Outputs. Decoders shall have the following outputs: a data port 
or ports (RS-232C with standard protocol and 1200 baud rate) where 
received valid EAS header codes and received preselected header codes 
are available; one audio port that is capable of monitoring each decoder 
audio input; and, an internal speaker to enable personnel to hear audio 
from each input.
    (8) Decoder Programming. Access to decoder programming shall be 
protected by a lock or other security measures and be configured so that 
authorized personnel can readily select and program the EAS Decoder with 
preselected Originator, Event and Location codes for either manual or 
automatic operation.
    (9) Reset. There shall be a method to automatically or manually 
reset the decoder to the normal monitoring condition. Operators shall be 
able to select a time interval, not less than two minutes, in which the 
decoder would automatically reset if it received an EAS header code but 
not an end-of-message (EOM) code. Messages received with the EAN Event 
codes shall disable the reset function so that lengthy audio messages 
can be handled. The last message received with valid header codes shall 
be displayed as required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section before the 
decoder is reset.
    (10) Message Validity. An EAS Decoder must provide error detection 
and validation of the header codes of each message to ascertain if the 
message is valid. Header code comparisons may be accomplished through 
the use of a bit-by-bit compare or any other error detection and 
validation protocol. A header code must only be considered valid when 
two of the three headers match exactly. Duplicate messages must not be 
relayed automatically.
    (11) A header code with the EAN Event code specified in Sec. 
11.31(c) that is received through any of the audio inputs must override 
all other messages.
    (b) Attention Signal. EAS Decoders shall have detection and 
activation circuitry that will demute a receiver upon detection of the 
two audio tones of 853 Hz and 960 Hz. To prevent false responses, 
decoders designed to use the two tones for receiver demuting shall 
comply with the following:
    (1) Time Delay. A minimum time delay of 8 but not more than 16 
seconds of tone reception shall be incorporated into the demuting or 
activation process to insure that the tones will be audible for a period 
of at least 4 seconds. After July 1, 1995, the time delay shall be 3-4 
seconds.
    (2) Operation Bandwidth. The decoder circuitry shall not respond to 
tones which vary more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 Hz from each of the 
frequencies, 853 Hz and 960 Hz.
    (3) Reset Ability. The decoder shall have a means to manually or 
automatically reset the associated broadcast receiver to a muted state.
    (c) Decoders shall be capable of operation within the tolerances 
specified in this section as well as those in Sec. 11.32 (b), (c) and 
(d).

<R05>
Sec. 11.51  EAS code and Attention Signal Transmission requirements.

    (a) Analog and digital broadcast stations must transmit, either 
automatically or manually, national level EAS messages and required 
tests by sending the EAS header codes, Attention Signal, emergency 
message and End of Message (EOM) codes using the EAS Protocol. The 
Attention Signal must precede any emergency audio message. After January 
1, 1998, the shortened Attention Signal may only be used as an audio 
alert signal and the EAS codes will become the minimum signaling 
requirement for National level messages and tests.
    (b) When relaying EAS messages, EAS Participants may transmit only 
the EAS header codes and the EOM code without the Attention Signal and 
emergency message for State and local emergencies. Pauses in video 
programming before EAS message transmission should not cause television 
receivers to mute EAS audio messages. No Attention Signal is required 
for EAS messages that do not contain audio programming, such as a 
Required Weekly Test.
    (c) By the effective dates provided in Sec. 11.11(a), all analog 
and digital radio and television stations shall transmit EAS messages in 
the main audio channel. Effective December 31, 2006, all DAB stations 
shall also transmit EAS

[[Page 733]]

messages on all audio streams. Effective December 31, 2006, all DTV 
broadcast stations shall also transmit EAS messages on all program 
streams.
    (d) By the effective dates provided in Sec. 11.11(a), analog and 
digital television broadcast stations shall transmit a visual message 
containing the Originator, Event, Location and the valid time period of 
an EAS message. If the message is a video crawl, it shall be displayed 
at the top of the television screen or where it will not interfere with 
other visual messages.
    (e) Analog class D non-commercial educational FM stations as defined 
in Sec. 73.506 of this chapter, digital class D non-commercial 
educational FM stations, analog Low Power FM (LPFM) stations as defined

analog low power TV (LPTV) stations as defined in Sec. 74.701(f) of 
this chapter, and digital LPTV stations as defined in Sec. 74.701(k) of 
this chapter are not required to have equipment capable of generating 
the EAS codes and Attention Signal specified in Sec. 11.31.
    (f) Analog and digital broadcast station equipment generating the 
EAS codes and the Attention Signal shall modulate a broadcast station 
transmitter so that the signal broadcast to other EAS Participants 
alerts them that the EAS is being activated or tested at the National, 
State or Local Area level. The minimum level of modulation for EAS 
codes, measured at peak modulation levels using the internal calibration 
output required in Sec. 11.32(a)(4), shall modulate the transmitter at 
the maximum possible level, but in no case less than 50% of full channel 
modulation limits. Measured at peak modulation levels, each of the 
Attention Signal tones shall be calibrated separately to modulate the 
transmitter at no less than 40%. These two calibrated modulation levels 
shall have values that are within 1 dB of each other.
    (g) Analog cable systems and digital cable systems with fewer than 
5,000 subscribers per headend and wireline video systems and wireless 
cable systems with fewer than 5,000 subscribers shall transmit EAS audio 
messages in the same order specified in paragraph (a) of this section on 
at least one channel. The Attention signal may be produced from a 
storage device. Additionally, these analog cable systems, digital cable 
systems, and wireless cable systems:
    (1) Must install, operate, and maintain equipment capable of 
generating the EAS codes. The modulation levels for the EAS codes and 
Attention Signal for analog cable systems shall comply with the aural 
signal requirements in Sec. 76.605 of this chapter,
    (2) Must provide a video interruption and an audio alert message on 
all channels. The audio alert message must state which channel is 
carrying the EAS video and audio message,
    (3) Shall transmit a visual EAS message on at least one channel. The 
message shall contain the Originator, Event, Location, and the valid 
time period of the EAS message. If the visual message is a video crawl, 
it shall be displayed at the top of the subscriber's television screen 
or where it will not interfere with other visual messages.
    (4) May elect not to interrupt EAS messages from broadcast stations 
based upon a written agreement between all concerned. Further, analog 
cable systems, digital cable systems, and wireless cable systems may

    (2) SDARS licensees may determine the distribution methods they will 
use to comply with this requirement.
    (j) Effective May 31, 2007, DBS providers shall transmit national 
audio and visual EAS messages on all channels in the same order 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) DBS providers must install, operate, and maintain equipment 
capable of generating the EAS codes.
    (2) The visual message shall contain the Originator, Event, Location 
and the valid time period of the EAS message. These are elements of the 
EAS header code and are described in Sec. 11.31. If the visual message 
is a video crawl, it shall be displayed at the top of the subscriber's 
television screen or where it will not interfere with other visual 
messages.
    (3) DBS providers may determine the distribution methods they will 
use to comply with this requirement. Such methods may include 
distributing the EAS message on all channels, using a means to 
automatically tune the subscriber's set-top box to a pre-designated 
channel which carries the required audio and video EAS messages, and/or 
passing through the EAS message provided by programmers and/or local 
channels (where applicable).
    (k) If manual interrupt is used as authorized in paragraph (m) of 
this section, EAS Encoders must be located so that EAS Participant 
staff, at normal duty locations, can initiate the EAS code and Attention 
Signal transmission.
    (l) EAS Participants that are co-owned and co-located with a 
combined studio or control facility, (such as an AM and FM licensed to 
the same entity and at the same location or a cable headend serving more 
than one system) may provide the EAS transmitting requirements contained 
in this section

[[Page 735]]

for the combined stations or systems with one EAS Encoder. The 
requirements of Sec. 11.32 must be met by the combined facility.
    (m) EAS Participants are required to transmit all received EAS 
messages in which the header code contains the Event codes for Emergency 
Action Notification (EAN), Emergency Action Termination (EAT), and 
Required Monthly Test (RMT), and when the accompanying location codes 
include their State or State/county. These EAS messages shall be 
retransmitted unchanged except for the LLLLLLLL-code which identifies 
the EAS Participant retransmitting the message. See Sec. 11.31(c). If 
an EAS source originates an EAS message with the Event codes in this 
paragraph, it must include the location codes for the State and counties 
in its service area. When transmitting the required weekly test, EAS 
Participants shall use the event code RWT. The location codes are the 
state and county for the broadcast station city of license or system 
community or city. Other location codes may be included upon approval of 
station or system management. EAS messages may be transmitted 
automatically or manually.
    (1) Automatic interrupt of programming and transmission of EAS 
messages are required when facilities are unattended. Automatic 
transmissions must include a permanent record that contains at a minimum 
the following information: Originator, Event, Location and valid time 
period of the message. The decoder performs the functions necessary to 
determine which EAS messages are automatically transmitted by the 
encoder.
    (2) Manual interrupt of programming and transmission of EAS messages 
may be used. EAS messages with the EAN Event code must be transmitted 
immediately and Monthly EAS test messages within 60 minutes. All actions 
must be logged and include the minimum information required for EAS 
video messages.
    (n) EAS Participants may employ a minimum delay feature, not to 
exceed 15 minutes, for automatic interruption of EAS codes. However, 
this may not be used for the EAN event which must be transmitted 
immediately. The delay time for an RMT message may not exceed 60 
minutes.
    (o) Either manual or automatic operation of EAS equipment may be 
used by EAS Participants that use remote control. If manual operation is 
used, an EAS decoder must be located at the remote control location and 
it must directly monitor the signals of the two assigned EAS sources. If 
direct monitoring of the assigned EAS sources is not possible at the 
remote location, automatic operation is required. If automatic operation 
is used, the remote control location may be used to override the 
transmission of an EAS alert. EAS Participants may change back and forth 
between automatic and manual operation.

assignments of each broadcast station and cable system and wireless 
cable system are specified in the State EAS Plan and FCC Mapbook. They 
are developed in accordance with FCC monitoring priorities.
    (1) If the required EAS sources cannot be received, alternate 
arrangements or a waiver may be obtained by written request to the FCC's 
EAS office. In an emergency, a waiver may be issued over the telephone 
with a follow up letter to confirm temporary or permanent reassignment.
    (2) The management of EAS Participants shall determine which header 
codes will automatically interrupt their programming for State and Local 
Area emergency situations affecting their audiences.
    (e) EAS Participants are required to interrupt normal programming 
either automatically or manually when they receive an EAS message in 
which the header code contains the Event codes for Emergency Action 
Notification (EAN), Emergency Action Termination (EAT), and Required 
Monthly Test (RMT) for their State or State/county location.
    (1) Automatic interrupt of programming is required when facilities 
are unattended. Automatic operation must provide a permanent record of 
the EAS message that contains at a minimum the following information: 
Originator, Event, Location and valid time period of the message.
    (2) Manual interrupt of programming and transmission of EAS messages 
may be used. EAS messages with the EAN Event code must be transmitted 
immediately and Monthly EAS test messages within 60 minutes. All actions 
must be logged and recorded as specified in Sec. Sec. 11.35(a) and 
11.54(b)(13). Decoders must be programmed for the EAN and EAT Event 
header codes for National level emergencies and the RMT and RWT Event 
header codes for required monthly and weekly tests, with the appropriate 
accompanying State and State/county location codes.

    Source: 72 FR 37673, July 11, 2007, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 12.1  Purpose.

    The rules in this part include requirements that will help ensure 
the resiliency, redundancy and reliability of communications systems, 
particularly 911 and E911 networks and/or systems.


<R05>
Sec. 12.2  Backup power.

    (a) Except to the extent set forth in Sec. Sec. 12.2(b) and 
12.2(c)(4) of the Commission's rules, local exchange carriers, including 
incumbent local exchange carriers and competitive local exchange 
carriers (collectively, LECs), and commercial mobile radio service 
(CMRS) providers, as defined in Sec. 20.9 of this chapter, must have an 
emergency backup power source (e.g., batteries, generators, fuel cells) 
for all assets necessary to maintain communications that are normally 
powered from local commercial power, including those assets located 
inside central offices, cell sites, remote switches and digital loop 
carrier system remote terminals. LECs and CMRS providers must maintain 
emergency backup power for a minimum of twenty-four hours for assets 
that are normally powered from local commercial power and located inside 
central offices, and eight hours for assets that are normally powered 
from local commercial power and at other locations, including cell 
sites, remote switches and digital loop carrier system remote terminals. 
Power sources satisfy this requirement if they were originally designed 
to provide the minimum backup power capacity level required herein and 
the provider has implemented reasonable methods and procedures to ensure 
that the power sources are regularly checked and replaced when they 
deteriorate. LECs that meet the definition of a Class B company as set 
forth in Sec. 32.11(b)(2) of this chapter and non-nationwide CMRS 
providers with no more than 500,000 subscribers are exempt from this 
rule.
    (b) LECs and CMRS providers are not required to comply with 
paragraph (a) of this section for assets as described in paragraph (a) 
of this section where the LEC or CMRS provider demonstrates, through the 
reporting requirement as described in paragraph (c) of this section, 
that such compliance is precluded by:
    (1) Federal, state, tribal or local law;
    (2) Risk to safety of life or health; or
    (3) Private legal obligation or agreement.
    (c) Within six months of the effective date of this requirement, 
LECs and CMRS providers subject to this section must file reports with 
the Chief of the Public Safety & Homeland Security Bureau.
    (1) Each report must list the following:
    (i) Each asset that was designed to comply with the applicable 
backup power requirement as defined in paragraph (a) of this section;
    (ii) Each asset where compliance with paragraph (a) of this section 
is precluded due to risk to safety of life or health;
    (iii) Each asset where compliance with paragraph (a) of this section 
is precluded by a private legal obligation or agreement;
    (iv) Each asset where compliance with paragraph (a) of this section 
is

[[Page 741]]

precluded by Federal, state, tribal or local law; and
    (v) Each asset that was designed with less than the emergency backup 
power capacity specified in paragraph (a) of this section and that is 
not precluded from compliance under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Reports listing assets falling within the categories identified 
in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section must include a 
description of facts supporting the basis of the LEC's or CMRS 
provider's claim of preclusion from compliance. For example, claims that 
a LEC or CMRS provider cannot comply with this section due to a legal 
constraint must include the citation(s) to the relevant law(s) and, in 
order to demonstrate that it is precluded from compliance, the provider 
must show that the legal constraint prohibits the provider from 
compliance. Claims that a LEC or CMRS provider cannot comply with this 
section with respect to a particular asset due to a private legal 
obligation or agreement must include a description of the relevant terms 
of the obligation or agreement and the dates on which the relevant terms 
of the agreement became effective and are set to expire. Claims that a 
LEC or CMRS provider cannot comply with this section with respect to a 
particular asset due to risk to safety of life or health must include a 
description of the safety of life or health risk and facts that 
demonstrate a substantial risk of harm.
    (3) For purposes of complying with the reporting requirements set 
forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, in cases 
where more than one asset necessary to maintain communications that are 
normally powered from local commercial power are located at a single 
site (i.e., within one central office), the reporting entity may 
identify all of such assets by the name of the site.
    (4) In cases where a LEC or CMRS provider identifies assets pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, such LEC or CMRS provider must 
comply with the backup power requirement in paragraph (a) of this 
section or, within 12 months from the effective date of this rule, file 
with the Commission a certified emergency backup power compliance plan. 
That plan must certify that and describe how the LEC or CMRS provider 
will provide emergency backup power to 100 percent of the area covered 
by any non-compliant asset in the event of a commercial power failure. 
For purposes of the plan, a provider may rely on on-site and/or portable 
backup power sources or other sources, as appropriate, sufficient for 
service coverage as follows: a minimum of 24 hours of service for assets 
inside central offices and eight hours for other assets, including cell 
sites, remote switches, and digital loop carrier system remote 
terminals. The emergency backup power compliance plans submitted are 
subject to Commission review.
    (5) Reports submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be supported 
by an affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury and signed and 
dated by a duly authorized representative of the LEC or CMRS provider 
with personal knowledge of the facts contained therein.
    (6) Information filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section shall be automatically afforded confidentiality in 
accordance with the Commission's rules.
    (7) LECs that meet the definition of a Class B company as set forth 
in Sec. 32.11(b)(2) of this chapter and non-nationwide CMRS providers 
with no more than 500,000 subscribers are exempt from this reporting 
requirement.

    Effective Date Note: At 72 FR 57887, Oct. 11, 2007, Sec. 12.2 was 
revised. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 12.3  911 and E911 analyses and reports.

    The following entities must analyze their 911 and E911 networks and/
or systems and provide a detailed report to the Commission on the 
redundancy, resiliency, and reliability of those networks and/or 
systems: Local exchange carriers (LECs), including incumbent LECs 
(ILECS) and competitive LECs (CLECs); commercial mobile radio service 
providers required to comply with the wireless 911 rules set forth in

[[Page 742]]

Sec. 20.18 of this chapter; and interconnected Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP) service providers. LECs that meet the definition of a 
Class B company set forth in Sec. 32.11(b)(2) of this chapter, non-
nationwide commercial mobile radio service providers with no more than 
500,000 subscribers at the end of 2001, and interconnected VoIP service 
providers with annual revenues below the revenue threshold established 
pursuant to Sec. 32.11 of this chapter are exempt from this rule.
    (a) The Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB) has the 
delegated authority to implement and activate a process through which 
these reports will be submitted, including the authority to establish 
the specific data that will be required. Where relevant, these reports 
should include descriptions of the steps the service providers intend to 
take to ensure diversity and dependability in their 911 and E911 
networks and/or systems, including any plans they have to migrate those 
networks and/or systems to a next generation Internet Protocol-based 
E911 platform.
    (b) These reports are due 120 days from the date that the Commission 
or its staff announces activation of the 911 network and system 
reporting process.
    (c) Reports filed under this Part will be presumed to be 
confidential. These reports will be shared with The National Emergency 
Number Association, The Association of Public Safety Communications 
Officials, and The National Association of State 9-1-1 Administrators 
only pursuant to a protective order. PSHSB has the delegated authority 
to issue such protective orders. All other access to these reports must 
be sought pursuant to procedures set forth in 47 CFR 0.461. Notice of 
any requests for inspection of these reports will be provided to the 
filers of the reports pursuant to 47 CFR 0.461(d)(3).

uses radio frequency energy for the purpose of performing data 
processing functions, such as electronic computations, operations, 
transformations, recording, filing, sorting, storage, retrieval, or 
transfer. A radio frequency device that is specifically subject to an 
emanation requirement in any other FCC Rule part or an intentional 
radiator subject to subpart C of this part that contains a digital 
device is not subject to the standards for digital devices, provided the 
digital device is used only to enable operation of the radio frequency 
device and the digital device does not control additional functions or 
capabilities.

    Note: Computer terminals and peripherals that are intended to be 
connected to a computer are digital devices.

    (l) Field disturbance sensor. A device that establishes a radio

<R05>
Sec. 15.5  General conditions of operation.

    (a) Persons operating intentional or unintentional radiators shall 
not be deemed to have any vested or recognizable right to continued use 
of any given frequency by virtue of prior registration or certification 
of equipment, or, for power line carrier systems, on the basis of prior 
notification of use pursuant to Sec. 90.63(g) of this chapter.
    (b) Operation of an intentional, unintentional, or incidental 
radiator is subject to the conditions that no harmful interference is 
caused and that interference must be accepted that may be caused by the 
operation of an authorized radio station, by another intentional or 
unintentional radiator, by industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) 
equipment, or by an incidental radiator.
    (c) The operator of a radio frequency device shall be required to 
cease operating the device upon notification by a Commission 
representative that the device is causing harmful interference. 
Operation shall not resume until the condition causing the harmful 
interference has been corrected.
    (d) Intentional radiators that produce Class B emissions (damped 
wave) are prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 15.7  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 15.9  Prohibition against eavesdropping.

    Except for the operations of law enforcement officers conducted 
under lawful authority, no person shall use, either directly or 
indirectly, a device operated pursuant to the provisions of this part 
for the purpose of overhearing or recording the private conversations

[[Page 758]]

of others unless such use is authorized by all of the parties engaging 
in the conversation.


<R05>
Sec. 15.11  Cross reference.

    The provisions of subparts A, H, I, J and K of part 2 apply to 
intentional and unintentional radiators, in addition to the provisions 
of this part. Also, a cable system terminal device and a cable input 
selector switch shall be subject to the relevant provisions of part 76 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 15.13  Incidental radiators.

    Manufacturers of these devices shall employ good engineering 
practices to minimize the risk of harmful interference.


<R05>
Sec. 15.15  General technical requirements.

    (a) An intentional or unintentional radiator shall be constructed in 
accordance with good engineering design and manufacturing practice. 
Emanations from the device shall be suppressed as much as practicable, 
but in no case shall the emanations exceed the levels specified in these 
rules.
    (b) Except as follows, an intentional or unintentional radiator must 
be constructed such that the adjustments of any control that is readily 
accessible by or intended to be accessible to the user will not cause 
operation of the device in violation of the regulations. Access BPL 
equipment shall comply with the applicable standards at the control 
adjustment that is employed. The measurement report used in support of 
an application for Certification and the user instructions for Access 
BPL equipment shall clearly specify the user-or installer-control 
settings that are required for conformance with these regulations.
    (c) Parties responsible for equipment compliance should note that 
the limits specified in this part will not prevent harmful interference 
under all circumstances. Since the operators of part 15 devices are 
required to cease operation should harmful interference occur to 
authorized users of the radio frequency spectrum, the parties 
responsible for equipment compliance are encouraged to employ the 
minimum field strength necessary for communications, to provide greater 
attenuation of unwanted emissions than required by these regulations, 
and to advise the user as to how to resolve harmful interference 
problems (for example, see Sec. 15.105(b)).

Sec. 15.27  Special accessories.

    (a) Equipment marketed to a consumer must be capable of complying 
with the necessary regulations in the configuration in which the 
equipment is marketed. Where special accessories, such as shielded 
cables and/or special connectors, are required to enable an 
unintentional or intentional radiator to comply with the emission limits 
in this part, the equipment must be marketed with, i.e., shipped and 
sold with, those special accessories. However, in lieu of shipping or 
packaging the special accessories with the unintentional or intentional 
radiator, the responsible party may employ other methods of ensuring 
that the special accessories are provided to the consumer, without 
additional charge, at the time of purchase. Information detailing any 
alternative method used to supply the special accessories shall be 
included in the application for a grant of equipment authorization or 
retained in the verification records, as appropriate. The party 
responsible for the equipment, as detailed in Sec. 2.909 of this 
chapter, shall ensure that these special accessories are provided with 
the equipment. The instruction manual for such devices shall include 
appropriate instructions on the first page of the text concerned with 
the installation of the device that these special accessories must be 
used with the device. It is the responsibility of the user to use the 
needed special accessories supplied with the equipment. In cases where 
the manual is provided only in a form other than paper, such as on a 
computer disk or over the Internet, the information required by this 
section may be included in the manual in that alternative form, provided 
the user can reasonably be expected to have the capability to access 
information in that form.
    (b) If a device requiring special accessories is installed by or 
under the supervision of the party marketing the

[[Page 762]]

device, it is the responsibility of that party to install the equipment 
using the special accessories. For equipment requiring professional 
installation, it is not necessary for the responsible party to market 
the special accessories with the equipment. However, the need to use the 
special accessories must be detailed in the instruction manual, and it 
is the responsibility of the installer to provide and to install the 
required accessories.
    (c) Accessory items that can be readily obtained from multiple 
retail outlets are not considered to be special accessories and are not 
required to be marketed with the equipment. The manual included with the 
equipment must specify what additional components or accessories are 
required to be used in order to ensure compliance with this part, and it 
is the responsibility of the user to provide and use those components 
and accessories.
    (d) The resulting system, including any accessories or components 
marketed with the equipment, must comply with the regulations.

Sec. 15.29  Inspection by the Commission.

    (a) Any equipment or device subject to the provisions of this part, 
together with any certificate, notice of registration or any technical 
data required to be kept on file by the operator, supplier or party 
responsible for compliance of the device shall be made available for 
inspection by a Commission representative upon reasonable request.
    (b) The owner or operator of a radio frequency device subject to 
this part shall promptly furnish to the Commission or its representative 
such information as may be requested concerning the operation of the 
radio frequency device.
    (c) The party responsible for the compliance of any device subject 
to this part shall promptly furnish to the Commission or its 
representatives such information as may be requested concerning the 
operation of the device, including a copy of any measurements made for 
obtaining an equipment authorization or demonstrating compliance with 
the regulations.
    (d) The Commission, from time to time, may request the party 
responsible for compliance, including an importer, to submit to the FCC 
Laboratory in Columbia, Maryland, various equipment to determine that 
the equipment continues to comply with the applicable standards. 
Shipping costs to the Commission's Laboratory and return shall be borne 
by the responsible party. Testing by the Commission will be performed 
using the measurement procedure(s) that was in effect at the time the 
equipment was authorized or verified.


<R05>
Sec. 15.31  Measurement standards.

    (a) The following measurement procedures are used by the Commission 
to determine compliance with the technical requirements in this part. 
Except where noted, copies of these procedures are available from the 
Commission's current duplicating contractor whose name and address are 
available from the Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau 
at 1-888-CALL-FCC (1-888-225-5322).
    (1) FCC/OET MP-2: Measurement of UHF Noise Figures of TV Receivers.
    (2) Unlicensed Personal Communication Service (UPCS) devices are to 
be measured for compliance using ANSI C63.17-1998: ``Methods of 
Measurement of the Electromagnetic and Operational Compatibility of 
Unlicensed Personal Communications Services (UPCS) Devices'', 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38). This incorporation by 
reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
    (3) Other intentional and unintentional radiators are to be measured 
for compliance using the following procedure excluding sections 4.1.5.2, 
5.7, 9 and 14: ANSI C63.4-2003: ``Methods of Measurement of Radio-Noise 
Emissions from Low-Voltage Electrical and Electronic Equipment in the 
Range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38). 
This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the 
Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.


[[Page 763]]


    Note to paragraph (a)(3): Digital devices tested to show compliance 
with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 15.107(e) and 15.109(g) must be tested 
following the ANSI C63.4 procedure described in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.

    (b) All parties making compliance measurements on equipment subject 
to the requirements of this part are urged to use these measurement 
procedures. Any party using other procedures should ensure that such 
other procedures can be relied on to produce measurement results 
compatible with the FCC measurement procedures. The description of the 
measurement procedure used in testing the equipment for compliance and a 
list of the test equipment actually employed shall be made part of an 
application for certification or included with the data required to be 
retained by the party responsible for devices authorized pursuant to a 
Declaration of Conformity or devices subject to verification.
    (c) For swept frequency equipment, measurements shall be made with 
the frequency sweep stopped at those frequencies chosen for the 
measurements to be reported.
    (d) Field strength measurements shall be made, to the extent 
possible, on an open field site. Test sites other than open field sites 
may be employed if they are properly calibrated so that the measurement 
results correspond to what would be obtained from an open field site. In 
the case of equipment for which measurements can be performed only at 
the installation site, such as perimeter protection systems, carrier 
current systems, and systems employing a ``leaky'' coaxial cable as an 
antenna, measurements for verification or for obtaining a grant of 
equipment authorization shall be performed at a minimum of three 
installations that can be demonstrated to be representative of typical 
installation sites.
    (e) For intentional radiators, measurements of the variation of the 
input power or the radiated signal level of the fundamental frequency 
component of the emission, as appropriate, shall be performed with the 
supply voltage varied between 85% and 115% of the nominal rated supply 
voltage. For battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be 
performed using a new battery.
    (f) To the extent practicable, the device under test shall be 
measured at the distance specified in the appropriate rule section. The 
distance specified corresponds to the horizontal distance between the 
measurement antenna and the closest point of the equipment under test, 
support equipment or interconnecting cables as determined by the 
boundary defined by an imaginary straight line periphery describing a 
simple geometric configuration enclosing the system containing the 
equipment under test. The equipment under test, support equipment and 
any interconnecting cables shall be included within this boundary.
    (1) At frequencies at or above 30 MHz, measurements may be performed 
at a distance other than what is specified provided: measurements are 
not made in the near field except where it can be shown that near field 
measurements are appropriate due to the characteristics of the device; 
and it can be demonstrated that the signal levels needed to be measured 
at the distance employed can be detected by the measurement equipment. 
Measurements shall not be performed at a distance greater than 30 meters 
unless it can be further demonstrated that measurements at a distance of 
30 meters or less are impractical. When performing measurements at a 
distance other than that specified, the results shall be extrapolated to 
the specified distance using an extrapolation factor of 20 dB/decade 
(inverse linear-distance for field strength measurements; inverse-
linear-distance-squared for power density measurements).
    (2) At frequencies below 30 MHz, measurements may be performed at a 
distance closer than that specified in the regulations; however, an 
attempt should be made to avoid making measurements in the near field. 
Pending the development of an appropriate measurement procedure for 
measurements performed below 30 MHz, when performing measurements at a 
closer distance than specified, the results shall be extrapolated to the 
specified distance by either making measurements at a minimum of two 
distances on at least one radial to determine the proper extrapolation 
factor or by using the

[[Page 764]]

square of an inverse linear distance extrapolation factor (40 dB/
decade).
    (3) The applicant for a grant of certification shall specify the 
extrapolation method used in the application filed with the Commission. 
For equipment subject to Declaration of Conformity or verification, this 
information shall be retained with the measurement data.
    (4) When measurement distances of 30 meters or less are specified in 
the regulations, the Commission will test the equipment at the distance 
specified unless measurement at that distance results in measurements 
being performed in the near field. When measurement distances of greater 
than 30 meters are specified in the regulations, the Commission will 
test the equipment at a closer distance, usually 30 meters, 
extrapolating the measured field strength to the specified distance 
using the methods shown in this section.
    (5) Measurements shall be performed at a sufficient number of 
radials around the equipment under test to determine the radial at which 
the field strength values of the radiated emissions are maximized. The 
maximum field strength at the frequency being measured shall be reported 
in the equipment authorization report. This paragraph shall not apply to 
Access BPL equipment on overhead medium voltage lines. In lieu thereof, 
the measurement guidelines established by the Commission for Access BPL 
shall be followed.
    (g) Equipment under test shall be adjusted, using those controls 
that are readily accessible to or are intended to be accessible to the 
consumer, in such a manner as to maximize the level of the emissions. 
For those devices to which wire leads may be attached by the consumer, 
tests shall be performed with wire leads attached. The wire leads shall 
be of the length to be used with the equipment if that length is known. 
Otherwise, wire leads one meter in length shall be attached to the 
equipment. Longer wire leads may be employed if necessary to 
interconnect to associated peripherals.
    (h) For a composite system that incorporates devices contained 
either in a single enclosure or in separate enclosures connected by wire 
or cable, testing for compliance with the standards in this part shall 
be performed with all of the devices in the system functioning. If an 
intentional radiator incorporates more than one antenna or other 
radiating source and these radiating sources are designed to emit at the 
same time, measurements of conducted and radiated emissions shall be 
performed with all radiating sources that are to be employed emitting. A 
device which incorporates a carrier current system shall be tested as if 
the carrier current system were incorporated in a separate device; that 
is, the device shall be tested for compliance with whatever rules would 
apply to the device were the carrier current system not incorporated, 
and the carrier current system shall be tested for compliance with the 
rules applicable to carrier current systems.
    (i) If the device under test provides for the connection of external 
accessories, including external electrical input signals, the device 
shall be tested with the accessories attached. The device under test 
shall be fully exercised with these external accessories. The emission 
tests shall be performed with the device and accessories configured in a 
manner that tends to produce maximized emissions within the range of 
variations that can be expected under normal operating conditions. In 
the case of multiple accessory external ports, an external accessory 
shall be connected to one of each type of port. Only one test using 
peripherals or external accessories that are representative of the 
devices that will be employed with the equipment under test is required. 
All possible equipment combinations do not need to be tested. The 
accessories or peripherals connected to the device being tested shall be 
unmodified, commercially available equipment.
    (j) If the equipment under test consists of a central control unit 
and an external or internal accessory(ies) (peripheral) and the party 
verifying the equipment or applying for a grant of equipment 
authorization manufactures or assembles the central control unit and at 
least one of the accessory devices that can be used with that control 
unit, testing of the control unit

[[Page 765]]

and/or the accessory(ies) must be performed using the devices 
manufactured or assembled by that party, in addition to any other needed 
devices which the party does not manufacture or assemble. If the party 
verifying the equipment or applying for a grant of equipment 
authorization does not manufacture or assemble the central control unit 
and at least one of the accessory devices that can be used with that 
control unit or the party can demonstrate that the central control unit 
or accessory(ies) normally would be marketed or used with equipment from 
a different entity, testing of the central control unit and/or the 
accessory(ies) must be performed using the specific combination of 
equipment which is intended to be marketed or used together. Only one 
test using peripherals or accessories that are representatve of the 
devices that will be employed with the equipment under test is required. 
All possible equipment combinations are not required to be tested. The 
accessories or peripherals connected to the device being tested shall be 
unmodified, commercially available equipment.
    (k) A composite system is a system that incorporates different 
devices contained either in a single enclosure or in separate enclosures 
connected by wire or cable. If the individual devices in a composite 
system are subject to different technical standards, each such device 
must comply with its specific standards. In no event may the measured 
emissions of the composite system exceed the highest level permitted for 
an individual component. For digital devices which consist of a 
combination of Class A and Class B devices, the total combination of 
which results in a Class A digital device, it is only necessary to 
demonstrate that the equipment combination complies with the limits for 
a Class A device. This equipment combination may not be employed for 
obtaining a grant of equipment authorization or verifying a Class B 
digital device. However, if the digital device combination consists of a 
Class B central control unit, e.g., a personal computer, and a Class A 
internal peripheral(s), it must be demonstrated that the Class B central 
control unit continues to comply with the limits for a Class B digital 
device with the Class A internal peripheral(s) installed but not active.
    (l) Measurements of radio frequency emissions conducted to the 
public utility power lines shall be performed using a 50 ohm/50 uH line-
impedance stabilization network (LISN).

    Note: Receivers tested under the transition provisions contained in 
Sec. 15.37 may be tested with a 50 ohm/5 [mu]H LISN.

    (m) Measurements on intentional radiators or receivers, other than 
TV broadcast receivers, shall be performed and, if required, reported 
for each band in which the device can be operated with the device 
operating at the number of frequencies in each band specified in the 
following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Frequency range over which device    Number of    Location in the range
              operates               frequencies       of operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 MHz or less......................           1   Middle.
1 to 10 MHz........................           2   1 near top and 1 near
                                                   bottom.
More than 10 MHz...................           3   1 near top, 1 near
                                                   middle and 1 near
                                                   bottom.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (n) Measurements on TV broadcast receivers shall be performed with 
the receiver tuned to each VHF frequency and also shall include the 
following oscillator frequencies: 520, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 
850, 900 and 931 MHz. If measurements cannot be made on one or more of 
the latter UHF frequencies because of the presence of signals from 
licensed radio stations or for other reasons to be detailed in the 
measurement report, measurements shall be made with the receiver 
oscillator at a nearby frequency. If the receiver is not capable of 
receiving channels above 806 MHz, the measurements employing the 
oscillator frequencies 900 and 931 MHz may be omitted.
    (o) The amplitude of spurious emissions from intentional radiators 
and emissions from unintentional radiators which are attenuated more 
than 20 dB below the permissible value need not be reported unless 
specifically required elsewhere in this part.
    (p) In those cases where the provisions in this section conflict 
with the measurement procedures in paragraph (a) of this section and the 
procedures were implemented after June 23, 1989,

[[Page 766]]

the provisions contained in the measurement procedures shall take 
precedence.

which separate authorizations are required to be obtained shall be 
tested as follows:
    (a) CPU boards shall be tested as follows:
    (1) Testing for radiated emissions shall be performed with the CPU 
board installed in a typical enclosure but with the enclosure's cover 
removed so that the internal circuitry is exposed at the top and on at 
least two sides. Additional components, including a power supply, 
peripheral devices, and subassemblies, shall be added, as needed, to 
result in a complete personal computer system. If the oscillator and the 
microprocessor circuits are contained on separate circuit boards, both 
boards, typical of the combination that would normally be employed, must 
be used in the test. Testing shall be in accordance with the procedures 
specified in Sec. 15.31.
    (i) Under these test conditions, the system under test shall not 
exceed the radiated emission limits specified in Sec. 15.109 by more 
than 6 dB. Emissions greater than 6 dB that can be identified and 
documented to originate from a component(s) other than the CPU board 
being tested, may be dismissed.
    (ii) Unless the test in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
demonstrates compliance with the limits in Sec. 15.109, a second test 
shall be performed using the same configuration described above but with 
the cover installed on the enclosure. Testing shall be in accordance 
with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31. Under these test 
conditions, the system under test shall not exceed the radiated emission 
limits specified in Sec. 15.109.
    (2) In lieu of the procedure in (a)(1) of this section, CPU boards 
may be tested to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Sec. 15.109 
using a specified enclosure with the cover installed. Testing for 
radiated emissions shall be performed with the CPU board installed in a 
typical system configuration. Additional components, including a power 
supply, peripheral devices, and subassemblies, shall be added, as 
needed, to result in a complete personal computer system. If the 
oscillator and the microprocessor circuits are contained on separate 
circuit boards, both boards, typical of the combination that would 
normally be employed, must be used in the test. Testing shall be in 
accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31. Under this 
procedure, CPU boards that comply with the limits in Sec. 15.109 must 
be marketed together with the specific enclosure used for the test.
    (3) The test demonstrating compliance with the AC power line 
conducted limits specified in Sec. 15.107 shall be performed in 
accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31 using an 
enclosure, peripherals, power supply and subassemblies that are typical 
of the type with which the CPU board under test would normally be 
employed.
    (b) The power supply shall be tested installed in an enclosure that 
is typical of the type within which it would normally be installed. 
Additional components, including peripheral devices, a CPU board, and 
subassemblies, shall be added, as needed, to result in a complete 
personal computer system. Testing shall be in accordance with the 
procedures specified in Sec. 15.31 and must demonstrate compliance with 
all of the standards contained in this part.

Sec. 15.33  Frequency range of radiated measurements.

    (a) For an intentional radiator, the spectrum shall be investigated 
from the lowest radio frequency signal generated in the device, without 
going below 9 kHz, up to at least the frequency shown in this paragraph:

[[Page 767]]

    (1) If the intentional radiator operates below 10 GHz: to the tenth 
harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 40 GHz, whichever is 
lower.
    (2) If the intentional radiator operates at or above 10 GHz and 
below 30 GHz: to the fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency 
or to 100 GHz, whichever is lower.
    (3) If the intentional radiator operates at or above 30 GHz: to the 
fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 200 GHz, 
whichever is lower, unless specified otherwise elsewhere in the rules.
    (4) If the intentional radiator contains a digital device, 
regardless of whether this digital device controls the functions of the 
intentional radiator or the digital device is used for additional 
control or function purposes other than to enable the operation of the 
intentional radiator, the frequency range shall be investigated up to 
the range specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section 
or the range applicable to the digital device, as shown in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, whichever is the higher frequency range of 
investigation.
    (b) For unintentional radiators:
    (1) Except as otherwise indicated in paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of 
this section, for an unintentional radiator, including a digital device, 
the spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest radio frequency 
signal generated or used in the device, without going below the lowest 
frequency for which a radiated emission limit is specified, up to the

    (2) A unintentional radiator, excluding a digital device, in which 
the highest frequency generated in the device, the highest frequency 
used in the device and the highest frequency on which the device 
operates or tunes are less than 30 MHz and which, in accordance with 
Sec. 15.109, is required to comply with standards on the level of 
radiated emissions within the frequency range 9 kHz to 30 MHz, such as a 
CB receiver or a device designed to conduct its radio frequency 
emissions via connecting wires or cables, e.g., a carrier current system 
not intended to radiate, shall be investigated from the lowest radio 
frequency generated or used in the device, without going below 9 kHz (25 
MHz for CB receivers), up to the frequency shown in the following table. 
If the unintentional radiator contains a digital device, the upper 
frequency to be investigated shall be that shown in the table below or

    (3) Except for a CB receiver, a receiver employing superheterodyne 
techniques shall be investigated from 30 MHz up to at least the second 
harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the 
device. If such receiver is controlled by a digital device, the 
frequency range shall be investigated up to the higher of the second 
harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the 
device or the upper frequency of the measurement range specified for the 
digital device in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) The above specified frequency ranges of measurements apply to 
the measurement of radiated emissions and, in the case of receivers, the 
measurement to demonstrate compliance with the antenna conduction limits 
specified in Sec. 15.111. The frequency range of measurements for AC 
power line conducted limits is specified in Sec. Sec. 15.107 and 15.207 
and applies to all equipment subject to those regulations. In some 
cases, depending on the frequency(ies) generated and used by

[[Page 768]]

the equipment, only signals conducted onto the AC power lines are 
required to be measured.
    (d) Particular attention should be paid to harmonics and 
subharmonics of the fundamental frequency as well as to those 
frequencies removed from the fundamental by multiples of the oscillator 
frequency. Radiation at the frequencies of multiplier states should also 
be checked.

Sec. 15.35  Measurement detector functions and bandwidths.

    The conducted and radiated emission limits shown in this part are 
based on the following, unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this 
part:
    (a) On any frequency or frequencies below or equal to 1000 MHz, the 
limits shown are based on measuring equipment employing a CISPR quasi-
peak detector function and related measurement bandwidths, unless 
otherwise specified. The specifications for the measuring instrument 
using the CISPR quasi-peak detector can be found in Publication 16 of 
the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) of the 
International Electrotechnical Commission. As an alternative to CISPR 
quasi-peak measurements, the responsible party, at its option, may 
demonstrate compliance with the emission limits using measuring 
equipment employing a peak detector function, properly adjusted for such 
factors as pulse desensitization, as long as the same bandwidths as 
indicated for CISPR quasi-peak measurements are employed.

    Note: For pulse modulated devices with a pulse-repetition frequency 
of 20 Hz or less and for which CISPR quasi-peak measurements are 
specified, compliance with the regulations shall be demonstrated using 
measuring equipment employing a peak detector function, properly 
adjusted for such factors as pulse desensitization, using the same 
measurement bandwidths that are indicated for CISPR quasi-peak 
measurements.

    (b) Unless otherwise specified, on any frequency or frequencies 
above 1000 MHz, the radiated emission limits are based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing an average detector function. 
Unless otherwise specified, measurements above 1000 MHz shall be 
performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz. When average 
radiated emission measurements are specified in this part, including 
average emission measurements below 1000 MHz, there also is a limit on 
the peak level of the radio frequency emissions. Unless otherwise 
specified, e.g., see Sec. Sec. 15.250, 15.252, 15.255, and 15.509-
15.519, the limit on peak radio frequency emissions is 20 dB above the 
maximum permitted average emission limit applicable to the equipment 
under test. This peak limit applies to the total peak emission level 
radiated by the device, e.g., the total peak power level. Note that the 
use of a pulse desensitization correction factor may be needed to 
determine the total peak emission level. The instruction manual or 
application note for the measurement instrument should be consulted for 
determining pulse desensitization factors, as necessary.
    (c) Unless otherwise specified, e.g. Sec. 15.255(b), when the 
radiated emission limits are expressed in terms of the average value of 
the emission, and pulsed operation is employed, the measurement field 
strength shall be determined by averaging over one complete pulse train, 
including blanking intervals, as long as the pulse train does not exceed 
0.1 seconds. As an alternative (provided the transmitter operates for 
longer than 0.1 seconds) or in cases where the pulse train exceeds 0.1 
seconds, the measured field strength shall be determined from the 
average absolute voltage during a 0.1 second interval during which the 
field strength is at its maximum value. The exact method of calculating 
the average field strength shall be submitted with any application for 
certification or shall be retained in the measurement data file for 
equipment subject to notification or verification.

the following methods:
    (1) The specific combination of CPU board, power supply and 
enclosure is tested together and authorized under a Declaration of 
Conformity or a grant of certification;
    (2) The personal computer is authorized under a Declaration of 
Conformity or a grant of certification, and the CPU board or power 
supply in that computer is replaced with a CPU board or power supply 
that has been separately authorized under a Declaration of Conformity or 
a grant of certification; or
    (3) The CPU board and power supply used in the assembly of a 
personal computer have been separately authorized under a Declaration of 
Conformity or a grant of certification; and
    (4) Personal computers assembled using either of the methods 
specified in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section must, by 
themselves, also be authorized under a Declaration of Conformity if they 
are marketed. However, additional testing is not required for this 
Declaration of Conformity, provided the procedures in Sec. 15.102(b) 
are followed.
    (d) Peripheral devices, as defined in Sec. 15.3(r), shall be 
authorized under a Declaration of Conformity, or a grant of 
certification, or verified, as appropriate, prior to marketing. 
Regardless of the provisions of paragraphs (a) or (c) of this section, 
if a CPU board, power supply, or peripheral device will always be 
marketed with a specific personal computer, it is not necessary to 
obtain a separate authorization for that product provided the specific 
combination of personal computer, peripheral device, CPU board and power 
supply has been authorized under a Declaration of Conformity or a grant 
of certification as a personal computer.
    (1) No authorization is required for a peripheral device or a 
subassembly that is sold to an equipment manufacturer for further 
fabrication; that manufacturer is responsible for obtaining the 
necessary authorization prior to further marketing to a vendor or to a 
user.
    (2) Power supplies and CPU boards that have not been separately 
authorized and are designed for use with personal computers may be 
imported and marketed only to a personal computer equipment manufacturer 
that has indicated, in writing, to the seller or importer that they will 
obtain a Declaration of Conformity or a grant of certification for the 
personal computer employing these components.
    (e) Subassemblies to digital devices are not subject to the 
technical standards in this part unless they are marketed as part of a 
system in which case the resulting system must comply with the 
applicable regulations. Subassemblies include:
    (1) Devices that are enclosed solely within the enclosure housing 
the digital device, except for: power supplies used in personal 
computers; devices included under the definition of a peripheral device 
in Sec. 15.3(r); and personal computer CPU boards, as defined in Sec. 
15.3(bb);
    (2) CPU boards, as defined in Sec. 15.3(bb), other than those used 
in personal computers, that are marketed without an enclosure or power 
supply; and
    (3) Switching power supplies that are separately marketed and are 
solely for use internal to a device other than a personal computer.
    (f) The procedures for obtaining a grant of certification or 
notification and for verification and a Declaration of Conformity are 
contained in subpart J of part 2 of this chapter.

Sec. 15.103  Exempted devices.

    The following devices are subject only to the general conditions of 
operation in Sec. Sec. 15.5 and 15.29 and are exempt from the specific 
technical standards and other requirements contained in this part. The 
operator of the exempted device shall be required to stop operating the 
device upon a finding by the Commission or its representative that the 
device is causing harmful interference. Operation shall not resume until 
the condition causing the harmful interference has been corrected. 
Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that the manufacturer 
of an exempted device endeavor to have the device meet the specific 
technical standards in this part.
    (a) A digital device utilized exclusively in any transportation 
vehicle including motor vehicles and aircraft.
    (b) A digital device used exclusively as an electronic control or 
power system utilized by a public utility or in an industrial plant. The 
term public utility includes equipment only to the extent that it is in 
a dedicated building or large room owned or leased by the utility and 
does not extend to equipment installed in a subscriber's facility.
    (c) A digital device used exclusively as industrial, commercial, or 
medical test equipment.
    (d) A digital device utilized exclusively in an appliance, e.g., 
microwave oven, dishwasher, clothes dryer, air conditioner (central or 
window), etc.
    (e) Specialized medical digital devices (generally used at the 
direction of or under the supervision of a licensed health care 
practitioner) whether used in a patient's home or a health

[[Page 774]]

care facility. Non-specialized medical devices, i.e., devices marketed 
through retail channels for use by the general public, are not exempted. 
This exemption also does not apply to digital devices used for record 
keeping or any purpose not directly connected with medical treatment.
    (f) Digital devices that have a power consumption not exceeding 6 
nW.
    (g) Joystick controllers or similar devices, such as a mouse, used 
with digital devices but which contain only non-digital circuitry or a 
simple circuit to convert the signal to the format required (e.g., an 
integrated circuit for analog to digital conversion) are viewed as 
passive add-on devices, not themselves directly subject to the technical 
standards or the equipment authorization requirements.
    (h) Digital devices in which both the highest frequency generated 
and the highest frequency used are less than 1.705 MHz and which do not 
operate from the AC power lines or contain provisions for operation 
while connected to the AC power lines. Digital devices that include, or 
make provision for the use of, battery eliminators, AC adaptors or 
battery chargers which permit operation while charging or that connect 
to the AC power lines indirectly, obtaining their power through another 
device which is connected to the AC power lines, do not fall under this 
exemption.
    (i) Responsible parties should note that equipment containing more 
than one device is not exempt from the technical standards in this part 
unless all of the devices in the equipment meet the criteria for 
exemption. If only one of the included devices qualifies for exemption, 
the remainder of the equipment must comply with any applicable 
regulations. If a device performs more than one function and all of 
those functions do not meet the criteria for exemption, the device does 
not qualify for inclusion under the exemptions.

paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) Carrier current systems used as unintentional radiators or other 
unintentional radiators that are designed to conduct their radio 
frequency emissions via connecting wires or cables and that operate in 
the frequency range of 9 kHz to 30 MHz, including devices that deliver 
the radio frequency energy to transducers, such as ultrasonic devices 
not covered under part 18 of this chapter, shall comply with the 
radiated emission limits for intentional radiators provided in Sec. 
15.209 for the frequency range of 9 kHz to 30 MHz. As an alternative, 
carrier current systems used as unintentional radiators and operating in

emission limits provided in Sec. 15.221(a). At frequencies above 30 
MHz, the limits in paragraph (a), (b), or (g) of this section, as 
appropriate, apply.
    (f) For a receiver which employs terminals for the connection of an 
external receiving antenna, the receiver shall be tested to demonstrate 
compliance with the provisions of this section with an antenna connected 
to the antenna terminals unless the antenna conducted power is measured 
as specified in Sec. 15.111(a). If a permanently attached receiving 
antenna is used, the receiver shall be tested to demonstrate compliance 
with the provisions of this section.
    (g) As an alternative to the radiated emission limits shown in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, digital devices may be shown to 
comply with the standards contained in Third Edition of the 
International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR), Pub. 22, 
``Information Technology Equipment--Radio Disturbance Characteristics--
Limits and Methods of Measurement'' (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 15.38). In addition:
    (1) The test procedure and other requirements specified in this part 
shall continue to apply to digital devices.
    (2) If, in accordance with Sec. 15.33 of this part, measurements 
must be performed above 1000 MHz, compliance above 1000 MHz shall be 
demonstrated with the emission limit in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, as appropriate. Measurements above 1000 MHz may be performed at 
the distance specified in the CISPR 22 publications for measurements 
below 1000 MHz provided the limits in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section are extrapolated to the new measurement distance using an 
inverse linear distance extrapolation factor (20 dB/decade), e.g., the 
radiated limit above 1000 MHz for a Class B digital device is 150 uV/m, 
as measured at a distance of 10 meters.
    (3) The measurement distances shown in CISPR Pub. 22, including 
measurements made in accordance with this paragraph above 1000 MHz, are 
considered, for the purpose of Sec. 15.31(f)(4) of this part, to be the 
measurement distances specified in this part.
    (4) If the radiated emissions are measured to demonstrate compliance 
with the alternative standards in this paragraph, compliance must also 
be demonstrated with the conducted limits shown in Sec. 15.107(e).
    (h) Radar detectors shall comply with the emission limits in 
paragraph (a) of this section over the frequency range of 11.7-12.2 GHz.

(particularly the frequency) shall be selected to achieve the highest 
practical degree of compatibility with authorized or licensed users of 
the radio spectrum. The signals from this operation shall be contained 
within the frequency band 9 kHz to 490 kHz. A power line carrier system 
shall operate on an unprotected, non-interference basis in accordance 
with Sec. 15.5 of this part. If harmful interference occurs, the 
electric power utility shall discontinue use or adjust its power line 
carrier operation, as required, to remedy the interference. Particular 
attention should be paid to the possibility of interference to Loran C 
operations at 100 kHz.
    (c) Power line carrier system apparatus shall be operated with the 
minimum power possible to accomplish the desired purpose. No equipment 
authorization is required.

of (R) for the video signal and 77.5 times the square root of (R) for 
the audio signal.
    (2) At any RF output terminal, the maximum measured RMS voltage, in 
microvolts, corresponding to the peak envelope power of the modulated 
signal during maximum amplitude peaks across a resistance (R in ohms) 
matching the rated output impedance of the TV interface device, of any 
emission appearing on frequencies removed by more than 4.6 MHz below or 
7.4 MHz above the video carrier frequency on which the TV interface 
device is operated shall not exceed the following:
    (i) For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device used 
with a master antenna, 692.8 times the square root of (R).
    (ii) For all other TV interface devices, 10.95 times the square root 
of (R).
    (3) The term master antenna used in this section refers to TV 
interface devices employed for central distribution of television or 
other video signals within a building. Such TV interface devices must be 
designed to:
    (i) Distribute multiple television signals at the same time;
    (ii) Distribute such signals by cable to outlets or TV receivers in 
multiple rooms in the building in which the TV interface devices are 
installed; and,
    (iii) Distribute all over-the-air or cable signals.

    Note: Cable-ready video cassette recorders continue to be subject to 
the provisions for general TV interface devices.

    (c) A TV interface device shall be equipped with a transfer switch 
for connecting the antenna terminals of a receiver selectively either to 
the receiving antenna or to the radio frequency output of the TV 
interface device, subject to the following:
    (1) When measured in any of its set positions, transfer switches 
shall comply with the following requirements:
    (i) For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device 
equipped for use with a cable system or a master antenna, as defined in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the isolation between the antenna and 
cable input terminals shall be at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at 
least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 
806 MHz. The 80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard 
applies at 550 MHz. In the case of a transfer switch requiring a power 
source, the required isolation shall be maintained in the event the 
device is not connected to a power source or power is interrupted. The 
provisions of this paragraph regarding frequencies in the range 550 MHz 
to 806 MHz are applicable as of June 30, 1997.
    (ii) For all other TV interface devices, the maximum voltage,

    (B) Recommended in the instruction manual, or
    (C) Normally employed by the consumer.
    (2) A TV interface device shall be designed and constructed, to the 
extent practicable, so as to preclude the possibility that the consumer 
may inadvertently attach the output of the device to the receiving 
antenna, if any, without first going through the transfer switch.
    (3) A transfer switch is not required for a TV interface device 
that, when connected, results in the user no longer having any need to 
receive standard over-the-air broadcast signals via a separate antenna. 
A transfer switch is not required to be marketed with a

[[Page 779]]

cable system terminal device unless that device provides for the 
connection of an external antenna. A transfer switch is not required for 
a device that is intended to be used as an accessory to an authorized TV 
interface device.
    (4) An actual transfer switch is not required for a TV interface 
device, including a cable system terminal device, that has an antenna 
input terminal(s); provided, the circuitry following the antenna input 
terminal(s) has sufficient bandwidth to allow the reception of all TV 
broadcast channels authorized under part 73 of this chapter and: For a 
cable system terminal device that can alternate between the reception of 
cable television service and an antenna, compliance with the isolation 
requirement specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section can be 
demonstrated; and, for all other TV interface devices, the maximum 
voltage appearing at the antenna terminal(s) does not exceed the limit 
in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (5) If a transfer switch is not required, the following label shall 
be used in addition to the label shown in Sec. 15.19(a):

    This device is intended to be attached to a receiver that is not 
used to receive over-the-air broadcast signals. Connection of this 
device in any other fashion may cause harmful interference to radio 
communications and is in violation of the FCC Rules, part 15.

    (d) A TV interface device, including a cable system terminal device, 
shall incorporate circuitry to automatically prevent emanations from the 
device from exceeding the technical specifications in this part. These 
circuits shall be adequate to accomplish their functions when the TV 
interface device is presented, if applicable, with video input signal 
levels in the range of one to five volts; this requirement is not 
applicable to a TV interface device that uses a built-in signal source 
and has no provisions for the connection of an external signal source. 
For devices that contain provisions for an external signal source but do 
not contain provisions for the input of an external baseband signal, 
e.g., some cable system terminal devices, compliance with the provisions 
of this paragraph shall be demonstrated with a radio frequency input 
signal of 0 to 25 dBmV.
    (e) For cable system terminal devices and TV interface devices used 
with a master antenna, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
the holder of the grant of authorization shall specify in the 
instruction manual or pamphlet, if a manual is not provided, the types 
of wires or coaxial cables necessary to ensure that the unit complies 
with the requirements of this part. The holder of the grant of 
authorization must comply with the provisions of Sec. 15.27. For all 
other TV interface devices, the wires or coaxial cables used to couple 
the output signals to the TV receiver shall be provided by the 
responsible party.
    (f) A TV interface device which is submitted to the Commission as a 
composite device in a single enclosure containing a RF modulator, video 
source and other component devices shall be submitted on a single 
application (FCC Form 731) and shall be authorized as a single device.
    (g) An external device or accessory that is intended to be attached 
to a TV interface device shall comply with the technical and 
administrative requirements set out in the rules under which it 
operates. For example, a personal computer must be certificated to show 
compliance with the regulations for digital devices.
    (h) Stand-alone switches used to alternate between cable service and 
an antenna shall provide isolation between the antenna and cable input 
terminals that is at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB 
from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz. The 
80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard applies at 550 
MHz. In the case of stand-alone switches requiring a power source, the 
required isolation shall be maintained in the event the device is not 
connected to a power source or power is interrupted. The provisions of 
this paragraph are applicable as of June 30, 1997.
    (i) Switches and other devices intended to be used to by-pass the 
processing circuitry of a cable system terminal device, whether internal 
to such a terminal device or a stand-alone unit, shall not attenuate the 
input signal more than 6 dB from 54 MHz to 550 MHz, or more than 8 dB 
from 550 MHz

[[Page 780]]

to 804 MHz. The 6 dB standard applies at 550 MHz. The provisions of this 
paragraph are applicable June 30, 1997.

Sec. 15.117  TV broadcast receivers.

    (a) All TV broadcast receivers shipped in interstate commerce or 
imported into the United States, for sale or resale to the public, shall 
comply with the provisions of this section, except that paragraphs (f) 
and (g) of this section shall not apply to the features of such sets 
that provide for reception of digital television signals. The reference 
in this section to TV broadcast receivers also includes devices, such as 
TV interface devices and set-top devices that are intended to provide 
audio-video signals to a video monitor, that incorporate the tuner 
portion of a TV broadcast receiver and that are equipped with an antenna 
or antenna terminals that can be used for off-the-air reception of TV 
broadcast signals, as authorized under part 73 of this chapter.
    (b) TV broadcast receivers shall be capable of adequately receiving 
all channels allocated by the Commission to the television broadcast 
service.
    (c) On a given receiver, use of the UHF and VHF tuning systems shall 
provide approximately the same degree of tuning accuracy with 
approximately the same expenditure of time and effort: Provided, 
however, That this requirement will be considered to be met if the need 
for routine fine tuning is eliminated on UHF channels.
    (1) Basic tuning mechanism. If a TV broadcast receiver is equipped 
to provide for repeated access to VHF television channels at discrete 
tuning positions, that receiver shall be equipped to provide for 
repeated access to a minimum of six UHF television channels at discrete 
tuning positions. Unless a discrete tuning position is provided for each 
channel allocated to UHF television, each position shall be readily 
adjustable to a particular UHF channel by the user without the use of 
tools. If 12 or fewer discrete tuning positions are provided, each 
position shall be adjustable to receive any channel allocated to UHF 
television.

    Note: The combination of detented rotary switch and pushbutton 
controls is acceptable, provided UHF channels, after their initial 
selection, can be accurately tuned with an expenditure of time and 
effort approximately the same as that used in accurately tuning VHF 
channels. A UHF tuning system comprising five pushbuttons and a separate 
manual tuning knob is considered to provide repeated access to six 
channels at discrete tuning positions. A one-knob (VHF/UHF) tuning 
system providing repeated access to 11 or more discrete tuning positions 
is also acceptable, provided each of the tuning positions is readily 
adjustable, without the use of tools, to receive any UHF channel.

    (2) Tuning controls and channel readout. UHF tuning controls and 
channel readout on a given receiver shall be comparable in size, 
location, accessibility and legibility to VHF controls and readout on 
that receiver.

    Note: Differences between UHF and VHF channel readout that follow 
directly from the larger number of UHF television channels available are 
acceptable if it is clear that a good faith effort to comply with the 
provisions of this section has been made.

    (d) If equipment and controls that tend to simplify, expedite or 
perfect the reception of television signals (e.g., AFC, visual aids, 
remote control, or signal seeking capability referred to generally as 
tuning aids) are incorporated into the VHF portion of a TV broadcast 
receiver, tuning aids of the same type and comparable capability and 
quality shall be provided for the UHF portion of that receiver.
    (e) If a television receiver has an antenna affixed to the VHF 
antenna terminals, it must have an antenna designed for and capable of 
receiving all UHF television channels affixed to the UHF antenna 
terminals. If a VHF antenna is provided with but not affixed to a 
receiver, a UHF antenna shall be provided with the receiver.
    (f) The picture sensitivity of a TV broadcast receiver averaged for 
all channels between 14 and 69 inclusive shall not be more than 8dB 
larger than the peak picture sensitivity of that receiver averaged for 
all channels between 2 and 13 inclusive.
    (g) The noise figure for any television channel 14 to 69 inclusive 
shall not exceed 14 dB. A TV receiver model is considered to comply with 
this noise figure if the maximum noise figure for

[[Page 781]]

channels 14-69 inclusive of 97.5% of all receivers within that model 
does not exceed 14 dB.
    (1) The responsible party shall measure the noise figure of a number 
of UHF channels of the test sample to give reasonable assurance that the 
UHF noise figure for each channel complies with the above limit.
    (2) The responsible party shall insert in his files a statement 
explaining the basis on which it will rely to ensure that at least 97.5% 
of all production units of the test sample that are manufactured have a 
noise figure of no greater than 14 dB.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) In the case of a TV tuner built-in as part of a video tape 
recorder that uses a power splitter between the antenna terminals of the 
video tape recorder and the input terminals of the TV tuner or a TV 
broadcast receiver that uses a power splitter between the antenna 
terminals of two or more UHF tuners contained within that receiver, 4 dB 
may be subtracted from the noise figure measured at the antenna 
terminals of the video tape recorder or TV broadcast receiver for 
determining compliance of the UHF tuner(s) with the 14 dB noise figure 
limit.
    (h) Digital television reception capability. TV broadcast receivers 
are required only to provide useable picture and sound commensurate with 
their video and audio capabilities when receiving digital television 
signals.
    (i) Digital television reception capability implementation schedule. 
(1) Responsible parties, as defined in Sec. 2.909 of this chapter, are 
required to equip new TV broadcast receivers that are shipped in 
interstate commerce or imported from any foreign country into the United 
States and for which they are responsible to comply with the provisions 
of this section in accordance with the following schedule:
    (i) Receivers with screen sizes 36<gr-thn-eq> and above--50% of all 
of a responsible party's units must include DTV tuners effective July 1, 
2004; 100% of such units must include DTV tuners effective July 1, 2005.
    (ii) Receivers with screen sizes 25<gr-thn-eq> to less than 
36<gr-thn-eq>--50% of all of a responsible party's units must include 
DTV tuners effective July 1, 2005; 100% of such units must include DTV 
tuners effective March 1, 2006.
    (iii) Receivers with screen sizes less than 25[sec]--100% of all 
such units must include DTV tuners effective March 1, 2007.
    (iv) Other video devices (videocassette recorders (VCRs), digital 
video recorders such as hard drive and DVD recorders, etc.) that receive 
television signals--100% of all such units must include DTV tuners 
effective March 1, 2007.
    (2) For purposes of this implementation schedule, screen sizes are 
to be measured diagonally across the picture viewing area.
    (3) Responsible parties may include combinations of DTV monitors and 
set-top DTV tuners in meeting the required percentages of units with a 
DTV tuner if such combinations are marketed together with a single 
price.
    (4) The requirement to include digital television reception 
capability in new TV broadcast receivers does not apply to devices such 
as mobile telephones and personal digital assistants where such devices 
do not include the capability to receive TV service on the frequencies 
allocated for broadcast television service.
    (j) For a TV broadcast receiver equipped with a cable input selector 
switch, the selector switch shall provide, in any of its set positions, 
isolation between the antenna and cable input terminals of at least 80 
dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at 
least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz. The 80 dB standard applies at 216 
MHz and the 60 dB standard applies at 550 MHz. In the case of a selector 
switch requiring a power source, the required isolation shall be 
maintained in the event the device is not connected to a power source or 
power is interrupted. An actual switch that can alternate between 
reception of cable television service and an antenna is not required for 
a TV broadcast receiver, provided compliance with the isolation 
requirement specified in this paragraph can be demonstrated and the 
circuitry following the antenna input terminal(s) has sufficient band-
width to allow the reception of all TV broadcast channels authorized 
under this chapter. The provisions

[[Page 782]]

of this paragraph regarding frequencies in the range 550 MHz to 806 MHz 
are applicable as of June 30, 1997.
    (k) The following requirements apply to all responsible parties, as 
defined in Sec. 2.909 of this chapter, and any person that displays or 
offers for sale or rent television receiving equipment that is not 
capable of receiving, decoding and tuning digital signals.
    (1) Such parties and persons shall place conspicuously and in close 
proximity to such television broadcast receivers a sign containing, in 
clear and conspicuous print, the Consumer Alert disclosure text required 
by paragraph (k)(3) of this section. The text should be in a size of 
type large enough to be clear, conspicuous and readily legible, 
consistent with the dimensions of the equipment and the label. The 
information may be printed on a transparent material and affixed to the 
screen, if the receiver includes a display, in a manner that is 
removable by the consumer and does not obscure the picture, or, if the 
receiver does not include a display, in a prominent location on the 
device, such as on the top or front of the device, when displayed for 
sale, or the information in this format may be displayed separately 
immediately adjacent to each television broadcast receiver offered for 
sale and clearly associated with the analog-only model to which it 
pertains.
    (2) If such parties and persons display or offer for sale or rent 
such television broadcast receivers via direct mail, catalog, or 
electronic means, they shall prominently display in close proximity to 
the images or descriptions of such television broadcast receivers, in 
clear and conspicuous print, the Consumer Alert disclosure text required 
by paragraph (k)(3) of this section. The text should be in a size large 
enough to be clear, conspicuous, and readily legible, consistent with 
the dimensions of the advertisement or description.
    (3) Consumer alert. This television receiver has only an analog 
broadcast tuner and will require a converter box after February 17, 
2009, to receive over-the-air broadcasts with an antenna because of the 
Nation's transition to digital broadcasting. Analog-only TVs should 
continue to work as before with cable and satellite TV services, gaming 
consoles, VCRs, DVD players, and similar products. For more information, 
call the Federal Communications Commission at 1-888-225-5322 (TTY: 1-
888-835-5322) or visit the Commission's digital television Web site at:

Sec. 15.118  Cable ready consumer electronics equipment.

    (a) All consumer electronics TV receiving equipment marketed in the 
United States as cable ready or cable compatible shall comply with the 
provisions of this section. Consumer electronics TV receiving equipment 
that includes features intended for use with cable service but does not 
fully comply with the provisions of this section are subject to the 
labelling requirements of Sec. 15.19(d). Until such time as generally 
accepted testing standards are developed, paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section will apply only to the analog portion of covered consumer 
electronics TV receiving equipment
    (b) Cable ready consumer electronics equipment shall be capable of 
receiving all NTSC or similar video channels on channels 1 through 125 
of the channel allocation plan set forth in CEA-542-B: ``CEA Standard: 
Cable Television Channel Identification Plan,'' (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 15.38).
    (c) Cable ready consumer electronics equipment must meet the 
following technical performance requirements. Compliance with these 
requirements shall be determined by performing measurements at the 
unfiltered IF output port. Where appropriate, the Commission will 
consider allowing alternative measurement methods.
    (1) Adjacent channel interference. In the presence of a lower 
adjacent channel CW signal that is 1.5 MHz below the desired visual 
carrier in frequency and 10 dB below the desired visual carrier in 
amplitude, spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated 
at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired signal. The 
desired input signal shall be an NTSC visual carrier modulated with a 10 
IRE flat field with

[[Page 783]]

color burst and the aural carrier which is 10 dB below the visual 
carrier should be unmodulated. Measurements are to be performed for 
input signal levels of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV, with the receiver tuned to 
ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 54 MHz to 804 
MHz.
    (2) Image channel interference. Image channel interference within 
the IF passband shall be attenuated below the visual carrier of the 
desired channel by at least 60 dB from 54 MHz to 714 MHz and 50 dB from 
714 MHz to 804 MHz. The 60 dB standard applies at 714 MHz. In testing 
for compliance with this standard, the desired input signal is to be an 
NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat 
field with color burst and the aural carrier is unmodulated and 10 dB 
below the visual carrier. The undesired test signal shall be a CW signal 
equal in amplitude to the desired visual carrier and located 90 MHz 
above the visual carrier frequency of the desired channel. Measurements 
shall be performed for input signals of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV, with the 
receiver tuned to at least ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels 
covering the band 54 MHz to 804 MHz.
    (3) Direct pickup interference. The direct pickup (DPU) of a co-
channel interfering ambient field by a cable ready device shall not 
exceed the following criteria. The ratio of the desired to undesired 
signal levels at the IF passband on each channel shall be at least 45 
dB. The average ratio over the six channels shall be at least 50 dB. The 
desired input signal shall be an NTSC signal having a visual carrier 
level of 0 dBmV. The visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat 
field with color burst, visual to aural carrier ratio of 10 dB, aural 
carrier unmodulated. The equipment under test (EUT) shall be placed on a 
rotatable table that is one meter in height. Any excess length of the 
power cord and other connecting leads shall be coiled on the floor under 
the table. The EUT shall be immersed in a horizontally polarized uniform 
CW field of 100 mV/m at a frequency 2.55 MHz above the visual carrier of 
the EUT tuned channel. Measurements shall be made with the EUT tuned to 
six EIA IS-132 channels, two each in the low VHF, high VHF and UHF 
broadcast bands. On each channel, the levels at the IF passband due to 
the desired and interfering signals are to be measured.
    (4) Tuner overload. Spurious signals within the IF passband shall be 
attenuated at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired 
channel using a comb-like spectrum input with each visual carrier signal 
individually set at +15 dBmV from 54 to 550 MHz. The desired input 
signal is to be an NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated 
with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier is 
unmodulated and 10 dB below the visual carrier. Measurements shall be 
made with the receiver tuned to at least seven evenly spaced EIA IS-132 
channels covering the band 54 MHz to 550 MHz. In addition, spurious 
signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 51 dB below 
the visual carrier of the desired channel using a comb spectrum input 
with each signal individually set at +15 dBmV from 550 to 804 MHz. 
Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least three 
evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 550 MHz to 804 MHz.
    (5) Cable input conducted emissions. (i) Conducted spurious 
emissions that appear at the cable input to the device must meet the 
following criteria. The input shall be an NTSC video carrier modulated 
with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst at a level of 0 dBmV and with 
a visual to aural ratio of 10 dB. The aural carrier shall be 
unmodulated. The peak level of the spurious signals will be measured 
using a spectrum analyzer connected by a directional coupler to the 
cable input of the equipment under test. Spurious signal levels must not 
exceed the limits in the following table:

From 54 MHz up to and including 300 MHz-26 dBmV
From 300 MHz up to and including 450 MHz-20 dBmV
From 450 MHz up to and including 804 MHz-15 dBmV

    (ii) The average of the measurements on multiple channels from 450 
MHz up to and including 804 MHz shall be no greater than -20 dBmV. 
Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned

[[Page 784]]

to at least four EIA IS-132 channels in each of the above bands. The 
test channels are to be evenly distributed across each of the bands. 
Measurements for conducted emissions caused by sources internal to the 
device are to be made in a shielded room. Measurements for conducted 
emissions caused by external signal sources shall be made in an ambient 
RF field whose field strength is 100 mV/m, following the same test 
conditions as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (d) The field strength of radiated emissions from cable ready 
consumer electronics equipment shall not exceed the limits in Sec. 
15.109(a) when measured in accordance with the applicable procedures 
specified in Sec. Sec. 15.31 and 15.35 for unintentional radiators, 
with the following modifications. During testing the NTSC input signal 
level is to be +15 dBmV, with a visual to aural ratio of 10 dB. The 
visual carrier is to be modulated by a 10 IRE flat field with color 
burst; the aural carrier is to be unmodulated. Measurements are to be 
taken on six EIA IS-132 channels evenly spaced across the required RF 
input range of the equipment under test.

    Note: The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section 
are applicable as of June 30, 1997.

<R05>
Sec. 15.119  Closed caption decoder requirements for analog television receivers.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1993, all TV broadcast receivers with picture 
screens 33 cm (13 in) or larger in diameter shipped in interstate 
commerce, manufactured, assembled, or imported from any foreign country 
into the United States shall comply with the provisions of this section.

    Note: This paragraph places no restriction on the shipping or sale 
of television receivers that were manufactured before July 1, 1993.

    (b) Transmission format. Closed-caption information is transmitted 
on line 21 of field 1 of the vertical blanking interval of television 
signals, in accordance with Sec. 73.682(a)(22) of this chapter.
    (c) Operating modes. The television receiver will employ customer-
selectable modes of operation for TV and Caption. A third mode of 
operation, Text, may be included on an optional basis. The Caption and 
Text Modes may contain data in either of two operating channels, 
referred to in this document as C1 and C2. The television receiver must 
decode both C1 and C2 captioning, and must display the captioning for 
whichever channel the user selects. The TV Mode of operation allows the 
video to be viewed in its original form. The Caption and Text Modes 
define one or more areas (called ``boxes'') on the screen within which 
caption or text characters are displayed.

    Note: For more information regarding Text mode, see ``Television 
Captioning for the Deaf: Signal and Display Specifications'', 
Engineering Report No. E-7709-C, Public Broadcasting Service, dated May 
1980, and ``TeleCaption II Decoder Module Performance Specification'', 
National Captioning Institute, Inc., dated November 1985. These 
documents are available, respectively, from the Public Broadcasting 
Service, 1320 Braddock Place, Alexandria, VA 22314 and from the National 
Captioning Institute, Inc., 5203 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041.

    (d) Screen format. The display area for captioning and text shall 
fall approximately within the safe caption area as defined in paragraph 
(n)(12) of this section. This display area will be further divided into 
15 character rows of equal height and 32 columns of equal width, to 
provide accurate placement of text on the screen. Vertically, the 
display area begins on line 43 and is 195 lines high, ending on line 237 
on an interlaced display. All captioning and text shall fall within 
these established columns and rows. The characters must be displayed 
clearly separated from the video over which they are placed. In 
addition, the user must have the capability to select a black background 
over which the captioned letters are displaced.
    (1) Caption mode. In the Caption Mode, text can appear on up to 4 
rows simultaneously anywhere on the screen within the defined display 
area. In addition, a solid space equal to one column width may be placed 
before the first character and after the last character of each row to 
enhance legibility.

[[Page 785]]

The caption area will be transparent anywhere that either:
    (i) No standard space character or other character has been 
addressed and no accompanying solid space is needed; or,
    (ii) An accompanying solid space is used and a ``transparent space'' 
special character has been addressed which does not immediately precede 
or follow a displayed character.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Presentation format. In analyzing the presentation of 
characters, it is convenient to think in terms of a non-visible cursor 
which marks the screen position at which the next event in a given mode 
and data channel will occur. The receiver remembers the cursor position 
for each mode even when data are received for a different address in an 
alternate mode or data channel.
    (1) Screen addressing. Two kinds of control codes are used to move 
the cursor to specific screen locations. In Caption Mode, these 
addressing codes will affect both row and column positioning. In Text 
Mode, the codes affect only column positioning. In both modes, the 
addressing codes are optional. Default positions are defined for each 
mode and style when no addressing code is provided.
    (i) The first type of addressing code is the Preamble Address Code 
(PAC). It assigns a row number and one of eight ``indent'' figures. Each 
successive indent moves the cursor four columns to the right (starting 
from the left margin). Thus, an indent of 0 places the cursor at Column 
1, an indent of 4 sets it at Column 5, etc. The PAC indent is non-
destructive to displayable characters. It will not affect the display to 
the left of the new cursor position on the indicated row. Note that 
Preamble Address Codes also set initial attributes for the displayable 
characters which follow. See paragraph (h) of this section and the 
Preamble Address Code table.
    (ii) The second type of addressing code is the Tab Offset, which is 
one of three Miscellaneous Control Codes. Tab Offset will move the 
cursor one, two, or three columns to the right. The character cells 
skipped over will be unaffected; displayable characters in these cells, 
if any, will remain intact while empty cells will remain empty, in the 
same manner that a PAC indent is non-destructive.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) Caption Mode. There are three styles of presenting text in 
Caption Mode: roll-up, pop-on, and paint-on. Character display varies 
significantly with the style used, but certain rules of character 
erasure are common to all styles. A character can be erased by 
addressing another character to the same screen location or by 
backspacing over the character from a subsequent location on the same 
row. The entire displayed memory will be erased instantly by receipt of 
an Erase Displayed Memory command. Both displayed memory and non-
displayed memory will be entirely erased simultaneously by either: The 
user switching receiver channels or data channels (C1/C2) or fields (F1/
F2) in decoders so equipped; the loss of valid data (see paragraph (j) 
of this section); or selecting non-captioning receiver functions which 
use the display memory of the decoder. Receipt of an End of Caption 
command will cause a displayed caption to become non-displayed (and vice 
versa) without being erased from memory. Changing the receiver to a non-
captioning mode which does not require use of the decoder's display 
memory will leave that memory intact, and the decoder will continue to 
process data as if the caption display were selected.
    (1) Roll-up. Roll-up style captioning is initiated by receipt of one 
of three Miscellaneous Control Codes that determine the maximum number 
of rows displayed simultaneously, either 2, 3 or 4 contiguous rows. 
These are the three Roll-Up Caption commands.
    (i) The bottom row of the display is known as the ``base row''. The 
cursor always remains on the base row. Rows of text roll upwards into 
the contiguous rows immediately above the base row to create a 
``window'' 2 to 4 rows high.
    (ii) The Roll-Up command, in normal practice, will be followed (not 
necessarily immediately) by a Preamble Address Code indicating the base 
row and the horizontal indent position. If no Preamble Address Code is 
received, the base row will default to Row 15 or,

[[Page 786]]

if a roll-up caption is currently displayed, to the same base row last 
received, and the cursor will be placed at Column 1. If the Preamble 
Address Code received contains a different base row than that of a 
currently displayed caption, the entire window will move intact (and 
without erasing) to the new base row immediately.
    (iii) Each time a Carriage Return is received, the text in the top 
row of the window is erased from memory and from the display or scrolled 
off the top of the window. The remaining rows of text are each rolled up 
into the next highest row in the window, leaving the base row blank and 
ready to accept new text. This roll-up must appear smooth to the user, 
and must take no more than 0.433 second to complete. The cursor is 
automatically placed at Column 1 (pending receipt of a Preamble Address 
Code).
    (iv) Increasing or decreasing the number of roll-up rows instantly 
changes the size of the active display window, appropriately turning on 
or off the display of the top one or two rows. A row which is turned off 
should also be erased from memory.
    (v) Characters are always displayed immediately when received by the 
receiver. Once the cursor reaches the 32nd column position on any row, 
all subsequent characters received prior to a Carriage Return, Preamble 
Address Code, or Backspace will be displayed in that column replacing 
any previous character occupying that address.
    (vi) The cursor moves automatically one column to the right after 
each character or Mid-Row Code received. A Backspace will move the 
cursor one column to the left, erasing the character or Mid-Row Code 
occupying that location. (A Backspace received when the cursor is in 
Column 1 will be ignored.)
    (vii) The Delete to End of Row command will erase from memory any 
characters or control codes starting at the current cursor location and 
in all columns to its right on the same row. If no displayable 
characters remain on the row after the Delete to End of Row is acted 
upon, the solid space (if any) for that row should also be erased to 
conform with the following provisions.
    (viii) If a solid space is used for legibility, it should appear 
when the first displayable character (not a transparent space) or Mid-
Row Code is received on a row, not when the Preamble Address Code, if 
any, is given. A row on which there are no displayable characters or 
Mid-Row Codes will not display a solid space, even when rolled up 
between two rows which do display a solid space.
    (ix) If the reception of data for a row is interrupted by data for 
the alternate data channel or for Text Mode, the display of caption text 
will resume from the same cursor position if a Roll-Up Caption command 
is received and no Preamble Address Code is given which would move the 
cursor.
    (x) A roll-up caption remains displayed until one of the standard 
caption erasure techniques is applied. Receipt of a Resume Caption 
Loading command (for pop-on style) or a Resume Direct Captioning command 
(for paint-on style) will not affect a roll-up display. Receipt of a 
Roll-Up Caption command will cause any pop-on or paint-on caption to be 
erased from displayed memory and non-displayed memory.
    (2) Pop-on. Pop-on style captioning is initiated by receipt of a 
Resume Caption Loading command. Subsequent data are loaded into a non-
displayed memory and held there until an End of Caption command is 
received, at which point the non-displayed memory becomes the displayed 
memory and vice versa. (This process is often referred to as ``flipping 
memories'' and does not automatically erase memory.) An End of Caption 
command forces the receiver into pop-on style if no Resume Caption 
Loading command has been received which would do so. The display will be 
capable of 4 full rows, not necessarily contiguous, simultaneous 
anywhere on the screen.
    (i) Preamble Address Codes can be used to move the cursor around the 
screen in random order to place captions on Rows 1 to 15. Carriage 
Returns have no effect on cursor location during caption loading.
    (ii) The cursor moves automatically one column to the right after 
each character or Mid-Row Code received. Receipt of a Backspace will 
move the

[[Page 787]]

cursor one column to the left, erasing the character or Mid-Row Code 
occupying that location. (A Backspace received when the cursor is in 
Column 1 will be ignored.) Once the cursor reaches the 32nd column 
position on any row, all subsequent characters received prior to a 
Backspace, an End of Caption, or a Preamble Address Code, will replace 
any previous character at that location.
    (iii) The Delete to End of Row command will erase from memory any 
characters or control codes starting at the current cursor location and 
in all columns to its right on the same row. If no displayable 
characters remain on a row after the Delete to End of Row is acted upon, 
the solid space (if any) for that element should also be erased.
    (iv) If data reception is interrupted during caption loading by data 
for the alternate caption channel or for Text Mode, caption loading will 
resume at the same cursor position if a Resume Caption Loading command 
is received and no Preamble Address Code is given that would move the 
cursor.
    (v) Characters remain in non-displayed memory until an End of 
Caption command flips memories. The caption will be erased without being 
displayed upon receipt of an Erase Non-Displayed Memory command, a Roll-
Up Caption command, or if the user switches receiver channels, data 
channels or fields, or upon the loss of valid data (see paragraph (j) of 
this section).
    (vi) A pop-on caption, once displayed, remains displayed until one 
of the standard caption erasure techniques is applied or until a Roll-Up 
Caption command is received. Characters within a displayed pop-on 
caption will be replaced by receipt of the Resume Direct Captioning 
command and paint-on style techniques (see below).
    (3) Paint-on. Paint-on style captioning is initiated by receipt of a 
Resume Direct Captioning command. Subsequent data are addressed 
immediately to displayed memory without need for an End of Caption 
command.
    (i) Preamble Address Codes can be used to move the cursor around the 
screen in random order to display captions on Rows 1 to 15. Carriage 
Returns have no affect on cursor location during direct captioning. The 
cursor moves automatically one column to the right after each character 
or Mid-Row Code is received. Receipt of a Backspace will move the cursor 
one column to the left, erasing the character or Mid-Row Code occupying 
that location. (A Backspace received when the cursor is in Column 1 will 
be ignored.) Once the cursor reaches the 32nd column position on any 
row, all subsequent characters received prior to a Preamble Address Code 
or Backspace will be displayed in that column replacing any previous 
character occupying that location.
    (ii) The Delete to End of Row command will erase from memory any 
characters or control codes starting at the current cursor location and 
in all columns to its right on the same row. If no displayable 
characters remain on the row after the Delete to End of Row is acted 
upon, the solid space (if any) for that element should also be erased.
    (iii) If the reception of data is interrupted during the direct 
captioning by data for the alternate caption channel or for Text Mode, 
the display of caption text will resume at the same cursor position if a 
Resume Direct Captioning command is received and no Preamble Address 
Code is given which would move the cursor.
    (iv) Characters remain displayed until one of the standard caption 
erasure techniques is applied or until a Roll-Up Caption command is 
received. An End of Caption command leaves a paint-on caption fully 
intact in non-displayed memory. In other words, a paint-on style caption 
behaves precisely like a pop-on style caption which has been displayed.
    (g) Character format. Characters are to be displayed on the screen 
within a character ``cell'' which is the height and width of a single 
row and column. The following codes define the displayable character 
set. Television receivers manufactured prior to January 1, 1996 and 
having a character resolution of 5x7 dots, or less, may display the 
allowable alternate characters in the character table. A statement must 
be in a prominent location on the box or other package in which the 
receiver is to be marketed, and information

[[Page 788]]

must be in the owner's manual, indicating the receiver displays closed 
captioning in upper case only.

    These require two bytes for each symbol. Each hex code as shown will 
be preceded by a 11h for data channel 1 or by a 19h for data channel 2. 
For example: 19h 37h will place a musical note in data channel 2.

    (h) Character Attributes--(1) Transmission of Attributes. A 
character may be transmitted with any or all of four attributes: Color, 
italics, underline, and flash. All of these attributes are set by 
control codes included in the received data. An attribute will remain in 
effect until changed by another control code or until the end of the row 
is reached. Each row begins with a control code which sets the color and 
underline attributes. (White non-underlined is the default display 
attribute if no Preamble Address Code is received before the first 
character on an empty row.) Attributes are not affected by transparent 
spaces within a row.
    (i) All Mid-Row Codes and the Flash On command are spacing 
attributes which appear in the display just as if a standard space (20h) 
had been received. Preamble Address Codes are non-spacing and will not 
alter any attributes when used to position the cursor in the midst of a 
row of characters.
    (ii) The color attribute has the highest priority and can only be 
changed by the Mid-Row Code of another color. Italics has the next 
highest priority. If characters with both color and italics are desired, 
the italics Mid-Row Code must follow the color assignment. Any color 
Mid-Row Code will turn off italics. If the least significant bit of a 
Preamble Address Code or of a color or italics Mid-Row Code is a 1 
(high), underlining is turned on. If that bit is a 0 (low), underlining 
is off.
    (iii) The flash attribute is transmitted as a Miscellaneous Control 
Code. The Flash On command will not alter the status of the color, 
italics, or underline attributes. However, any color or italics Mid-Row 
Code will turn off flash.
    (iv) Thus, for example, if a red, italicized, underlined, flashing 
character is desired, the attributes must be received in the following 
order: a red Mid-Row or Preamble Address Code, an italics Mid-Row Code 
with underline bit, and the Flash On command. The character will then be 
preceded by three spaces (two if red was assigned via a Preamble Address 
Code).
    (2) Display of attributes. The underline attribute will be displayed 
by drawing a line beneath the character in the same color as the 
character. The flash attribute will be displayed by causing the 
character to blink from the display at least once per second. The italic 
attribute must be capable of being displayed by either a special italic 
font, or by the modification of the standard font by slanting. The user 
may be given the option to select other methods of italic display as 
well. The support of the color attributes is optional. If the color 
attributes are supported, they will be displayed in the color they have 
been assigned. If color attributes are not supported, the display may be 
in color, but all color changes will be ignored.
    (i) Control codes. There are three different types of control codes 
used to identify the format, location, attributes, and display of 
characters: Preamble Address Codes, Mid-Row Codes, and Miscellaneous 
Control Codes.
    (1) Each control code consists of a pair of bytes which are always 
transmitted together in a single field of line 21 and which are normally 
transmitted twice in succession to help insure correct reception of the 
control instructions. The first of the control code bytes is a non-
printing character in the range 10h to 1Fh. The second byte is always a 
printing character in the range 20h to 7Fh. Any such control code pair 
received which has not been assigned a function is ignored. If the non-
printing character in the pair is in the range 00h to 0Fh, that 
character alone will be ignored and the second character will be treated 
normally.
    (2) If the second byte of a control code pair does not contain odd 
parity (see paragraph (j) of this section), then the pair is ignored. 
The redundant transmission of the pair will be the instruction upon 
which the receiver acts.
    (3) If the first byte of the first transmission of a control code 
pair fails the parity check, then that byte is inserted into the 
currently active memory as a solid block character (7Fh) followed by 
whatever the second byte is. Again, the redundant transmission of the 
pair will be the controlling instruction.
    (4) If the first transmission of a control code pair passes parity, 
it is acted upon within one video frame. If the next frame contains a 
perfect repeat of

[[Page 790]]

the same pair, the redundant code is ignored. If, however, the next 
frame contains a different but also valid control code pair, this pair, 
too, will be acted upon (and the receiver will expect a repeat of this 
second pair in the next frame). If the first byte of the expected 
redundant control code pair fails the parity check and the second byte 
is identical to the second byte in the immediately preceding pair, then 
the expected redundant code is ignored. If there are printing characters 
in place of the redundant code, they will be processed normally.
    (5) There is provision for decoding a second data channel. The 
second data channel is encoded with the same control codes and 
procedures already described. The first byte of every control code pair 
indicates the data channel (C1/C2) to which the command applies. Control 
codes which do not match the data channel selected by the user, and all 
subsequent data related to that control code, are ignored by the 
receiver.

Note: All indent codes (second byte equals 50h-5fh, 70th-7fh) assign white as the color attribute.

    (j) Data rejection. The receiver should provide an effective 
procedure to verify data. A receiver will reject data if the data is 
invalid, or if the data is directed to the data channel or field not 
selected by the user. Invalid data is any data that fails to pass a 
check for odd parity, or which, having passed the parity check, is 
assigned no function.
    (1) If a print character fails to pass a check for parity, a solid 
block (7Fh) should be displayed in place of the failed character. In 
addition, valid data can be corrupted in many ways and may not be 
suitable for display. For example, repeated fields, skipped fields and 
altered field sequences are all possible from consumer video equipment 
and might present meaningless captions.
    (2) The receiver will ignore data rejected due to being directed to 
a deselected field or channel. However, this will not cause the display 
to be disabled.
    (k) Automatic display enable/disable. The receiver shall provide an 
automatic enable/disable capability to prevent the display of invalid or 
incomplete data, when the user selects the Caption Mode. The display 
should automatically become enable after the receiver verifies the data 
as described in paragraph (j) of this section. The display will be 
automatically disabled when there is a sustained detection of invalid 
data. The display will be re-enabled when the data verification process 
has been satisfied once again.
    (l) Compatibility with Cable Security Systems. Certain cable 
television security techniques, such as signal encryption and copy 
protection, can alter the television signal so that some methods of 
finding line 21 will not work. In particular, counting of lines or 
timing from the start of the vertical blanking interval may cause 
problems. Caption decoding circuitry must function properly when 
receiving signals from cable security systems that were designed and 
marketed prior to April 5, 1991. Further information concerning such 
systems is available from the National Cable Television Association, 
Inc., Washington, DC, and from the Electronic Industries Association, 
Washington, DC.
    (m) Labelling and consumer information requirements. The box or 
other package in which the individual television receiver is to be 
marketed shall carry a statement in a prominent location, visible to the 
buyer before purchase, which reads as follows:

    This television receiver provides display of television closed 
captioning in accordance with Sec. 15.119 of the FCC rules.


Receivers that do not support color attributes or text mode, as well as 
receivers that display only upper-case characters pursuant to paragraph 
(g) of this section, must include with the statement, and in the owner's 
manual, language indicating that those features are not supported.
    (n) Glossary of terms. The following terms are used to describe 
caption decoder specifications:
    (1) Base row: The bottom row of a roll-up display. The cursor always 
remains on the base row. Rows of text

[[Page 792]]

roll upwards into the contiguous rows immediately above the base row.
    (2) Box: The area surrounding the active character display. In Text 
Mode, the box is the entire screen area defined for display, whether or 
not displayable characters appear. In Caption Mode, the box is 
dynamically redefined by each caption and each element of displayable 
characters within a caption. The box (or boxes, in the case of a 
multiple-element caption) includes all the cells of the displayed 
characters, the non-transparent spaces between them, and one cell at the 
beginning and end of each row within a caption element in those decoders 
that use a solid space to improve legibility.
    (3) Caption window: The invisible rectangle which defines the top 
and bottom limits of a roll-up caption. The window can be 2 to 4 rows 
high. The lowest row of the window is called the base row.
    (4) Cell: The discrete screen area in which each displayable 
character or space may appear. A cell is one row high and one column 
wide.
    (5) Column: One of 32 vertical divisions of the screen, each of 
equal width, extending approximately across the full width of the safe 
caption area as defined in paragraph (n)(12) of this section. Two 
additional columns, one at the left of the screen and one at the right, 
may be defined for the appearance of a box in those decoders which use a 
solid space to improve legibility, but no displayable characters may 
appear in those additional columns. For reference, columns may be 
numbered 0 to 33, with columns 1 to 32 reserved for displayable 
characters.
    (6) Displayable character: Any letter, number or symbol which is 
defined for on-screen display, plus the 20h space.
    (7) Display disable: To turn off the display of captions or text 
(and accompanying background) at the receiver, rather than through codes 
transmitted on line 21 which unconditionally erase the display. The 
receiver may disable the display because the user selects an alternate 
mode, e.g., TV Mode, or because no valid line 21 data is present.
    (8) Display enable: To allow the display of captions or text when 
they are transmitted on line 21 and received as valid data. For display 
to be enabled, the user must have selected Caption Mode or Text Mode, 
and valid data for the selected mode must be present on line 21.
    (9) Element: In a pop-on or paint-on style caption, each contiguous 
area of cells containing displayable characters and non-transparent 
spaces between those characters. A single caption may have multiple 
elements. An element is not necessarily a perfect rectangle, but may 
include rows of differing widths.
    (10) Erase Display: In Caption Mode, to clear the screen of all 
characters (and accompanying background) in response to codes 
transmitted on line 21. (The caption service provider can accomplish the 
erasure either by sending an Erase Displayed Memory command or by 
sending an Erase Non-Displayed Memory command followed by an End of 
Caption command, effectively making a blank caption ``appear''.) Display 
can also be erased by the receiver when the caption memory erasure 
conditions are met, such as the user changing TV channels.
    (11) Row: One of 15 horizontal divisions of the screen, extending 
across the full height of the safe caption area as defined in paragraph 
(n)(12) of this section.
    (12) Safe caption area: The area of the television picture within 
which captioning and text shall be displayed to ensure visibility of the 
information on the majority of home television receivers. The safe 
caption area is specified as shown in the following figure:

[[Page 793]]

    (13) Special characters: Displayable characters (except for 
``transparent space'') which require a two-byte sequence of one non-
printing and one printing character. The non-printing byte varies 
depending on the data channel. Regular characters require unique one-
byte codes which are the same in either data channel.
    (14) Text: When written with an upper-case ``T'', refers to the Text 
Mode. When written with a lower-case ``t'', refers to any combination of 
displayable characters.
    (15) Transparent space: Transmitted as a special character, it is a 
one-column-wide space behind which program video is always visible 
(except when a transparent space immediately precedes or follows a 
displayable character and solid box is needed to make that character 
legible).

Sec. 15.120  Program blocking technology requirements for television receivers.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1999, manufacturers of television broadcast 
receivers as defined in section 15.3(w) of this chapter, including 
personal computer systems meeting that definition, must ensure that one-
half of their product models with picture screens 33 cm (13 in) or 
larger in diameter shipped in interstate commerce or manufactured in the 
United States comply with the

[[Page 794]]

provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.

    Note: This paragraph places no restrictions on the shipping or sale 
of television receivers that were manufactured before July 1999.

    (b) Effective January 1, 2000, all TV broadcast receivers as defined 
in Sec. 15.3(w), including personal computer systems meeting that 
definition, with picture screens 33 cm (13 in) or larger, measured 
diagonally, or with displays in the 16:9 aspect ratio that are 19.8 cm 
(7.8 in) or greater in height and digital television receivers without 
an associated display device shipped in interstate commerce or 
manufactured in the United States shall comply with the provisions of 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
    (c) Transmission format. (1) Analog television program rating 
information shall be transmitted on line 21 of field 2 of the vertical 
blanking interval of television signals, in accordance with Sec. 
73.682(a)(22) of this chapter.
    (2) Digital television program rating information shall be 
transmitted in digital television signals in accordance with Sec. 
73.682(d) of this chapter.
    (d) Operation. (1) Analog television receivers will receive program 
ratings transmitted pursuant to EIA-744: ``Transport of Content Advisory 
Information Using Extended Data Service (XDS)'' (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 15.38) and EIA-608: ``Recommended Practice for Line 
21 Data Service'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38). Blocking 
of programs shall occur when a program rating is received that meets the 
pre-determined user requirements.
    (2) Digital television receivers shall react in a similar manner as 
analog televisions when programmed to block specific rating categories. 
Effective March 15, 2006, digital television receivers will receive 
program rating descriptors transmitted pursuant to industry standard 
EIA/CEA-766-A ``U.S. and Canadian Region Rating Tables (RRT) and Content 
Advisory Descriptors for Transport of Content Advisory Information using 
ATSC A/65-A Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP),'' 2001 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38). Blocking of programs shall 
occur when a program rating is received that meets the pre-determined 
user requirements. Digital television receivers shall be able to respond 
to changes in the content advisory rating system.
    (e) All television receivers as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall block programming as follows:
    (1) Channel Blocking. Channel Blocking should occur as soon as a 
program rating packet with the appropriate Content Advisory or MPAA 
rating level is received. Program blocking is described as a receiver 
performing all of the following:

    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Muting the program audio.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Rendering the video black or otherwise 
indecipherable.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Eliminating program-related captions.

    (2) Default State. The default state of a receiver (i.e., as 
provided to the consumer) should not block unrated programs. However, it 
is permissible to include features that allow the user to reprogram the 
receiver to block programs that are not rated.
    (3) Picture-In-Picture (PIP). If a receiver has the ability to 
decode program-related rating information for the Picture-In-Picture 
(PIP) video signal, then it should block the PIP channel in the same 
manner as the main channel. If the receiver does not have the ability to 
decode PIP program-related rating information, then it should block or 
otherwise disable the PIP if the viewer has enabled program blocking.
    (4) Selection of Ratings. Each television receiver, in accordance 
with user input, shall block programming based on the age based ratings, 
the content based ratings, or a combination of the two.
    (i) If the user chooses to block programming according to its age 
based rating level, the receiver must have the ability to automatically 
block programs with a more restrictive age based rating. For example, if 
all shows with an age-based rating of TV-PG have been selected for 
blocking, the user should be able to automatically block programs with 
the more restrictive ratings of TV-14 and TV-MA.
    (ii) If the user chooses to block programming according to a 
combination of age based and content based ratings the receiver must 
have the ability to

[[Page 795]]

automatically block programming with a more restrictive age rating but a 
similar content rating. For example, if all shows rated TV-PG-V have 
been selected for blocking, the user should be able to block 
automatically shows with the more restrictive ratings of TV-14-V and TV-
MA-V.
    (iii) The user should have the capability of overriding the 
automatic blocking described in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (4)(ii) of this 
section.

Sec. 15.121  Scanning receivers and frequency converters used with scanning receivers.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, scanning 
receivers and frequency converters designed or marketed for use with 
scanning receivers, shall:
    (1) Be incapable of operating (tuning), or readily being altered by 
the user to operate, within the frequency bands allocated to the 
Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of this chapter (cellular 
telephone bands). Scanning receivers capable of ``readily being altered 
by the user'' include, but are not limited to, those for which the 
ability to receive transmissions in the cellular telephone bands can be 
added by clipping the leads of, or installing, a simple component such 
as a diode, resistor or jumper wire; replacing a plug-in semiconductor 
chip; or programming a semiconductor chip using special access codes or 
an external device, such as a personal computer. Scanning receivers, and 
frequency converters designed for use with scanning receivers, also 
shall be incapable of converting digital cellular communication 
transmissions to analog voice audio.
    (2) Be designed so that the tuning, control and filtering circuitry 
is inaccessible. The design must be such that any attempts to modify the 
equipment to receive transmissions from the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service likely will render the receiver inoperable.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, scanning 
receivers shall reject any signals from the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower based upon a 12 dB SINAD 
measurement, which is considered the threshold where a signal can be 
clearly discerned from any interference that may be present.
    (c) Scanning receivers and frequency converters designed or marketed 
for use with scanning receivers, are not subject to the requirements of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section provided that they are 
manufactured exclusively for, and marketed exclusively to, entities 
described in 18 U.S.C. 2512(2), or are marketed exclusively as test 
equipment pursuant to Sec. 15.3(dd).
    (d) Modification of a scanning receiver to receive transmissions 
from Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands will be considered 
to constitute manufacture of such equipment. This includes any 
individual, individuals, entity or organization that modifies one or 
more scanners. Any modification to a scanning receiver to receive 
transmissions from the Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands 
voids the certification of the scanning receiver, regardless of the date 
of manufacture of the original unit. In addition, the provisions of 
Sec. 15.23 shall not be interpreted as permitting modification of a 
scanning receiver to receiver Cellular Radiotelephone Service 
transmissions.
    (e) Scanning receivers and frequency converters designed for use 
with scanning receivers shall not be assembled from kits or marketed in 
kit form unless they comply with the requirements in paragraph (a) 
through (c) of this section.
    (f) Scanning receivers shall have a label permanently affixed to the 
product, and this label shall be readily visible to the purchaser at the 
time of purchase. The label shall read as follows: WARNING: MODIFICATION 
OF THIS DEVICE TO RECEIVE CELLULAR RADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE SIGNALS IS 
PROHIBITED UNDER FCC RULES AND FEDERAL LAW.
    (1) ``Permanently affixed'' means that the label is etched, 
engraved, stamped, silkscreened, indelible printed or otherwise 
permanently marked on a permanently attached part of the equipment or on 
a nameplate of metal, plastic or other material fastened to

[[Page 796]]

the equipment by welding, riveting, or permanent adhesive. The label 
shall be designed to last the expected lifetime of the equipment in the 
environment in which the equipment may be operated and must not be 
readily detachable. The label shall not be a stick-on, paper label.
    (2) When the device is so small that it is not practicable to place 
the warning label on it, the information required by this paragraph 
shall be placed in a prominent location in the instruction manual or 
pamphlet supplied to the user and shall also be placed on the container 
in which the device is marketed. However, the FCC identifier must be 
displayed on the device.

Sec. 15.122  Closed caption decoder requirements for digital television receivers and converter boxes.

    (a)(1) Effective July 1, 2002, all digital television receivers with 
picture screens in the 4:3 aspect ratio with picture screens measuring 
13 inches or larger diagonally, all digital television receivers with 
picture screens in the 16:9 aspect ratio measuring 7.8 inches or larger 
vertically and all separately sold DTV tuners shipped in interstate 
commerce or manufactured in the United States shall comply with the 
provisions of this section.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1): This paragraph places no restrictions on 
the shipping or sale of digital television receivers that were 
manufactured before July 1, 2002.

    (2) Effective July 1, 2002, DTV converter boxes that allow digitally 
transmitted television signals to be displayed on analog receivers shall 
pass available analog caption information to the attached receiver in a 
form recognizable by that receiver's built-in caption decoder circuitry.

    Note to paragraph (a)(2): This paragraph places no restrictions on 
the shipping or sale of DTV converter boxes that were manufactured 
before July 1, 2002.

    (b) Digital television receivers and tuners must be capable of 
decoding closed captioning information that is delivered pursuant to 
EIA-708-B: ``Digital Television (DTV) Closed Captioning'' (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 15.38).
    (c) Services. (1) Decoders must be capable of decoding and 
processing data for the six standard services, Caption Service 
<greek-i>1 through Caption Service <greek-i>6.
    (2) Decoders that rely on Program and System Information Protocol 
data to implement closed captioning functions must be capable of 
decoding and processing the Caption Service Directory data. Such 
decoders must be capable of decoding all Caption Channel Block Headers 
consisting of Standard Service Headers, Extended Service Block Headers, 
and Null Block headers. However, decoding of the data is required only 
for Standard Service Blocks (Service IDs <-6), and then only if the 
characters for the corresponding language are supported. The decoders 
must be able to display the directory for services 1 through 6.
    (d) Code space organization. (1) Decoders must support Code Space 
C0, G0, C1, and G1 in their entirety.

    (2) The following characters within code space G2 must be supported:
    (i) Transparent space (<INF>TSP</INF>).
    (ii) Non-breaking transparent space (<INF>NBTSP</INF>).
    (iii) Solid block ( ).
    (iv) Trademark symbol (\TM\).
    (v) Latin-1 characters [Scaron], [OElig], [scaron], [oelig], [Yuml].
    (3) The substitutions in Table 2 are to be made if a decoder does 
not support the remaining G2 characters.

    (e) Screen coordinates. Table 3 specifies the screen coordinate 
resolutions and limits for anchor point positioning in 4:3 and 16:9 
display formats, and the number of characters per row.

                                Table 3--Screen Coordinate Resolutions and Limits
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                           Maximum     Maximum

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4:3..........................  75vx160h...................  15vx32h....................           4           32
16:9.........................  75vx210h...................  15vx42h....................           4           42

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\H = 32 x (the width of the screen in relation to a 4:3 display). For example, the 16:9 format is \1/3\ wider
  than a 4:3 display; thus, H = 32 * \4/3\ = 42.667, or 42.

    (1) This means that the minimum grid resolution for a 4:3 aspect 
ratio instrument is 15 vertical positions x 32 horizontal positions. 
This minimum grid resolution for 16:9 ratio instrument is 15 vertical 
positions x 42 horizontal positions. These minimum grid sizes are to 
cover the entire safe-title area of the corresponding screen.
    (2) The minimum coordinates equate to a \1/5\ reduction in the 
maximum horizontal and vertical grid resolution coordinates. Caption 
providers are to use the maximum coordinate system values when 
specifying anchor point positions. Decoders using the minimum resolution 
are to divide the provided horizontal and vertical screen coordinates by 
5 to derive the equivalent minimum coordinates.
    (3) Any caption targeted for both 4:3 and 16:9 instruments is 
limited to 32 contiguous characters per row. If a caption is received by 
a 4:3 instrument that is targeted for a 16:9 display only, or requires a 
window width greater than 32 characters, then the caption may be 
completely disregarded by the decoder. 16:9 instruments should be able 
to process and display captions intended for 4:3 displays, providing all 
other minimum recommendations are met.
    (4) If the resulting size of any window is larger than the safe 
title area for the corresponding display's aspect ratio, then this 
window will be completely disregarded.
    (f) Caption windows. (1) Decoders need to display no more than 4 
rows of captions on the screen at any given time, regardless of the 
number of windows displayed. This implies that no more than 4 windows 
can be displayed at any given time (with each having only one caption 
row). However, decoders should maintain storage to support a minimum 
total of 8 rows of captions. This storage is needed for the worst-case 
support of a displayed window with 4 rows of captioning and a non-
displayed window which is buffering the incoming rows for the next 4-row 
caption. As implied above, the maximum number of windows that may be 
displayed at any one time by a minimum decoder implementation is 4. If 
more than 4 windows are defined in the caption stream, the decoder may 
disregard the youngest and lowest priority window definition(s). Caption 
providers must be aware of this limitation, and either restrict the 
total number of windows used or accept that some windows will not be 
displayed.

[[Page 799]]

    (2) Decoders do not need to support overlapped windows. If a window 
overlaps another window, the overlapped window need not be displayed by 
the decoder.
    (3) At a minimum, decoders will assume that all windows have rows 
and columns ``locked''. This implies that if a decoder implements the 
SMALL pen-size, then word-``un''wrapping, when shrinking captions, need 
not be implemented. Also, if a decoder implements the LARGE pen size, 
then word wrapping (when enlarging captions) need not be implemented.
    (4) Whenever possible, the receiver should render embedded carriage 
returns as line breaks, since these carriage returns indicate an 
important aspect of the caption's formatting as determined by the 
service provider. However, it may sometimes be necessary for the 
receiver to ignore embedded line breaks. For example, if a caption is to 
appear in a larger font, and if its window's rows and/or columns are 
unlocked, the rows of text may need to become longer or shorter to fit 
within the allocated space. Such automatic reformatting of a caption is 
known as ``word wrap.'' If decoders support word-wrapping, it must be 
implemented as follows:
    (i) The receiver should follow standard typographic practice when 
implementing word wrap. Potential breaking points (word-wrapping points) 
are indicated by the space character (20h) and by the hyphen character 
(2Dh).
    (ii) If a row is to be broken at a space, the receiver should remove 
the space from the caption display. If a row is to be broken after a 
hyphen, the hyphen should be retained.
    (iii) If an embedded return is to be removed, it should usually be 
replaced with a space. However, if the character to the left of the 
embedded return is a hyphen, the embedded return should be removed but 
NOT replaced with a space.
    (iv) This specification does not include optional hyphens, nor does 
it provide for any form of automatic hyphenation. No non-breaking hyphen 
is defined. The non-breaking space (A0h in the G1 code set) and the non-
breaking transparent space (21h in the G2 code set) should not be 
considered as potential line breaks.
    (v) If a single word exceeds the length of a row, the word should be 
placed at the start of a new row, broken at the character following the 
last character that fits on the row, and continued with further breaks 
if needed.
    (g) Window text painting. (1) All decoders should implement 
``left'', ``right'', and ``center'' caption-text justification. 
Implementation of ``full'' justification is optional. If ``full'' 
justification is not implemented, fully justified captions should be 
treated as though they are ``left'' justified.
    (i) For ``left'' justification, decoders should display any portion 
of a received row of text when it is received. For ``center'', 
``right'', and ``full'' justification, decoders may display any portion 
of a received row of text when it is received, or may delay display of a 
received row of text until reception of a row completion indicator. A 
row completion indicator is defined as receipt of a CR, ETX or any other 
command, except SetPenColor, SetPenAttributes, or SetPenLocation where 
the pen relocation is within the same row.
    (ii) Receipt of a character for a displayed row which already 
contains text with ``center'', ``right'' or ``full'' justification will 
cause the row to be cleared prior to the display of the newly received 
character and any subsequent characters. Receipt of a justification 
command which changes the last received justification for a given window 
will cause the window to be cleared.
    (2) At a minimum, decoders must support LEFT--TO--RIGHT printing.
    (3) At a minimum, decoders must support BOTTOM--TO--TOP scrolling. 
For windows sharing the same horizontal scan lines on the display, 
scrolling may be disabled.
    (4) At a minimum, decoders must support the same recommended 
practices for scroll rate as is provided for NTSC closed-captioning.
    (5) At a minimum, decoders must support the same recommended 
practices for smooth scrolling as is provided for NTSC closed-
captioning.

[[Page 800]]

    (6) At a minimum, decoders must implement the ``snap'' window 
display effect. If the window ``fade'' and ``wipe'' effects are not 
implemented, then the decoder will ``snap'' all windows when they are to 
be displayed, and the ``effect speed'' parameter is ignored.
    (h) Window colors and borders. At a minimum, decoders must implement 
borderless windows with solid, black backgrounds (i.e., border type = 
NONE, fill color = (0,0,0), fill opacity = SOLID), and borderless 
transparent windows (i.e., border type = NONE, fill opacity = 
TRANSPARENT).
    (i) Predefined window and pen styles. Predefined Window Style and 
Pen Style ID's may be provided in the DefineWindow command. At a 
minimum, decoders should implement Predefined Window Attribute Style 1 
and Predefined Pen Attribute Style 1, as shown in Table 4 and Table 5, 
respectively.

*``NTSC Style''--White Text on Black Background


[[Page 803]]

    (j) Pen size. (1) Decoders must support the standard, large, and 
small pen sizes and must allow the caption provider to choose a pen size 
and allow the viewer to choose an alternative size. The STANDARD pen 
size should be implemented such that the height of the tallest character 
in any implemented font is no taller than \1/15\ of the height of the 
safe-title area, and the width of the widest character is no wider than 
\1/32\ of the width of the safe-title area for 4:3 displays and \1/42\ 
of the safe-title area width for 16:9 displays.
    (2) The LARGE pen size should be implemented such that the width of 
the widest character in any implemented font is no wider than \1/32\ of 
the safe-title area for 16:9 displays. This recommendation allows for 
captions to grow to a LARGE pen size without having to reformat the 
caption since no caption will have more than 32 characters per row.
    (k) Font styles. (1) Decoders must support the eight fonts listed 
below. Caption providers may specify 1 of these 8 font styles to be used 
to write caption text. The styles specified in the ``font style'' 
parameter of the SetPenAttributes command are numbered from 0 through 7. 
The following is a list of the 8 required font styles. For information 
purposes only, each font style references one or more popular fonts 
which embody the characteristics of the style:
    (i) 0--Default (undefined)
    (ii) 1--Monospaced with serifs (similar to Courier)
    (iii) 2--Proportionally spaced with serifs (similar to Times New 
Roman)
    (iv) 3--Monospaced without serifs (similar to Helvetica Monospaced)
    (v) 4--Proportionally spaced without serifs (similar to Arial and 
Swiss)
    (vi) 5--Casual font type (similar to Dom and Impress)
    (vii) 6--Cursive font type (similar to Coronet and Marigold)
    (viii) 7--Small capitals (similar to Engravers Gothic)
    (2) Font styles may be implemented in any typeface which the decoder 
manufacturer deems to be a readable rendition of the font style, and 
need not be in the exact typefaces given in the example above. Decoders 
must include the ability for consumers to choose among the eight fonts. 
The decoder must display the font chosen by the caption provider unless 
the viewer chooses a different font.
    (l) Character offsetting. Decoders need not implement the character 
offsetting (i.e., subscript and superscript) pen attributes.
    (m) Pen styles. At a minimum, decoders must implement normal, 
italic, and underline pen styles.
    (n) Foreground color and opacity. (1) At a minimum, decoders must 
implement transparent, translucent, solid and flashing character 
foreground type attributes.
    (2) At a minimum, decoders must implement the following character 
foreground colors: white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta and 
cyan.
    (3) Caption providers may specify the color/opacity. Decoders must 
include the ability for consumers to choose among the color/opacity 
options. The decoder must display the color/opacity chosen by the 
caption provider unless the viewer chooses otherwise.
    (o) Background color and opacity. (1) Decoders must implement the 
following background colors: white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, 
magenta and cyan. It is recommended that this background is extended 
beyond the character foreground to a degree that the foreground is 
separated from the underlying video by a sufficient number of background 
pixels to insure the foreground is separated from the background.
    (2) Decoders must implement transparent, translucent, solid and 
flashing background type attributes. Caption providers may specify the 
color/opacity. Decoders must include the ability for consumers to choose 
among the color/opacity options. The decoder must display the color/
opacity chosen by the caption provider unless the viewer chooses 
otherwise.
    (p) Character edges. Decoders must implement separate edge color and 
type attribute control.
    (q) Color representation. (1) At a minimum, decoders must support 
the 8 colors listed in Table 6.

    (2)(i) When a decoder supporting this Minimum Color List receives an 
RGB value not in the list, it will map the received value to one of the 
values in the list via the following algorithm:
    (A) All one (1) values are to be changed to 0.
    (B) All two (2) values are to remain unchanged.
    (C) All three (3) values are to be changed to 2.
    (ii) For example, the RGB value (1,2,3) will be mapped to (0,2,2), 
(3,3,3) will be mapped to (2,2,2) and (1,1,1) will be mapped to (0,0,0).
    (3) Table 7 is an alternative minimum color list table supporting 22 
colors.

    (i) When a decoder supporting the Alternative Minimum Color List in 
Table 7 receives an RGB value not in the list (i.e., an RGB value whose 
non-zero elements are not the same value), it will map the received 
value to one of the values in the list via the following algorithm:
    (A) For RGB values with all elements non-zero and different--e.g., 
(1,2,3), (3,2,1), and (2,1,3), the 1 value will be changed to 0, the 2 
value will remain unchanged, and the 3 value will be changed to 2.
    (B) For RGB values with all elements non-zero and with two common 
elements--e.g. (3,1,3), (2,1,2), and (2,2,3), if the common elements are 
3 and the uncommon one is 1, then the 1 elements is changed to 0; e.g. 
(3,1,3) [rarr] (3,0,3). If the common elements are 1 and the uncommon 
element is 3, then the 1 elements are changed to 0, and the 3 element is 
changed to 2; e.g. (1,3,1) [rarr] (0,2,0). In all other cases, the 
uncommon element is changed to the common value; e.g., (2,2,3) [rarr] 
(2,2,2), (1,2,1) [rarr] (1,1,1), and (3,2,3) [rarr] (3,3,3).
    (ii) All decoders not supporting either one of the two color lists 
described above, must support the full 64 possible RGB color value 
combinations.
    (r) Character rendition considerations. In NTSC Closed Captioning, 
decoders were required to insert leading and trailing spaces on each 
caption row. There were two reasons for this requirement:
    (1) To provide a buffer so that the first and last characters of a 
caption row do not fall outside the safe title area, and
    (2) To provide a black border on each side of a character so that 
the ``white'' leading pixels of the first character on a row and the 
trailing ``white'' pixels of the last character on a row do not bleed 
into the underlying video.
    (i) Since caption windows are required to reside in the safe title 
area of the DTV screen, reason 1 (above) is not applicable to DTVCC 
captions.
    (ii) The attributes available in the SetPenAttributes command for 
character rendition (e.g., character background and edge attributes) 
provide unlimited flexibility to the caption provider when describing 
caption text in an ideal decoder implementation. However, manufacturers 
need not implement all pen attributes. Thus it is recommended that no 
matter what the level of implementation, decoder manufacturers should 
take into account the readability of all caption text against a variety 
of all video backgrounds, and should implement some

[[Page 805]]

automatic character delineation when the individual control of character 
foreground, background and edge is not supported.
    (s) Service synchronization. Service Input Buffers must be at least 
128 bytes in size. Caption providers must keep this lower limit in mind 
when following Delay commands with other commands and window text. In 
other words, no more than 128 bytes of DTVCC commands and text should be 
transmitted (encoded) before a pending Delay command's delay interval 
expires.
    (t) Settings. Decoders must include an option that permits a viewer 
to choose a setting that will display captions as intended by the 
caption provider (a default). Decoders must also include an option that 
allows a viewer's chosen settings to remain until the viewer chooses to 
alter these settings, including periods when the television is turned 
off.

Sec. 15.123  Labeling of digital cable ready products.

    (a) The requirements of this section shall apply to unidirectional 
digital cable products. Unidirectional digital cable products are one-
way devices that accept a Point of Deployment module (POD) and which 
include, but are not limited to televisions, set-top-boxes and recording 
devices connected to digital cable systems. Unidirectional digital cable 
products do not include interactive two-way digital television products.
    (b) A unidirectional digital cable product may not be labeled with 
or marketed using the term ``digital cable ready,'' or other terminology 
that describes the device as ``cable ready'' or ``cable compatible,'' or 
otherwise indicates that the device accepts a POD or conveys the 
impression that the device is compatible with digital cable service 
unless it implements at a minimum the following features:
    (1) Tunes NTSC analog channels transmitted in-the-clear.
    (2) Tunes digital channels that are transmitted in compliance with 
SCTE 40 2003 (formerly DVS 313): ``Digital Cable Network Interface 
Standard'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38), provided, 
however, that with respect to Table B.11 of that standard, the phase 
noise requirement shall be -86 dB/Hz including both in-the-clear 
channels and channels that are subject to conditional access.
    (3) Allows navigation of channels based on channel information 
(virtual channel map and source names) provided through the cable system 
in compliance with ANSI/SCTE 65 2002 (formerly DVS 234): ``Service 
Information Delivered Out-of-Band for Digital Cable Television'' 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38), and/or PSIP-enabled 
navigation (ANSI/SCTE 54 2003 (formerly DVS 241): ``Digital Video 
Service Multiplex and Transport System Standard for Cable Television'' 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38)).
    (4) Includes the POD-Host Interface specified in SCTE 28 2003 
(formerly DVS 295): ``Host-POD Interface Standard'' (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 15.38), and SCTE 41 2003 (formerly DVS 301): ``POD 
Copy Protection System'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38), 
or implementation of a more advanced POD-Host Interface based on 
successor standards. Support for Internet protocol flows is not 
required.
    (5) Responds to emergency alerts that are transmitted in compliance 
with ANSI/SCTE 54 2003 (formerly DVS 241): ``Digital Video Service 
Multiplex and Transport System Standard for Cable Television'' 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 15.38).
    (6) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) 
of this section, a unidirectional digital cable television may not be 
labeled or marketed as digital cable ready or with other terminology as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, unless it includes a DTV 
broadcast tuner as set forth in Sec. 15.117(i) and employs at least one 
specified interface in accordance with the following schedule:
    (i) For 480p grade unidirectional digital cable televisions, either 
a DVI/HDCP, HDMI/HDCP, or 480p Y,Pb,Pr interface:
    (A) Models with screen sizes 36 inches and above: 50% of a 
manufacturer's or importer's models manufactured or imported after July 
1, 2004; 100% of such

[[Page 806]]

models manufactured or imported after July 1, 2005.
    (B) Models with screen sizes 32 to 35 inches: 50% of a

Sec. 15.124  DTV transition notices by manufacturers of televisions and related devices.

    (a) Television receivers and related devices manufactured between 
April 1, 2009, and June 30, 2009, must include notices about the digital 
television (DTV) transition. Related devices covered by this 
requirement: All television broadcast receivers as defined in Sec. 
15.3(w); TV interface devices as defined in Sec. 15.3(y); devices that 
record and/or display signals received from television broadcast 
receivers; and set-top boxes available for sale at retail that receive 
video programming provided by multi-channel video programming 
distributors.
    (b) The notices required under paragraph (a) of this section must:
    (1) Be in clear and conspicuous print;
    (2) Convey at least the following information about the DTV 
transition:
    (i) The nationwide switch to digital television broadcasting will be 
complete on June 12, 2009, but your local television stations may switch 
sooner. After the switch, analog-only television sets that receive TV 
programming through an antenna will need a converter box to continue to 
receive over-the-air TV. Watch your local stations to find out when they 
will turn off their analog signal and switch to digital-only 
broadcasting. Analog-only TVs should continue to work as before to 
receive low power, Class A or translator television stations and with 
cable and satellite TV services, gaming consoles, VCRs, DVD players, and 
similar products.
    (ii) Information about the DTV transition is available from your 
local television stations, http://www.DTV.gov, or 1-888-CALL-FCC (TTY 1-
888-TELL-FCC), and from http://www.dtv2009.gov or 1-888-DTV-2009 (TTY 1-
877-530-2634) for information about subsidized coupons for digital-to-
analog converter boxes; and
    (3) Explain clearly what effect, if any, the DTV transition will 
have on the use of the receiver or related device, including any 
limitations or requirements associated with connecting a related device 
to a DTV receiver.

chapter prior to marketing.
    (c) For devices such as perimeter protection systems which, in 
accordance with Sec. 15.31(d), are required to be measured at the 
installation site, each application for certification must be 
accompanied by a statement indicating that the system has been tested at 
three installations and found to comply at each installation. Until such 
time as certification is granted, a given installation of a system that 
was measured for the submission for certification will be considered to 
be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the 
marketing regulations in subpart I of part 2 of this chapter, if tests 
at that installation show the system to be in compliance with the 
relevant technical requirements. Similarly, where measurements must be 
performed on site for equipment subject to verification, a given 
installation that has been verified to demonstrate compliance with the 
applicable standards will be considered to be in compliance with the 
provisions of

[[Page 808]]

this chapter, including the marketing regulations in subpart I of part 2 
of this chapter.
    (d) For perimeter protection systems operating in the frequency 
bands allocated to television broadcast stations operating under part 73 
of this chapter, the holder of the grant of certification must test each 
installation prior to initiation of normal operation to verify 
compliance with the technical standards and must maintain a list of all 
installations and records of measurements. For perimeter protection 
systems operating outside of the frequency bands allocated to television 
broadcast stations, upon receipt of a grant of certification, further 
testing of the same or similar type of system or installation is not 
required.

Sec. 15.202  Certified operating frequency range.

    Client devices that operate in a master/client network may be 
certified if they have the capability of operating outside permissible 
part 15 frequency bands, provided they operate on only permissible part 
15 frequencies under the control of the master device with which they 
communicate. Master devices marketed within the United States must be 
limited to operation on permissible part 15 frequencies. Client devices 
that can also act as master devices must meet the requirements of a 
master device. For the purposes of this section, a master device is 
defined as a device operating in a mode in which it has the capability 
to transmit without receiving an enabling signal. In this mode it is 
able to select a channel and initiate a network by sending enabling 
signals to other devices. A network always has at least one device 
operating in master mode. A client device is defined as a device 
operating in a mode in which the transmissions of the device are under 
control of the master. A device in client mode is not able to initiate a 
network.

Sec. 15.203  Antenna requirement.

    An intentional radiator shall be designed to ensure that no antenna 
other than that furnished by the responsible party shall be used with 
the device. The use of a permanently attached antenna or of an antenna 
that uses a unique coupling to the intentional radiator shall be 
considered sufficient to comply with the provisions of this section. The 
manufacturer may design the unit so that a broken antenna can be 
replaced by the user, but the use of a standard antenna jack or 
electrical connector is prohibited. This requirement does not apply to 
carrier current devices or to devices operated under the provisions of 
Sec. 15.211, Sec. 15.213, Sec. 15.217, Sec. 15.219, or Sec. 15.221. 
Further, this requirement does not apply to intentional radiators that 
must be professionally installed, such as perimeter protection systems 
and some field disturbance sensors, or to other intentional radiators 
which, in accordance with Sec. 15.31(d), must be measured at the 
installation site. However, the installer shall be responsible for 
ensuring that the proper antenna is employed so that the limits in this 
part are not exceeded.

marketed with the intentional radiator, it shall be of a type which is 
authorized with the intentional radiator. An intentional radiator may be 
authorized with multiple antenna types.
    (1) The antenna type, as used in this paragraph, refers to antennas 
that have similar in-band and out-of-band radiation patterns.
    (2) Compliance testing shall be performed using the highest gain 
antenna for each type of antenna to be certified with the intentional 
radiator. During this testing, the intentional radiator shall be 
operated at its maximum available output power level.
    (3) Manufacturers shall supply a list of acceptable antenna types 
with the application for equipment authorization of the intentional 
radiator.
    (4) Any antenna that is of the same type and of equal or less 
directional gain as an antenna that is authorized with the intentional 
radiator may be marketed with, and used with, that intentional radiator. 
No retesting of this system configuration is required. The marketing or 
use of a system configuration that employs an antenna of a different 
type, or that operates at a higher gain, than the antenna authorized 
with the intentional radiator is not permitted unless the procedures 
specified in Sec. 2.1043 of this chapter are followed.
    (d) Except as described in this paragraph, an external radio 
frequency power amplifier or amplifier kit shall be marketed only with 
the system configuration with which it was approved and not as a 
separate product.
    (1) An external radio frequency power amplifier may be marketed for 
individual sale provided it is intended for use in conjunction with a 
transmitter that operates in the 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz, and 5725-
5850 MHz bands pursuant to Sec. 15.247 of this part or a transmitter 
that operates in the 5.725-5.825 GHz band pursuant to Sec. 15.407 of 
this part. The amplifier must be of a design such that it can only be 
connected as part of a system in which it has been previously 
authorized. (The use of a non-standard connector or a form of electronic 
system identification is acceptable.) The output power of such an 
amplifier must not exceed the maximum permitted output power of its 
associated transmitter.
    (2) The outside packaging and user manual for external radio 
frequency power amplifiers sold in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section must include notification that the amplifier can be used 
only in a system which it has obtained authorization. Such a notice must 
identify the authorized system by FCC Identifier.

** Except as provided in paragraph (g), fundamental emissions from
  intentional radiators operating under this section shall not be
  located in the frequency bands 54-72 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz or
  470-806 MHz. However, operation within these frequency bands is
  permItted under other sections of this part, e.g., Sec. Sec.  15.231
  and 15.241.

    (b) In the emission table above, the tighter limit applies at the 
band edges.
    (c) The level of any unwanted emissions from an intentional radiator 
operating under these general provisions shall not exceed the level of 
the fundamental emission. For intentional radiators which operate under 
the provisions of other sections within this part and which are required 
to reduce their unwanted emissions to the limits specified in this 
table, the limits in this table are based on the frequency of the 
unwanted emission and not the fundamental frequency. However, the level 
of any unwanted emissions shall not exceed the level of the fundamental 
frequency.
    (d) The emission limits shown in the above table are based on 
measurements employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector except for the 
frequency bands 9-90 kHz, 110-490 kHz and above 1000 MHz. Radiated 
emission limits in these three bands are based on measurements employing 
an average detector.
    (e) The provisions in Sec. Sec. 15.31, 15.33, and 15.35 for 
measuring emissions at distances other than the distances specified in 
the above table, determining the frequency range over which radiated 
emissions are to be measured, and limiting peak emissions apply to all 
devices operated under this part.
    (f) In accordance with Sec. 15.33(a), in some cases the emissions 
from an intentional radiator must be measured to beyond the tenth 
harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency designed to be emitted by 
the intentional radiator because of the incorporation of a digital 
device. If measurements above the tenth harmonic are so required, the 
radiated emissions above the tenth harmonic shall comply with the 
general radiated emission limits applicable to the incorporated digital 
device, as shown in Sec. 15.109 and as based on the

[[Page 812]]

frequency of the emission being measured, or, except for emissions 
contained in the restricted frequency bands shown in Sec. 15.205, the 
limit on spurious emissions specified for the intentional radiator, 
whichever is the higher limit. Emissions which must be measured above 
the tenth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency designed to be 
emitted by the intentional radiator and which fall within the restricted 
bands shall comply with the general radiated emission limits in Sec. 
15.109 that are applicable to the incorporated digital device.
    (g) Perimeter protection systems may operate in the 54-72 MHz and 
76-88 MHz bands under the provisions of this section. The use of such 
perimeter protection systems is limited to industrial, business and 
commercial applications.

Sec. 15.211  Tunnel radio systems.

    An intentional radiator utilized as part of a tunnel radio system 
may operate on any frequency provided it meets all of the following 
conditions:
    (a) Operation of a tunnel radio system (intentional radiator and all 
connecting wires) shall be contained solely within a tunnel, mine or 
other structure that provides attenuation to the radiated signal due to 
the presence of naturally surrounding earth and/or water.
    (b) Any intentional or unintentional radiator external to the 
tunnel, mine or other structure, as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, shall be subject to the other applicable regulations contained 
within this part.
    (c) The total electromagnetic field from a tunnel radio system on 
any frequency or frequencies appearing outside of the tunnel, mine or 
other structure described in paragraph (a) of this section, shall not 
exceed the limits shown in Sec. 15.209 when measured at the specified 
distance from the surrounding structure, including openings. Particular 
attention shall be paid to the emissions from any opening in the 
structure to the outside environment. When measurements are made from 
the openings, the distances shown in Sec. 15.209 refer to the distance 
from the plane of reference which fits the entire perimeter of each 
above ground opening.
    (d) The conducted limits in Sec. 15.207 apply to the radiofrequency 
voltage on the public utility power lines outside of the tunnel.


<R05>
Sec. 15.212  Modular transmitters.

    (a) Single modular transmitters consist of a completely self-
contained radiofrequency transmitter device that is typically 
incorporated into another product, host or device. Split modular 
transmitters consist of two components: a radio front end with antenna 
(or radio devices) and a transmitter control element (or specific 
hardware on which the software that controls the radio operation 
resides). All single or split modular transmitters are approved with an 
antenna. All of the following requirements apply, except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) Single modular transmitters must meet the following requirements 
to obtain a modular transmitter approval.
    (i) The radio elements of the modular transmitter must have their 
own shielding. The physical crystal and tuning capacitors may be located 
external to the shielded radio elements.
    (ii) The modular transmitter must have buffered modulation/data 
inputs (if such inputs are provided) to ensure that the module will 
comply with part 15 requirements under conditions of excessive data 
rates or over-modulation.
    (iii) The modular transmitter must have its own power supply 
regulation.
    (iv) The modular transmitter must comply with the antenna and 
transmission system requirements of Sec. Sec. 15.203, 15.204(b) and 
15.204(c). The antenna must either be permanently attached or employ a 
``unique'' antenna coupler (at all connections between the module and 
the antenna, including the cable). The ``professional installation'' 
provision of Sec. 15.203 is not applicable to modules but can apply to 
limited modular approvals under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (v) The modular transmitter must be tested in a stand-alone 
configuration,

[[Page 813]]

i.e., the module must not be inside another device during testing for 
compliance with part 15 requirements. Unless the transmitter module will 
be battery powered, it must comply with the AC line conducted 
requirements found in Sec. 15.207. AC or DC power lines and data input/
output lines connected to the module must not contain ferrites, unless 
they will be marketed with the module (see Sec. 15.27(a)). The length 
of these lines shall be the length typical of actual use or, if that 
length is unknown, at least 10 centimeters to insure that there is no 
coupling between the case of the module and supporting equipment. Any 
accessories, peripherals, or support equipment connected to the module 
during testing shall be unmodified and commercially available (see Sec. 
15.31(i)).
    (vi) The modular transmitter must be equipped with either a 
permanently affixed label or must be capable of electronically 
displaying its FCC identification number.
    (A) If using a permanently affixed label, the modular transmitter 
must be labeled with its own FCC identification number, and, if the FCC 
identification number is not visible when the module is installed inside 
another device, then the outside of the device into which the module is 
installed must also display a label referring to the enclosed module. 
This exterior label can use wording such as the following: ``Contains 
Transmitter Module FCC ID: XYZMODEL1'' or ``Contains FCC ID: 
XYZMODEL1.'' Any similar wording that expresses the same meaning may be 
used. The Grantee may either provide such a label, an example of which 
must be included in the application for equipment authorization, or, 
must provide adequate instructions along with the module which explain 
this requirement. In the latter case, a copy of these instructions must 
be included in the application for equipment authorization.
    (B) If the modular transmitter uses an electronic display of the FCC 
identification number, the information must be readily accessible and 
visible on the modular transmitter or on the device in which it is 
installed. If the module is installed inside another device, then the 
outside of the device into which the module is installed must display a 
label referring to the enclosed module. This exterior label can use 
wording such as the following: ``Contains FCC certified transmitter 
module(s).'' Any similar wording that expresses the same meaning may be 
used. The user manual must include instructions on how to access the 
electronic display. A copy of these instructions must be included in the 
application for equipment authorization.
    (vii) The modular transmitter must comply with any specific rules or 
operating requirements that ordinarily apply to a complete transmitter 
and the manufacturer must provide adequate instructions along with the 
module to explain any such requirements. A copy of these instructions 
must be included in the application for equipment authorization.
    (viii) The modular transmitter must comply with any applicable RF 
exposure requirements in its final configuration.
    (2) Split modular transmitters must meet the requirements in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, excluding paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and 
(a)(1)(v), and the following additional requirements to obtain a modular 
transmitter approval.
    (i) Only the radio front end must be shielded. The physical crystal 
and tuning capacitors may be located external to the shielded radio 
elements. The interface between the split sections of the modular system 
must be digital with a minimum signaling amplitude of 150 mV peak-to-
peak.
    (ii) Control information and other data may be exchanged between the 
transmitter control elements and radio front end.
    (iii) The sections of a split modular transmitter must be tested 
installed in a host device(s) similar to that which is representative of 
the platform(s) intended for use.
    (iv) Manufacturers must ensure that only transmitter control 
elements and radio front end components that have been approved together 
are capable of operating together. The transmitter module must not 
operate unless it has verified that the installed transmitter control 
elements and radio front end have been authorized together. 
Manufacturers may use means including, but not limited to, coding in 
hardware and

[[Page 814]]

electronic signatures in software to meet these requirements, and must 
describe the methods in their application for equipment authorization.
    (b) A limited modular approval may be granted for single or split 
modular transmitters that do not comply with all of the above 
requirements, e.g., shielding, minimum signaling amplitude, buffered 
modulation/data inputs, or power supply regulation, if the manufacturer 
can demonstrate by alternative means in the application for equipment 
authorization that the modular transmitter meets all the applicable part 
15 requirements under the operating conditions in which the transmitter 
will be used. Limited modular approval also may be granted in those 
instances where compliance with RF exposure rules is demonstrated only 
for particular product configurations. The applicant for certification 
must state how control of the end product into which the module will be 
installed will be maintained such that full compliance of the end 
product is always ensured.

Sec. 15.213  Cable locating equipment.

    An intentional radiator used as cable locating equipment, as defined 
in Sec. 15.3(d), may be operated on any frequency within the band 9-490 
kHz, subject to the following limits: Within the frequency band 9 kHz, 
up to, but not including, 45 kHz, the peak output power from the cable 
locating equipment shall not exceed 10 watts; and, within the frequency 
band 45 kHz to 490 kHz, the peak output power from the cable locating 
equipment shall not exceed one watt. If provisions are made for 
connection of the cable locating equipment to the AC power lines, the 
conducted limits in Sec. 15.207 also apply to this equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 15.214  Cordless telephones.

    (a) For equipment authorization, a single application form, FCC Form 
731, may be filed for a cordless telephone system, provided the 
application clearly identifies and provides data for all parts of the 
system to show compliance with the applicable technical requirements. 
When a single application form is submitted, both the base station and 
the portable handset must carry the same FCC identifier. The application 
shall include a fee for certification of each type of transmitter and 
for certification, if appropriate, for each type of receiver included in 
the system.
    (b) A cordless telephone that is intended to be connected to the 
public switched telephone network shall also comply with the applicable 
regulations in part 68 of this chapter. A separate procedure for 
approval under part 68 is required for such terminal equipment.
    (c) The label required under subpart A of this part shall also 
contain the following statement: ``Privacy of communications may not be 
ensured when using this phone.''
    (d) Cordless telephones shall incorporate circuitry which makes use 
of a digital security code to provide protection against unintentional 
access to the public switched telephone network by the base unit and 
unintentional ringing by the handset. These functions shall operate such 
that each access of the telephone network or ringing of the handset is 
preceded by the transmission of a code word. Access to the telephone 
network shall occur only if the code transmitted by the handset matches 
code set in the base unit. Similarly, ringing of the handset shall occur 
only if the code transmitted by the base unit matches the code set in 
the handset. The security code required by this section may also be 
employed to perform other communications functions, such as providing 
telephone billing information. This security code system is to operate 
in accordance with the following provisions.
    (1) There must be provision for at least 256 possible discrete 
digital codes. Factory-set codes must be continuously varied over at 
least 256 possible codes as each telephone is manufactured. The codes 
may be varied either randomly, sequentially, or using another systematic 
procedure.
    (2) Manufacturers must use one of the following approaches for 
facilitating variation in the geographic distribution of individual 
security codes:
    (i) Provide a means for the user to readily select from among at 
least 256 possible discrete digital codes. The cordless telephone shall 
be either in a non-operable mode after manufacture

[[Page 815]]

until the user selects a security code or the manufacturer must 
continuously vary the initial security code as each telephone is 
produced.
    (ii) Provide a fixed code that is continuously varied among at least 
256 discrete digital codes as each telephone is manufactured.
    (iii) Provide a means for the cordless telephone to automatically 
select a different code from among at least 256 possible discrete 
digital codes each time it is activated.
    (iv) It is permissible to provide combinations of fixed, automatic, 
and user-selectable coding provided the above criteria are met.
    (3) A statement of the means and procedures used to achieve the 
required protection shall be provided in any application for equipment 
authorization of a cordless telephone.

             Radiated Emission Limits, Additional Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 15.215  Additional provisions to the general radiated emission limitations.

    (a) The regulations in Sec. Sec. 15.217 through 15.257 provide 
alternatives to the general radiated emission limits for intentional 
radiators operating in specified frequency bands. Unless otherwise 
stated, there are no restrictions as to the types of operation permitted 
under these sections.
    (b) In most cases, unwanted emissions outside of the frequency bands 
shown in these alternative provisions must be attenuated to the emission 
limits shown in Sec. 15.209. In no case shall the level of the unwanted 
emissions from an intentional radiator operating under these additional 
provisions exceed the field strength of the fundamental emission.
    (c) Intentional radiators operating under the alternative provisions 
to the general emission limits, as contained in Sec. Sec. 15.217 
through 15.257 and in Subpart E of this part, must be designed to ensure 
that the 20 dB bandwidth of the emission, or whatever bandwidth may 
otherwise be specified in the specific rule section under which the 
equipment operates, is contained within the frequency band designated in 
the rule section under which the equipment is operated. The requirement 
to contain the designated bandwidth of the emission within the specified 
frequency band includes the effects from frequency sweeping, frequency 
hopping and other modulation techniques that may be employed as well as 
the frequency stability of the transmitter over expected variations in 
temperature and supply voltage. If a frequency stability is not 
specified in the regulations, it is recommended that the fundamental 
emission be kept within at least the central 80% of the permitted band 
in order to minimize the possibility of out-of-band operation.

Sec. 15.216  Disclosure requirements for wireless microphones and other low power auxiliary stations capable of operating in the core TV bands.

    (a) Any person who manufactures, sells, leases, or offers for sale 
or lease, low power auxiliary stations capable of operating in the core 
TV bands (channels 2-51, excluding channel 37) is subject to the 
following disclosure requirements: (1) Such persons must display the 
consumer disclosure text, as specified by the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau and the Consumer and Governmental Affairs 
Bureau, at the point of sale or lease of each such low power auxiliary 
station. The text must be displayed in a clear, conspicuous, and readily 
legible manner. One way to fulfill the requirement in this section is to 
display the consumer disclosure text in a prominent manner on the 
product box by using a label (either printed onto the box or otherwise 
affixed to the box), a sticker, or other means. Another way to fulfill 
this requirement is to display the text immediately adjacent to each low 
power auxiliary station offered for sale or lease and clearly associated 
with the model to which it pertains.
    (2) If such persons offer such low power auxiliary stations via 
direct mail, catalog, or electronic means,

[[Page 816]]

they shall prominently display the consumer disclosure text in close 
proximity to the images and descriptions of each such low power 
auxiliary station. The text should be in a size large enough to be 
clear, conspicuous, and readily legible, consistent with the dimensions 
of the advertisement or description.
    (3) If such persons have Web sites pertaining to these low power 
auxiliary stations, the consumer disclosure text must be displayed there 
in a clear, conspicuous, and readily legible manner (even in the event 
such persons do not sell low power auxiliary stations directly to the 
public).
    (b) The consumer disclosure text described in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section is set out in an appendix to this section.

    (b) The total length of the transmission line, antenna, and ground 
lead (if used) shall not exceed 15 meters.
    (c) All emissions below 160 kHz or above 190 kHz shall be attenuated 
at least 20 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier. Determination 
of compliance with the 20 dB attenuation specification may be based on 
measurements at the intentional radiator's antenna output terminal 
unless the intentional radiator uses a permanently attached antenna, in 
which case compliance shall be demonstrated by measuring the radiated 
emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 15.219  Operation in the band 510-1705 kHz.

    (b) The total length of the transmission line, antenna and ground 
lead (if used) shall not exceed 3 meters.
    (c) All emissions below 510 kHz or above 1705 kHz shall be 
attenuated at least 20 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier. 
Determination of compliance with the 20 dB attenuation specification may 
be based on measurements at the intentional radiator's antenna output 
terminal unless the intentional radiator uses a permanently attached 
antenna, in which case compliance shall be deomonstrated by measuring 
the radiated emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 15.221  Operation in the band 525-1705 kHz.

    (a) Carrier current systems and transmitters employing a leaky 
coaxial cable as the radiating antenna may operate in the band 525-1705 
kHz provided the field strength levels of the radiated emissions do not 
exceed 15 uV/m, as measured at a distance of 47,715/(frequency in kHz) 
meters (equivalent to Lambda/2Pi) from the electric power line or the 
coaxial cable, respectively. The field strength levels of emissions 
outside this band shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits 
in Sec. 15.209.
    (b) As an alternative to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this 
section, intentional radiators used for the operation of an AM broadcast 
station on a college or university campus or on the campus of any other 
education institution may comply with the following:
    (1) On the campus, the field strength of emissions appearing outside 
of this frequency band shall not exceed the general radiated emission 
limits shown

[[Page 817]]

in Sec. 15.209 as measured from the radiating source. There is no limit 
on the field strength of emissions appearing within this frequency band, 
except that the provisions of Sec. 15.5 continue to comply.
    (2) At the perimeter of the campus, the field strength of any 
emissions, including those within the frequency band 525-1705 kHz, shall 
not exceed the general radiated emission in Sec. 15.209.
    (3) The conducted limits specified in Sec. 15.207 apply to the 
radio frequency voltage on the public utility power lines outside of the 
campus. Due to the large number of radio frequency devices which may be 
used on the campus, contributing to the conducted emissions, as an 
alternative to measuring conducted emissions outside of the campus, it 
is acceptable to demonstrate compliance with this provision by measuring 
each individual intentional radiator employed in the system at the point 
where it connects to the AC power lines.
    (c) A grant of equipment authorization is not required for 
intentional radiators operated under the provisions of this section. In 
lieu thereof, the intentional radiator shall be verified for compliance 
with the regulations in accordance with subpart J of part 2 of this 
chapter. This data shall be kept on file at the location of the studio, 
office or control room associated with the transmitting equipment. In 
some cases, this may correspond to the location of the transmitting 
equipment.
    (d) For the band 535-1705 kHz, the frequency of operation shall be 
chosen such that operation is not within the protected field strength 
contours of licensed AM stations.

microvolts/meter at 3 meters.
    (b) As an alternative to the limit in paragraph (a) of this section, 
perimeter protection systems may demonstrate compliance with the 
following: the field strength of any emissions within this band shall 
not exceed 500 microvolts/meter at 3 meters, as determined using 
measurement instrumentations employing an average detector. The 
provisions in Sec. 15.35 for limiting peak emissions apply where 
compliance of these devices is demonstrated under this alternative 
emission limit.

Sec. 15.231  Periodic operation in the band 40.66-40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz.

    (a) The provisions of this section are restricted to periodic 
operation within the band 40.66-40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz. Except as 
shown in paragraph (e) of this section, the intentional radiator is 
restricted to the transmission of a control signal such as those used 
with alarm systems, door openers, remote switches, etc. Continuous 
transmissions, voice, video and the radio control of toys are not 
permitted. Data is permitted to be sent with a control signal. The 
following conditions shall be met to comply with the provisions for this 
periodic operation:
    (1) A manually operated transmitter shall employ a switch that will 
automatically deactivate the transmitter within not more than 5 seconds 
of being released.
    (2) A transmitter activated automatically shall cease transmission 
within 5 seconds after activation.
    (3) Periodic transmissions at regular predetermined intervals are 
not permitted. However, polling or supervision transmissions, including 
data, to determine system integrity of transmitters used in security or 
safety applications are allowed if the total duration of transmissions 
does not exceed more than two seconds per hour for each transmitter. 
There is no limit on the number of individual transmissions, provided 
the total transmission time does not exceed two seconds per hour.
    (4) Intentional radiators which are employed for radio control 
purposes during emergencies involving fire, security, and safety of 
life, when activated to signal an alarm, may operate during the pendency 
of the alarm condition
    (5) Transmission of set-up information for security systems may 
exceed the transmission duration limits in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) 
of this section, provided such transmissions are under the control of a 
professional installer and do not exceed ten seconds after a manually 
operated switch is released or a transmitter is activated automatically. 
Such set-up information may include data.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of Sec. 15.205, the field 
strength of emissions from intentional radiators operated under this 
section shall not exceed the following:

    (1) The above field strength limits are specified at a distance of 3 
meters. The tighter limits apply at the band edges.
    (2) Intentional radiators operating under the provisions of this 
section shall demonstrate compliance with the limits on the field 
strength of emissions, as shown in the above table, based on the average 
value of the measured emissions. As an alternative, compliance with the 
limits in the above table may be based on the use of measurement 
instrumentation with a CISPR quasi-peak detector. The specific method of 
measurement employed shall be specified in the application for equipment 
authorization. If average emission measurements are employed, the 
provisions in Sec. 15.35 for averaging pulsed emissions and for 
limiting peak emissions apply. Further, compliance with the provisions 
of Sec. 15.205 shall be demonstrated using the measurement 
instrumentation specified in that section.
    (3) The limits on the field strength of the spurious emissions in 
the above table are based on the fundamental frequency of the 
intentional radiator. Spurious emissions shall be attenuated to the 
average (or, alternatively, CISPR quasi-peak) limits shown in this table 
or to the general limits shown in Sec. 15.209, whichever limit permits 
a higher field strength.
    (c) The bandwidth of the emission shall be no wider than 0.25% of 
the center frequency for devices operating above 70 MHz and below 900 
MHz. For devices operating above 900 MHz, the emission shall be no wider 
than 0.5% of the center frequency. Bandwidth is determined at the points 
20 dB down from the modulated carrier.
    (d) For devices operating within the frequency band 40.66-40.70 MHz, 
the bandwidth of the emission shall be confined within the band edges 
and the frequency tolerance of the carrier shall be <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01%. This frequency tolerance shall be maintained for 
a temperature variation of -20 degrees to +50 degrees C at normal supply 
voltage, and for a variation in the primary supply voltage from 85% to 
115% of the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 20 degrees C. For 
battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be performed using 
a new battery.
    (e) Intentional radiators may operate at a periodic rate exceeding 
that specified in paragraph (a) of this section and may be employed for 
any type of operation, including operation prohibited in paragraph (a) 
of this section, provided the intentional radiator complies with the 
provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, except the 
field strength table in paragraph (b) of this section is replaced by the

minus<ls-thn-eq>20 kHz. Accordingly, the total signal level over the 
band of operation may be higher than 200 mV/m. The field strength of 
emissions radiated on any frequency outside of the television broadcast 
channel within which the fundamental is contained shall not exceed the 
general limits in Sec. 15.209.
    (d) The user and the installer of a biomedical telemetry device 
operating within the frequency range 174-216 MHz, 470-608 MHz or 614-668 
MHz shall ensure that the following minimum separation distances are 
maintained between the biomedical telemetry device and the authorized 
radio services operating on the same frequencies:
    (1) At least 10.3 km outside of the Grade B field strength contour 
(56 dBuV/m) of a TV broadcast station or an associated TV booster 
station operating within the band 174-216 MHz.
    (2) At least 5.5 km outside of the Grade B field strength contour 
(64 dBuV/m) of a TV broadcast station or an associated TV booster 
station operating within the bands 470-608 MHz or 614-668 MHz.
    (3) At least 5.1 km outside of the 68 dBuV/m field strength contour 
of a low power TV or a TV translator station operating within the band 
174-216 MHz.
    (4) At least 3.1 km outside of the 74 dBuV/m field strength contour 
of a low power TV or a TV translator station operating within the bands 
470-608 MHz or 614-668 MHz.

[[Page 824]]

    (5) Whatever distance is necessary to protect other authorized users 
within these bands.
    (e) The user and the installer of a biomedical telemetry device 
operating within the frequency range 608-614 MHz and that will be 
located within 32 km of the very long baseline array (VLBA) stations or 
within 80 km of any of the other radio astronomy observatories noted in 
footnote US 311 of Section 2.106 of this chapter must coordinate with, 
and obtain the written concurrence of, the director of the affected 
radio astronomy observatory before the equipment can be installed or 
operated. The National Science Foundation point of contact for 
coordination is: Spectrum Manager, Division of Astronomical Sciences, 
NSF Rm 1045, 4201 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22230; tel: (703) 306-
1823.
    (f) Biomedical telemetry devices must not cause harmful interference 
to licensed TV broadcast stations or to other authorized radio services, 
such as operations on the broadcast frequencies under subparts G and H 
of part 74 of this chapter, land mobile stations operating under part 90 
of this chapter in the 470-512 MHz band, and radio astronomy operation 
in the 608-614 MHz band. (See Sec. 15.5.) If harmful interference 
occurs, the interference must either be corrected or the device must 
immediately cease operation on the occupied frequency. Further, the 
operator of the biomedical telemetry device must accept whatever level 
of interference is received from other radio operations. The operator, 
i.e., the health care facility, is responsible for resolving any 
interference that occurs subsequent to the installation of these 
devices.
    (g) The manufacturers, installers, and users of biomedical telemetry 
devices are reminded that they must ensure that biomedical telemetry 
transmitters operating under the provisions of this section avoid 
operating in close proximity to authorized services using this spectrum. 
Sufficient separation distance, necessary to avoid causing or receiving 
harmful interference, must be maintained from co-channel operations. 
These parties are reminded that the frequencies of the authorized 
services are subject to change, especially during the implementation of 
the digital television services. The operating frequencies of the part 
15 devices may need to be changed, as necessary and in accordance with 
the permissive change requirements of this chapter, to accommodate 
changes in the operating frequencies of the authorized services.
    (h) The manufacturers, installers and users of biomedical telemetry 
devices are cautioned that the operation of this equipment could result 
in harmful interference to other nearby medical devices.

operation of field disturbance sensors designed to be used in farm 
equipment, vehicles such as fork lifts that are intended primarily for 
use indoors or for very specialized operations, or railroad locomotives, 
railroad cars and other equipment which travels on fixed tracks is 
permitted. A field disturbance sensor will be considered not to be 
operating in a continuous mode if its operation is limited to specific 
activities of limited duration (e.g., putting a vehicle into reverse

Sec. 15.247  Operation within the bands 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz, and 5725-5850 MHz.

    (a) Operation under the provisions of this Section is limited to 
frequency hopping and digitally modulated intentional radiators that 
comply with the following provisions:
    (1) Frequency hopping systems shall have hopping channel carrier 
frequencies separated by a minimum of 25 kHz or the 20 dB bandwidth of 
the hopping channel, whichever is greater. Alternatively, frequency 
hopping systems operating in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band may have hopping 
channel carrier frequencies that are separated by 25 kHz or two-thirds 
of the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel, whichever is greater, 
provided the systems operate with an output power no greater than 125 
mW. The system shall hop to channel frequencies that are selected at the 
system hopping rate from a pseudo randomly ordered list of hopping 
frequencies. Each frequency must be used equally on the average by each 
transmitter. The system receivers shall have input bandwidths that match 
the hopping channel bandwidths of their corresponding transmitters and 
shall shift frequencies in synchronization with the transmitted signals.
    (i) For frequency hopping systems operating in the 902-928 MHz band: 
if the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is less than 250 kHz, the 
system shall use at least 50 hopping frequencies and the average time of 
occupancy on any frequency shall not be greater than 0.4 seconds within 
a 20 second period; if the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is 250 
kHz or greater, the system shall use at least 25 hopping frequencies and 
the average time of occupancy on any frequency shall not be

[[Page 826]]

greater than 0.4 seconds within a 10 second period. The maximum allowed 
20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is 500 kHz.
    (ii) Frequency hopping systems operating in the 5725-5850 MHz band 
shall use at least 75 hopping frequencies. The maximum 20 dB bandwidth 
of the hopping channel is 1 MHz. The average time of occupancy on any 
frequency shall not be greater than 0.4 seconds within a 30 second 
period.
    (iii) Frequency hopping systems in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band shall 
use at least 15 channels. The average time of occupancy on any channel 
shall not be greater than 0.4 seconds within a period of 0.4 seconds 
multiplied by the number of hopping channels employed. Frequency hopping 
systems may avoid or suppress transmissions on a particular hopping 
frequency provided that a minimum of 15 channels are used.
    (2) Systems using digital modulation techniques may operate in the 
902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz, and 5725-5850 MHz bands. The minimum 6 dB 
bandwidth shall be at least 500 kHz.
    (b) The maximum peak conducted output power of the intentional 
radiator shall not exceed the following:
    (1) For frequency hopping systems operating in the 2400-2483.5 MHz 
band employing at least 75 non-overlapping hopping channels, and all 
frequency hopping systems in the 5725-5850 MHz band: 1 watt. For all 
other frequency hopping systems in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band: 0.125 
watts.
    (2) For frequency hopping systems operating in the 902-928 MHz band: 
1 watt for systems employing at least 50 hopping channels; and, 0.25 
watts for systems employing less than 50 hopping channels, but at least 
25 hopping channels, as permitted under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (3) For systems using digital modulation in the 902-928 MHz, 2400-
2483.5 MHz, and 5725-5850 MHz bands: 1 Watt. As an alternative to a peak 
power measurement, compliance with the one Watt limit can be based on a 
measurement of the maximum conducted output power. Maximum Conducted 
Output Power is defined as the total transmit power delivered to all 
antennas and antenna elements averaged across all symbols in the 
signaling alphabet when the transmitter is operating at its maximum 
power control level. Power must be summed across all antennas and 
antenna elements. The average must not include any time intervals during 
which the transmitter is off or is transmitting at a reduced power 
level. If multiple modes of operation are possible (e.g., alternative 
modulation methods), the maximum conducted output power is the highest 
total transmit power occurring in any mode.
    (4) The conducted output power limit specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section is based on the use of antennas with directional gains that 
do not exceed 6 dBi. Except as shown in paragraph (c) of this section, 
if transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi are 
used, the conducted output power from the intentional radiator shall be 
reduced below the stated values in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) 
of this section, as appropriate, by the amount in dB that the 
directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (i) Systems operating in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band that are used 
exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations may employ transmitting 
antennas with directional gain greater than 6 dBi provided the maximum 
peak output power of the intentional radiator is reduced by 1 dB for 
every 3 dB that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (ii) Systems operating in the 5725-5850 MHz band that are used 
exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations may employ transmitting 
antennas with directional gain greater than 6 dBi without any 
corresponding reduction in transmitter peak output power.
    (iii) Fixed, point-to-point operation, as used in paragraphs 
(b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, excludes the use of point-to-
multipoint systems, omnidirectional applications, and multiple co-
located intentional radiators transmitting the same information. The 
operator of the spread spectrum intentional radiator or, if the 
equipment is professionally installed, the installer is responsible for 
ensuring that the system is used exclusively for fixed, point-to-point 
operations. The

[[Page 827]]

instruction manual furnished with the intentional radiator shall contain 
language in the installation instructions informing the operator and the 
installer of this responsibility.
    (c) Operation with directional antenna gains greater than 6 dBi.
    (1) Fixed point-to-point operation:
    (i) Systems operating in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band that are used 
exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations may employ transmitting 
antennas with directional gain greater than 6 dBi provided the maximum 
conducted output power of the intentional radiator is reduced by 1 dB 
for every 3 dB that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (ii) Systems operating in the 5725-5850 MHz band that are used 
exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations may employ transmitting 
antennas with directional gain greater than 6 dBi without any 
corresponding reduction in transmitter conducted output power.
    (iii) Fixed, point-to-point operation, as used in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, excludes the use of point-to-
multipoint systems, omnidirectional applications, and multiple co-
located intentional radiators transmitting the same information. The 
operator of the spread spectrum or digitally modulated intentional 
radiator or, if the equipment is professionally installed, the installer 
is responsible for ensuring that the system is used exclusively for 
fixed, point-to-point operations. The instruction manual furnished with 
the intentional radiator shall contain language in the installation 
instructions informing the operator and the installer of this 
responsibility.
    (2) In addition to the provisions in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), 
(b)(4) and (c)(1)(i) of this section, transmitters operating in the 
2400-2483.5 MHz band that emit multiple directional beams, 
simultaneously or sequentially, for the purpose of directing signals to 
individual receivers or to groups of receivers provided the emissions 
comply with the following:
    (i) Different information must be transmitted to each receiver.
    (ii) If the transmitter employs an antenna system that emits 
multiple directional beams but does not do emit multiple directional 
beams simultaneously, the total output power conducted to the array or 
arrays that comprise the device, i.e., the sum of the power supplied to 
all antennas, antenna elements, staves, etc. and summed across all 
carriers or frequency channels, shall not exceed the limit specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section, as applicable. However, the 
total conducted output power shall be reduced by 1 dB below the 
specified limits for each 3 dB that the directional gain of the antenna/
antenna array exceeds 6 dBi. The directional antenna gain shall be 
computed as follows:
    (A) The directional gain shall be calculated as the sum of 10 log 
(number of array elements or staves) plus the directional gain of the 
element or stave having the highest gain.
    (B) A lower value for the directional gain than that calculated in 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section will be accepted if sufficient 
evidence is presented, e.g., due to shading of the array or coherence 
loss in the beamforming.
    (iii) If a transmitter employs an antenna that operates 
simultaneously on multiple directional beams using the same or different 
frequency channels, the power supplied to each emission beam is subject 
to the power limit specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. If 
transmitted beams overlap, the power shall be reduced to ensure that 
their aggregate power does not exceed the limit specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section. In addition, the aggregate power transmitted 
simultaneously on all beams shall not exceed the limit specified in 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section by more than 8 dB.
    (iv) Transmitters that emit a single directional beam shall operate 
under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) In any 100 kHz bandwidth outside the frequency band in which the 
spread spectrum or digitally modulated intentional radiator is 
operating, the radio frequency power that is produced by the intentional 
radiator shall be at least 20 dB below that in the 100 kHz bandwidth 
within the band that contains the highest level of the desired

[[Page 828]]

power, based on either an RF conducted or a radiated measurement, 
provided the transmitter demonstrates compliance with the peak conducted 
power limits. If the transmitter complies with the conducted power 
limits based on the use of RMS averaging over a time interval, as 
permitted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the attenuation 
required under this paragraph shall be 30 dB instead of 20 dB. 
Attenuation below the general limits specified in Sec. 15.209(a) is not 
required. In addition, radiated emissions which fall in the restricted 
bands, as defined in Sec. 15.205(a), must also comply with the radiated 
emission limits specified in Sec. 15.209(a) (see Sec. 15.205(c)).
    (e) For digitally modulated systems, the power spectral density 
conducted from the intentional radiator to the antenna shall not be 
greater than 8 dBm in any 3 kHz band during any time interval of 
continuous transmission. This power spectral density shall be determined 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. The 
same method of determining the conducted output power shall be used to 
determine the power spectral density.
    (f) For the purposes of this section, hybrid systems are those that 
employ a combination of both frequency hopping and digital modulation 
techniques. The frequency hopping operation of the hybrid system, with 
the direct sequence or digital modulation operation turned off, shall 
have an average time of occupancy on any frequency not to exceed 0.4 
seconds within a time period in seconds equal to the number of hopping 
frequencies employed multiplied by 0.4. The digital modulation operation 
of the hybrid system, with the frequency hopping operation turned off, 
shall comply with the power density requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (g) Frequency hopping spread spectrum systems are not required to 
employ all available hopping channels during each transmission. However, 
the system, consisting of both the transmitter and the receiver, must be 
designed to comply with all of the regulations in this section should 
the transmitter be presented with a continuous data (or information) 
stream. In addition, a system employing short transmission bursts must 
comply with the definition of a frequency hopping system and must 
distribute its transmissions over the minimum number of hopping channels 
specified in this section.
    (h) The incorporation of intelligence within a frequency hopping 
spread spectrum system that permits the system to recognize other users 
within the spectrum band so that it individually and independently 
chooses and adapts its hopsets to avoid hopping on occupied channels is 
permitted. The coordination of frequency hopping systems in any other 
manner for the express purpose of avoiding the simultaneous occupancy of 
individual hopping frequencies by multiple transmitters is not 
permitted.

    Note: Spread spectrum systems are sharing these bands on a 
noninterference basis with systems supporting critical Government 
requirements that have been allocated the usage of these bands, 
secondary only to ISM equipment operated under the provisions of part 18 
of this chapter. Many of these Government systems are airborne 
radiolocation systems that emit a high EIRP which can cause interference 
to other users. Also, investigations of the effect of spread spectrum 
interference to U. S. Government operations in the 902-928 MHz band may 
require a future decrease in the power limits allowed for spread 
spectrum operation.
    (i) Systems operating under the provisions of this section shall be 
operated in a manner that ensures that the public is not exposed to 
radio frequency energy levels in excess of the Commission's guidelines. 
See Sec. 1.1307(b)(1) of this chapter.

    (b) Fixed, point-to-point operation as referred to in this paragraph 
shall be limited to systems employing a fixed transmitter transmitting 
to a fixed remote location. Point-to-multipoint systems, omnidirectional 
applications, and multiple co-located intentional radiators transmitting 
the same information are not allowed. Fixed, point-to-point operation is 
permitted in the 24.05-24.25 GHz band subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The field strength of emissions in this band shall not exceed 
2500 millivolts/meter.
    (2) The frequency tolerance of the carrier signal shall be 
maintained within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.001% of the operating 
frequency over a temperature variation of -20 degrees to +50 degrees C 
at normal supply voltage, and for a variation in the primary supply 
voltage from 85% to 115% of the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 
20 degrees C. For battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall 
be performed using a new battery.
    (3) Antenna gain must be at least 33 dBi. Alternatively, the main 
lobe beamwidth must not exceed 3.5 degrees. The beamwidth limit shall 
apply to both the azimuth and elevation planes. At antenna gains over 33 
dBi or beamwidths narrower than 3.5 degrees, power must be reduced to 
ensure that the field strength does not exceed 2500 millivolts/meter.
    (c) Field strength limits are specified at a distance of 3 meters.
    (d) Emissions radiated outside of the specified frequency bands, 
except for harmonics, shall be attenuated by at least 50 dB below the 
level of the fundamental or to the general radiated emission limits in 
Sec. 15.209, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (e) As shown in Sec. 15.35(b), for frequencies above 1000 MHz, the 
field strength limits in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are 
based on average limits. However, the peak field strength of any 
emission shall not exceed the maximum permitted average limits specified 
above by more than 20 dB under any condition of modulation. For point-
to-point operation under paragraph (b) of this section, the peak field 
strength shall not exceed 2500 millivolts/meter at 3 meters along the 
antenna azimuth.
    (f) Parties considering the manufacture, importation, marketing or 
operation of equipment under this section should also note the 
requirement in Sec. 15.37(d).

Sec. 15.250  Operation of wideband systems within the band 5925-7250 MHz.

    (a) The -10 dB bandwidth of a device operating under the provisions 
of this section must be contained within the 5925-7250 MHz band under 
all conditions of operation including the effects from stepped 
frequency, frequency hopping or other modulation techniques that may be 
employed as well as the frequency stability of the transmitter over 
expected variations in temperature and supply voltage.
    (b) The -10 dB bandwidth of the fundamental emission shall be at 
least 50 MHz. For transmitters that employ frequency hopping, stepped

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) In addition to the radiated emission limits specified in the 
table in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, transmitters operating under 
the provisions of this section shall not exceed the following RMS 
average limits when measured using a resolution bandwidth of no less 
than 1 kHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                EIRP in

1559-1610....................................................      -85.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) There is a limit on the peak level of the emissions contained 
within a 50 MHz bandwidth centered on the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs and this 50 MHz bandwidth must be contained 
within the 5925-7250 MHz band. The peak EIRP limit is 20 log (RBW/50) 
dBm where RBW is the resolution bandwidth in megahertz that is employed 
by the measurement instrument. RBW shall not be lower than 1 MHz or 
greater than 50 MHz. The video bandwidth of the measurement instrument 
shall not be less than RBW. If RBW is greater than 3 MHz, the 
application for certification filed with the Commission shall contain a 
detailed description of the test procedure, calibration of the test 
setup, and the instrumentation employed in the testing.
    (4) Radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz shall not exceed the 
emission levels in Sec. 15.209.
    (5) Emissions from digital circuitry used to enable the operation of 
the transmitter may comply with the limits in Sec. 15.209 provided it 
can be clearly demonstrated that those emissions are due solely to 
emissions from digital circuitry contained within the transmitter and 
the emissions are not intended to be radiated from the transmitter's 
antenna. Emissions from associated digital devices, as defined in Sec. 
15.3(k), e.g., emissions from digital circuitry used to control 
additional functions or capabilities other than the operation of the 
transmitter, are subject to the limits contained in subpart B of this 
part. Emissisons from these digital circuits shall not be employed in 
determining the -10 dB bandwidth of the fundamental emission or the 
frequency at which the highest emission level occurs.
    (e) Measurement procedures:
    (1) All emissions at and below 960 MHz are based on measurements 
employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector. Unless otherwise specified, all 
RMS average emission levels specified in this section are to be measured 
utilizing a 1 MHz resolution bandwidth with a one millisecond dwell over 
each 1 MHz segment. The frequency span of the analyzer should equal the 
number of sampling bins times 1 MHz and the sweep rate of the analyzer 
should equal the number of sampling bins times one millisecond. The 
provision in Sec. 15.35(c) that allows emissions to be averaged over a 
100 millisecond period does not apply to devices operating under this 
section. The video bandwidth of the measurement instrument shall not be 
less than the resolution bandwidth and trace averaging shall not be 
employed. The RMS average emission measurement is to be repeated over 
multiple sweeps with the analyzer set for maximum hold until the 
amplitude stabilizes.
    (2) The peak emission measurement is to be repeated over multiple 
sweeps with the analyzer set for maximum hold until the amplitude 
stabilizes.
    (3) For transmitters that employ frequency hopping, stepped 
frequency or similar modulation types, the peak emission level 
measurement, the measurement of the RMS average emission levels, and the 
measurement to determine the frequency at which the highest level 
emission occurs shall be made with the frequency hop or step function 
active. Gated signals may be measured with the gating active. The 
provisions

[[Page 831]]

of Sec. 15.31(c) continue to apply to transmitters that employ swept 
frequency modulation.
    (4) The -10 dB bandwidth is based on measurement using a peak 
detector, a 1 MHz resolution bandwidth, and a video bandwidth greater 
than or equal to the resolution bandwidth.
    (5) Alternative measurement procedures may be considered by the 
Commission.

within a 50 MHz bandwidth centered on the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs and this 50 MHz bandwidth must be contained 
within the 16.2-17.7 GHz band or the 24.05-29.0 GHz band, as 
appropriate. The peak EIRP limit is 20 log (RBW/50) dBm where RBW is the 
resolution bandwidth in MHz employed by the measurement instrument. RBW 
shall not be lower than 1 MHz or greater than 50 MHz. Further, RBW shall

employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector. Unless otherwise specified, all 
RMS average emission levels specified in this section are to be measured 
utilizing a 1 MHz resolution bandwidth with a one millisecond dwell over 
each 1 MHz segment. The frequency span of the analyzer should equal the 
number of sampling bins times 1 MHz and the sweep rate of the analyzer 
should equal the number of sampling bins times one millisecond. The 
provision in Sec. 15.35(c) that allows emissions to be averaged over a

    (a) Operation under the provisions of this section is not permitted 
for the following products:
    (1) Equipment used on aircraft or satellites.
    (2) Field disturbance sensors, including vehicle radar systems, 
unless the field disturbance sensors are employed for fixed operation. 
For the purposes of this section, the reference to fixed operation 
includes field disturbance sensors installed in fixed equipment, even if 
the sensor itself moves within the equipment.
    (b) Within the 57-64 GHz band, emission levels shall not exceed the 
following:
    (1) For products other than fixed field disturbance sensors, the 
average power density of any emission, measured during the transmit 
interval, shall not exceed 9 [mu]W/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from the 
radiating structure, and the peak power density of any emission shall 
not exceed 18 [mu]W/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from the radiating 
structure.
    (2) For fixed field disturbance sensors that occupy 500 MHz or less 
of bandwidth and that are contained wholly within the frequency band 
61.0-61.5 GHz, the average power density of any emission, measured 
during the transmit interval, shall not exceed 9 [mu]W/cm\2\,

[[Page 835]]

as measured 3 meters from the radiating structure, and the peak power 
density of any emission shall not exceed 18 [mu]W/cm\2\, as measured 3 
meters from the radiating structure. In addition, the average power 
density of any emission outside of the 61-61.5 GHz band, measured during 
the transmit interval, but still within the 57-64 GHz band, shall not 
exceed 9 nW/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from the radiating structure, 
and the peak power density of any emission shall not exceed 18 nW/cm\2\, 
as measured three meters from the radiating structure.
    (3) For fixed field disturbance sensors other than those operating 
under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the peak 
transmitter output power shall not exceed 0.1 mW and the peak power 
density shall not exceed 9 nW/cm\2\ at a distance of 3 meters.
    (4) Peak power density shall be measured with an RF detector that 
has a detection bandwidth that encompasses the 57-64 GHz band and has a 
video bandwidth of at least 10 MHz, or using an equivalent measurement 
method.
    (5) The average emission levels shall be calculated, based on the 
measured peak levels, over the actual time period during which 
transmission occurs.
    (c) Limits on spurious emissions:
    (1) The power density of any emissions outside the 57-64 GHz band 
shall consist solely of spurious emissions.
    (2) Radiated emissions below 40 GHz shall not exceed the general 
limits in Sec. 15.209.
    (3) Between 40 GHz and 200 GHz, the level of these emissions shall 
not exceed 90 pW/cm\2\ at a distance of 3 meters.
    (4) The levels of the spurious emissions shall not exceed the level 
of the fundamental emission.
    (d) Only spurious emissions and transmissions related to a publicly-
accessible coordination channel, whose purpose is to coordinate 
operation between diverse transmitters with a view towards reducing the 
probability of interference throughout the 57-64 GHz band, are permitted 
in the 57-57.05 GHz band.

    Note to paragraph (d): The 57-57.05 GHz is reserved exclusively for 
a publicly-accessible coordination channel. The development of standards 
for this channel shall be performed pursuant to authorizations issued 
under part 5 of this chapter.

    (e) Except as specified elsewhere in this paragraph (e), the total 
peak transmitter output power shall not exceed 500 mW.
    (1) Transmitters with an emission bandwidth of less than 100 MHz 
must limit their peak transmitter output power to the product of 500 mW 
times their emission bandwidth divided by 100 MHz. For the purposes of 
this paragraph (e)(1), emission bandwidth is defined as the 
instantaneous frequency range occupied by a steady state radiated signal 
with modulation, outside which the radiated power spectral density never 
exceeds 6 dB below the maximum radiated power spectral density in the 
band, as measured with a 100 kHz resolution bandwidth spectrum analyzer. 
The center frequency must be stationary during the measurement interval, 
even if not stationary during normal operation (e.g. for frequency 
hopping devices).
    (2) Peak transmitter output power shall be measured with an RF 
detector that has a detection bandwidth that encompasses the 57-64 GHz 
band and that has a video bandwidth of at least 10 MHz, or using an 
equivalent measurement method.
    (3) For purposes of demonstrating compliance with this paragraph 
(e), corrections to the transmitter output power may be made due to the 
antenna and circuit loss.
    (f) Fundamental emissions must be contained within the frequency 
bands specified in this section during all conditions of operation. 
Equipment is presumed to operate over the temperature range -20 to +50 
degrees celsius with an input voltage variation of 85% to 115% of rated 
input voltage, unless justification is presented to demonstrate 
otherwise.
    (g) Regardless of the power density levels permitted under this 
section, devices operating under the provisions of this section are 
subject to the radiofrequency radiation exposure requirements specified 
in Sec. Sec. 1.1307(b), 2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter, as 
appropriate. Applications for equipment authorization of devices 
operating under this

[[Page 836]]

section must contain a statement confirming compliance with these 
requirements for both fundamental emissions and unwanted emissions. 
Technical information showing the basis for this statement must be 
submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (h) Any transmitter that has received the necessary FCC equipment 
authorization under the rules of this chapter may be mounted in a group 
installation for simultaneous operation with one or more other 
transmitter(s) that have received the necessary FCC equipment 
authorization, without any additional equipment authorization. However, 
no transmitter operating under the provisions of this section may be 
equipped with external phase-locking inputs that permit beam-forming 
arrays to be realized.
    (i) For all transmissions that emanate from inside of a building, 
within any one second interval of signal transmission, each transmitter 
with a peak output power equal to or greater than 0.1 mW or a peak power 
density equal to or greater than 3 nW/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from 
the radiating structure, must transmit a transmitter identification at 
least once. Each application for equipment authorization for equipment 
that will be used inside of a building must declare that the equipment 
contains the required transmitter identification feature and must 
specify a method whereby interested parties can obtain sufficient 
information, at no cost, to enable them to fully detect and decode this 
transmitter identification information. Upon the completion of decoding, 
the transmitter identification data block must provide the following 
fields:
    (1) FCC Identifier, which shall be programmed at the factory.
    (2) Manufacturer's serial number, which shall be programmed at the 
factory.
    (3) Provision for at least 24 bytes of data relevant to the specific 
device, which shall be field programmable. The grantee must implement a 
method that makes it possible for users to specify and update this data. 
The recommended content of this field is information to assist in 
contacting the operator.

Sec. 15.257  Operation within the band 92-95 GHz.

    (a) Operation of devices under the provisions of this section is 
limited to indoor use;
    (1) Devices operating under the provisions of this section, by the 
nature of their design, must be capable of operation only indoors. The 
necessity to operate with a fixed indoor infrastructure, e.g., a 
transmitter that must be connected to the AC power lines, may be 
considered sufficient to demonstrate this.
    (2) The use of outdoor mounted antennas, e.g., antennas mounted on 
the outside of a building or on a telephone pole, or any other outdoors 
infrastructure is prohibited.
    (3) The emissions from equipment operated under this section shall 
not be intentionally directed outside of the building in which the 
equipment is located, such as through a window or a doorway.
    (4) Devices operating under the provisions of this section shall 
bear the following or similar statement in a conspicuous location on the 
device or in the instruction manual supplied with the device: ``This 
equipment may only be operated indoors. Operation outdoors is in 
violation of 47 U.S.C. 301 and could subject the operator to serious 
legal penalties.''
    (b) Operation under the provisions of this section is not permitted 
on aircraft or satellites.
    (c) Within the 92-95 GHz bands, the emission levels shall not exceed 
the following:
    (1) The average power density of any emission, measured during the 
transmit interval, shall not exceed 9 uW/sq. cm, as measured at 3 meters 
from the radiating structure, and the peak power density of any emission 
shall not exceed 18 uW/sq. cm, as measured 3 meters from the radiating 
structure.
    (2) Peak power density shall be measured with an RF detector that 
has a detection bandwidth that encompasses the band being used and has a 
video

[[Page 837]]

bandwidth of at least 10 MHz, or uses an equivalent measurement method.
    (3) The average emission limits shall be calculated based on the 
measured peak levels, over the actual time period during which 
transmission occurs.
    (d) Limits on spurious emissions:
    (1) The power density of any emissions outside the band being used 
shall consist solely of spurious emissions.
    (2) Radiated emissions below 40 GHz shall not exceed the general 
limits in Sec. 15.209.
    (3) Between 40 GHz and 200 GHz, the level of these emissions shall 
not exceed 90 pW/cm \2\ at a distance of 3 meters.
    (4) The levels of the spurious emissions shall not exceed the level 
of the fundamental emission.
    (e) The total peak transmitter output power shall not exceed 500 mW.
    (f) Fundamental emissions must be contained within the frequency 
bands specified in this section during all conditions of operation. 
Equipment is presumed to operate over the temperature range -20 to +50 
degrees Celsius with an input voltage variation of 85% to 115% of rated 
input voltage, unless justification is presented to demonstrate 
otherwise.
    (g) Regardless of the maximum EIRP and maximum power density levels 
permitted under this section, devices operating under the provisions of 
this section are subject to the radiofrequency radiation exposure 
requirements specified in 47 CFR 1.1307(b), 2.1091, and 2.1093, as 
appropriate. Applications for equipment authorization of devices 
operating under this section must contain a statement confirming 
compliance with these requirements for both fundamental emissions and 
unwanted emissions. Technical information showing the basis for this 
statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (h) Any transmitter that has received the necessary FCC equipment 
authorization under the rules of this chapter may be mounted in a group 
installation for simultaneous operation with one or more other 
transmitter(s) that have received the necessary FCC equipment 
authorization, without any additional equipment authorization. However, 
no transmitter operating under the provisions of this section may be 
equipped with external phase-locking inputs that permit beam-forming 
arrays to be realized.

harmful interference to the incumbent microwave facilities.
    (f) Peak transmit power. The peak power output as measured over an 
interval of time equal to the frame rate or transmission burst of the 
device under all conditions of modulation. Usually this parameter is 
measured as a conducted emission by direct connection of a calibrated

connected directly, alternative techniques acceptable to the Commission 
may be used.
    (g) Personal Communications Services (PCS) Devices [Unlicensed].

Sec. 15.305  Equipment authorization requirement.

    PCS devices operating under this subpart shall be certified by the 
Commission under the procedures in subpart J of part 2 of this chapter 
before marketing. The application for certification must contain 
sufficient information to demonstrate compliance with the requirements 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 15.307  Coordination with fixed microwave service.

    (a) UTAM, Inc. is designated to coordinate and manage the transition 
of the 1910-1930 MHz band from the Private Operational-Fixed Microwave 
Service (OFS) operating under part 101 of this chapter to unlicensed PCS 
operations,
    (b) Each application for certification of equipment operating under 
the provisions of this subpart must be accompanied by an affidavit from 
UTAM, Inc. certifying that the applicant is a participating member of 
UTAM, Inc. In the event a grantee fails to fulfill the obligations 
attendant to participation in UTAM, Inc., the Commission may invoke 
administrative sanctions as necessary to preclude continued marketing 
and installation of devices covered by the grant of certification, 
including but not limited to revoking certification.
    (c) An application for certification of a PCS device that is deemed 
by UTAM, Inc. to be noncoordinatable will not be accepted until the 
Commission announces that a need for coordination no longer exists.
    (d) A coordinatable PCS device is required to incorporate means that 
ensure that it cannot be activated until its location has been 
coordinated by UTAM, Inc. The application for certification shall 
contain an explanation of all measures taken to prevent unauthorized 
operation. This explanation shall include all procedural safeguards, 
such as the mandatory use of licensed technicians to install the 
equipment, and a complete description of all technical features 
controlling activation of the device.
    (e) A coordinatable PCS device shall incorporate an automatic 
mechanism for disabling operation in the event it is moved outside the 
geographic area where its operation has been coordinated by UTAM, Inc. 
The application for certification shall contain a full description of 
the safeguards against unauthorized relocation and must satisfy the 
Commission that the safeguards cannot be easily defeated.
    (f) At such time as the Commission deems that the need for 
coordination between unlicensed PCS operations and existing Part 101 
Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Services ceases to exist, the 
disabling mechanism required by paragraph (e) of this section will no 
longer be required.

[[Page 839]]

    (g) Operations under the provisions of this subpart are required to 
protect systems in the Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Service 
operating within the 1850-1990 MHz band until the dates and conditions 
specified in Sec. Sec. 101.69 through 101.73 of this chapter for 
termination of primary status. Interference protection is not required 
for part 101 stations in this band licensed on a secondary basis.
    (h) The operator of a PCS device that is relocated from the 
coordinated area specified by UTAM, Inc., must cease operating the 
device until coordination for the new location is verified by UTAM, Inc.

Sec. 15.309  Cross reference.

    (a) The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to unlicensed PCS 
devices, except where specific provisions are contained in subpart D.
    (b) The requirements of subpart D apply only to the radio 
transmitter contained in the PCS device. Other aspects of the operation 
of a PCS device may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in 
this chapter. In particular, a PCS device that includes digital 
circuitry not directly associated with the radio transmitter also is 
subject to the requirements for unintentional radiators in subpart B.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) All transmissions must use only digital modulation techniques.
    (c) Peak transmit power shall not exceed 100 microwatts multiplied 
by the square root of the emission bandwidth in hertz. Peak transmit 
power must be measured over any interval of continuous transmission 
using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an rms-equivalent voltage. 
The measurement results shall be properly adjusted for any instrument 
limitations, such as detector response times, limited resolution 
bandwidth capability when compared to the emission bandwidth, 
sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak measurement for the 
emission in question over the full bandwidth of the channel.
    (d) Power spectral density shall not exceed 3 milliwatts in any 3 
kHz bandwidth as measured with a spectrum analyzer having a resolution 
bandwidth of 3 kHz.
    (e) The peak transmit power shall be reduced by the amount in 
decibels that the maximum directional gain of the antenna exceeds 3 dBi.
    (f) The device shall automatically discontinue transmission in case 
of either absence of information to transmit or operational failure. The

radiation exposure requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 1.1307(b), 
2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. All equipment shall 
be considered to operate in a ``general population/uncontrolled''

<R05>
Sec. 15.321  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 15.323  Specific requirements for devices operating in the 1920-1930 MHz sub-band.

    (a) Operation shall be contained within the 1920-1930 MHz band. The 
emission bandwidth shall be less then 2.5 MHz. The power level shall be 
as specified in Sec. 15.319(c), but in no event shall the emission 
bandwidth be less than 50 kHz.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Devices must incorporate a mechanism for monitoring the time and 
spectrum windows that its transmission is intended to occupy. The 
following criteria must be met:
    (1) Immediately prior to initiating transmission, devices must 
monitor the combined time and spectrum windows in which they intend to 
transmit for a period of at least 10 milliseconds for systems designed 
to use a 10 milliseconds or shorter frame period or at least 20 
milliseconds for systems designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period.
    (2) The monitoring threshold must not be more than 30 dB above the 
thermal noise power for a bandwidth equivalent to the emission bandwidth 
used by the device.
    (3) If no signal above the threshold level is detected, transmission 
may commence and continue with the same emission bandwidth in the 
monitored time and spectrum windows without further monitoring. However, 
occupation of the same combined time and spectrum windows by a device or 
group of cooperating devices continuously over a period of time longer 
than 8 hours is not permitted without repeating the access criteria.
    (4) Once access to specific combined time and spectrum windows is 
obtained an acknowledgment from a system participant must be received by 
the initiating transmitter within one second or transmission must cease. 
Periodic acknowledgments must be received at least every 30 seconds or 
transmission must cease. Channels used exclusively for control and 
signaling information may transmit continuously for 30 seconds without 
receiving an acknowledgment, at which time the access criteria must be 
repeated.
    (5) If access to spectrum is not available as determined by the 
above, and a minimum of 40 duplex system access channels are defined for 
the system, the time and spectrum windows with the lowest power level 
below a monitoring threshold of 50 dB above the thermal noise power 
determined for the emission bandwidth may be accessed. A device 
utilizing the provisions of this paragraph must have monitored all 
access channels defined for its system within the last 10 seconds and 
must verify, within the 20 milliseconds (40 milliseconds for devices 
designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period) immediately preceding 
actual channel access that the detected power of the selected time and 
spectrum windows is no higher than the previously detected value. The 
power measurement resolution for this comparison must be accurate to 
within 6 dB. No device or group of co-operating devices located within 1 
meter of each other shall during any frame period occupy more than 6 MHz 
of aggregate bandwidth, or alternatively, more than one third of the 
time and spectrum windows defined by the system.

[[Page 841]]

    (6) If the selected combined time and spectrum windows are 
unavailable, the device may either monitor and select different windows 
or seek to use the same windows after waiting an amount of time, 
randomly chosen from a uniform random distribution between 10 and 150 
milliseconds, commencing when the channel becomes available.
    (7) The monitoring system bandwidth must be equal to or greater than 
the emission bandwidth of the intended transmission and have a maximum 
reaction time less than 50xSQRT (1.25/emission bandwidth in MHz) 
microseconds for signals at the applicable threshold level but shall not 
be required to be less than 50 microseconds. If a signal is detected 
that is 6 dB or more above the applicable threshold level, the maximum 
reaction time shall be 35xSQRT (1.25/emission bandwidth in MHz) 
microseconds but shall not be required to be less than 35 microseconds.
    (8) The monitoring system shall use the same antenna used for 
transmission, or an antenna that yields equivalent reception at that 
location.
    (9) Devices that have a power output lower than the maximum 
permitted under this subpart may increase their monitoring detection 
threshold by one decibel for each one decibel that the transmitter power 
is below the maximum permitted.
    (10) An initiating device may attempt to establish a duplex 
connection by monitoring both its intended transmit and receive time and 
spectrum windows. If both the intended transmit and receive time and 
spectrum windows meet the access criteria, then the initiating device 
can initiate a transmission in the intended transmit time and spectrum 
window. If the power detected by the responding device can be decoded as 
a duplex connection signal from the initiating device, then the 
responding device may immediately begin transmitting on the receive time 
and spectrum window monitored by the initiating device.
    (11) An initiating device that is prevented from monitoring during 
its intended transmit window due to monitoring system blocking from the 
transmissions of a co-located (within one meter) transmitter of the same 
system, may monitor the portions of the time and spectrum windows in 
which they intend to receive over a period of at least 10 milliseconds. 
The monitored time and spectrum window must total at least 50 percent of 
the 10 millisecond frame interval and the monitored spectrum must be 
within 1.25 MHz of the center frequency of channel(s) already occupied 
by that device or co-located co-operating devices. If the access 
criteria is met for the intended receive time and spectrum window under 
the above conditions, then transmission in the intended transmit window 
by the initiating device may commence.
    (12) The provisions of (c)(10) or (c)(11) of this section shall not 
be used to extend the range of spectrum occupied over space or time for 
the purpose of denying fair access to spectrum to other devices.
    (d) Emissions outside the sub-band shall be attenuated below a 
reference power of 112 milliwatts as follows: 30 dB between the sub-band 
and 1.25 MHz above or below the sub-band; 50 dB between 1.25 and 2.5 MHz 
above or below the sub-band; and 60 dB at 2.5 MHz or greater above or 
below the sub-band. Emissions inside the sub-band must comply with the 
following emission mask: In the bands between 1B and 2B measured from 
the center of the emission bandwidth the total power emitted by the 
device shall be at least 30 dB below the transmit power permitted for 
that device; in the bands between 2B and 3B measured from the center of 
the emission bandwidth the total power emitted by an intentional 
radiator shall be at least 50 dB below the transmit power permitted for 
that radiator; in the bands between 3B and the sub-band edge the total 
power emitted by an intentional radiator in the measurement bandwidth 
shall be at least 60 dB below the transmit power permitted for that 
radiator. ``B'' is defined as the emission bandwidth of the device in 
hertz. Compliance with the emission limits is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing peak detector function with an 
instrument resolution bandwidth approximately equal to 1.0 percent of 
the emission bandwidth of the device under measurement.

[[Page 842]]

    (e) The frame period (a set of consecutive time slots in which the 
position of each time slot can be identified by reference to a 
synchronizing source) of an intentional radiator operating in these sub-
bands shall be 20 milliseconds or 10 milliseconds/X where X is a 
positive whole number. Each device that implements time division for the 
purposes of maintaining a duplex connection on a given frequency carrier 
shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a frequency stability of at 
least 50 parts per million (ppm). Each device which further divides 
access in time in order to support multiple communication links on a 
given frequency carrier shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a 
frequency stability of at least 10 ppm. The jitter (time-related, 
abrupt, spurious variations in the duration of the frame interval) 
introduced at the two ends of such a communication link shall not exceed 
25 microseconds for any two consecutive transmissions. Transmissions 
shall be continuous in every time and spectrum window during the frame 
period defined for the device.
    (f) The frequency stability of the carrier frequency of the 
intentional radiator shall be maintained within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 
ppm over 1 hour or the interval between channel access monitoring, 
whichever is shorter. The frequency stability shall be maintained over a 
temperature variation of -20[deg] to +50 [deg]C at normal supply 
voltage, and over a variation in the primary supply voltage of 85 
percent to 115 percent of the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 
20 [deg]C. For equipment that is capable only of operating from a 
battery, the frequency stability tests shall be performed using a new 
battery without any further requirement to vary supply voltage.

reduced power level. If multiple modes of operation are possible (e.g., 
alternative modulation methods), the maximum conducted output power is 
the highest total transmit power occurring in any mode.
    (o) Power Spectral Density. The power spectral density is the total 
energy output per unit bandwidth from a pulse or sequence of pulses for 
which the transmit power is at its peak or maximum level, divided by the 
total duration of the pulses. This total time does not include the time 
between pulses during which the transmit power is off or below its 
maximum level.
    (p) Pulse. A pulse is a continuous transmission of a sequence of 
modulation symbols, during which the average symbol envelope power is 
constant.
    (q) RLAN. Radio Local Area Network.
    (r) Transmit Power Control (TPC). A feature that enables a U-NII 
device to dynamically switch between several transmission power levels 
in the data transmission process.
    (s) U-NII devices. Intentional radiators operating in the frequency 
bands 5.15-5.35 GHz and 5.470-5.825 GHz that use wideband digital 
modulation techniques and provide a wide array of high data rate mobile 
and fixed communications for individuals, businesses, and institutions.

Sec. 15.405  Cross reference.

    (a) The provisions of subparts A, B, and C of this part apply to 
unlicensed U-NII devices, except where specific provisions are contained 
in subpart E. Manufacturers should note that this includes the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 15.203 and 15.205.
    (b) The requirements of subpart E apply only to the radio 
transmitter contained in the U-NII device. Other aspects of the 
operation of a U-NII device may be subject to requirements contained 
elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a U-NII device that includes 
digital circuitry not directly associated with the radio transmitter 
also is subject to the requirements for unintentional radiators in 
subpart B.

[63 FR 40835, July 31, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 15.407  General technical requirements.

    (a) Power limits:
    (1) For the band 5.15-5.25 GHz, the maximum conducted output power 
over the frequency band of operation shall not exceed the lesser of 50 
mW or 4 dBm + 10 log B, where B is the 26-dB emission bandwidth in MHz. 
In addition, the peak power spectral density shall not exceed 4 dBm in 
any 1-MHz band. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater 
than 6 dBi are used, both the maximum conducted output power and the 
peak power spectral density shall be reduced by the

[[Page 844]]

amount in dB that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (2) For the 5.25-5.35 GHz and 5.47-5.725 GHz bands, the maximum 
conducted output power over the frequency bands of operation shall not 
exceed the lesser of 250 mW or 11 dBm + 10 log B, where B is the 26 dB 
emission bandwidth in megahertz. In addition, the peak power spectral 
density shall not exceed 11 dBm in any 1 megahertz band. If transmitting 
antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used, both the 
maximum conducted output power and the peak power spectral density shall 
be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional gain of the antenna 
exceeds 6 dBi.
    (3) For the band 5.725-5.825 GHz, the maximum conducted output power 
over the frequency band of operation shall not exceed the lesser of 1 W 
or 17 dBm + 10 log B, where B is the 26-dB emission bandwidth in MHz. In 
addition, the peak power spectral density shall not exceed 17 dBm in any 
1-MHz band. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 
dBi are used, both the maximum conducted output power and the peak power 
spectral density shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the 
directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi. However, fixed point-to-
point U-NII devices operating in this band may employ transmitting 
antennas with directional gain up to 23 dBi without any corresponding 
reduction in the transmitter peak output power or peak power spectral 
density. For fixed, point-to-point U-NII transmitters that employ a 
directional antenna gain greater than 23 dBi, a 1 dB reduction in peak 
transmitter power and peak power spectral density for each 1 dB of 
antenna gain in excess of 23 dBi would be required. Fixed, point-to-
point operations exclude the use of point-to-multipoint systems, 
omnidirectional applications, and multiple collocated transmitters 
transmitting the same information. The operator of the U-NII device, or 
if the equipment is professionally installed, the installer, is 
responsible for ensuring that systems employing high gain directional 
antennas are used exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations.

    Note to paragraph (a)(3): The Commission strongly recommends that 
parties employing U-NII devices to provide critical communications 
services should determine if there are any nearby Government radar 
systems that could affect their operation.

    (4) The maximum conducted output power must be measured over any 
interval of continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in 
terms of an rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be 
properly adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector 
response times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to 
the emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak 
measurement conforming to the above definitions for the emission in 
question.
    (5) The peak power spectral density is measured as a conducted 
emission by direct connection of a calibrated test instrument to the 
equipment under test. If the device cannot be connected directly, 
alternative techniques acceptable to the Commission may be used. 
Measurements are made over a bandwidth of 1 MHz or the 26 dB emission 
bandwidth of the device, whichever is less. A resolution bandwidth less 
than the measurement bandwidth can be used, provided that the measured 
power is integrated to show total power over the measurement bandwidth. 
If the resolution bandwidth is approximately equal to the measurement 
bandwidth, and much less than the emission bandwidth of the equipment 
under test, the measured results shall be corrected to account for any 
difference between the resolution bandwidth of the test instrument and 
its actual noise bandwidth.
    (6) The ratio of the peak excursion of the modulation envelope 
(measured using a peak hold function) to the maximum conducted output 
power (measured as specified above) shall not exceed 13 dB across any 1 
MHz bandwidth or the emission bandwidth whichever is less.
    (b) Undesirable emission limits: Except as shown in paragraph (b)(6) 
of this section, the peak emissions outside of the frequency bands of 
operation shall be attenuated in accordance with the following limits:

[[Page 845]]

    (1) For transmitters operating in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band: all 
emissions outside of the 5.15-5.35 GHz band shall not exceed an EIRP of 
-27 dBm/MHz.
    (2) For transmitters operating in the 5.25-5.35 GHz band: all 
emissions outside of the 5.15-5.35 GHz band shall not exceed an EIRP of 
-27 dBm/MHz. Devices operating in the 5.25-5.35 GHz band that generate 
emissions in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band must meet all applicable technical 
requirements for operation in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band (including indoor 
use) or alternatively meet an out-of-band emission EIRP limit of -27 
dBm/MHz in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band.
    (3) For transmitters operating in the 5.47-5.725 GHz band: all 
emissions outside of the 5.47-5.725 GHz band shall not exceed an EIRP of 
-27 dBm/MHz.
    (4) For transmitters operating in the 5.725-5.825 GHz band: all 
emissions within the frequency range from the band edge to 10 MHz above 
or below the band edge shall not exceed an EIRP of -17 dBm/MHz; for 
frequencies 10 MHz or greater above or below the band edge, emissions 
shall not exceed an EIRP of -27 dBm/MHz.
    (5) The emission measurements shall be performed using a minimum 
resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz. A lower resolution bandwidth may be 
employed near the band edge, when necessary, provided the measured 
energy is integrated to show the total power over 1 MHz.
    (6) Unwanted emissions below 1 GHz must comply with the general 
field strength limits set forth in Sec. 15.209. Further, any U-NII 
devices using an AC power line are required to comply also with the 
conducted limits set forth in Sec. 15.207.
    (7) The provisions of Sec. 15.205 apply to intentional radiators 
operating under this section.
    (8) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier 
frequency shall be adjusted as close to the upper and lower frequency 
block edges as the design of the equipment permits.
    (c) The device shall automatically discontinue transmission in case 
of either absence of information to transmit or operational failure. 
These provisions are not intended to preclude the transmission of 
control or signalling information or the use of repetitive codes used by 
certain digital technologies to complete frame or burst intervals. 
Applicants shall include in their application for equipment 
authorization a description of how this requirement is met.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Within the 5.15-5.25 GHz band, U-NII devices will be restricted 
to indoor operations to reduce any potential for harmful interference to 
co-channel MSS operations.
    (f) U-NII devices are subject to the radio frequency radiation 
exposure requirements specified in Sec. 1.1307(b), Sec. 2.1091 and 
Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. All equipment shall be 
considered to operate in a ``general population/uncontrolled'' 
environment. Applications for equipment authorization of devices 
operating under this section must contain a statement confirming 
compliance with these requirements for both fundamental emissions and 
unwanted emissions. Technical information showing the basis for this 
statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (g) Manufacturers of U-NII devices are responsible for ensuring 
frequency stability such that an emission is maintained within the band 
of operation under all conditions of normal operation as specified in 
the users manual.
    (h) Transmit Power Control (TPC) and Dynamic Frequency Selection 
(DFS).
    (1) Transmit power control (TPC). U-NII devices operating in the 
5.25-5.35 GHz band and the 5.47-5.725 GHz band shall employ a TPC 
mechanism. The U-NII device is required to have the capability to 
operate at least 6 dB below the mean EIRP value of 30 dBm. A TPC 
mechanism is not required for systems with an e.i.r.p. of less than 500 
mW.
    (2) Radar Detection Function of Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS). 
U-NII devices operating in the 5.25-5.35 GHz and 5.47-5.725 GHz bands 
shall employ a DFS radar detection mechanism to detect the presence of 
radar systems and to avoid co-channel operation with radar systems. The 
minimum DFS detection threshold for devices with a maximum e.i.r.p. of 
200 mW to 1 W is -64 dBm. For devices that operate

[[Page 846]]

with less than 200 mW e.i.r.p. the minimum detection threshold is -62 
dBm. The detection threshold is the received power averaged over 1 
microsecond referenced to a 0 dBi antenna. The DFS process shall be 
required to provide a uniform spreading of the loading over all the 
available channels.
    (i) Operational Modes. The DFS requirement applies to the following 
operational modes:
    (A) The requirement for channel availability check time applies in 
the master operational mode.
    (B) The requirement for channel move time applies in both the master 
and slave operational modes.
    (ii) Channel Availability Check Time. A U-NII device shall check if 
there is a radar system already operating on the channel before it can 
initiate a transmission on a channel and when it has to move to a new 
channel. The U-NII device may start using the channel if no radar signal 
with a power level greater than the interference threshold values listed 
in paragraph (h)(2) of this part, is detected within 60 seconds.
    (iii) Channel Move Time. After a radar's presence is detected, all 
transmissions shall cease on the operating channel within 10 seconds. 
Transmissions during this period shall consist of normal traffic for a 
maximum of 200 ms after detection of the radar signal. In addition, 
intermittent management and control signals can be sent during the 
remaining time to facilitate vacating the operating channel.
    (iv) Non-occupancy Period. A channel that has been flagged as 
containing a radar system, either by a channel availability check or in-
service monitoring, is subject to a non-occupancy period of at least 30 
minutes. The non-occupancy period starts at the time when the radar 
system is detected.

                   Subpart F_Ultra-Wideband Operation

    Source: 67 FR 34856, May 16, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 15.501  Scope.

    This subpart sets out the regulations for unlicensed ultra-wideband 
transmission systems.


<R05>
Sec. 15.503  Definitions.

    (a) UWB bandwidth. For the purpose of this subpart, the UWB 
bandwidth is the frequency band bounded by the points that are 10 dB 
below the highest radiated emission, as based on the complete 
transmission system including the antenna. The upper boundary is 
designated f<INF>H</INF> and the lower boundary is designated 
f<INF>L</INF>. The frequency at which the highest radiated emission 
occurs is designated f<INF>M</INF>.
    (b) Center frequency. The center frequency, f<INF>C</INF>, equals 
(f<INF>H</INF> + f<INF>L</INF>)/2.
    (c) Fractional bandwidth. The fractional bandwidth equals 
2(f<INF>H</INF>-f<INF>L</INF>)/ (f<INF>H</INF> + f<INF>L</INF>).
    (d) Ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter. An intentional radiator that, 
at any point in time, has a fractional bandwidth equal to or greater 
than 0.20 or has a UWB bandwidth equal to or greater than 500 MHz, 
regardless of the fractional bandwidth.
    (e) Imaging system. A general category consisting of ground 
penetrating radar systems, medical imaging systems, wall imaging systems 
through-wall imaging systems and surveillance systems. As used in this 
subpart, imaging systems do not include systems designed to detect the 
location of tags or systems used to transfer voice or data information.
    (f) Ground penetrating radar (GPR) system. A field disturbance 
sensor that is designed to operate only when in contact with, or within 
one meter of, the ground for the purpose of detecting or obtaining the 
images of buried objects or determining the physical properties within 
the ground. The energy from the GPR is intentionally directed down into 
the ground for this purpose.
    (g) Medical imaging system. A field disturbance sensor that is 
designed to detect the location or movement of objects within the body 
of a person or animal.
    (h) Wall imaging system. A field disturbance sensor that is designed 
to detect the location of objects contained within a ``wall'' or to 
determine the physical properties within the ``wall.''

[[Page 847]]

The ``wall'' is a concrete structure, the side of a bridge, the wall of 
a mine or another physical structure that is dense enough and thick 
enough to absorb the majority of the signal transmitted by the imaging 
system. This category of equipment does not include products such as 
``stud locators'' that are designed to locate objects behind gypsum, 
plaster or similar walls that are not capable of absorbing the 
transmitted signal.
    (i) Through-wall imaging system. A field disturbance sensor that is 
designed to detect the location or movement of persons or objects that 
are located on the other side of an opaque structure such as a wall or a 
ceiling. This category of equipment may include products such as ``stud 
locators'' that are designed to locate objects behind gypsum, plaster or 
similar walls that are not thick enough or dense enough to absorb the 
transmitted signal.
    (j) Surveillance system. A field disturbance sensor used to 
establish a stationary RF perimeter field that is used for security 
purposes to detect the intrusion of persons or objects.
    (k) EIRP. Equivalent isotropically radiated power, i.e., the product 
of the power supplied to the antenna and the antenna gain in a given 
direction relative to an isotropic antenna. The EIRP, in terms of dBm, 
can be converted to a field strength, in dBuV/m at 3 meters, by adding 
95.2. As used in this subpart, EIRP refers to the highest signal 
strength measured in any direction and at any frequency from the UWB 
device, as tested in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 
15.31(a) and 15.523 of this chapter.
    (l) Law enforcement, fire and emergency rescue organizations. As 
used in this subpart, this refers to those parties eligible to obtain a 
license from the FCC under the eligibility requirements specified in 
Sec. 90.20(a)(1) of this chapter.
    (m) Hand held. As used in this subpart, a hand held device is a 
portable device, such as a lap top computer or a PDA, that is primarily 
hand held while being operated and that does not employ a fixed 
infrastructure.


<R05>
Sec. 15.505  Cross reference.

    (a) Except where specifically stated otherwise within this subpart, 
the provisions of subparts A and B and of Sec. Sec. 15.201 through 
15.204 and 15.207 of subpart C of this part apply to unlicensed UWB 
intentional radiators. The provisions of Sec. 15.35(c) and 15.205 do 
not apply to devices operated under this subpart. The provisions of 
Footnote US 246 to the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in Sec. 
2.106 of this chapter does not apply to devices operated under this 
subpart.
    (b) The requirements of this subpart apply only to the radio 
transmitter, i.e., the intentional radiator, contained in the UWB 
device. Other aspects of the operation of a UWB device may be subject to 
requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a UWB 
device that contains digital circuitry not directly associated with the 
operation of the transmitter also is subject to the requirements for 
unintentional radiators in subpart B of this part. Similarly, an 
associated receiver that operates (tunes) within the frequency range 30 
MHz to 960 MHz is subject to the requirements in subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 15.507  Marketing of UWB equipment.

    In some cases, the operation of UWB devices is limited to specific 
parties, e.g., law enforcement, fire and rescue organizations operating 
under the auspices of a state or local government. The marketing of UWB 
devices must be directed solely to parties eligible to operate the 
equipment. The responsible party, as defined in Sec. 2.909 of this 
chapter, is responsible for ensuring that the equipment is marketed only 
to eligible parties. Marketing of the equipment in any other manner may 
be considered grounds for revocation of the grant of certification 
issued for the equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 15.509  Technical requirements for ground penetrating radars and wall imaging systems.

    (a) The UWB bandwidth of an imaging system operating under the 
provisions of this section must be below 10.6 GHz.
    (b) Operation under the provisions of this section is limited to 
GPRs and

commercial mining, or construction.
    (1) Parties operating this equipment must be eligible for licensing 
under the provisions of part 90 of this chapter.
    (2) The operation of imaging systems under this section requires 
coordination, as detailed in Sec. 15.525.
    (c) A GPR that is designed to be operated while being hand held and 
a wall imaging system shall contain a manually operated switch that 
causes the transmitter to cease operation within 10 seconds of being 
released by the operator. In lieu of a switch located on the imaging 
system, it is permissible to operate an imaging system by remote control 
provided the imaging system ceases transmission within 10 seconds of the 
remote switch being released by the operator.
    (d) The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device 
operating under the provisions of this section shall not exceed the 
emission levels in Sec. 15.209. The radiated emissions above 960 MHz 
from a device operating under the provisions of this section shall not 
exceed the following average limits when measured using a resolution 
bandwidth of 1 MHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Frequency in MHz                        EIRP in dBm

1164-1240.................................................         -75.3
1559-1610.................................................         -75.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) For UWB devices where the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>, is above 960 MHz, there is a 
limit on the peak level of the emissions contained within a 50 MHz 
bandwidth centered on f<INF>M</INF>. That limit is 0 dBm EIRP. It is 
acceptable to employ a different resolution bandwidth, and a 
correspondingly different peak emission limit, following the procedures 
described in Sec. 15.521.

Sec. 15.511  Technical requirements for surveillance systems.

    (a) The UWB bandwidth of an imaging system operating under the 
provisions of this section must be contained between 1990 MHz and 10,600 
MHz.
    (b) Operation under the provisions of this section is limited to

any emissions within the 23.6-24.0 GHz band that appear 30 degrees or 
greater above the horizontal plane. This level of attenuation can be 
achieved through the antenna directivity, through a reduction in output 
power or any other means.
    (d) The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device

    (a) Operation under the provisions of this section is limited to UWB 
transmitters employed solely for indoor operation.
    (1) Indoor UWB devices, by the nature of their design, must be 
capable of operation only indoors. The necessity to operate with a fixed 
indoor infrastructure, e.g., a transmitter that must be connected to the 
AC power lines, may be considered sufficient to demonstrate this.
    (2) The emissions from equipment operated under this section shall 
not be intentionally directed outside of the building in which the 
equipment is located, such as through a window or a doorway, to perform 
an outside function, such as the detection of persons about to enter a 
building.
    (3) The use of outdoor mounted antennas, e.g., antennas mounted on 
the outside of a building or on a telephone pole, or any other outdoors 
infrastructure is prohibited.
    (4) Field disturbance sensors installed inside of metal or 
underground storage tanks are considered to operate indoors provided the 
emissions are directed towards the ground.
    (5) A communications system shall transmit only when the intentional 
radiator is sending information to an associated receiver.

    (d) In addition to the radiated emission limits specified in the 
table in paragraph (c) of this section, UWB transmitters operating under 
the provisions of this section shall not exceed the following average 
limits when measured using a resolution bandwidth of no less than 1 kHz:

within a 50 MHz bandwidth centered on the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>. That limit is 0 dBm EIRP. It is 
acceptable to employ a different resolution bandwidth, and a 
correspondingly different peak emission limit, following the procedures 
described in Sec. 15.521.
    (f) UWB systems operating under the provisions of this section shall 
bear the following or similar statement in a conspicuous location on the 
device or in the instruction manual supplied with the device:

    ``This equipment may only be operated indoors. Operation outdoors is 
in violation of 47 U.S.C. 301 and could subject the operator to serious 
legal penalties.''

Sec. 15.519  Technical requirements for hand held UWB systems.

    (a) UWB devices operating under the provisions of this section must 
be hand held, i.e., they are relatively small devices that are primarily 
hand held while being operated and do not employ a fixed infrastructure.
    (1) A UWB device operating under the provisions of this section 
shall transmit only when it is sending information to an associated 
receiver. The UWB intentional radiator shall cease transmission within 
10 seconds unless it receives an acknowledgement from the associated 
receiver that its transmission is being received. An acknowledgment of 
reception must continue to be received by the UWB intentional radiator 
at least every 10 seconds or the UWB device must cease transmitting.
    (2) The use of antennas mounted on outdoor structures, e.g., 
antennas mounted on the outside of a building or on a telephone pole, or 
any fixed outdoors infrastructure is prohibited. Antennas may be mounted 
only on the hand held UWB device.
    (3) UWB devices operating under the provisions of this section may 
operate indoors or outdoors.
    (b) The UWB bandwidth of a device operating under the provisions of 
this section must be contained between 3100 MHz and 10,600 MHz.
    (c) The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device 
operating under the provisions of this section shall not exceed the 
emission levels in Sec. 15.209. The radiated emissions above 960 MHz 
from a device operating under the provisions of this section shall not 
exceed the following average limits when measured using a resolution 
bandwidth of 1 MHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm

3100-10600...........................................              -41.3
Above 10600..........................................              -61.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) In addition to the radiated emission limits specified in the 
table in paragraph (c) of this section, UWB transmitters operating under 
the provisions of this section shall not exceed the following average 
limits when

[[Page 853]]

measured using a resolution bandwidth of no less than 1 kHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm

1559-1610............................................              -85.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) There is a limit on the peak level of the emissions contained 
within a 50 MHz bandwidth centered on the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>. That limit is 0 dBm EIRP. It is 
acceptable to employ a different resolution bandwidth, and a 
correspondingly different peak emission limit, following the procedures 
described in Sec. 15.521.

<R05>
Sec. 15.521  Technical requirements applicable to all UWB devices.

    (a) UWB devices may not be employed for the operation of toys. 
Operation onboard an aircraft, a ship or a satellite is prohibited.
    (b) Manufacturers and users are reminded of the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 15.203 and 15.204.
    (c) Emissions from digital circuitry used to enable the operation of 
the UWB transmitter shall comply with the limits in Sec. 15.209, rather 
than the limits specified in this subpart, provided it can be clearly 
demonstrated that those emissions from the UWB device are due solely to 
emissions from digital circuitry contained within the transmitter and 
that the emissions are not intended to be radiated from the 
transmitter's antenna. Emissions from associated digital devices, as 
defined in Sec. 15.3(k), e.g., emissions from digital circuitry used to 
control additional functions or capabilities other than the UWB 
transmission, are subject to the limits contained in Subpart B of this 
part.
    (d) Within the tables in Sec. Sec. 15.509, 15.511, 15.513, 15.515, 
15.517, and 15.519, the tighter emission limit applies at the band 
edges. Radiated emission levels at and below 960 MHz are based on 
measurements employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector. Radiated emission 
levels above 960 MHz are based on RMS average measurements over a 1 MHz 
resolution bandwidth. The RMS average measurement is based on the use of 
a spectrum analyzer with a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz, an RMS 
detector, and a 1 millisecond or less averaging time. Unless otherwise 
stated, if pulse gating is employed where the transmitter is quiescent 
for intervals that are long compared to the nominal pulse repetition 
interval, measurements shall be made with the pulse train gated on. 
Alternative measurement procedures may be considered by the Commission.
    (e) The frequency at which the highest radiated emission occurs, 
f<INF>M</INF>, must be contained within the UWB bandwidth.
    (f) Imaging systems may be employed only for the type of information 
exchange described in their specific definitions contained in Sec. 
15.503. The detection of tags or the transfer or data or voice 
information is not permitted under the standards for imaging systems.
    (g) When a peak measurement is required, it is acceptable to use a 
resolution bandwidth other than the 50 MHz specified in this subpart. 
This resolution bandwidth shall not be lower than 1 MHz or greater than 
50 MHz, and the measurement shall be centered on the frequency at which 
the highest radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>. If a resolution 
bandwidth other than 50 MHz is employed, the peak EIRP limit shall be 20 
log (RBW/50) dBm where RBW is the resolution bandwidth in megahertz that 
is employed. This may be converted to a peak field strength level at 3 
meters using E(dBuV/m) = P(dBm EIRP) + 95.2. If RBW is greater than 3 
MHz, the application for certification filed with the Commission must 
contain a detailed description of the test procedure, calibration of the 
test setup, and the instrumentation employed in the testing.
    (h) The highest frequency employed in Sec. 15.33 to determine the 
frequency range over which radiated measurements are made shall be based 
on the center frequency, f<INF>C</INF>, unless a higher frequency is 
generated within the UWB device. For measuring emission levels, the 
spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest frequency generated in 
the UWB transmitter, without going below 9 kHz, up to the frequency 
range shown in Sec. 15.33(a) or up to f<INF>C</INF> + 3/(pulse

[[Page 854]]

width in seconds), whichever is higher. There is no requirement to 
measure emissions beyond 40 GHz provided f<INF>C</INF> is less than 10 
GHz; beyond 100 GHz if f<INF>C</INF> is at or above 10 GHz and below 30 
GHz; or beyond 200 GHz if f<INF>C</INF> is at or above 30 GHz.
    (i) The prohibition in Sec. 2.201(f) and 15.5(d) of this chapter 
against Class B (damped wave) emissions does not apply to UWB devices 
operating under this subpart.
    (j) Responsible parties are reminded of the other standards and 
requirements cross referenced in Sec. 15.505, such as a limit on 
emissions conducted onto the AC power lines.

Sec. 15.525  Coordination requirements.

    (a) UWB imaging systems require coordination through the FCC before 
the equipment may be used. The operator shall comply with any 
constraints on equipment usage resulting from this coordination.
    (b) The users of UWB imaging devices shall supply operational areas 
to the FCC Office of Engineering and Technology, which shall coordinate 
this information with the Federal Government through the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration. The information 
provided by the UWB operator shall include the name, address and other 
pertinent contact information of the user, the desired geographical 
area(s) of operation, and the FCC ID number and other nomenclature of 
the UWB device. If the imaging device is intended to be used for mobile 
applications, the geographical area(s) of operation may be the state(s) 
or county(ies) in which the equipment will be operated. The operator of 
an imaging system used for fixed operation shall supply a specific 
geographical location or the address at which the equipment will be 
operated. This material shall be submitted to Frequency Coordination 
Branch, OET, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW, 
Washington, D.C. 20554, Attn: UWB Coordination.
    (c) The manufacturers, or their authorized sales agents, must inform 
purchasers and users of their systems of the requirement to undertake 
detailed coordination of operational areas with the FCC prior to the 
equipment being operated.
    (d) Users of authorized, coordinated UWB systems may transfer them 
to other qualified users and to different locations upon coordination of 
change of ownership or location to the FCC and coordination with 
existing authorized operations.
    (e) The FCC/NTIA coordination report shall identify those 
geographical areas within which the operation of an imaging system 
requires additional coordination or within which the operation of an 
imaging system is prohibited. If additional coordination is required for 
operation within specific geographical areas, a local coordination 
contact will be provided. Except for operation within these designated 
areas, once the information requested on the UWB imaging system is 
submitted to the FCC no additional coordination with the FCC is required 
provided the reported areas of operation do not change. If the area of 
operation changes, updated information shall be submitted to the FCC 
following the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) The coordination of routine UWB operations shall not take longer 
than 15 business days from the receipt of the coordination request by 
NTIA. Special temporary operations may be handled with an expedited 
turn-around time when circumstances warrant. The operation of UWB 
systems in emergency situations involving the safety of life or property 
may occur without coordination provided a notification procedure, 
similar to that contained in Sec. 2.405(a) through (e) of this chapter, 
is followed by the UWB equipment user.

Sec. 15.609  Marketing of Access BPL equipment.

    The marketing of Access BPL equipment must be directed solely to 
parties eligible to operate the equipment. Eligible parties consist of 
AC power line public utilities, Access BPL service providers and 
associates of Access BPL service providers. The responsible party, as 
defined in Sec. 2.909 of this chapter, is responsible for ensuring that 
the equipment is marketed only to eligible parties. Marketing of the 
equipment in any other manner may be considered grounds for revocation 
of the grant of certification issued for the equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 15.611  General technical requirements.

    (a) Conducted emission limits. Access BPL is not subject to the 
conducted emission limits of Sec. 15.107.
    (b) Radiated emission limits--(1) Medium voltage power lines. (i) 
Access BPL systems that operate in the frequency range of 1.705 kHz to 
30 MHz over medium voltage power lines shall comply with the radiated 
emission limits for intentional radiators provided in Sec. 15.209.
    (ii) Access BPL systems that operate in the frequency range above 30 
MHz over medium voltage power lines shall

[[Page 856]]

comply with the radiated emission limits provided in Sec. 15.109(b).
    (2) Low voltage power lines. Access BPL systems that operate over 
low-voltage power lines, including those that operate over low-voltage 
lines that are connected to the in-building wiring, shall comply with 
the radiated emission limits provided in Sec. 15.109(a) and (e).
    (c) Interference Mitigation and Avoidance. (1) Access BPL systems 
shall incorporate adaptive interference mitigation techniques to 
remotely reduce power and adjust operating frequencies, in order to 
avoid site-specific, local use of the same spectrum by licensed 
services. These techniques may include adaptive or ``notch'' filtering, 
or complete avoidance of frequencies, or bands of frequencies, locally 
used by licensed radio operations.
    (i) For frequencies below 30 MHz, when a notch filter is used to 
avoid interference to a specific frequency band, the Access BPL system 
shall be capable of attenuating emissions within that band to a level at 
least 20 dB below the applicable part 15 limits.
    (ii) For frequencies above 30 MHz, when a notch filter is used to 
avoid interference to a specific frequency band, the Access BPL system 
shall be capable of attenuating emissions within that band to a level at 
least 10 dB below the applicable part 15 limits.
    (iii) At locations where an Access BPL operator attenuates radiated 
emissions from its operations in accordance with the above required 
capabilities, we will not require that operator to take further actions 
to resolve complaints of harmful interference to mobile operations.
    (2) Access BPL systems shall comply with applicable radiated 
emission limits upon power-up following a fault condition, or during a 
start-up operation after a shut-off procedure, by the use of a non-
volatile memory, or some other method, to immediately restore previous 
settings with programmed notches and excluded bands, to avoid time delay 
caused by the need for manual re-programming during which protected 
services may be vulnerable.
    (3) Access BPL systems shall incorporate a remote-controllable shut-
down feature to deactivate, from a central location, any unit found to 
cause harmful interference, if other interference mitigation techniques 
do not resolve the interference problem.

<R05>
Sec. 15.613  Measurement procedures.

    Compliance measurements for Access BPL shall be made in accordance 
with the Guidelines for Access BPL systems specified by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 15.615  General administrative requirements.

    (a) Access BPL Database. Entities operating Access BPL systems shall 
supply to an industry-recognized entity, information on all existing 
Access BPL systems and all proposed Access BPL systems for inclusion 
into a publicly available data base, within 30 days prior to initiation 
of service. Such information shall include the following:
    (1) The name of the Access BPL provider.
    (2) The frequencies of the Access BPL operation.
    (3) The postal zip codes served by the specific Access BPL 
operation.
    (4) The manufacturer and type of Access BPL equipment and its 
associated FCC ID number, or, in the case of Access BPL equipment that 
has been subject to verification, the Trade Name and Model Number, as 
specified on the equipment label.
    (5) The contact information, including both phone number and e-mail 
address of a person at, or associated with, the BPL operator's company, 
to facilitate the resolution of any interference complaint.
    (6) The proposed/or actual date of Access BPL operation.
    (b) The Access BPL database manager shall enter this information 
into the publicly accessible database within three (3) business days of 
receipt.
    (c) No notification to the Commission is required.
    (d) A licensed spectrum user experiencing harmful interference that 
is suspected to be caused by an Access BPL system shall inform the local 
BPL operator's contact person designated in the Access BPL database. The 
investigation of the reported interference

[[Page 857]]

and the resolution of confirmed harmful interference from the Access BPL 
system shall be successfully completed by the BPL operator within a 
reasonable time period according to a mutually acceptable schedule, 
after the receipt of an interference complaint, in order to avoid 
protracted disruptions to licensed services. The Access BPL operator 
shall respond to complaints of harmful interference from public safety 
users within 24 hours. With regard to public safety complaints, the BPL 
provider shall be required to immediately cease the operations causing 
such complaint if it fails to respond within 24 hours.
    (e) Consultation with public safety users. An entity operating an 
Access BPL system shall notify and consult with the public safety users 
in the area where it plans to deploy Access BPL, at least 30 days prior 
to initiation of any operation or service. This entity shall design or 
implement the Access BPL system such that it does not cause harmful 
interference in those frequencies or bands used by the public safety 
agencies in the area served by the Access BPL system. The notification 
shall include, at a minimum, the information in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (f) Federal government spectrum users and other radio service users. 
An entity operating an Access BPL system shall ensure that, within its 
Access BPL deployment area, its system does not operate on any 
frequencies designated as excluded bands or on identified frequencies 
within any designated exclusion zones.
    (1) Excluded Bands. To protect Aeronautical (land) stations and 
aircraft receivers, Access BPL operations using overhead medium voltage 
power lines are prohibited in the frequency bands listed in Table 1. 
Specifically, such BPL systems shall not place carrier frequencies in 
these bands.

    (ii) New or relocated Coast stations. In the unlikely event that a 
new or relocated coast station is established for the 2.173.5-2.190.5 
kHz band at a coordinate not specified in Table 2 or 2.1, Access BPL 
operations in that frequency band shall also be excluded within 1 km of 
the new coast station facility;
    (3) Consultation areas. Access BPL operators shall provide 
notification to the appropriate point of contact specified regarding 
Access BPL operations at any frequencies of potential concern in the 
following consultation areas, at least 30 days prior to initiation of 
any operation or service. The notification shall include, at a minimum, 
the information in paragraph (a) of this section. We expect parties to 
consult in good faith to ensure that no harmful interference is caused 
to licensed operations and that any constraints on BPL deployments are 
minimized to those necessary to avoid harmful interference. In the 
unlikely event that a new or relocated aeronautical receive station is 
established for the 1.7-30 MHz band at a coordinate not specified in 
Table 3b, Access BPL operators are also required to coordinate with the 
appropriate point of contact regarding Access BPL operations at any 
frequencies of potential concern in the new or relocated consultation 
areas, and to adjust their system operating parameters to protect the 
new or relocated aeronautical receive station.
    (i) For frequencies in the 1.7-30 MHz frequency range, the areas 
within 4 km of facilities located at the following coordinates:
    (A) The Commission's protected field offices listed in 47 CFR 0.121, 
the point-of-contact for which is specified in that section;
    (B) The aeronautical stations listed in Tables 3a and 3b;
    (C) The land stations listed in Tables 4 and 5;
    (ii) For frequencies in the 1.7-80.0 MHz frequency range, the areas 
within 4 km of facilities located at the coordinates specified for radio 
astronomy facilities in 47 CFR 2.106, Note U.S. 311.

    (iii) For frequencies in the 1.7-80 MHz frequency range, the area 
within 1 km of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, the coordinates 
and point of contact for which are specified in 47 CFR 21.113(b).
    (iv) For frequencies in the 1.7-30 MHz frequency range, the areas

<R04>
                    Subpart H_Television Band Devices

    Source: 74 FR 7326, Feb. 17, 2009, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 15.701  Scope.

    This subpart sets out the regulations for Television Band Devices 
(TVBDs) which are unlicensed intentional radiators operating on 
available channels in the broadcast television frequency bands at 54-60 
MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz, 470-608 MHz and 614-698 MHz bands.


<R05>
Sec. 15.703  Definitions.

    (a) Available channel. A television channel which is not being used 
by an authorized user at or near the same geographic location as the 
TVBD and is acceptable for use by an unlicensed device under the 
provisions of Sec. 15.709. A TVBD determines television channel 
availability either from the TV bands database or spectrum sensing.
    (b) Client device. A TVBD operating in client mode.
    (c) Client mode. An operating mode in which the transmissions of the 
TVBD, including frequencies of operation, are under control of the 
master device. A device in client mode is not able to initiate a 
network.
    (d) Fixed device. A TVBD that transmits and/or receives 
radiocommunication signals at a specified fixed location. Fixed TVBDs 
may operate as part of a system, transmitting to one or more fixed TVBDs 
or to personal/portable TVBDs.
    (e) Geo-location. The capability of a TVBD to determine its 
geographic coordinates within a specified level of accuracy.
    (f) Master device. A TVBD operating in master mode.
    (g) Master mode. An operating mode in which the TVBD has the 
capability to transmit without receiving an enabling signal. The TVBD is 
able to select a channel itself based on a list provided by the database 
and initiate a network by sending enabling signals to other devices. A 
network always has at least one device operating in master mode.
    (h) Mode I operation. Operation of a personal/portable TVBD 
operating only on the available channel identified by either the fixed 
TVBD or Mode II TVBD that enables its operation. Mode I operation does 
not require use of a geo-location capability or access to the TV bands 
database and requires operation in client mode.
    (i) Mode II operation. Operation of a personal/portable TVBD whereby 
the device determines the available channels at its location using its 
own geo-location and TV bands database access capabilities. Devices 
operating in Mode II may function as master devices.
    (j) Network initiation. The process by which a fixed or Mode II TVBD 
sends control signals to another similar device or to a client device(s) 
and allows them to begin transmissions.

[[Page 862]]

    (k) Operating channel. An available channel used by a TVBD for 
transmission and/or reception.
    (l) Personal/portable device. A TVBD that transmits and/or receives 
radiocommunication signals while in motion or at unspecified locations 
that may change.
    (m) Receive site. The location where the signal of a full service 
station is received for rebroadcast by a television translator or low 
power TV, including Class A TV, station.
    (n) Spectrum sensing. A process whereby a TVBD monitors a television 
channel to detect whether the channel is occupied by a radio signal.
    (o) Television band device (TVBD). Intentional radiators operating 
on available channels in the broadcast television frequency bands at 54-
60 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz, 470-608 MHz and 614-698 MHz.
    (p) TV bands database. A database of authorized services in the TV 
frequency bands that is used to determine the available channels at a 
given location for use by TVBDs.


<R05>
Sec. 15.705  Cross reference.

    (a) The provisions of subparts A, B, and C of this part apply to 
TVBDs, except where specific provisions are contained in subpart H.
    (b) The requirements of subpart H apply only to the radio 
transmitter contained in the TVBD. Other aspects of the operation of a 
TVBD may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. 
In particular, a TVBD that includes a receiver that tunes within the 
frequency range specified in Sec. 15.101(b) contains digital circuitry 
not directly associated with the radio transmitter is also subject to 
the requirements for unintentional radiators in subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 15.706  Information to the user.

    (a) For TV band device, the instructions furnished the user shall 
include the following or similar statement, placed in a prominent 
location in the text of the manual:

    This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the rules 
for TV band devices, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC rules. These rules 
are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful 
interference. This equipment generates uses and can radiate radio 
frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the 
instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. 
However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a 
particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful 
interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined 
by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to 
correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:
    1. Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
    2. Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
    3. Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from 
that to which the receiver is connected.
    4. Consult the manufacturer, dealer or an experienced radio/TV 
technician for help.

    (b) In cases where the manual is provided only in a form other than 
paper, such as on a computer disk or over the Internet, the information 
required by this section may be included in the manual in that 
alternative form, provided the user can reasonably be expected to have 
the capability to access information in that form.


<R05>
Sec. 15.707  Permissible channels of operation.

    (a) All TVBDs are permitted to operate in the frequency bands 512-
608 MHz and 614-698 MHz, except that in the 13 metropolitan areas listed 
Sec. 90.303(a) of this chapter and nearby areas where private land 
mobile services and commercial land mobile services are authorized by 
waiver, operation of TVBDs is prohibited on the first channel on each 
side of TV channel 37 (608-614 MHz) that is available at all locations 
within the protection range of the coordinates of each such area as set 
forth in Sec. 15.712(d). These channels will be listed in the TV bands 
database.
    (b) Operation in the bands 54-60 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz, and 
470-512 MHz is permitted only for fixed TVBDs that communicate only with 
other fixed TVBDs.
    (c) Fixed and Mode II TVBDs shall only operate on available channels 
as determined by the TV bands database and in accordance with the 
interference avoidance mechanisms of Sec. 15.711.

[[Page 863]]

    (d) Mode I TVBDs shall only operate on available channels provided 
to it from a Fixed or Mode II TVBD.


<R05>
Sec. 15.709  General technical requirements.

    (a) Power limits for TVBDs are as follows: (1) For fixed TVBDs, the 
maximum conducted output power over the TV channel of operation shall 
not exceed one watt. Transmitter power will be measured at the antenna 
input to account for any cable losses between the transmitter and the 
antenna. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi 
are used, the maximum conducted output power shall be reduced by the 
amount in dB that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (2) For personal/portable TVBDs, the maximum conducted output power 
over the TV channel of operation shall not exceed 100 milliwatts; except 
that for personal/portable TVBDs that do not meet the adjacent channel 
separation requirements in Sec. 15.712(a), the maximum conducted output 
power shall not exceed 40 milliwatts. If transmitting antennas of 
directional gain greater than 0 dBi are used, the maximum conducted 
output power shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional 
gain of the antenna exceeds 0 dBi.
    (3) TVBDs shall incorporate transmit power control to limit their 
operating power to the minimum necessary for successful communication. 
Applicants for certification shall include a description of a device's 
transmit power control feature mechanism.
    (4) Maximum conducted output power is the total transmit power in 
the entire emission bandwidth delivered to all antennas and antenna 
elements averaged across all symbols in the signaling alphabet when the 
transmitter is operating at its maximum power control level. Power must 
be summed across all antennas and antenna elements. The average must not 
include any time intervals during which the transmitter is off or is 
transmitting at a reduced power level. If multiple modes of operation 
are possible (e.g., alternative modulation methods), the maximum 
conducted output power is the highest total transmit power occurring in 
any mode.
    (b) Antenna requirements. (1) For personal/portable TVBDs, the 
antenna shall be permanently attached.
    (2) The receive antenna used with fixed devices shall be located 
outdoors at least 10 meters above the ground. The antenna system shall 
be capable of receiving signals of protected services equally in all 
directions. The transmit antenna used with fixed devices may not be more 
than 30 meters above the ground.
    (3) For both fixed and personal/portable TVBDs, the provisions of 
Sec. 15.204(c)(4) do not apply to an antenna used for transmission and 
reception/spectrum sensing.
    (4) For both fixed and personal/portable TVBDs with a separate 
sensing antenna, compliance testing shall be performed using the lowest 
gain antenna for each type of antenna to be certified.
    (c) Undesirable emission limits for TVBDs are as follows:
    (1) In the 6 MHz channels adjacent to the operating channel, 
emissions from TVBD devices shall be at least 55 dB below the highest 
average power in the band in which the device is operating.
    (2) The above emission measurements shall be performed using a 
minimum resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz with an average detector. A 
narrower resolution bandwidth may be employed near the band edge, when 
necessary, provided the measured energy is integrated to show the total 
power over 100 kHz.
    (3) At frequencies beyond 6 MHz from the edge of the operating 
channel, radiated emissions from TVBD devices shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 15.209.
    (4) Emissions in the band 602-620 MHz must also comply with the 
following field strength limits at a distance of one meter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       Field strength  dB[micro]V/meter/
          Frequency  (MHz)                          120 kHz
------------------------------------------------------------------------
602-607.............................  120-5[F(MHz)-602]
607-608.............................  95
608-614.............................  30
614-615.............................  95
615-620.............................  120-5[620-F(MHz)]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) TVBDs connected to the AC power line are required to comply with 
the conducted limits set forth in Sec. 15.207.

[[Page 864]]

    (d) Compliance with radio frequency exposure requirements. To ensure 
compliance with the Commission's radio frequency exposure requirements 
in Sec. Sec. 1.1307(b), 2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter, fixed TVBDs 
shall be accompanied by instructions on measures to take to ensure that 
persons maintain a distance of at least 40 cm from the device, as well 
as any necessary hardware that may be needed to implement that 
protection. These instructions shall be submitted with the application 
for certification. Personal/portable TVBDs that meet the definition of 
portable devices under Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter and that operate 
with a source-based time-averaged output of less than 20 mW will not be 
subject to routine evaluation for compliance with the radio frequency 
exposure guidelines, while devices that operate with a source-based 
time-average output power greater than 20 mW will be subject to the 
routine evaluation requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 15.711  Interference avoidance mechanisms.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 15.717, television channel 
availability for a TVBD is determined based on either the geo-location 
and database access mechanism described in paragraph (b) of this section 
or spectrum sensing described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) A TVBD shall rely on the geo-location and database access 
mechanism to identify available television channels consistent with the 
interference protection requirements of Sec. 15.712. Such protection 
will be provided for the following authorized services: digital 
television stations, digital and analog Class A, low power, translator 
and booster stations; translator receive operations; fixed broadcast 
auxiliary service links; private land mobile service/commercial radio 
service (PLMRS/CMRS) operations; offshore radiotelephone service; and 
cable system head-ends. In addition, protection shall be provided in 
border areas near Canada and Mexico in accordance with Sec. 15.712(g).
    (2) For low power auxiliary services authorized pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 74.801 through 74.882 of this chapter, including wireless 
microphones, a TVBD shall rely on the geo-location and database access 
mechanism to identify available television channels to provide 
interference protection to registered locations of such operations, 
consistent with the requirements of Sec. 15.712, and shall rely on 
spectrum sensing to identify available television channels to provide 
interference protection to all other operations.
    (b) Geo-location and database access. (1) The geographic coordinates 
of a fixed TVBD shall be determined to an accuracy of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>50 meters by either an incorporated geo-location 
capability or a professional installer. In the case of professional 
installation, the party who registers the fixed TVBD in the database 
will be responsible for assuring the accuracy of the entered 
coordinates. The geographic coordinates of a fixed TVBD shall be 
determined at the time of installation and first activation from a 
power-off condition, and this information may be stored internally in 
the TVBD. If the fixed TVBD is moved to another location or if the 
stored coordinates become altered, the operator shall re-establish the 
device's:
    (i) Geographic location and store this information in the TVBD 
either by means of the device's incorporated geo-location capability or 
through the services of a professional installer; and
    (ii) Registration with the database based on the device's new 
coordinates.
    (2) A Mode II personal/portable device shall incorporate a geo-
location capability to determine its geographic coordinates to an 
accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>50 meters. The device must re-
establish its position each time it is activated from a power-off 
condition.
    (3)(i) Fixed devices must access a TV bands database over the 
Internet to determine the TV channels that are available at their 
geographic coordinates prior to their initial service transmission at a 
given location. Operation is permitted only on channels that are 
indicated in the database as being available for TVBDs. Fixed TVBDS 
shall access the database at least once a day to verify that the 
operating channels continue to remain available. Operation must cease 
immediately if the channel is no longer available.
    (ii) Mode II personal/portable devices must access a TV bands 
database over

[[Page 865]]

the Internet to determine the TV channels that are available at their 
geographic coordinates prior to their initial service transmission at a 
given location. Operation is permitted only on channels that are 
indicated in the database as being available for TVBDs. A Mode II 
personal/portable device must access the database for a list of 
available channels each time it is activated from a power-off condition 
and re-check its location and the database for available channels if it 
changes location during operation. A Mode II personal/portable device 
that has been in a powered state shall re-check its location and access 
the database daily to verify that the operating channel(s) continue to 
be available.
    (iii) If a fixed or mode II TVBD fails to contact the TV bands 
database during any given day, it may continue to operate until 11:59 PM 
of the following day at which time it must cease operations unless it 
has contacted the TV bands database during the intervening period.
    (iv) Personal/portable devices operating in Mode I shall obtain a 
list of channels on which they may operate from a master device.
    (4) All geographic coordinates shall be referenced to the North 
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
    (c) Spectrum sensing--(1) Detection threshold. (i) All fixed and 
personal/portable TVBDs must be capable of detecting ATSC digital TV, 
NTSC analog TV and wireless microphone signals using analog or digital 
modulation methods. The required detection thresholds are.
    (A) ATSC signals: -114 dBm, averaged over a 6 MHz bandwidth;
    (B) NTSC signals: -114 dBm, averaged over a 100 kHz bandwidth;
    (C) Wireless microphone signals: -114 dBm, averaged over a 200 kHz 
bandwidth.
    (ii) The detection thresholds are referenced to an omnidirectional 
receive antenna with a gain of 0 dBi. If a receive antenna with a 
minimum directional gain of less than 0 dBi is used, the detection 
threshold shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the minimum 
directional gain of the antenna is less than 0 dBi. Minimum directional 
gain shall be defined as the antenna gain in the direction and at the 
frequency that exhibits the least gain. Alternative approaches for the 
sensing antenna are permitted, e.g., electronically rotateable antennas, 
provided the applicant for equipment authorization can demonstrate that 
its sensing antenna provides at least the same performance as an 
omnidirectional antenna with 0 dBi gain.
    (2) Low power auxiliary device channel availability check time. A 
TVBD may start operating on a TV channel if no wireless microphone or 
other low power auxiliary device signals above the detection threshold 
are detected within a minimum time interval of 30 seconds.
    (3) TV channel availability check time. A TVBD is required to check 
for TV signals for a minimum time interval of 30 seconds. If a TV signal 
is detected on a channel indicated as available for use by the database 
system, the device will provide a notice of that detection to the 
operator of the device and a means for the operator to optionally remove 
the channel from the device's list of available channels.
    (4) In-service monitoring. A TVBD must perform in-service monitoring 
of an operating channel a minimum of once every 60 seconds. There is no 
minimum channel availability check time for in-service monitoring.
    (5) Channel move time. After a wireless microphone or other low 
power auxiliary device signal is detected on a TVBD operating channel, 
all transmissions by the TVBD must cease within two seconds.
    (6) Personal/portable devices operating in the client mode shall 
identify to the fixed or Mode II personal/portable device those 
television channels on which it senses any signals above the detection 
threshold. The fixed or Mode II device shall respond in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph as if it had detected the signal 
itself.
    (7) TVBDs communicating either directly with one another or linked 
through a base station must share information on channel occupancy 
determined by sensing. If any device in a local area group or network 
determines that a channel is occupied, all other

[[Page 866]]

linked devices will also be required to respond in accordance with the 
provisions of this paragraph as if it had detected the signal itself.
    (d) A TVBD must incorporate the capability to display a list of 
identified available channels and its operating channels.
    (e) Fixed TVBDs shall transmit identifying information. The 
identification signal must conform to a standard established by a 
recognized industry standards setting organization. The identification 
signal shall carry sufficient information to identify the device and its 
geographic coordinates.
    (f) If a fixed TVBD device does not have a direct connection to the 
Internet and has not yet been initialized and registered with the TV 
bands database, consistent with Sec. 15.713, but can receive the 
transmissions of another fixed TVBD, the device needing initialization 
may transmit to that other device on either a channel that the other 
TVBD has transmitted on or on a channel which the other TVBD indicates 
is available for use to access the database to register its location and 
receive a list of channels that are available for it to use. 
Subsequently, the newly registered TVBD must only use the television 
channels that the database indicates are available for it to use. Such 
fixed devices must re-contact the database through another fixed device 
to review their list of available channels at least once every 60 
seconds. A fixed device may not operate as a client to another fixed 
device.
    (g) A personal/portable TVBD operating in Mode I may only transmit 
upon receiving the transmissions of fixed or Mode II TVBD. A personal/
portable device operating in Mode I may transmit on either an operating 
channel of the fixed or Mode II TVBD or on a channel the fixed or Mode 
II TVBD indicates is available for use.

queried by a specific TVBD or model of TVBDs.
    (k) If more than one database is developed, the database 
administrators shall cooperate to develop a standardized process for 
providing on a daily basis or more often, as appropriate, the data 
collected for the facilities listed in Sec. 15.713(b)(2) to all other 
TV bands databases to ensure consistency in the records of protected 
facilities.

    Effective Date Note: At 74 FR 7326, Feb. 17, 2009, Sec. 15.715 was

<R05>
Sec. 15.717  TVBDs that rely on spectrum sensing.

    (a) Parties may submit applications for certification of TVBDs that 
rely solely on spectrum sensing to identify available channels. Devices 
authorized under this section must demonstrate with an extremely high 
degree of confidence that they will not cause harmful interference to 
incumbent radio services.
    (1) In addition to the procedures in subpart J of part 2 of this 
chapter, applicants shall comply with the following.
    (i) The application must include a full explanation of how the 
device will protect incumbent authorized services against interference.
    (ii) Applicants must submit a pre-production device, identical to 
the device expected to be marketed.
    (2) The Commission will follow the procedures below for processing 
applications pursuant to this section.
    (i) Applications will be placed on public notice for a minimum of 30 
days for comments and 15 days for reply comments. Applicants may request 
that portions of their application remain confidential in accordance 
with Sec. 0.459 of this chapter. This public notice will include 
proposed test procedures and methodologies.
    (ii) The Commission will conduct laboratory and field tests of the 
pre-production device. This testing will be conducted to evaluate proof 
of performance of the device, including characterization of its sensing 
capability and its interference potential. The testing will be open to 
the public.
    (iii) Subsequent to the completion of testing, the Commission will 
issue by public notice, a test report including recommendations. The 
public notice will specify a minimum of 30 days for comments and, if any 
objections are received, an additional 15 days for reply comments.
    (b) The device shall meet the requirements for personal/portable 
devices in this subpart except that it will be limited to a maximum EIRP 
of 50 mw and it does not have to comply with the requirements for geo-
location and database access in Sec. 15.711(b). Compliance with the 
detection threshold for spectrum sensing in Sec. 15.711(c), although 
required, is not necessarily sufficient for demonstrating reliable 
interference avoidance. Once a device is certified, additional devices 
that are identical in electrical characteristics and antenna systems may 
be certified under the procedures of part 2, subpart J of this chapter.

    Effective Date Note: At 74 FR 7326, Feb. 17, 2009, Sec. 15.717 was 
added. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.

                      Subpart A_General Information


<R05>
Sec. 17.1  Basis and purpose.

    (a) The rules in this part are issued pursuant to the authority 
contained in Title III of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
which vest authority in the Federal Communications Commission to issue 
licenses to radio stations when it is found that the public interest, 
convenience, and necessity would be served thereby, and to require the 
painting, and/or illumination of antenna structures if and when in its 
judgment such structures constitute, or there is reasonable possibility 
that they may constitute, a menace to air navigation.
    (b) The purpose of this part is to prescribe certain procedures for 
antenna structure registration and standards with respect to the 
Commission's consideration of proposed antenna structures which will 
serve as a guide to antenna structure owners. The standards are 
referenced from two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory 
Circulars.

[61 FR 4362, Feb. 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 17.2  Definitions.

    (a) Antenna structure. The term antenna structure includes the 
radiating and/or receive system, its supporting structures and any 
appurtenances mounted thereon.
    (b) An antenna farm area is defined as a geographical location, with 
established boundaries, designated by the Federal Communications 
Commission, in which antenna towers with a common impact on aviation may 
be grouped.
    (c) Antenna structure owner. For the purposes of this part, an 
antenna structure owner is the individual or entity vested with 
ownership, equitable ownership, dominion, or title to the antenna 
structure. Notwithstanding any agreements made between the owner and any 
entity designated by the owner to maintain the antenna structure, the 
owner is ultimately responsible for compliance with the requirements of 
this part.
    (d) Antenna structure registration number. A unique number, issued 
by the Commission during the registration process, which identifies an 
antenna structure. Once obtained, this number must be used in all 
filings related to this structure.

39 FR 26157, July 17, 1974; 61 FR 4362, Feb. 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 17.4  Antenna structure registration.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1996, the owner of any proposed or existing 
antenna structure that requires notice of proposed construction to the 
Federal Aviation Administration must register the structure with the 
Commission. This includes those structures used as

[[Page 873]]

part of stations licensed by the Commission for the transmission of 
radio energy, or to be used as part of a cable television head end 
system. If a Federal Government antenna structure is to be used by a 
Commission licensee, the structure must be registered with the 
Commission.
    (1) For a proposed antenna structure or alteration of an existing 
antenna structure, the owner must register the structure prior to 
construction or alteration.
    (2) For an existing antenna structure that had been assigned 
painting or lighting requirements prior to July 1, 1996, the owner must 
register the structure prior to July 1, 1998.
    (3) For a structure that did not originally fall under the 
definition of ``antenna structure,'' the owner must register the 
structure prior to hosting a Commission licensee.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each owner 
must file FCC Form 854 with the Commission. Additionally, each owner of 
a proposed structure referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this 
section must submit a valid FAA determination of ``no hazard.'' In order 
to be considered valid by the Commission, the FAA determination of ``no 
hazard'' must not have expired prior to the date on which FCC Form 854 
is received by the Commission. The height of the structure will include 
the highest point of the structure including any obstruction lighting or 
lighting arrester.
    (c) If an Environmental Assessment is required under Sec. 1.1307 of 
this chapter, the Bureau will address the environmental concerns prior 
to processing the registration.
    (d) If a final FAA determination of ``no hazard'' is not submitted 
along with FCC Form 854, processing of the registration may be delayed 
or disapproved.
    (e) If the owner of the antenna structure cannot file FCC Form 854 
because it is subject to a denial of Federal benefits under the Anti-
Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. 862, the first tenant licensee 
authorized to locate on the structure (excluding tenants that no longer 
occupy the structure) must register the structure using FCC Form 854, 
and provide a copy of the Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 854R) 
to the owner. The owner remains responsible for providing a copy of FCC 
Form 854R to all tenant licensees on the structure and for posting the 
registration number as required by paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) The Commission shall issue, to the registrant, FCC Form 854R, 
Antenna Structure Registration, which assigns a unique Antenna Structure 
Registration Number. The structure owner shall immediately provide a 
copy of Form 854R to each tenant licensee and permittee.
    (g) Except as described in paragraph (h) of this section, the 
Antenna Structure Registration Number must be displayed in a conspicuous 
place so that it is readily visible near the base of the antenna 
structure. Materials used to display the Antenna Structure Registration 
Number must be weather-resistant and of sufficient size to be easily 
seen at the base of the antenna structure.
    (h) The owner is not required to post the Antenna Structure 
Registration Number in cases where a federal, state, or local government 
entity provides written notice to the owner that such a posting would 
detract from the appearance of a historic landmark. In this case, the 
owner must make the Antenna Structure Registration Number available to 
representatives of the Commission, the FAA, and the general public upon 
reasonable demand.

[61 FR 4362, Feb. 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 17.5  Commission consideration of applications for station authorization.

    (a) Applications for station authorization, excluding services 
authorized on a geographic basis, are reviewed to determine whether 
there is a requirement that the antenna structure in question must be 
registered with the Commission.
    (b) If registration is required, the registrant must supply the 
structure's registration number upon request by the Commission.
    (c) If registration is not required, the application for 
authorization will be processed without further regard to this chapter.

[61 FR 4362, Feb. 6, 1996]

[[Page 874]]


<R05>
Sec. 17.6  Responsibility of Commission licensees and permittees.

    (a) The antenna structure owner is responsible for maintaining the 
painting and lighting in accordance with this part. However, if a 
licensee or permittee authorized on an antenna structure is aware that 
the structure is not being maintained in accordance with the 
specifications set forth on the Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 
854R) or the requirements of this part, or otherwise has reason to 
question whether the antenna structure owner is carrying out its 
responsibility under this part, the licensee or permittee must take 
immediate steps to ensure that the antenna structure is brought into 
compliance and remains in compliance. The licensee must:
    (1) Immediately notify the structure owner;
    (2) Immediately notify the site management company (if applicable);
    (3) Immediately notify the Commission; and,
    (4) Make a diligent effort to immediately bring the structure into 
compliance.
    (b) In the event of non-compliance by the antenna structure owner, 
the Commission may require each licensee and permittee authorized on an 
antenna structure to maintain the structure, for an indefinite period, 
in accordance with the Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 854R) 
and the requirements of this part.
    (c) If the owner of the antenna structure cannot file FCC Form 854 
because it is subject to a denial of Federal benefits under the Anti-
Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. 862, the first licensee authorized to 
locate on the structure must register the structure using FCC Form 854, 
and provide a copy of the Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 854R) 
to the owner. The owner remains responsible for providing a copy of FCC 
Form 854R to all tenant licensees on the structure and for posting the 
registration number as required by Sec. 17.4(g).

<R04>
     Subpart B_Federal Aviation Administration Notification Criteria


<R05>
Sec. 17.7  Antenna structures requiring notification to the FAA.

    A notification to the Federal Aviation Administration is required, 
except as set forth in Sec. 17.14, for any of the following 
construction or alteration:
    (a) Any construction or alteration of more than 60.96 meters (200 
feet) in height above ground level at its site.
    (b) Any construction or alteration of greater height than an 
imaginary surface extending outward and upward at one of the following 
slopes:
    (1) 100 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 6.10 kilometers (20,000 
feet) from the nearest point of the nearest runway of each airport 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section with at least one runway more 
than 0.98 kilometers (3,200 feet) in actual length, excluding heliports.
    (2) 50 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 3.05 kilometers (10,000 
feet) from the nearest point of the nearest runway of each airport 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section with its longest runway no 
more than 0.98 kilometers (3,200 feet) in actual length, excluding 
heliports.
    (3) 25 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 1.52 kilometers (5,000 
feet) from the nearest point of the nearest landing and takeoff area of 
each heliport specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) When requested by the FAA, any construction or alteration that 
would be in an instrument approach area (defined in the FAA standards 
governing instrument approach procedures) and available information 
indicates it might exceed an obstruction standard of the FAA.
    (d) Any construction or alteration on any of the following airports 
(including heliports):
    (1) An airport that is available for public use and is listed in the 
Airport Directory of the current Airman's Information Manual or in 
either the Alaska or Pacific Airman's Guide and Chart Supplement.
    (2) An airport under construction, that is the subject of a notice 
or proposal on file with the Federal Aviation Administration, and except 
for military airports, it is clearly indicated

[[Page 875]]

that the airport will be available for public use.
    (3) An airport that is operated by an armed force of the United 
States.

    Note: Consideration to aeronautical facilities not in existence at 
the time of the filing of the application for radio facilities will be 
given only when proposed airport construction or improvement plans are 
on file with the Federal Aviation Administration as of the filing date 
of the application for such radio facilities.

FR 54823, Oct. 11, 1977; 42 FR 57127, Nov. 1, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 17.8  Establishment of antenna farm areas.

    (a) Each antenna farm area will be established by an appropriate 
rulemaking proceeding, which may be commenced by the Commission on its 
own motion after consultation with the FAA, upon request of the FAA, or 
as a result of a petition filed by any interested person. After receipt 
of a petition from an interested person disclosing sufficient reasons to 
justify institution of a rulemaking proceeding, the Commission will 
request the advice of the FAA with respect to the considerations of 
menace to air navigation in terms of air safety which may be presented 
by the proposal. The written communication received from the FAA in 
response to the Commission's request shall be placed in the Commission's 
public rulemaking file containing the petition, and interested persons 
shall be allowed a period of 30 days within which to file statements 
with respect thereto. Such statements shall also be filed with the 
Administrator of the FAA with proof of such filing to be established in 
accordance with Sec. 1.47 of this chapter. The Administrator of the FAA 
shall have a period of 15 days within which to file responses to such 
statements. If the Commission, upon consideration of the matters 
presented to it in accordance with the above procedure, is satisfied 
that establishment of the proposed antenna farm would constitute a 
menace to air navigation for reasons of air safety, rulemaking 
proceedings will not be instituted. If rulemaking proceedings are 
instituted, any person filing comments therein which concern the 
question of whether the proposed antenna farm will constitute a menace 
to air navigation shall file a copy of the comments with the 
Administrator of the FAA. Proof of such filing shall be established in 
accordance with Sec. 1.47 of this chapter.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to mean that only one 
antenna farm area will be designated for a community. The Commission 
will consider on a case-by-case basis whether or not more than one 
antenna farm area shall be designated for a particular community.

[32 FR 8813, June 21, 1967, as amended at 32 FR 13591, Sept. 28, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 17.9  Designated antenna farm areas.

    The areas described in the following paragraphs of this section are 
established as antenna farm areas [appropriate paragraphs will be added 
as necessary].

<R05>
Sec. 17.10  Antenna structures over 304.80 meters (1,000 feet) in height.

    Where one or more antenna farm areas have been designated for a 
community or communities (see Sec. 17.9), the Commission will not 
accept for filing an application to construct a new station or to 
increase height or change antenna location of an existing station 
proposing the erection of an antenna structure over 304.80 meters (1,000 
feet) above ground unless:
    (a) It is proposed to locate the antenna structure in a designated 
antenna farm area, or
    (b) It is accompanied by a statement from the Federal Aviation 
Administration that the proposed structure will not constitute a menace 
to air navigation, or
    (c) It is accompanied by a request for waiver setting forth reasons 
sufficient, if true, to justify such a waiver.

[32 FR 8813, June 21, 1967, as amended at 42 FR 54824, Oct. 11, 1977; 61 
FR 4363, Feb. 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 17.14  Certain antenna structures exempt from notification to the FAA.

    A notification to the Federal Aviation Administration is not 
required for any of the following construction or alteration:

[[Page 876]]

    (a) Any object that would be shielded by existing structures of a 
permanent and substantial character or by natural terrain or topographic 
features of equal or greater height, and would be located in the 
congested area of a city, town, or settlement where it is evident beyond 
all reasonable doubt that the structure so shielded will not adversely 
affect safety in air navigation. Applicant claiming such exemption under 
Sec. 17.14(a) shall submit a statement with their application to the 
FCC explaining basis in detail for their finding.
    (b) Any antenna structure of 6.10 meters (20 feet) or less in height 
except one that would increase the height of another antenna structure.
    (c) Any air navigation facility, airport visual approach or landing 
aid, aircraft arresting device, or meteorological device, of a type 
approved by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, 
the location and height of which is fixed by its functional purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 17.17  Existing structures.

    (a) The requirements found in Sec. 17.23 relating to painting and 
lighting of antenna structures shall not apply to those structures 
authorized prior to July 1, 1996. Previously authorized structures may 
retain their present painting and lighting specifications, so long as 
the overall structure height or site coordinates do not change. The 
Antenna Structure Registration requirements found in Sec. 17.5, 
however, shall apply to all antenna structures that have been assigned 
painting or lighting requirements by the Commission, regardless of prior 
authorization.
    (b) No change in any of these criteria or relocation of airports 
shall at any time impose a new restriction upon any then existing or 
authorized antenna structure or structures.

Sec. 17.21  Painting and lighting, when required.

    Antenna structures shall be painted and lighted when:
    (a) They exceed 60.96 meters (200 feet) in height above the ground 
or they require special aeronautical study.
    (b) The Commission may modify the above requirement for painting 
and/or lighting of antenna structures, when it is shown by the applicant 
that the absence of such marking would not impair the safety of air 
navigation, or that a lesser marking requirement would insure the safety 
thereof.

    During construction of an antenna structure, for which red 
obstruction lighting is required, at least two 116- or 125-watt lamps 
(A21/TS) enclosed in aviation red obstruction light globes, shall be 
installed at the uppermost point of the structure. The intensity of each 
lamp shall not be less than 32.5 candelas. In addition, as the height of 
the structure exceeds each level at which permanent obstruction lights 
will be required, two similar lights shall be installed at each such 
level. These temporary warning lights shall be displayed nightly from 
sunset to sunrise until the permanent obstruction lights have been 
installed and placed in operation, and shall be positioned so as to 
insure unobstructed visibility of at least one of the lights at any 
normal angle of approach. If practical, the permanent obstruction lights 
may be installed and operated at each required level as construction 
progresses.

person designated by the Chairman to assist in administration of the 
program may give a letter of clearance to the employee concerned, and 
the case will not be recorded in his Official Personnel Folder;
    (ii) If, after investigation, the case investigator deems the act to 
be merely a minor indiscretion, he may resolve the situation by 
discussing it with the employee. The case will not be recorded in the 
employee's Official Personnel Folder;
    (iii) If the case administrator considers the problem to be of 
sufficient importance, he may call it to the attention of the Chairman, 
who in turn may notify the employee of the seriousness of his act and 
warn him of the consequences of a repetition. The case will not be 
recorded in the employee's Official Personnel Folder, unless the 
employee requests it;
    (iv) The Chairman may, when in his opinion circumstances warrant, 
establish a special review board to investigate the facts in a case and 
to make a full report thereon, including recommended action; or
    (v)(A) If the Chairman decides that formal disciplinary action 
should be taken, he may prepare for Commission consideration a statement 
of facts and recommend one of the following:

<R05>
Sec. 19.735-201  Outside employment and other activity prohibited by the Communications Act.

    Under section 4(b) of the Communications Act, at 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(A)(iv), no employee of the Commission may be

[[Page 889]]

in the employ of or hold any official relation to any person 
significantly regulated by the Commission under that Act. In addition, 
the Commissioners are prohibited by section 4(b) of the Communications 
Act, at 47 U.S.C. 154(b)(4), from engaging in any other business, 
vocation, profession, or employment.

    Note: Under the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Federal Communications Commission, at 5 CFR 3901.102, 
professional employees of the Commission must obtain approval before 
engaging in the private practice of the same profession as that of the 
employee's official position, whether or not for compensation.


<R05>
Sec. 19.735-202  Financial interests prohibited by the Communications Act.

    (a) No Commissioner shall have a pecuniary interest in any hearing 
or proceeding in which he participates. (47 U.S.C. 154(j).)
    (b)(1) Section 4(b) of the Communications Act, at 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(A), provides:

    No member of the Commission or person employed by the Commission 
shall:
    (i) Be financially interested in any company or other entity engaged 
in the manufacture or sale of telecommunications equipment which is 
subject to regulation by the Commission;
    (ii) Be financially interested in any company or other entity 
engaged in the business of communication by wire or radio or in the use 
of the electromagnetic spectrum;
    (iii) Be financially interested in any company or other entity which 
controls any company or other entity specified in clause (i) or clause 
(ii), or which derives a significant portion of its total income from 
ownership of stocks, bonds, or other securities of any such company or 
other entity; or
    (iv) Be employed by, hold any official relation to, or own any 
stocks, bonds, or other securities of, any person significantly 
regulated by the Commission under this act; except that the prohibitions 
established in this subparagraph shall apply only to financial interests 
in any company or other entity which has a significant interest in 
communications, manufacturing, or sales activities which are subject to 
regulation by the Commission.

    (2) To determine whether an entity has a significant interest in 
communications related activities that are subject to Commission 
regulations, the Commission shall consider, without excluding other 
relevant factors, the criteria in section 4(b) of the Communications 
Act, at 47 U.S.C. 154(b)(3). These criteria include:
    (i) The revenues and efforts directed toward the telecommunications 
aspect of the business;
    (ii) The extent of Commission regulation over the entity involved;
    (iii) The potential economic impact of any Commission action on that 
particular entity; and
    (iv) The public perception regarding the business activities of the 
company.
    (3)(i) Section 4(b) of the Communications Act, at 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(B)(i), permits the Commission to waive the prohibitions at 47 
U.S.C. 154(b)(2)(A). The Act's waiver provision at 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(B)(i) provides:

    The Commission shall have authority to waive, from time to time, the 
application of the prohibitions established in subparagraph (A) of 
section 4(b) to persons employed by the Commission if the Commission 
determines that the financial interests of a person which are involved 
in a particular case are minimal, except that such waiver authority 
shall be subject to the provisions of section 208 of title 18, United 
States Code. The waiver authority established in this subparagraph shall 
not apply with respect to members of the Commission.

    (ii)(A) Requests for waiver of the provisions of 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(A) may be submitted by an employee to the Head of the 
employee's Office or Bureau, who will endorse the request with an 
appropriate recommendation and forward the request to the Designated 
Agency Ethics Official. The Designated Agency Ethics Official has 
delegated authority to waive the applicability of 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(A).
    (B) All requests for waiver shall be in writing and in the required 
detail. The dollar value for the financial interest sought to be waived 
shall be expressed explicitly or in categories of value provided at 5 
CFR 2634.301(d).
    (C) Copies of all waiver requests and the action taken thereon shall 
be maintained by the Designated Agency Ethics Official. In any case in 
which the Commission exercises the waiver authority established in 
section 4(b) of the Communications Act, the Commission shall publish 
notice of such action in the Federal Register and shall furnish notice 
of such action to the appropriate committees of each House of the

[[Page 890]]

Congress. Each such notice shall include information regarding the 
identity of the person receiving the waiver, the position held by such 
person, and the nature of the financial interests which are the subject 
of the waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 19.735-203  Nonpublic information.

    (a) Except as authorized in writing by the Chairman pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, or otherwise as authorized by the 
Commission or its rules, nonpublic information shall not be disclosed, 
directly or indirectly, to any person outside the Commission. Such 
information includes, but is not limited to, the following:
    (1) The content of agenda items (except for compliance with the 
Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b); or
    (2) Actions or decisions made by the Commission at closed meetings 
or by circulation prior to the public release of such information by the 
Commission.
    (b) An employee engaged in outside teaching, lecturing, or writing 
shall not use nonpublic information obtained as a result of his 
Government employment in connection with such teaching, lecturing, or 
writing except when the Chairman gives written authorization for the use 
of that nonpublic information on the basis that its use is in the public 
interest.
    (c) This section does not prohibit the disclosure of an official 
Commission meeting agenda listing titles and summaries of items for 
discussion at an open Commission meeting. Also, this section does not 
prohibit the disclosure of information about the scheduling of 
Commission agenda items.
    (d) Any person regulated by or practicing before the Commission 
coming into possession of written nonpublic information (including 
written material transmitted in electronic form) as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section under circumstances where it appears that 
its release was inadvertent or otherwise unauthorized shall promptly 
return the written information to the Commission's Office of the 
Inspector General without further distribution or use of the written 
nonpublic information. Any person regulated by or practicing before the 
Commission who willfully violates this section by failing to promptly 
notify the Commission's Office of the Inspector General of the receipt 
of written nonpublic information (including written material transmitted 
in electronic form) that he knew or should have known was released 
inadvertently or in any otherwise unauthorized manner may be subject to 
appropriate sanctions by the Commission. In the case of attorneys 
practicing before the Commission, such sanctions may include 
disciplinary action under the provisions of Sec. 1.24 of this chapter.

    Note: Employees also should refer to the provisions of the Standards 
of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, at 5 CFR 
2635.703, on the use of nonpublic information. Additionally, employees 
should refer to Sec. 19.735-107 of this part, which provides that 
employees of the Commission who violate this part may be subject to 
disciplinary action which may be in addition to any other penalty 
prescribed by law. As is the case with section 2635.703, this part is 
intended only to cover knowing unauthorized disclosures of nonpublic 
information.
