                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 0.5  General description of Commission organization and operations.

    (a) Principal staff units. The Commission is assisted in the 
performance of its responsibilities by its staff, which is divided into 
the following principal units:
    (1) Office of Managing Director.
    (2) Office of Engineering and Technology.

[[Page 8]]

    (3) Office of General Counsel.
    (4) Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis.
    (5) Office of Media Relations.
    (6) Office of Legislative Affairs.
    (7) Office of Inspector General.
    (8) Office of Communications Business Opportunities.
    (9) Office of Administrative Law Judges.
    (10) Office of Workplace Diversity
    (11) Wireline Competition Bureau.
    (12) Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.
    (13) International Bureau.
    (14) Media Bureau.
    (15) Enforcement Bureau.
    (16) Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau.
    (b) Staff responsibilities and functions. The organization and 
functions of these major staff units are described in detail in 
Secs. 0.11 through 0.151. The defense and emergency preparedness 
functions of the Commission are set forth separately, beginning at 
Sec. 0.181. For a complete description of staff functions, reference 
should be made to those provisions. (See also the U.S. Government 
Organization Manual, which contains a chart showing the Commission's 
organization, the names of the members and principal staff officers of 
the Commission, and other information concerning the Commission.)
    (c) Delegations of authority to the staff. Pursuant to section 5(c) 
of the Communications Act, the Commission has delegated authority to its 
staff to act on matters which are minor or routine or settled in nature 
and those in which immediate action may be necessary. See subpart B of 
this part. Actions taken under delegated authority are subject to review 
by the Commission, on its own motion or on an application for review 
filed by a person aggrieved by the action. Except for the possibility of 
review, actions taken under delegated authority have the same force and 
effect as actions taken by the Commission. The delegation of authority 
to a staff officer, however, does not mean that he will exercise that 
authority in all matters subject to the delegation. In non-hearing 
matters, the staff is at liberty to refer any matter at any stage to the 
Commission for action, upon concluding that it involves matters 
warranting the Commission's consideration, and the Commission may 
instruct the staff to do so.
    (d) Commission action. Matters requiring Commission action, or 
warranting its consideration, are dealt with by the Commission at 
regular monthly meetings, or at special meetings called to consider a 
particular matter. Meetings are normally held at the principal offices 
of the Commission in the District of Columbia, but may be held elsewhere 
in the United States. In appropriate circumstances, Commission action 
may be taken between meetings ``by circulation'', which involves the 
submission of a document to each of the Commissioners for his approval.
    (e) Compliance with Federal financial management requirements. Any 
Bureau or Office recommending Commission action that may affect agency 
compliance with Federal financial management requirements must confer 
with the Office of Managing Director. Such items will indicate the 
position of the Managing Director when forwarded to the Commission. Any 
Bureau or Office taking action under delegated authority that may affect 
agency compliance with Federal financial management requirements must 
confer with the Office of the Managing Director before taking action.

Administrative Law Judge are ruled on by the presiding officer by virtue 
of the authority vested in him to control the course and conduct of the

Procedure Act and section 409 of the Communications Act rather than from 
delegations of authority made pursuant to section 5(c) of the 
Communications Act. (See Secs. 0.218 and 0.341.).

interlocutory pleadings in hearing proceedings are set forth in 
Secs. 1.291 through 1.298 of this chapter. Procedures pertaining to 
appeals from rulings of the presiding officer are set forth in

officer's rulings are set forth in Sec. 1.303. Procedures pertaining to 
reconsideration and review of actions taken pursuant to delegated 
authority are set forth in Secs. 1.101, 1.102, 1.104, 1.106, 1.113, 
1.115, and 1.117. Procedures pertaining to exceptions to initial 
decisions are set forth in Secs. 1.276-1.279.
    (d) The Commission, by vote of a majority of the members then 
holding office, may delegate its functions either by rule or by order, 
and may at any time amend, modify, or rescind any such rule or order.
    (1) Functions of a continuing or recurring nature are delegated by 
rule. The rule is published in the Federal Register and is included in 
this subpart.
    (2) Functions pertaining to a particular matter or proceeding are 
delegated by order. The order is published in the Federal Register and 
associated with the record of that matter or proceeding, but neither the 
order nor any reference to the delegation made thereby is included in 
this subpart.

taken pursuant to delegated authority shall have the same force and 
effect and shall be made, evidenced, and enforced in the same manner as 
actions of the Commission.

subpart is authorized to issue orders (including rulings, decisions, or 
other action documents) pursuant to such authority and to enter into 
general correspondence concerning any matter for which he is responsible 
under this subpart or subpart A of this part.
    (b) Authority of subordinate officials. Authority delegated to any 
official to issue orders or to enter into correspondence under paragraph 
(a) of this section may be exercised by that official or by appropriate 
subordinate officials acting for him.

<R05>
Sec. 0.406  The rules and regulations.

    Persons having business with the Commission should familiarize 
themselves with those portions of its rules and regulations pertinent to 
such business. All of the rules have been published and are readily 
available. See Secs. 0.411(b), 0.412, and 0.415. For the benefit of 
those who are not familiar with the rules, there is set forth in this 
section a brief description of their format and contents.
    (a) Format. The rules are set forth in the Code of Federal 
Regulations aschapter I of title 47. Chapter I is divided into parts 
numbered from 0-99. Each part, in turn, is divided into numbered 
sections. To allow for the addition of new parts and sections in logical 
sequence, without extensive renumbering, parts and sections are not 
always numbered consecutively. Thus, for example, part 2 is followed by 
part 5, and Sec. 1.8 is followed by Sec. 1.10; in this case, parts 3 and 
4 and Sec. 1.9 have been reserved for future use. In numbering sections, 
the number before the period is the part number; and the number after 
the period locates the section within that part. Thus, for example, 
Sec. 1.1 is the first section of part 1 and Sec. 5.1 is the first 
section in part 5. Except in the case of accounting regulations (parts 
31-35), the period should not be read as a decimal point; thus, 
Sec. 1.511 is not located between Secs. 1.51 and 1.52 but at a much 
later point in the rules. In citing the Code of Federal Regulations, the 
citation, 47 CFR 5.1, for example, is to Sec. 5.1 (in part 5) of chapter 
I of title 47 of the Code, and permits the exact location of that rule. 
No citation to other rule units (e.g., subpart or chapter) is needed.
    (b) Contents. Parts 0-19 of the rules have been reserved for 
provisions of a general nature. Parts 20-69 of this chapter have been 
reserved for provisions pertaining to common carriers. Parts 20-29 and

<R05>
Sec. 0.409  Commission policy on private printing of FCC forms.

    The Commission has established a policy regarding the printing of 
blank FCC forms by private companies if they elect to do so as a matter 
of expediency and convenience to their clients or consumers. The policy 
is as follows:
    (a) Blank FCC forms may be reproduced by private companies at their 
own expense provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) Use a printing process resulting in a product that is at least 
comparable in quality to the original document, without change to the 
page size, image size, configuration of pages, folds or perforations, 
and matching as closely as possible the paper weight, paper color and 
ink color.
    (2) Delete in its entirety any and all U.S. Government Printing 
Office (GPO)

[[Page 53]]

indicia that may appear in the margin(s).
    (3) If the printer wishes to identify a foreign country in which the 
forms are printed, a marginal notation must be added stating ``No U.S. 
Government funds were used to print this document.''
    (4) Do not add to the form any other symbol, word or phrase that 
might be construed as personalizing the form or advertising on it.
    (5) Except as specified above, do not delete from or add to any part 
of the form, or attach anything thereto.
    (6) Assure that the form being reproduced is an edition currently 
acceptable by the Commission, which will endeavor to keep the public 
advised of revisions to its forms, but cannot assume responsibility to 
the extent of eliminating any element of risk against the use of 
obsolete forms.
    (b) These guidelines do not apply to forms which respondents may 
wish to reproduce as completed facsimiles on automated equipment to 
satisfy application or report requirements. Requests for permission to 
submit such forms to the Commission should be addressed to the Office of 
Managing Director.

Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402:
    (a) Statutory materials. Laws pertaining to communications are 
contained in Title 47 of the United States Code. Laws enacted since the 
printing of the last supplement to the Code are printed individually as 
slip laws, and these are compiled chronologically in the United States 
Statutes at Large. The Acts of Congress from 1910-62 pertaining to radio 
have been compiled in a single volume, Radio Laws of the United States 
(1962 ed.). See Secs. 0.405 and 0.414.
    (b) Regulatory materials--(1) The Code of Federal Regulations. The 
rules and regulations of the Commission are contained in chapter I of 
title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Chapter I is divided into 
the following four subchapters, which may be purchased separately: 
Subchapter A--General; Subchapter B--Common Carrier Services; Subchapter 
C--Broadcast Radio Services; and Subchapter D--Private Radio Services. 
Most persons will find that they need subchapter A, containing the 
general rules, and one of the other volumes, depending upon their area 
of interest. These four volumes are revised annually to reflect changes 
in the rules. See Secs. 0.406, 0.412, and 0.415. The Code of Federal 
Regulations is fully indexed and contains numerous finding aids. See 1 
CFR appendix C.
    (2) The Federal Register. As rules are adopted, amended, or 
repealed, the changes are published in the Federal Register, which is 
published daily except on legal holidays. Notices of proposed rule 
making, other rule making documents, statements of general policy, 
interpretations of general applicability, and other Commission documents 
having general applicability and legal effect are also published in the 
Federal Register. Summaries of the full Notices of proposed rule making 
and other rule making decisions adopted by the Commission constitute 
rulemaking documents for purposes of Federal Register publication. The 
Federal Register is fully indexed and contains numerous findings aids.

<R05>
Sec. 0.442  Disclosure to other Federal government agencies of information submitted to the Commission in confidence.

    (a) The disclosure of records to other Federal government agencies 
is generally governed by 44 U.S.C. 3512 and 3510(b) rather than the 
Freedom of Information Act. The acceptance of materials in confidence 
under Sec. 0.457 or Sec. 0.459 does not provide assurance against their 
disclosure to other agencies.
    (b) Information submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant 
to Sec. 0.457(c) (2) and (3), (d) and (g) or Sec. 0.459 will be 
disclosed to other agencies of the Federal government upon request: 
Provided (1) Specific Commission assurances against such disclosure have 
not been given, (2) the other agency has established a legitimate need 
for the information, (3) disclosure is made subject to the provisions of 
44 U.S.C.

[[Page 56]]

3510(b), and (4) disclosure is not prohibited by the Privacy Act or 
other provisions of law.
    (c) The Commission's staff may give assurances against disclosure of 
information to other Federal agencies only with the prior written 
approval of the General Counsel. In no event will assurance against 
disclosure to otheragencies be given in advance of submission of the 
information to the Commission if submission is required by statute or by 
the provisions of this chapter; but the notice provisions of paragraph 
(d) of this section will apply to such information.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section, a party who furnished records to the Commission in confidence 
will be notified at the time that the request for disclosure is 
submitted and will be afforded 10 days in which to oppose disclosure.
    (2) If the agency requesting the records states to the satisfaction 
of the Commission that notice to the party who furnished the records to 
the Commission will interfere unduly with its law enforcement activities 
and further states that it will notify that party of the Commission's 
disclosure once the potential for such interference is eliminated, the 
Commission will not give notice of disclosure.
    (3) A party who furnished records to the Commission in confidence 
under Sec. 0.457(d) or 0.459 will not be afforded prior notice when the 
disclosure is made to the Comptroller General. Such a party will instead 
be notified of disclosure of the records to the Comptroller General 
either individually or by public notice.
    (4) If disclosure is opposed and the Commission decides to make the 
records available to the other agency, the party who furnished the 
records to the Commission will be afforded ten (10) working days from 
the date of the ruling in which to move for a judicial stay of the 
Commission's action. If he does not move for stay within this period, 
the records will be disclosed.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, nothing 
in this section is intended to govern disclosure of information to 
Congress or the Comptroller General.

    (a) Adjudicatory opinions and orders of the Commission, or its staff 
acting on delegated authority, are mailed to the parties, and as part of 
the record, are available for inspection in accordance with Secs. 0.453 
and 0.455.
    (b) Texts adopted by the Commission or a member of its staff on 
delegated authority and released through the Office of Media Relations 
are published in the FCC Record. Older materials of this nature are 
available in the FCC Reports. In the event that such older materials are 
not published in the FCC Reports, reference should be made to the 
Federal Register or Pike and Fischer Radio Regulation.
    (c) All rulemaking documents are published in the Federal Register. 
Summaries of the full Notices of proposed rule making and other rule 
making decisions adopted by the Commission constitute rulemaking 
documents for purposes of Federal Register publication. See 
Sec. 1.412(a)(1). The complete text of the Commission decision also is 
released by the Commission and is available for inspection and copying 
during normal business hours in the Office of Media Relations or as 
otherwise specified in the rulemaking document published in the Federal 
Register. Docketed matters are available to the public via the 
Electronic Comment Filing System maintained in the Reference Information 
Center at 445 12th Street, Washington, DC. The complete texts of 
rulemaking decisions may also be purchased from the Commission's 
duplicating contractor.
    (d) Formal policy statements and interpretations designed to have 
general applicability and legal effect are published in the Federal 
Register, the FCC Record, FCC Reports, or Pike and Fischer. Commission 
decisions and

[[Page 57]]

other Commission documents not entitled formal policy statements or 
interpretations may contain substantive interpretations and statements 
regarding policy, and these are published as part of the document in the 
FCC Record, FCC Reports or Pike and Fischer. General statements 
regarding policy and interpretations furnished to individuals, in 
correspondence or otherwise, are not ordinarily published.
    (e) If the documents described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section are published in the Federal Register, the FCC Record, FCC 
Reports, or Pike and Fischer Radio Regulation, they may be relied upon, 
used or cited as precedent by the Commission or private parties in any 
manner. If they are not so published, they may not be relied upon, used 
or cited as precedent, except against persons who have actual notice of 
the document in question or by such persons against the Commission. No 
person is expected to comply with any requirement or policy of the 
Commission unless he has actual notice of that requirement or policy or 
a document stating it has been published as provided in this paragraph. 
Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be construed as precluding a 
reference to the rationale set forth in a recent document that is 
pending publication if the requirment or policy to which the rationale 
relates is contained in a published document or if actual notice of that 
requirement or policy has been given.
    (f) The Federal Register, the FCC Record, FCC Reports and Pike and 
Fischer Radio Regulation are indexed. If the documents described in 
paragraphs (a)-(d) of this section are not published, they are neither 
indexed nor relied upon, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (g) The FCC Administrative Manual (excepting Part IX, concerning 
Civil Defense, which contains materials classified under E.O. 10501) is 
available for inspection in the Office of the Managing Director. The 
Manual is not indexed but is organized by subject, with tables of 
contents, and the materials contained therein can be located without 
difficulty.
    (h) Subparts A and B of this part describe the functions of the 
staff and list the matters on which authority has been delegated to the 
staff. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, all general 
instructions to the staff and limitations upon its authority are set 
forth in those subparts. As part of the Commission's rules and 
regulations, the provisions of these subparts are indexed in the Federal 
Register and the Code of Federal Regulations. Instructions to the staff 
in particular matters or cases are privileged and are not published or 
made available for public inspection.
    (i) To the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion 
of personal privacy, the Commission may delete identifying details when 
it makes available or publishes any document described in this section. 
The justification for any such deletion will be fully explained in a 
preamble to the document.

Sec. 0.451  Inspection of records: Generally.

    (a) Records which are routinely available for public inspection. 
Sections 0.453 and 0.455 list those Commission records which are 
routinely available for public inspection and the places at which those 
records may be inspected. Procedures governing requests for inspection 
of such records are set out in Sec. 0.460.
    (b) Records which are not routinely available for public inspection. 
Records which are not listed in Sec. 0.453 or Sec. 0.455 are not 
routinely available for public inspection. Such records fall into two 
categories.
    (1) The first category consists of those records or kinds of records 
listed in Sec. 0.457 and of particular records withheld from public 
inspection under Sec. 0.459. The Commission has determined that there is 
a statutory basis for withholding these records from public inspection. 
In some cases, the Commission is prohibited from permitting the 
inspection of records. In other cases, the records are the property of 
anotheragency, and the Commission

[[Page 58]]

has no authority to permit their inspection. In still other cases, the 
Commission is authorized, for reason of policy, to withhold records from 
inspection, but is not required to do so.
    (2) The second category consists of records which are not listed in 
Sec. 0.453, Sec. 0.455, or Sec. 0.457 and have not been withheld from 
inspection under Sec. 0.459. In some cases, these records have not been 
identified for listing. In other cases (e.g., the general correspondence 
files), the Commission is unable to determine either that all records in 
a class should be routinely available for inspection or that all records 
in that class should not be routinely available for inspection, and 
individual determination is required.
    (3) Procedures governing requests for inspection of these records 
are set out in Sec. 0.461.
    (4) Procedures governing demands by competent authority for 
inspection of these records are set out in Sec. 0.463.
    (5) Except as provided in Secs. 0.461 and 0.463, no officer or 
employee of the Commission shall permit the inspection of records which 
are not routinely available for public inspection under Sec. 0.453 or 
Sec. 0.455, or disclose information contained therein.
    (c) Copies. Section 0.465 applies to requests for copies of 
Commission records which are routinely available for public inspection 
under Secs. 0.453 and 0.455 and those which are made available for 
inspection under Sec. 0.461. Section 0.467 applies to requests for 
certified copies of Commission records.
    (d) Search fees. Section 0.466 prescribes fees to cover the expense 
of searching for records made available for inspection under Sec. 0.460 
or Sec. 0.461.

Sec. 0.457  Records not routinely available for public inspection.

    The records listed in this section are not routinely available for 
public inspection. The records are listed in this

[[Page 63]]

section by category, according to the statutory basis for withholding 
thoserecords from inspection; and under each category, if appropriate, 
the underlying policy considerations affecting the withholding and 
disclosure of records in that category are briefly outlined. Except 
where the records are not the property of the Commission or where the 
disclosure of those records is prohibited by law, the Commission will 
entertain requests from members of the public under Sec. 0.461 for 
permission to inspect particular records withheld from inspection under 
the provisions of this section, and will weigh the policy considerations 
favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting 
inspection in the light of the facts of the particular case. In making 
such requests, it is important to appreciate that there may be more than 
one basis for withholding particular records from inspection. The 
listing of records by category is not intended to imply the contrary but 
is solely for the information and assistance of persons making such 
requests. Requests to inspect or copy the transcripts, recordings or 
minutes of agency or advisory committee meetings will be considered 
under Sec. 0.603 rather than under the provisions of this section.
    (a) Materials that are specifically authorized under criteria 
established by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of 
national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified 
pursuant to such Executive Order, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1). (1) E.O. 10450, 
``Security Requirements for Government Employees,'' 18 FR 2489, April 
27, 1953, 3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 936. Pursuant to the provisions of 
E.O. 10450, reports and other material and information developed in 
security investigations are the property of the investigative agency. If 
they are retained by the Commission, it is required that they be 
maintained in confidence and that no access be given to them without the 
consent of the investigative agency. Such materials and information will 
not be made available for public inspection. See also paragraphs (f) and 
(g) of this section.
    (2) E.O. 10501, ``Safeguarding Official Information in the Interests 
of the Defense of the United States,'' 18 FR 7049, November 10, 1953, as 
amended, 3 CFR, 1965 ed., p. 450. E.O. 10501, as amended, provides for 
the classification of official information which requires protection in 
the interests of national defense, and prohibits the disclosure of 
classified information except as provided therein. Classified materials 
and information will not be made available for public inspection. See 
also, E.O. 10033, February 8, 1949, 14 FR 561, 3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., 
p. 226, and 47 U.S.C. 154(j).
    (b) Materials that are related solely to the internal personnel 
rules and practices of the Commission, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2). (1) Materials 
related solely to internal management matters, including minutes of 
Commission actions on such matters. Such materials may be made available 
for inspection under Sec. 0.461, however, unless their disclosure would 
interfere with or prejudice the performance of the internal management 
functions to which they relate, or unless their disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (see 
paragraph (f) of this section).
    (2) Materials relating to the negotiation of contracts.
    (3) All materials used in conducting radio operator examinations, 
including test booklets, Morse Code tapes, and scoring masks.
    (c) Materials that are specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b): 
Provided, That such statute (1) requires that the materials be withheld 
from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, 
or (2) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of materials to be withheld. The Commission is 
authorized under the following statutory provisions to withhold 
materials from public inspection.
    (1) Section 4(j) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 154(j), 
provides, in part, that, ``The Commission is authorized to withhold 
publication of records or proceedings containing secret information 
affecting the national defense.'' Pursuant to that provision, it has 
been

[[Page 64]]

determined that the following materials should be withheld from public 
inspection (see also paragraph (a) of this section):
    (i) Maps showing the exact location of submarine cables.
    (ii) Minutes of Commission actions on classified matters.
    (iii) Maps of nation-wide point-to-point microwave networks.
    (2) Under section 213(f) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 
213(f), the Commission is authorized to order, with the reasons 
therefor, that records and data pertaining to the valuation of the 
property of common carriers and furnished to the Commission by the 
carriers pursuant to the provisions of that section, shall not be 
available for public inspection. If such an order has been issued, the 
data and records will be withheld from public inspection, except under 
the provisions of Sec. 0.461. Normally, however, such data and 
information is available for inspection. See Sec. 0.455(c) (8).
    (3) Under section 412 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 412, the 
Commission may withhold from public inspection certain contracts, 
agreements and arrangements between common carriers relating to foreign 
wire or radio communication. Reports of negotiations regarding such 
foreign communication matters, filed by carriers under Sec. 43.52 of 
this chapter, may also be withheld from public inspection under section 
412. Any person may file a petition requesting that such materials be 
withheld from public inspection. To support such action, the petition 
must show that the contract, agreement or arrangement relates to foreign 
wire or radio communications; that its publication would place American 
communication companies at a disadvantage in meeting the competition of 
foreign communication companies; and that the public interest would be 
served by keeping its terms confidential. If the Commission orders that 
such materials be kept confidential, they will be made available for 
inspection only under the provisions of Sec. 0.461.
    (4) Section 605 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 605, provides, 
in part, that, ``no person not being authorized by the sender shall 
intercept any communication [by wire or radio] and divulge or publish 
the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such 
intercepted communications to any person.'' In executing its 
responsibilities, the Commission regularly monitors radio transmissions 
(see Sec. 0.116). Except as required for the enforcement of the 
communications laws, treaties and the provisions of this chapter, or as 
authorized in section 605, the Commission is prohibited from divulging 
information obtained in the course of these monitoring activities; and 
such information, and materials relating thereto, will not be made 
available for public inspection.
    (5) Section 1905 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1905, prohibits the 
unauthorized disclosure of certain confidential information. See 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from any person and privileged or confidential--categories of materials 
not routinely available for public inspection, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 18 
U.S.C. 1905.
    (1) The materials listed in this subparagraph have been accepted, or 
are being accepted, by the Commission on a confidential basis pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). To the extent indicated in each case, the 
materials are not routinely available for public inspection. If the 
protection afforded is sufficient, it is unnecessary for persons 
submitting such materials to submit therewith a request for non-
disclosure pursuant to Sec. 0.459. A persuasive showing as to the 
reasons for inspection will be required in requests for inspection of 
such materials submitted under Sec. 0.461.
    (i) Financial reports submitted by licensees of broadcast stations 
pursuant to former Sec. 1.611 or by radio or television networks are not 
routinely available for inspection.
    (ii) Applications for equipment authorizations (type acceptance, 
type approval, certification, or advance approval of subscription 
television systems), and materials relating to such applications, are 
not routinely available for public inspection prior to the effective 
date of the authorization. The effective date of the authorization will, 
upon request, be deferred to a date no

[[Page 65]]

earlier than that specified by the applicant. Following the effective 
date of the authorization, the application and related materials 
(including technical specifications and test measurements) will be made 
available for inspection upon request (See Sec. 0.460). Portions of 
applications for equipment certification of scanning receivers and 
related materials will not be made available for inspection. This 
information includes that necessary to prevent modification of scanning 
receivers to receive Cellular Service frequencies, such as schematic 
diagrams, technical narratives describing equipment operation, and 
relevant design details.
    (iii) Information submitted in connection with audits, 
investigations and examination of records pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 220.
    (iv) Programming contracts between programmers and multichannel 
video programming distributors.
    (v) Prior to July 4, 1967, the rules and regulations provided that 
certain materials submitted to the Commission would not be made 
available for public inspection or provided assurance, in varying 
degrees, that requests for nondisclosure of certain materials would be 
honored. See, e.g., 47 CFR chapter I revised as of October 1, 1966, 
Secs. 0.417, 2.557, 5.204, 5.255, 15.70, 21.406, 80.33, 87.153, 89.215, 
91.208, 91.605 and 93.208. Materials submitted under these provisions 
are not routinely available for public inspection. To the extent that 
such materials were accepted on a confidential basis under the then 
existing rules, they are not routinely available for public inspection. 
The rules cited in this paragraph (d)(1)(v) were superseded by the 
provisions of this paragraph (d), effective July 4, 1967. Equipment 
authorization information accepted on a confidential basis between July 
4, 1967 and March 25, 1974, will not be routinely available for 
inspection and a persuasive showing as to the reasons for inspection of 
such information will be required in requests for inspection of such 
materials submitted under Sec. 0.461.
    (vi) The rates, terms and conditions in any agreement between a U.S. 
carrier and a foreign carrier that govern the settlement of U.S. 
international traffic, including the method for allocating return 
traffic, if the U.S. international route is exempt from the 
international settlements policy under Sec. 43.51(e)(3) of this Chapter.
    (2) Unless the materials to be submitted are listed in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section and the protection thereby afforded is adequate, 
it is important for any person who submits materials which he wishes 
withheld from public inspection under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) to submit 
therewith a request for non-disclosure pursuant to Sec. 0.459. If it is 
shown in the request that the materials contain trade secrets or 
commercial, financial or technical data which would customarily be 
guarded from competitors, the materials will not be made routinely 
available for inspection; and a persuasive showing as to the reasons for 
inspection will be required in requests for inspection submitted under 
Sec. 0.461. In the absence of a request for non-disclosure, the 
Commission may, in the unusual instance, determine on its own motion 
that the materials should not be routinely available for public 
inspection. Ordinarily, however, in the absence of such a request, 
materials which are submitted will be made available for inspection upon 
request pursuant to Sec. 0.461, even though some question may be present 
as to whether they contain trade secrets or like matter.
    (e) Interagency and intra-agency memorandums or letters, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(5). Interagency and intra-agency memorandums or letters and the 
work papers of members of the Commission or its staff will not be made 
available for public inspection, except in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 0.461. Only if it is shown in a request 
under Sec. 0.461 that such a communication would be routinely available 
to a private party through the discovery process in litigation with the 
Commission will the communication be made available for public 
inspection. Normally such papers are privileged and not available to 
private parties through the discovery process, since their disclosure 
would tend to restrain the commitment of ideas to writing, would tend to 
inhibit communication among Government personnel, and would, in some 
cases, involve premature disclosure of their contents.

[[Page 66]]

    (f) Personnel, medical and other files whose disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(6). (1) Under Executive Order 10561, 19 FR 5963, September 13, 
1954, 3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., page 205, the Commission maintains an 
Official Personnel Folder for each of its employees. Such folders are 
under the jurisdiction and control, and are a part of the records, of 
the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Except as provided in the rules 
of the Office of Personnel Management (5 CFR 294.701-294.703), such 
folders will not be made available for public inspection by the 
Commission. In addition, other records of the Commission containing 
private, personal or financial information concerning particular 
employees will be withheld from public inspection.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Information submitted to the Commission by applicants for 
commercial radio operator licenses concerning the character and mental 
or physical health of the applicant is available for inspection only 
under procedures set forth in Sec. 0.461. Except in this respect, or 
where other aspects of a similar private nature warrant nondisclosure, 
commercial radio operator application files are available for 
inspection.
    (g) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, to 
the extent that production of such records would:
    (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;
    (2) Deprive a person of a right to fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication;
    (3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source;
    (5) Disclose investigative techniques or procedures; or
    (6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7).

Sec. 0.458  Nonpublic information.

    Any person regulated by or practicing before the Commission coming 
into possession of written nonpublic information (including written 
material transmitted in electronic form) as described in Sec. 19.735-
203(a) of this chapter under circumstances where it appears that its 
release was inadvertent or otherwise unauthorized shall be obligated to 
return the information to the Commission's Office of Inspector General 
pursuant to that section. See 47 CFR 19.735-203.

[65 FR 66185, Nov. 3, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 0.459  Requests that materials or information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public inspection.

    (a) Any person submitting information or materials to the Commission 
may submit therewith a request that such information not be made 
routinely available for public inspection. (If the materials are 
specifically listed in Sec. 0.457, such a request is unnecessary.) A 
copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the 
materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If 
feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically 
separated from any materials to which the request does not apply; if 
this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request 
applies shall be identified.
    (b) Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for 
withholding the materials from inspection (see Sec. 0.457) and of the 
facts upon which those records are based, including:
    (1) Identification of the specific information for which 
confidential treatment is sought;
    (2) Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the 
information was submitted or a description of the circumstances giving 
rise to the submission;
    (3) Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial 
or financial, or contains a trade secret or is privileged;
    (4) Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a 
service that is subject to competition;

[[Page 67]]

    (5) Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in 
substantial competitive harm;
    (6) Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to 
prevent unauthorized disclosure;
    (7) Identification of whether the information is available to the 
public and the extent of any previous disclosure of the information to 
third parties;
    (8) Justification of the period during which the submitting party 
asserts that material should not be available for public disclosure; and
    (9) Any other information that the party seeking confidential 
treatment believes may be useful in assessing whether its request for 
confidentiality should be granted.
    (c) Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered.
    (d)(1) The Commission may defer acting on requests that materials or 
information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public 
inspection until a request for inspection has been made pursuant to 
Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 0.461. The information will be accorded confidential 
treatment, as provided for in Sec. 0.459(g) and Sec. 0.461, until the 
Commission acts on the confidentiality request and all subsequent appeal 
and stay proceedings have been exhausted. If a response in opposition to 
a confidentiality request is filed, the party requesting confidentiality 
may file a reply.
    (2) Requests which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section will be acted upon by the appropriate Bureau or 
Office Chief, who is directed to grant the request if it presents by a 
preponderance of the evidence a case for non-disclosure consistent with 
the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. If the 
request is granted, the ruling will be placed in the public file in lieu 
of the materials withheld from public inspection. A copy of the ruling 
shall be forwarded to the General Counsel.
    (e) If the materials are submitted voluntarily (i.e., absent any 
direction by the Commission), the person submitting them may request the 
Commission to return the materials without consideration if the request 
for confidentiality should be denied. In that event, the materials will 
ordinarily be returned (e.g., an application will be returned if it 
cannot be considered on a confidential basis). Only in the unusual 
instance where the public interest so requires will the materials be 
made available for public inspection. However, no materials submitted 
with a request for confidentiality will be returned if a request for 
inspection is filed under Sec. 0.461. If submission of the materials is 
required by the Commission and the request for confidentiality is 
denied, the materials will be made available for public inspection.
    (f) If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the Commission 
assumes no obligation to consider the need for non-disclosure but, in 
the unusual instance, may determine on its own motion that the materials 
should be withheld from public inspection. See Sec. 0.457(g).
    (g) If a request for confidentiality is denied, the person who 
submitted the request may, within 5 working days, file an application 
for review by the Commission. If the application for review is denied, 
the person who submitted the request will be afforded 5 working days in 
which to seek a judicial stay of the ruling. If these periods expire 
without action by the person who submitted the request, the materials 
will be returned to the person who submitted them or will be placed in a 
public file. Notice of denial and of the time for seeking review or a 
judicial stay will be given by telephone, with follow-up notice in 
writing. The first day to be counted in computing the time periods 
established in this subsection is the day after the date of oral notice. 
Materials will be accorded confidential treatment, as provided in 
Sec. 0.459(g) and Sec. 0.461, until the Commission acts on any timely 
applications for review of an order denying a request for 
confidentiality, and until a court acts on any timely motion for stay of 
such an order denying confidential treatment.
    (h) If the request is granted, the status of the materials is the 
same as that of materials listed in Sec. 0.457. Any person wishing to 
inspect them may submit a request for inspection under Sec. 0.461.

[[Page 68]]

    (i) Third party owners of materials submitted to the Commission by 
another party may participate in the proceeding resolving the 
confidentiality of the materials.

<R05>
Sec. 0.460  Requests for inspection of records which are routinely available for public inspection.

    (a) Sections 0.453 and 0.455 list those Commission records which are 
routinely available for public inspection and the places at which those 
records may be inspected. Subject to the limitations set out in this 
section and to the provisions of Sec. 0.466 and paragraph (l) of this 
section, a person who wants to inspect such records need only appear at 
the specified location and ask to see the records. Many such records 
also are available through the Commission's site on the World Wide Web, 
located at http://www.fcc.gov. Commission documents listed in Sec. 0.416 
are published in the FCC Record, and many such documents or summaries 
thereof are also published in the Federal Register.
    (b) A person who does not want a copy of the records must appear at 
the specified location during the office hours of the Commission and 
must inspect the records at that location. (Procedures governing 
requests for copies are set out in Sec. 0.465.) However, arrangements 
may be made in advance, by telephone or by correspondence, to make the 
records available for inspection on a particular date, and there are 
many circumstances in which such advance arrangements will save 
inconvenience. If the request is for a large number of documents, for 
example, a delay in collecting them is predictable. Current records may 
be in use by the staff when the request is made. Older records may have 
been forwarded to another location for storage.
    (c) The records in question must be reasonably described by the 
person requesting them so as to permit their location by staff 
personnel. The information needed to locate the records will vary, 
depending on the records requested. Advice concerning the kind of 
information needed to locate particular records will be furnished in 
advance upon request. Members of the public will not be given access to 
the area in which records are kept and will not be permitted to search 
the files.
    (d) If it appears that there will be an appreciable delay in 
locating or producing the records (as where a large number of documents 
is the subject of a single request or where an extended search for a 
document appears to be necessary), the request shall be submitted in 
writing, either in person or by mail.
    (e) Written requests shall be captioned ``REQUEST FOR INSPECTION OF 
RECORDS'', shall be dated, shall list the telephone number (if any) of 
the person making the request and for each document requested, shall set 
out all information known to the person making the request which would 
be helpful in identifying and locating the document. Written requests 
shall, in addition, specify the maximum search fee the person making the 
request is prepared to pay. (see Sec. 0.467)
    (f) Written requests shall be delivered or mailed directly to the 
chief of the organizational unit having custody of the records, as 
listed in Secs. 0.453 and0.455. If the request is enclosed in an 
envelope, the envelope shall be marked, ``REQUEST FOR INSPECTION OF 
RECORDS.''
    (g) When a written request is received by the custodian of the 
records, it will be date-stamped.
    (h) All requests limited to records listed in Secs. 0.453 and 0.455 
will be granted, subject to paragraph (k) of this section. Requests for 
records listed in those sections shall not be combined with requests for 
other records.
    (i) The records will be produced for inspection at the earliest 
possible time.
    (j) Records shall be inspected within 7 days after notice is given 
that they have been located and are available for inspection. After that 
period, they will be returned to storage and additional charges may be 
imposed for again producing them.
    (k) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the 
following provisions apply to the reports filed

[[Page 69]]

with the Commission pursuant to subpart E of part 19 of this chapter. 
(1) Such reports shall not be obtained or used:
    (i) For any unlawful purpose; (ii) for any commercial purpose, other 
than by news and communications media for dissemination to the general 
public; (iii) for determining or establishing the credit rating of any 
individual; or (iv) for use, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation 
of money for any political, charitable, or other purpose.
    (2) Such reports may not be made available to any person nor may any 
copy thereof be provided to any person except upon a written application 
by such person stating: (i) That person's name, occupation and address; 
(ii) the name and address of any other person or organization on whose 
behalf the inspection or copying is requested; and (iii) that such 
person is aware of the prohibitions on the obtaining or use of the 
report. Further, any such application for inspection shall be made 
available to the public throughout the period during which the report 
itself is made available to the public.

<R05>
Sec. 0.461  Requests for inspection of materials not routinely available for public inspection.

    Any person desiring to inspect Commission records which are not 
listed in Sec. 0.453 or Sec. 0.455 shall file a request for inspection 
meeting the requirements of this section.
    (a)(1) The records in question must be reasonably described by the 
person requesting them, so as to permit their location by staff 
personnel. See Sec. 0.460(c).
    (2) The person requesting records under this section may specify the 
form or format of the records to be produced.
    (b)(1) Requests shall be captioned ``Freedom of Information Act 
Request,'' shall be dated, shall list the telephone number (if any) of 
the person making the request and, for each document requested, shall 
set out all information known to the person making the request which 
would be helpful in identifying and locating the document.
    (2) The request shall, in addition, specify the maximum search fee 
the person making the request is prepared to pay (see Sec. 0.467).
    (c) If the records are of the kinds listed in Sec. 0.457 or if they 
have been withheld from inspection under Sec. 0.459, the request shall, 
in addition, contain a statement of the reasons for inspection and the 
facts in support thereof. In the case of other materials, no such 
statement need accompany the request; but the custodian of the records 
may require the submission of such a statement if he determines that the 
materials in question may lawfully be withheld from inspection.
    (d)(1) Requests shall be delivered or mailed to the Managing 
Director, sent by electronic mail to <foia@fcc.gov<ls-thn-eq>, or sent 
by facsimile. (For purposes of this section, the custodian of the 
records is the Chief of the appropriate Bureau or Office.)
    (2) If the request is enclosed in an envelope, the envelope shall be 
marked, ``Freedom of Information Act Request.''
    (3) An original and two copies of the request shall be submitted. If 
the request is for materials not open to routine public inspection under 
Sec. 0.457(d) or Sec. 0.459, or if a request for confidentiality is 
pending pursuant to Sec. 0.459, one copy of the request will be mailed 
by the custodian of the records to the person who originally submitted 
the materials to the Commission.
    (e) When the request is received by the Managing Director, it will 
be assigned to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Control Office, 
where it will be date-stamped and assigned to the custodian of the 
records.
    (f) Requests for inspection of records will be acted on as follows 
by the custodian of the records.
    (1) If the Commission is prohibited from disclosing the records in 
question, the request for inspection will be denied with a statement 
setting forth the specific grounds for denial.
    (2) If the records are the property of another agency, the request 
will be referred to that agency and the person

[[Page 70]]

who submitted the request will be so advised, with the reasons therefor.
    (3) If it is determined that the Commission does not have authority 
to withhold the records from public inspection, the request will be 
granted.
    (4) If it is determined that the Commission does have authority to 
withhold the records from public inspection, the considerations favoring 
disclosure and non-disclosure will be weighed in light of the facts 
presented, and the request will be granted, either conditionally or 
unconditionally, or denied.
    (5) If there is a statutory basis for withholding part of a document 
only from inspection, that part will be deleted and the remainder will 
be made available for inspection.
    (6) In locating and recovering records responsive to a FOIA request, 
only those records within the Commission's possession and control as of 
the date of its receipt of the request shall be considered.
    (g) The custodian of the records will make every effort to act on 
the request within 20 working days after it is received by the FOIA 
Control Office. If it is not possible to locate the records and to 
determine whether they should be made available for inspection within 20 
working days, the custodian may, in any of the following circumstances, 
extend the time for action by up to 10 working days:
    (1) It is necessary to search for and collect the requested records 
from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request.
    (2) It is necessary to search for, collect and appropriately examine 
a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded 
in a single request; or
    (3) It is necessary to consult with another agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two 
or more components of the Commission having substantial subject matter 
interest therein.


The custodian of the records will notify the requester in writing of any 
extension of time exercised pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. 
If it is not possible to locate the records and make the determination 
within the extended period, the person or persons who made the request 
will be provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so 
that it may be processed within the extended time limit, or an 
opportunity to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the 
request or a modified request, and asked to consent to an extension or 
further extension. If the requester agrees to an extension, the 
custodian of the records will confirm the agreement in a letter 
specifying the length of the agreed-upon extension. If he or she does 
not agree to an extension, the request will be denied, on the grounds 
that the custodian has not been able to locate the records and/or to 
make the determination within the period for a ruling mandated by the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. In that event, the custodian 
will continue to search for and/or assess the records and will advise 
the person who made the request of further developments; but that person 
may file an application for review by the Commission. When action is 
taken by the custodian of the records, written notice of the action will 
be given.
    (h)(1) Requesters who seek expedited processing of FOIA requests 
shall submit such requests, along with their FOIA requests, to the 
Managing Director, as described in Sec. 0.461(d). If the request is 
enclosed in an envelope, the envelope shall be marked ``Request for 
Expedited Proceeding--FOIA Request.'' An original and two copies of the 
request for expedition shall be submitted, but only one copy is 
necessary if submitted by electronic mail. When the request is received 
by the Managing Director, it, and the accompanying FOIA request, will be 
assigned to the FOIA Control Office, where it will be date-stamped and 
assigned to the custodian of records.
    (2) Expedited processing shall be granted to a requester 
demonstrating a compelling need that is certified by the requester to be 
true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.
    (3) For purposes of this section, compelling need means--

[[Page 71]]

    (i) That failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis 
could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information, there is an urgency to inform the public 
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
    (4)(i) Notice of the determination as to whether to grant expedited 
processing shall be provided to the requester by the custodian of 
records within 10 calendar days after receipt of the request by the FOIA 
Control Office. Once the determination has been made to grant expedited 
processing, the custodian shall process the FOIA request as soon as 
practicable.
    (ii) If a request for expedited processing is denied, the person 
seeking expedited processing may file an application for review within 
five working days after the date of the written denial. The application 
for review and the envelope containing it (if any) shall be captioned 
``Review of FOIA Expedited Proceeding Request.'' The application for 
review shall be delivered or mailed to the General Counsel. (For general 
procedures relating to applications for review, see Sec. 1.115 of this 
chapter.) The Commission shall act expeditiously on the application for 
review, and shall notify the custodian of records of the disposition of 
such an application for review.
    (i)(1) If a request for inspection of records submitted to the 
Commission in confidence under Sec. 0.457(d) or Sec. 0.459 is granted, 
an application for review of the action may be filed by the person who 
submitted the records to the Commission or by a third party owner of the 
records. The application for review and the envelope containing it (if 
any) shall be captioned ``Review of Freedom of Information Action.'' The 
application for review shall be filed within 10 working days after the 
date of the written ruling, shall be delivered or mailed to the General 
Counsel, and shall be served on the person who filed the request for 
inspection of records. The first day to be counted in computing the time 
period for filing the application for review is the day after the date 
of the written ruling. If an application for review is not filed within 
this period, the records will be produced for inspection. The person who 
filed the request for inspection of records may respond to the 
application for review within 10 working days after it is filed.
    (2) If the request for inspection of records submitted to the 
Commission in confidence under Sec. 0.457(d) or Sec. 0.459 is partially 
granted and partially denied, the person who submitted the records to 
the Commission, a third party owner of the records and the person who 
filed the request for inspection of those records may file an 
application for review within the 10 working days after the date of the 
written ruling. The application for review and the envelope containing 
it (if any) shall be captioned ``REVIEW OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 
ACTION.'' The application for review shall be delivered or mailed to the 
General Counsel. If either person files an application for review, it 
shall be served upon the other person.
    (3) If an application for review is denied, the person filing the 
application for review will be notified in writing and advised of their 
rights.
    (4) If an application for review filed by the person who submitted 
the records to the Commission or who owns the records is denied, or if 
the records are made available on review which were not initially made 
available, the person who submitted the records to the Commission or who 
owns the records will be afforded 10 working days from the date of the 
written ruling in which to move for a judicial stay of the Commission's 
action. The first day to be counted in computing the time period for 
seeking a judicial stay is the day after the date of the written ruling. 
If a motion for stay is not made within this period, the record will be 
produced for inspection.
    (j) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, an 
application for review of an initial action on a request for inspection 
may be filed only by the person who made the request. The application 
shall be filed within 30 days after the date of the written ruling by 
the custodian of records, and shall be

[[Page 72]]

captioned, ``Review of Freedom of Information Action.'' The envelope (if 
any) shall also be so captioned. The application shall be delivered or 
mailed to the General Counsel and shall be served on the person (if any) 
who originally submitted the materials to the Commission. That person 
may file a response within 10 working days after the application for 
review is filed. If the records are made available on review, the person 
who submitted them to the Commission (if any) will be afforded 10 
working days after the date of the written ruling to seek a judicial 
stay. See paragraph (i) of this section. The first day to be counted in 
computing the time period for filing the application for review or 
seeking a judicial stay is the day after the date of the written ruling. 
(For general procedures relating to applications for review, see 
Sec. 1.115 of this chapter.)
    (k) The Commission will make every effort to act on an application 
for review of an action on a request for inspection of records within 20 
working days after it is filed. See, however, paragraph (i) of this 
section. If it is not possible to locate the records and to determine 
whether they should be made available for inspection within 20 working 
days, the General Counsel may, in the following circumstances and to the 
extent time has not been extended under paragraphs (g) (1)(i), (ii), or 
(iii) of this section, extend the time for action up to 10 working days. 
(The total period of extensions taken under this paragraph and under 
paragraph (g) of this section without the consent of the person who 
submitted the request shall not exceed 10 working days.):
    (1) It is necessary to search for and collect the requested records 
from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) It is necessary to search for, collect and appropriately examine 
a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded 
in a single request; or
    (3) It is necessary to consult with another agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or 
more components of the Commission having substantial subject matter 
interest therein.

If these circumstances are not present or if it is not possible to 
locate the records and make the determination within the extended 
period, the person who made the request will be advised of his/her 
rights and asked to consent to an extension or further extension. If the 
requester or person who made the request agrees to an extension, the 
General Counsel will confirm the agreement in a letter specifying the 
length of the agreed-upon extension. If the requestor or person who made 
the request does not agree to an extension, the Commission will continue 
to search for and/or assess the record and will advise the person who 
made the request of further developments; but that person may file a 
complaint in an appropriate United States district court.
    (l) Subject to the application for review and judicial stay 
provisions of paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, if the request is 
granted, the records will be produced for inspection at the earliest 
possible time.
    (m) Staff orders and letters denying requests for inspection are 
signed by the official (or officials) who give final approval of their 
contents. If a request is denied by the Commission, notice of denial 
will set forth the names of the Commissioners participating in the 
decision.
    (n) Records shall be inspected within 7 days after notice is given 
that they have been located and are available for inspection. After that 
period, they will be returned to storage, and additional charges may be 
imposed for again producing them.

Sec. 0.463  Demand by competent authority for the production of documents or testimony concerning information contained therein.

    (a) In the event that a demand (subpoena, order or other demand) is 
made by a court or other competent authority outside the Commission for 
the production of records or files or for testimony concerning 
information contained therein, the Managing Director shall promptly be 
advised of such demand, the nature of the papers or information sought, 
and all other relevant facts and circumstances. The Commissioin will 
thereupon issue such instructions as it may deem advisable.
    (b) Unless specifically authorized to produce such records or files 
or to testify with respect thereto, any officer or employee of the 
Commission who is served with a demand for the production of records or 
files or testimony concerning the same, shall appear in response to the 
demand and respectfully decline to produce such records or files or to 
testify concerning them, basing the refusal upon this rule.

<R05>
Sec. 0.465  Request for copies of materials which are available, or made available, for public inspection.

    (a) The Commission awards a contract to a commercial duplication 
firm to make copies of Commission records and offer them for sale to the 
public. In addition to the charge for copying, the contractor may charge 
a search fee for extracting the requested documents from the 
Commission's files.

    Note to paragraph (a):
    The name, address, telephone number, and schedule of fees for the 
current duplication contractor are published at the time of contract 
award of renewal in a Public Notice and periodically thereafter. 
Questions regarding this information should be directed to the Reference 
Information Center of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau.

    (b) The Commission awards a contract to a commercial firm to 
transcribe Commission proceedings in which a verbatim record is kept and 
tooffer copies of the transcript for sale to the public. Except as 
authorized by the Commission, the firm is required to retain the 
capacity to furnish copies of the transcript for a period of 5 years, 
and may retain that capacity for a longer period, even though another 
firm is currently transcribing Commission proceedings. Requests for 
copies of the transcript of the current proceedings should be directed 
to the current contractor. Requests for transcripts of older proceedings 
will be forwarded by the Commission to the firm which made the 
transcript in question; and the names of contracting firms for past 
years will be furnished upon request.

    Note to paragraph (b):
    The name, address, telephone number, and schedule of fees for the 
current transcription contractor are maintained by the Office of the 
Secretary in the Managing Director's Office.

    (c)(1) Contractual arrangements which have been entered into with 
commercial firms, as described in this section, do not in any way limit 
the right of the public to inspect Commission records or to extract 
therefrom whatever information may be desired. Coin-operated and debit 
card copy machines are available for use by the public.
    (2) The Commission has reserved the right to make copies of its 
records for its own use or for the use of other agencies of the U.S. 
Government. When it serves the regulatory or financial interests of the 
U.S. Government, the Commission will make and furnish copies of its 
records free of charge. In other circumstances, however, if it should be 
necessary for the Commission to make and furnish copies of its records 
for the use of others, the fee for this service shall be 17 cents per 
page. For copies prepared with other media, such as computer tapes, 
microfiche or videotape, the charge will be the actual direct cost 
including operator time. Requests for copying should be accompanied by a 
statement specifying the maximum copying fee the person making the 
request is prepared to pay. If the Commission estimates that copying 
charges are likely to exceed $25 or the amount which the requester has 
indicated that he/she is prepared to pay, then it shall notify the 
requester of the

[[Page 74]]

estimated amount of fees. Such a notice shall offer the requester the 
opportunity to confer with Commission personnel with the object of 
revising or clarifying the request.

    Note: The criterion considered in acting on a waiver request is 
whether ``waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest 
because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily 
benefiting the general public.'' 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A). The following 
factors are relevant in applying that criterion: the number of persons 
to be benefited, the significance of the benefit, the private interest 
of the requester which the release may further, the usefulness of the 
materials to be released to the general public and the likelihood that a 
tangible public benefit will be realized. (See Attorney General's 1974 
FOI Amdts. Memorandum, at 15.)

    (3) Requests for copies by representatives of foreign governments or 
persons residing in foreign countries shall be submitted to the General 
Counsel and will be reviewed by the General Counsel under criteria 
established by the Department of Commerce for controlling the export of 
technical data.
    (4) Certified Documents. Copies of documents which are available or 
made available, for inspection under Secs. 0.451 through 0.465, will be 
prepared and certified, under seal, by the Secretary, or for documents 
located in the Commission's Gettysburg, Pennsylvania Office by his 
deputy. Requests shall be in writing, specifying the exact documents, 
the number of copies desired, and the date on which they will be 
required. The request shall allow a reasonable time for the preparation 
and certification of copies. The fee for preparing copies shall be the 
same as thatcharged by the Commission as described in Sec. 0.465(c)(2). 
The fee for certification shall be $10 for each document.
    (d)(1) Computer maintained data bases produced by the Commission may 
be obtained from the FCC's internet web site at www.fcc.gov.

    Note: The Commission awards a contract to provide the public with 
direct electronic access to a portion of the non-Government Master 
Frequency File data base released for access and residing on the 
contractor's computer system. The name, address, telephone number, and 
schedule of fees for the current contractor are published annually at 
the time of contract award or renewal in a Public notice. This 
information may be obtained from the Office of Congressional and Public 
Affairs, Consumer Assistance and Small Business Division, Telephone 
(202) 632-7000.

    (2) Copies of computer generated data stored as paper printouts or 
on microfiche may also be obtained from the Commission's duplicating 
contractor (see paragraph (a) of this section).
    (d)(3) Copies of computer source programs and associated 
documentation produced by the Commission shall be obtained from the 
Office of the Managing Director.
    (e) This section has no application to printed publications, which 
may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents or private firms 
(see Secs. 0.411 through 0.420). Nor does it apply to application forms 
or information bulletins, which are prepared for the use and information 
of the public and are available upon request (see Secs. 0.421 and 
0.423).
    (f) Anyone requesting copies of documents pursuant to this section 
may select either the Commission or the contractor to fulfill the 
request. If a request goes directly to the contractor, the requester 
will be charged by the contractor pursuant to the price list set forth 
in the latest contract. If a request goes directly to the Commission, it 
shall be sent to the Office of the Managing Director for appropriate 
processing according to the fee standards established under the FOIA.

<R05>
Sec. 0.466  Definitions.

    (a) For the purpose of Secs. 0.467 and 0.468, the following 
definitions shall apply:
    (1) The term direct costs means those expenditures which the 
Commission actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in case 
of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA 
request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the 
work (the basic rate of pay

[[Page 75]]

for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), and 
the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct 
costs are overhead expenses, such as costs of space, and heating or 
lighting the facility in which the records are stored.
    (2) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material contained within documents. Such activity 
should be distinguished, however, from ``review'' of material in order 
to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section).
    (3) The term review refers to the process of examining documents 
located in response to a commercial use request (see paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section) to determine whether any portion of a document located is 
exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any documents for 
disclosure, e.g., performing such functions that are necessary to excise 
them or otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time 
spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application 
of FOIA exemptions.
    (4) The term commercial use request refers to a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial interests of the requester. In determining whether a 
requester properly falls within this category, the Commission shall 
determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. 
Where the Commission has reasonable cause to question the use to which a 
requester will put the documents sought, or where that use is not clear 
from the request itself, the Commission shall seek additional 
clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
    (5) The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution or graduate 
higher education, an institution of professional education and an 
institution of vocational education, which operates a program or 
programs of scholarly research.
    (6) The term non-commercial scientific institution refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is 
referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of 
which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (7) The term representative of the news media refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio 
stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of 
periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as 
disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for 
purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not 
intended to be all inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news 
delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through 
telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included 
in this category. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists, they may be 
regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a 
solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even 
though not actually employed by it.

[53 FR 39093, Oct. 5, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 0.467  Search and review fees.

    (a)(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, an hourly fee 
shall be charged for recovery of the full, allowable direct costs of 
searching for and reviewing records requested under Sec. 0.460(e) or 
Sec. 0.461, unless such fees are precluded or waived pursuant to 
Sec. 0.470. The fee is based on the grade level of the employee(s) who 
conduct(s) the search or review, as specified in the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Grade                              Hourly fee

GS-11......................................................        31.22
GS-12......................................................        37.42
GS-13......................................................        44.50
GS-14......................................................        52.58
GS-15......................................................        61.85
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note: These fees will be modified periodically to correspond with 
modifications in the rate of pay approved by Congress.
    (2) The fees in paragraph (a) (1) of this section were computed at 
Step 5 of each grade level based on the General Schedule effective 
January 2003 and include 20 percent for personnel benefits.
    (b) Search fees may be assessed for time spent searching, even if 
the Commission fails to locate the records or if the records are 
determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (c) The Commission shall charge only for the initial review, i.e., 
the review undertaken initially when the Commission analyzes the 
applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record. The 
Commission shall not charge for review at the appeal level of an 
exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records 
withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not 
to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other 
exemptions not previously considered. The costs of such a subsequent 
review, under these circumstances, are properly assessable.
    (d) The fee charged will not exceed an amount based on the time 
typically required to locate records of the kind requested.
    (e) If the Commission estimates that search charges are likely to 
exceed $25 or the amount which the requester indicated he/she is 
prepared to pay, then it shall notify the requester of the estimated 
amount of fees. Such a notice shall offer the requester the opportunity 
to confer with Commission personnel with the object of revising or 
clarifying the request.
    (f) When the search has been completed, the custodian of the records 
will give notice of the charges incurred to the person who made the 
request.
    (g) The fee shall be paid to the Financial Management Division, 
Office of Managing Director, or as otherwise directed by the Commission.
    (h) Records shall be inspected within 7 days after notice is given 
that they have been located and are available for inspection. After that 
period, they will be returned to storage, and additional charges may be 
imposed for again producing them.

Sec. 0.468  Interest.

    Interest shall be charged those requesters who fail to pay the fees 
charged. The agency will begin assessing interest charges on the amount 
billed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing 
was sent. The date on which the payment is received by the agency will 
determine whether and how much interest is due. The interest shall be 
set at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

[53 FR 39094, Oct. 5, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 0.469  Advance payments.

    (a)(1) The Commission may not require advance payment of estimated 
FOIA fees except as provided in subsection (a)(2) or where the 
Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges that a 
requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed$250.00 and the 
requester has no history of payment. Where allowable charges are likely 
to exceed $250.00 and the requester has a history of prompt payment of 
FOIA fees the Commission may notify the requester of the estimated cost 
and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment.
    (2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in 
a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), the 
Commission may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus 
any applicable interest as provided in Sec. 0.468, and to make an 
advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the 
Commission begins to process a new request or a pending request from 
that requester.

[[Page 77]]

    (3) When the Commission acts under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this 
section, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) 
of the FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 
20 working days from receipt of appeals from initial denials, plus 
permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after the 
agency has received the fee payments described above.
    (b) [Reserved]

[53 FR 39094, Oct. 5, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 0.470  Assessment of fees.

    (a)(1) Commercial use requesters. When the Commission receives a 
request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that 
recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing and duplicating 
the records sought pursuant to Secs. 0.466 and 0.467, above.
    (2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters 
and requesters who are representatives of the news media. The Commission 
shall provide documents to requesters in these categories for the cost 
of reproduction only, pursuant to Sec. 0.465 above, excluding 
reproduction charges for the first 100 pages, provided however, that 
requesters who are representatives of the news media shall be entitled 
to a reduced assessment of charges only when the request is for the 
purpose of disseminating information.
    (3) All other requesters. The Commission shall charge requesters who 
do not fit into any of the categories above fees which cover the full, 
reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are 
responsive to the request, pursuant to Secs. 0.467 and 0.465 above, 
except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours 
of search time shall be furnished without charge.
    (b)(1) The 100 page restriction on assessment of reproduction fees 
in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section refers to 100 paper 
copies of a standard size, which will normally be ``8\1/2\ x 11'' or 
``11 x 14,'' or microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or 100 
pages of computer printout. Requesters will not be entitled to 100 
microfiche.
    (2) When the agency reasonably believes that a requester or group of 
requesters is attempting to segregate a request into a series of 
separate individual requests for the purpose of evading the assessment 
of fees, the agency will aggregate any such requests and assess charges 
accordingly.
    (c) When a requester believes he is entitled to a restricted fee 
assessment pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3), of this section , 
or a waiver pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the requester 
must include, in his original FOIA request, a statement explaining with 
specificity, the reasons demonstrating that he/she qualifies for a 
restricted fee or a fee waiver. Included in this statement should be a 
certification that the information will not be used to further the 
commercial interests of the requester.

    Note: Anyone requesting a restricted fee must submit the request 
directly to the Commission and not to the contractor who will provide 
documents only at the contract price.

    (d) If the Commission reasonably believes that a commercial interest 
exists, based on the information provided pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the requester shall be so notified and given an additional 
5 working days to provide further information to justify receiving a 
restricted fee. During this time period, the materials will be available 
for inspection to the extent that the time period exceeds the 10 or 20 
day time period for responding to FOIA requests, as appropriate.
    (e) Copying, search and review charges shall be waived or reduced by 
the General Counsel, when ``disclosure of the information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the government 
and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' 5 
U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).
    (f) The Commission shall not assess any fees if the routine cost of 
collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.

    Executive Order 12356 requires that information relating to national 
security be protected against unauthorized disclosure as long as 
required by national security considerations. The Order also provides 
that all information classified under Executive Order 12356 or

Commission, the Managing Director shall assign the request to the 
appropriate bureau or office for action.
    (c) Requests related to information, either derivatively classified 
by the Commission or originally classified by another agency, shall be 
forwarded, together with a copy of the record, to the originating 
agency. The transmittal may contain a recommendation for action.


<R05>
Sec. 0.504  Processing requests for declassification.

    (a) Responses to mandatory declassification review requests shall be

request. A final determination shall be made within one year from the 
date of receipt of the request, except in unusual circumstances.
    (b) Upon a determination by the bureau or office that the requested 
material originally classified by the Commission no longer warrants 
protection, it shall be declassified and made available to the 
requester, unless withholding is otherwise authorized under law.
    (c) If the information may not be declassified or released in whole 
or in part, the requester shall be notified asto the reasons for the 
denial, given notice of the right to appeal the denial to the 
Classification Review Committee, and given notice that such an appeal 
must be filed within 60 days of the date of denial in order to be 
considered.
    (d) The Commission's Classification Review Committee, consisting of 
the

Managing Director (Chairman), the General Counsel or his designee, and 
the Chief, Internal Review and Security Division, shall have authority 
to act, within 30 days, upon all appeals regarding denials of requests 
for mandatory declassification of Commission-originated classifications. 
The Committee shall be authorized to overrule previous determinations in 
whole or in part when, in its judgment, continued classification is no 
longer required. If the Committee determines that continued 
classification is required under the criteria of the Order, the 
requester shall be promptly notified and advised that an application for 
review may be filed with the Commission pursuant to 47 CFR 1.115.

    (h) The agency procedures whereby an individual can be notified how 
access can be gained to any record pertaining to that individual 
contained in a system of records, and the procedure for correcting or 
contesting its contents; and
    (i) The categories of sources of records in the system.

(Secs. 4(i) and 303(n), Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 
U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(n); 47 CFR 0.231(d))

<R05>
Sec. 0.553  New uses of information.

    Before establishing a new routine use of a system of records, the 
Commission will publish a notice in the Federal Register of its 
intention to do so, and will provide at least 30 days for public comment 
on such use. The notice will contain:
    (a) The name of the system of records for which the new routine use 
is to be established;
    (b) The authority for the system;
    (c) The categories of records maintained;
    (d) The proposed routine use(s); and
    (e) The categories of recipients for each proposed routine use.


<R05>
Sec. 0.554  Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records in a system of records.

    (a) Upon request, the Commission will notify individuals as to 
whether it maintains information about them in a system of records and, 
subject to the provisons of Sec. 0.555(b), will disclose the substance 
of such information to that individual. In order to properly request 
notification or access to record information, reference must be made to 
the Notice described in Sec. 0.552. A table of contents, which is 
alphabetized by bureau or office, precedes the system descriptions and 
allows members of the public to easily identify record systems of 
interest to them. An individual may inquire into information contained 
in any or all systems of records described in the Notice. However, each 
inquiry shall be limited to information from systems located within a 
single bureau or office and shall be addressed to that bureau or office.
    (b) Reasonable identification is required of all individuals making 
requests pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in order to assure 
that disclosure of any information is made to the proper person.
    (1) Individuals who choose to register a request for information in 
person may verify their identity by showing any two of the following: 
social security card; drivers license; employee identification card; 
medicare card; birth certificate; bank credit card; or other positive 
means of identification. Documents incorporating a picture and/or 
signature of the individual shall be produced if possible. If an 
individual cannot provide suitable documentation for identification, 
that individual will be required to sign an identity statement 
stipulating that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to 
records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a 
fine of up to $5,000.

    Note: An individual's refusal to disclose his social security number 
shall not constitute cause in and of itself, for denial of a request.

    (2) All requests for record information sent by mail shall be signed 
by the requestor and shall include his printed name, current address and 
telephone number (if any). Commission officials receiving such requests 
will attempt to verify the identity of the requestor by comparing his or 
her signature to those in the record. If the record contains no 
signatures and if positive identification cannot be made on the basis of 
other information submitted, the requestor will be required to sign 
anidentity statement and stipulate that knowingly or willfully seeking 
or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretense 
is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.

[[Page 82]]

    (3) If positive identification cannot be made on the basis of the 
information submitted, and if data in the record is so sensitive that 
unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual 
to whom the record pertains, the Commission reserves the right to deny 
access to the record pending the production of additional more 
satisfactory evidence of identity.

    Note: The Commission will require verification of identity only 
where it has determined that knowledge of the existence of record 
information or its substance is not subject to the public disclosure 
requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as 
amended.

    (c) All requests for notification of the existence of record 
information or for access to such information shall be delivered to the 
business address of the system manager responsible for the system of 
records in question, except that requests relating to official personnel 
records shall be addressed to the Associate Managing Director--Personnel 
Management. Such addresses can be found in the Federal Register Notice 
described in Sec. 0.552.
    (d) A written acknowledgement of receipt of a request for 
notification and/or access will be provided within 10 days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) to the individual making 
the request. Such an acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any 
additional information needed to locate a record. A search of all 
systems of records identified in the individual's request will be made 
to determine if any records pertaining to the individual are contained 
therein, and the individual will be notified of the search results as 
soon as the search has been completed. Normally, a request will be 
processed and the individual notified of the search results within 30 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from the date 
the inquiry is received. However, in some cases, as where records have 
to be recalled from Federal Record Centers, notification may be delayed. 
If it is determined that a record pertaining to the individual making 
the request does exist, the notification will state approximately when 
the record will be available for personal review. No separate 
acknowledgement is required if the request can be processed and the 
individual notified of the search results within the ten-day period.

(Secs. 4(i) and 303(n), Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 
U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(n); 47 CFR 0.231(d))

<R05>
Sec. 0.555  Disclosure of record information to individuals.

    (a) Individuals having been notified that the Commission maintains a 
record pertaining to them in a system of records may request access to 
such record in one of three ways: by in person inspection at the system 
location; by transfer of the record to a nearer location; or by mail.
    (1) Individuals who wish to review their records at the system 
location must do so during regular Commission business hours (8:00 a.m.-
4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday). For personal and administrative 
convenience, individuals are urged to arrange to review a record by 
appointment. Preferences as to specific dates and times can be made by 
writing or calling the system manager responsible for the system of 
records in question at least two days in advance of the desired 
appointment date, and by providing a telephone number where the 
individual can be reached during the day in case the appointment must be 
changed. Verification of identity is required as in Sec. 0.554(b)(1) 
before access will be granted an individual appearing in person. 
Individuals may be accompanied by a person of his or her own choosing 
when reviewing a record. However, in such cases, a written statement 
authorizing discussion of their record in the presence of a Commission 
representative having physical custody of the records.
    (2) Individuals may request that a record be transferred to a 
Commission field office or installation in the vicinity of his or her 
home and that access be granted at that location. The addresses of 
Commission field offices are listed in Sec. 0.121. A request to 
transferrecords must specify the exact location where the records should 
be sent and a telephone number to call when the information is available 
for

[[Page 83]]

review at the field location. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding 
personal appointments, verification of identity accompanying persons, 
and disclosure of original records applies equally to this paragraph.
    (3) Individuals may request that copies of records be sent directly 
to them. In such cases, individuals must verify their identity as 
Sec. 0.554(b)(2) and provide an accurate return address. Records shall 
be sent only to that address.
    (b) The disclosure of record information under this section is 
subject to the following limitations:
    (1) Records containing medical information pertaining to an 
individual are subject to individual access under this section unless, 
in the judgment of the system manager having custody of the records 
after consultation with a medical doctor, access to such record 
information could have an adverse impact on the individual. In such 
cases, a copy of the record will be delivered to a medical doctor named 
by the individual.
    (2) Classified material, investigative material compiled for law 
enforcement purposes, investigatory material compiled solely for 
determining suitability for Federal employment or access to classified 
information, and certain testing or examination material shall be 
removed from the records to the extent permitted in the Privacy Act of 
1974, 5 U.S.C. 552(a). Section 0.561 of this subpart sets forth the 
systems of records maintained by the Commission which are either totally 
or partially exempt from disclosure under this subparagraph.
    (c) No fee will be imposed if the number of pages of records 
requested is 25 or less. Requests involving more than 25 pages shall be 
submitted to the duplicating contractor (see Sec. 0.456(a)).
    (d) The provisions of this section in no way give an individual the 
right to access any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a 
civil action or proceeding.
    (e) In the event that a determination is made denying an individual 
access to records pertaining to that individual for any reason, such 
individual may either:
    (1) Seek administrative review of the adverse determination. Such a 
request shall be in writing and should be addressed to the system 
manager who made the initial decision. In addition, the request for 
review shall state specifically why the initial decision should be 
reversed.
    (2) Seek judicial relief in the district courts of the United States 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(B) of the Act.

(Secs. 4(i) and 303(n), Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47

<R05>
Sec. 0.556  Request to correct or amend records.

    (a) An individual may request the amendment of information contained 
in their record. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the 
request to amend should be submitted in writing to the system manager 
responsible for the records. Requests to amend the official personnel 
records of active FCC employees should be submitted to the Associate 
Managing Director--Human Resources Management, 445 12th Street, SW., 
Washington, D.C. 20554. Requests to amend official personnel records of 
former FCC employees should be sent to the Assistant Director for Work 
Force Information, Compliance and Investigations Group, Office of 
Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20415. Any 
request to amend should contain as a minimum:
    (1) The identity verification information required by 
Sec. 0.554(b)(2) and the information needed to locate the record as 
required by Sec. 0.554(a).
    (2) A brief description of the item or items of information to be 
amended; and
    (3) The reason for the requested change.
    (b) A written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend a 
record will be provided within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal public holidays) to the individualrequesting the amendment. 
Such an acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional 
information needed to make a determination.

[[Page 84]]

There will be no acknowledgement if the request can be reviewed, 
processed, and the individual notified of compliance or denial within 
the 10 day period.
    (c) The responsible system manager, or in the case of official 
personnel records of active FCC employees, the Associate Managing 
Director--Personnel Management, shall (normally within 30 days) take one 
of the following actions regarding a request to amend:
    (1) If the system manager agrees that an amendment to the record is 
warranted, the system manager shall:
    (i) So advise the individual in writing;
    (ii) Correct the record in compliance with the individual's request; 
and
    (iii) If an accounting of disclosures has been made, advise all 
previous recipients of the fact that the record has been corrected and 
of the substance of the correction.
    (2) If the system manager, after an initial review, does not agree 
that all or any portion of the record merits amendment, the system 
manager shall:
    (i) Notify the individual in writing of such refusal to amend and 
the reasons therefore;
    (ii) Advise the individual that further administrative review of the 
initial decision by the full Commission may be sought pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 0.557. (In cases where the request to amend 
involves official personnel records, review is available exclusively 
from the Assistant Director for Work Force Information, Compliance and 
Investigations Group, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 
20415; and
    (iii) Inform the individual of the procedures for requesting 
Commission review pursuant to Sec. 0.557.
    (d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the 
system manager shall assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or 
completeness of the record in light of each data element placed into 
controversy and the use of the record in making decisions that could 
possibly affect the individual. Moreover, the system manager shall 
ajudge the merits of any request to delete information based on whether 
or not the information in controversy is both relevant and necessary to 
accomplish a statutory purpose required of the Commission by law or 
executive order of the President.

Sec. 0.557  Administrative review of an initial decision not to amend a record.

    (a) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the determination not 
to amend a record consistent with their request to seek further 
administrative review by the full Commisison. Such a request shall be in 
writing and should be addressed to either the system manager who made 
the initial adverse decision, or, in the case of official personnel 
records of active FCC employees, to the Assistant Director for Work 
Force Information, Compliance and Investigations Group, Office of 
Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415. Any request for 
administrative review must:
    (1) Clearly identify the questions presented for review (e.g., 
whether the record information in question is, in fact, accurate; 
whether information subject to a request to delete is relevant and 
necessary to the purpose for which it is maintained);
    (2) Specify with particularity why the decision reached by the 
system manager is erroneous or inequitable; and
    (3) Clearly state how the record should be amended or corrected.
    (b) The Commission shall conduct an independent review of the record 
in controversy using the standards of review set out in Sec. 0.556(d). 
It may seek such additional information as is necessary to make its 
determination. Final administrative review shall be completed not later 
than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) 
from the date on which the individual requests such review unless the 
Chairman determines that a fair and equitable review cannot be made 
within the 30 day period. Insuch event, the individual will be informed 
in writing of the reasons for the delay and the approximate date on

[[Page 85]]

which the review is expected to be completed.
    (c) If upon review of the record in controversy the Commission 
agrees with the individual that the requested amendment is warranted, 
the Commission will proceed in accordance with Sec. 0.556(c)(1) (i) 
through (iii).
    (d) If after the review, the Commission also refuses to amend the 
record as requested, it shall:
    (1) Notify the individual in writing of its refusal and the reasons 
therefore;
    (2) Advise the individual that a concise statement of the reasons 
for disagreeing with the decision of the Commisison may be filed;
    (3) Inform the individual:
    (i) That such a statement should be signed and addressed to the 
system manager having custody of the record in question;
    (ii) That the statement will be made available to any one to whom 
the record is subsequently disclosed together with, at the Commission's 
discretion, a summary of its reasons for refusing to amend the record; 
and
    (iii) That prior recipients of the record will be provided a copy of 
the statement of dispute to the extent that an accounting of such 
disclosures is maintained; and
    (4) Advise the individual that judicial review of the Commisison's 
decision not to amend the record in any district court of the United 
States is available.

Sec. 0.601  Definitions.

    For purposes of this section:
    (a) The term agency means:
    (1) The Commission,
    (2) A board of Commissioners (see Sec. 0.212),
    (3) The Telecommunications Committee (see Sec. 0.215), and

Commissioners, where such deliberations determine or result in the joint 
conduct or disposition of official agency business, except that the term 
does not include deliberations to decide whether to announce a meeting 
with less than seven days notice, or whether a meeting should be open or 
closed. (The term includes conference telephone calls, but does not 
include the separate consideration of Commission business by 
Commissioners.) For purposes of this subpart each item on the agenda of 
a meeting is considered a meeting or a portion of a meeting.

    (a) All meetings shall be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 0.603, every portion of every meeting

the official record, will receive no consideration, and no further 
action by the Commission will be taken thereon.
    (d) Deliberations, discussions, comments or observations made during 
the course of open meetings do not themselves constitute action of the

of discussion and may not reflect the ultimate position of a 
Commissioner.

<R05>
Sec. 0.603  Bases for closing a meeting to the public.

    Except where the agency finds that the public interest requires 
otherwise, an agency or advisory committee meeting may be closed to the 
public, and information pertaining to such meetings which would 
otherwise be disclosed to the public under Sec. 0.605 may be withheld, 
if the agency determines that an open meeting or the disclosure of such 
information is likely to:
    (a) Disclose matters that: (1) Are specifically authorized under 
criteria established by executive order to be kept secret in the 
interest of national defense or foreign policy, and (2) are in fact 
properly classified pursuant to such executive order (see 
Sec. 0.457(a));
    (b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency (see Sec. 0.457(b));
    (c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure, by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552). 
Provided, That such statute (1) requires that the matters be withheld 
from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, 
or (2) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld (see Sec. 0.457(c));
    (d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential (see 
Sec. 0.457(d));
    (e) Involve accusing any person of a crime or formally censuring any 
person;
    (f) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (see 
Sec. 0.457(f));
    (g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such 
records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or 
information would (1) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (2) 
deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication, (3) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, (4) disclose the identity of a confidential source, and, in the 
case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source, (5) disclose investigative 
techniques and procedures, or (6) endanger the life or physical safety 
of law enforcement personnel;
    (h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions;
    (i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency 
action, except where the agency has already disclosed to the public the 
content or nature of the disclosed action, or where the agency is 
required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to 
taking final agency action on such proposal; or
    (j) Specifically concern the agency's issuance of a subpoena, or the 
agency's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a 
foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the 
initiation, conduct, or disposition by the agency of a particular case 
of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures specified in 5 
U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after 
opportunity for hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 0.605  Procedures for announcing meetings.

    (a) Notice of all open and closed meetings will be given.
    (b) The meeting notice will be submitted for publication in the 
Federal Register on or before the date on which the announcement is 
made. Copies will be available in the Press and News Media Division on 
the day the announcement is made. Copies will also be attached to ``FCC 
Actions Alert'', which is mailed to certain individuals and groups who 
have demonstrated an interest in representing the public in Commission 
proceedings.
    (c)(1) If the agency staff determines that a meeting should be open 
to the public, it will, at least one week prior to the meeting, announce 
in writing the time, place and subject matter of the meeting, that it is 
to be open to the public, and the name and phone number of the Chief, 
Press and News Media Division, who has been designated to respond to 
requests for information about the meeting.
    (2) If the staff determines that a meeting should be closed to the 
public, it will refer the matter to the General Counsel, who will 
certify that there is (or is not) a legal basis for closing the meeting 
to the public. Following action by the General Counsel, the matter may 
be referred to the agency for a vote on the question of closing the 
meeting (See Sec. 0.606).
    (d)(1) If the question of closing a meeting is considered by the 
agency but no vote is taken, the agency will, at least one week prior to 
the meeting, announce in writing the time, place and subject matter of 
the meeting, that it is to be open to the public, and the name and phone 
number of the Chief, Press and News Media Division.
    (2) If a vote is taken, the agency will, in the same announcement 
and within one day after the vote, make public the vote of each 
participating Commissioner.
    (3) If the vote is to close the meeting, the agency will also, in 
that announcement, set out a full written explanation of its action, 
including the applicable provision(s) of Sec. 0.603, and a list of 
persons expected to attend the meeting, including Commission personnel, 
together with their affiliations. The Commissioners, their assistants, 
the General Counsel, the Executive Director, the Chief, Press and News 
Media Division, and the Secretary are expected to attend all Commission 
meetings. The appropriate Bureau or Office Chief and Division Chief are 
expected to attend meetings which relate to their responsibilities (see 
subpart A of this part).
    (4) If a meeting is closed, the agency may omit from the 
announcement information usually included, if and to the extent that it 
finds that disclosure would be likely to have any of the consequences 
listed in Sec. 0.603.
    (e) If the prompt and orderly conduct of agency business requires 
that a meeting be held less than one week after the announcement of the 
meeting, or before that announcement, the agency will issue the 
announcement at the earliest practicable time. In addition to other 
information, the announcement will contain the vote of each member of 
the agency who participated in the decision to give less than seven days 
notice, and the particular reason for that decision.
    (f) If, after announcement of a meeting, the time or place of the 
meeting is changed or the meeting is cancelled, the agency will announce 
the change at the earliest practicable time.
    (g) If the subject matter or the determination to open or close a 
meeting is changed, the agency will publicly announce the change and the 
vote of each member at the earliest practicable time. The announcement 
will contain a finding that agency business requires the change and that 
no earlier announcement of the change was possible.

Sec. 0.606  Procedures for closing a meeting to the public.

    (a) For every meeting closed under Sec. 0.603, the General Counsel 
will certify that there is a legal basis for closing the meeting to the 
public and will state each relevant provision of Sec. 0.603. The staff 
of the agency will refer the matter to the General Counsel for 
certification before it is referred to the

[[Page 89]]

agency for a vote on closing the meeting. Certifications will be 
retained in apublic file in the Minute and Rules Branch, Office of the 
Secretary.
    (b) The agency will vote on the question of closing a meeting.
    (1) If a member of the agency requests that a vote be taken;
    (2) If the staff recommends that a meeting be closed and one member 
of the agency requests that a vote be taken; or
    (3) If a person whose interests may be directly affected by a 
meeting requests the agency to close the meeting for any of the reasons 
listed in Sec. 0.603 (e), (f) or (g), or if any person requests that a 
closed meeting be opened, and a member of the agency requests that a 
vote be taken. (Such requests may be filed with the Secretary at any 
time prior to the meeting and should briefly state the reason(s) for 
opening or closing the meeting. To assure that they reach the Commission 
for consideration prior to the meeting, they should be submitted at the 
earliest practicable time and should be called specifically to the 
attention of the Secretary--in person or by telephone. It will be 
helpful if copies of the request are furnished to the members of the 
agency and the General Counsel. The filing of a request shall not stay 
the holding of a meeting.)
    (c) A meeting will be closed to the public pursuant to Sec. 0.603 
only by vote of a majority of the entire membership of the agency. The 
vote of each participating Commissioner will be recorded. No 
Commissioner may vote by proxy.
    (d) A separate vote will be taken before any meeting is closed to 
the public and before any information is withheld from the meeting 
notice. However, a single vote may be taken with respect to a series of 
meetings proposed to be closed to the public, and with respect to 
information concerning such series of meetings (a vote on each question, 
if both are presented), if each meeting involves the same particular 
matters and is scheduled to be held no later than 30 days after the 
first meeting in the series.
    (e) Less than seven days notice may be given only by majority vote 
of the entire membership of the agency.
    (f) The subject matter or the determination to open or close a 
meeting will be changed only if a majority of the entire membership of 
the agency determines by recorded vote that agency business so requires 
and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible.


<R05>
Sec. 0.607  Transcript, recording or minutes; availability to the public.

    (a) The agency will maintain a complete transcript or electronic 
recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting 
closed to the public, except that in a meeting closed pursuant to 
paragraph (h) or (j) of Sec. 0.603, the agency may maintain minutes in 
lieu of a transcript or recording. Such minutes shall fully and clearly 
describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate 
summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a 
description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of 
any roll call vote. All documents considered in connection with any item 
will be identified in the minutes.
    (b) A public file of transcripts (or minutes) of closed meetings 
will be maintained in the Minute and Rules Branch, Office of the 
Secretary. The transcript of a meeting will be placed in that file if, 
after the meeting, the responsible Bureau or Office Chief determines, in 
light of the discussion, that the meeting could have been open to the 
public or that the reason for withholding information concerning the 
matters discussed no longer pertains. Transcripts placed in the public 
file are available for inspection under Sec. 0.460. Other transcripts, 
and separable portions thereof which do not contain information properly 
withheld under Sec. 0.603, may be made available for inspection under 
Sec. 0.461. When a transcript, or portion thereof, is made available for 
inspection under Sec. 0.461, it will be placed in the public file. 
Copies of transcripts may be obtained from the duplicating contractor 
pursuant to Sec. 0.465(a). There will be no search or transcription fee. 
Requests for inspection or copies of transcripts shall specify the date 
of the meeting, the name of the agenda and the agenda item number; this 
information will appear in the notice of the meeting. Pursuant to 
Sec. 0.465(c)(3), the Commission will

[[Page 90]]

makecopies of the transcript available directly, free of charge, if it 
serves the financial or regulatory interests of the United States.
    (c) The Commission will maintain a copy of the transcript or minutes 
for a period of at least two years after the meeting, or until at least 
one year after conclusion of the proceeding to which the meeting 
relates, whichever occurs later.

Sec. 0.701  Intergovernmental Advisory Committee.

    (a) Purpose and term of operations. The Intergovernmental Advisory 
Committee (IAC) is established to facilitate intergovernmental 
communication between municipal, county, state and tribal governments 
and the Federal Communications Commission. The IAC will commence 
operations with its first meeting convened under this section and is 
authorized to undertake its mission for a period of two years from that 
date. At his discretion, the Chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission may extend the IAC's term of operations for an additional two 
years, for which new members will be appointed as set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section. Pursuant to Section 204(b) of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1534(b), the IAC is not subject to, and is 
not required to follow, the procedures set forth in the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act. 5 U.S.C., App. 2 (1988).
    (b) Membership. The IAC will be composed of the following 15 members 
(or their designated employees): Four elected municipal officials (city 
mayors and city council members); two elected county officials (county 
commissioners or council members); one elected or appointed local 
government attorney; one elected state executive (governor or lieutenant 
governor); three elected state legislators; one elected or appointed 
public utilities or public service commissioner; and three elected or 
appointed Native American tribal representatives. The Chairman of the 
Commission will appoint members through an application process initiated 
by a Public Notice, and will select a Chairman and a Vice Chairman to 
lead the IAC. The Chairman of the Commission will also appoint members 
to fill any vacancies and may replace an IAC member, at his discretion, 
using the appointment process. Members of the IAC are responsible for 
travel and other incidental expenses incurred while on IAC business and 
will not be reimbursed by the Commission for such expenses.
    (c) Location and frequency of meetings. The IAC will meet in 
Washington, DC four times a year. Members must attend a minimum of fifty 
percent of the IAC's yearly meetings and may be removed by the Chairman 
of the IAC for failure to comply with this requirement.
    (d) Participation in IAC meetings. Participation at IAC meetings 
will be limited to IAC members or employees designated by IAC members to 
act on their behalf. Members unable to attend an IAC meeting should 
notify the IAC Chairman a reasonable time in advance of the meeting and 
provide the name of the employee designated on their behalf. With the 
exception of Commission staff and individuals or groups having business 
before the IAC, no other persons may attend or participate in an IAC 
meeting.
    (e) Commission support and oversight. The Chairman of the 
Commission, or Commissioner designated by the Chairman for such purpose, 
will serve as a liaison between the IAC and the Commission and provide 
general oversight for its activities. The IAC will also communicate 
directly with the Chief, Consumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau, 
concerning logistical assistance and staff support, and such other 
matters as are warranted.

Sec. 1.1  Proceedings before the Commission.

    The Commission may on its own motion or petition of any interested 
party hold such proceedings as it may deem necessary from time to time 
in connection with the investigation of any matter which it has power to 
investigate under the law, or for the purpose of obtaining information 
necessary or helpful in the determination of its policies, the carrying 
out of its duties or the formulation or amendment of its rules and 
regulations. For such purposes it may subpena witnesses and require the 
production of evidence. Procedures to be followed by the Commission 
shall, unless specifically prescribed in this part, be such as in the 
opinion of the Commission will best serve the purposes of such 
proceedings.

(Sec. 403, 48 Stat. 1094; 47 U.S.C. 403)

Sec. 1.2  Declaratory rulings.

    The Commission may, in accordance with section 5(d) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, on motion or on its own motion issue a 
declaratory ruling terminating a controversy or removing uncertainty.

<R05>
Sec. 1.3  Suspension, amendment, or waiver of rules.

    The provisions of this chapter may be suspended, revoked, amended, 
or waived for good cause shown, in whole or in part, at any time by the 
Commission, subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure 
Act and the provisions of this chapter. Any provision of the rules may 
be waived by the Commission on its own motion or on petition if good 
cause therefor is shown.

    Cross Reference: See subpart C of this part for practice and 
procedure involving rulemaking.


<R05>
Sec. 1.4  Computation of time.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this rule section is to detail the 
method for computing the amount of time within which persons or entities 
must act in response to deadlines established by the Commission. It also 
applies to computation of time for seeking both reconsideration and 
judicial review of Commission decisions.
    (b) General Rule--Computation of Beginning Date When Action is 
Initiated by Commission or Staff. Unless otherwise provided, the first 
day to be counted when a period of time begins with an action taken by 
the Commission, an Administrative Law Judge or by members of the 
Commission or its staff pursuant to delegated authority is the day after 
the day on which public notice of that action is given. See Sec. 1.4(b) 
(1)-(5) of this section. Unless otherwise provided, all Rules measuring 
time from the date of the issuance of a Commission document entitled 
``Public Notice'' shall be calculated in accordance with this section. 
See Sec. 1.4(b)(4) of this section for a description of the ``Public 
Notice'' document. Unless otherwise provided in Sec. 1.4 (g) and (h) of 
this section, it is immaterial whether the first day is a ``holiday.'' 
For purposes of this section, the term public notice means the date of 
any of the following events: See Sec. 1.4(e)(1) of this section for 
definition of ``holiday.''
    (1) For all documents in notice and comment and non-notice and 
comment rulemaking proceedings required by the Administrative Procedure 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, 553, to be published in the Federal Register, 
including summaries thereof, the date of publication in the Federal 
Register.
    Note to paragraph (b)(1):
    Licensing and other adjudicatory decisions with respect to specific 
parties that may be associated with or contained in rulemaking documents 
are governed by the provisions of Sec. 1.4(b)(2).

    Example 1: A document in a Commission rule making proceeding is 
published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, May 6, 1987. Public 
notice commences on Wednesday, May 6, 1987. The first day to be counted 
in computing the beginning date of a period of time for action in 
response to the document is Thursday, May 7, 1987, the ``day after the 
day'' of public notice.
    Example 2: Section 1.429(e) provides that when a petition for 
reconsideration is timely filed in proper form, public notice of its 
filing is published in the Federal Register. Section 1.429(f) provides 
that oppositions to a petition for reconsideration shall be filed within 
15 days after public notice of the petition's filing in the Federal 
Register. Public notice of the filing of a petition for reconsideration 
is published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, June 10, 1987. For 
purposes of computing the filing period for an opposition, the first day 
to be counted is Thursday, June 11, 1987, which is the day after the 
date of public notice. Therefore, oppositions to the reconsideration 
petition must be filed by Thursday, June 25, 1987, 15 days later.

    (2) For non-rulemaking documents released by the Commission or 
staff, including the Commission's section 271 determinations, 47 U.S.C. 
271, the release date.

    Example 3: The Chief, Mass Media Bureau, adopts an order on 
Thursday, April 2, 1987. The text of that order is not released to the 
public until Friday, April 3, 1987. Public notice of this decision is 
given on Friday, April 3, 1987. Saturday, April 4, 1987, is the first 
day to be counted in computing filing periods.

    (3) For rule makings of particular applicability, if the rule making 
document is to be published in the Federal Register and the Commission 
so states in its decision, the date of public notice

[[Page 100]]

will commence on the day of the Federal Register publication date. If 
the decision fails to specify Federal Register publication, the date of 
public notice will commence on the release date, even if the document is 
subsequently published in the Federal Register. See Declaratory Ruling, 
51 FR 23059 (June 25, 1986).

    Example 4: An order establishing an investigation of a tariff, and 
designating issues to be resolved in the investigation, is released on 
Wednesday, April 1, 1987, and is published in the Federal Register on 
Friday, April 10, 1987. If the decision itself specifies Federal 
Register publication, the date of public notice is Friday, April 10, 
1987. If this decision does not specify Federal Register publication, 
public notice occurs on Wednesday, April 1, 1987, and the first day to 
be counted in computing filing periods is Thursday, April 2, 1987.

    (4) If the full text of an action document is not to be released by 
the Commission, but a descriptive document entitled ``Public Notice'' 
describing the action is released, the date on which the descriptive 
``Public Notice'' is released.

    Example 5: At a public meeting the Commission considers an 
uncontested application to transfer control of a broadcast station. The 
Commission grants the application and does not plan to issue a full text 
of its decision on the uncontested matter. Five days after the meeting, 
a descriptive ``Public Notice'' announcing the action is publicly 
released. The date of public notice commences on the day of the release 
date.
    Example 6: A Public Notice of petitions for rule making filed with 
the Commission is released on Wednesday, September 2, 1987; public 
notice of these petitions is given on September 2, 1987. The first day 
to be counted in computing filing times is Thursday, September 3, 1987.

    (5) If a document is neither published in the Federal Register nor 
released, and if a descriptive document entitled ``Public Notice'' is 
not released, the date appearing on the document sent (e.g., mailed, 
telegraphed, etc.) to persons affected by the action.

    Example 7: A Bureau grants a license to an applicant, or issues a 
waiver for non-conforming operation to an existing licensee, and no 
``Public Notice'' announcing the action is released. The date of public 
notice commences on the day appearing on the license mailed to the 
applicant or appearing on the face of the letter granting the waiver 
mailed to the licensee.

    (c) General Rule--Computation of Beginning Date When Action is 
Initiated by Act, Event or Default. Commission procedures frequently 
require the computation of a period of time where the period begins with 
the occurrence of an act, event or default and terminates a specific 
number of days thereafter. Unless otherwise provided, the first day to 
be counted when a period of time begins with the occurrence of an act, 
event or default is the day after the day on which the act, event or 
default occurs.

    Example 8: Commission Rule Sec. 21.39(d) requires the filing of an 
application requesting consent to involuntary assignment or control of 
the permit or license within thirty days after the occurrence of the 
death or legal disability of the licensee or permittee. If a licensee 
passes away on Sunday, March 1, 1987, the first day to be counted 
pursuant to Sec. 1.4(c) is the day after the act or event. Therefore, 
Monday, March 2, 1987, is the first day of the thirty day period 
specified in Sec. 21.39(d).

    (d) General Rule--Computation of Terminal Date. Unless otherwise 
provided, when computing a period of time the last day of such period of 
time is included in the computation, and any action required must be 
taken on or before that day.

    Example 9: Paragraph 1.4(b)(1) of this section provides that 
``public notice'' in a notice and comment rule making proceeding begins 
on the day of Federal Register publication. Paragraph 1.4(b) of this 
section provides that the first day to be counted in computing a 
terminal date is the ``day after the day'' on which public notice 
occurs. Therefore, if the commission allows or requires an action to be 
taken 20 days after public notice in the Federal Register, the first day 
to be counted is the day after the date of the Federal Register 
publication. Accordingly, if the Federal Register document is published 
on Thursday, July 23, 1987, public notice is given on Thursday, July 23, 
and the first day to be counted in computing a 20 day period is Friday, 
July 24, 1987. The 20th day or terminal date upon which action must be 
taken is Wednesday, August 12, 1987.

    (e) Definitions for purposes of this section:
    (1) The term holiday means Saturday, Sunday, officially recognized 
Federal legal holidays and any other day on which the Commission's 
offices are

[[Page 101]]

closed and not reopened prior to 5:30 p.m. For example, a regularly 
scheduled Commission business day may become a holiday if its offices 
are closed prior to 5:30 p.m. due to adverse weather, emergency or other 
closing.

    Note: As of August 1987, officially recognized Federal legal 
holidays are New Year's Day, January 1; Martin Luther King's Birthday, 
third Monday in January; Washington's Birthday, third Monday in 
February; Memorial Day, last Monday in May; Independence Day, July 4; 
Labor Day, first Monday in September; Columbus Day, second Monday in 
October; Veterans Day, November 11; Thanksgiving Day, fourth Thursday in 
November; Christmas Day, December 25. If a legal holiday falls on 
Saturday or Sunday, the holiday is taken, respectively, on the preceding 
Friday or the following Monday. In addition, January 20, (Inauguration 
Day) following a Presidential election year is a legal holiday in the 
metropolitan Washington, DC area. If Inauguration Day falls on Sunday, 
the next succeeding day is a legal holiday. See 5 U.S.C. 6103; Executive 
Order No. 11582, 36 FR 2957 (Feb. 11, 1971). The determination of a 
``holiday'' will apply only to the specific Commission location(s) 
designated as on ``holiday'' on that particular day.

    (2) The term business day means all days, including days when the 
Commission opens later than the time specified in Rule Sec. 0.403, which 
are not ``holidays'' as defined above.
    (3) The term filing period means the number of days allowed or 
prescribed by statute, rule, order, notice or other Commission action 
for filing any document with the Commission. It does not include any 
additional days allowed for filing any document pursuant to paragraphs 
(g), (h) and (j) of this section.
    (4) The term filing date means the date upon which a document must 
be filed after all computations of time authorized by this section have 
been made.
    (f) Except as provided in Sec. 0.401(b) of this chapter, all 
petitions, pleadings, tariffs or other documents not required to be 
accompanied by a fee and which are hand-delivered must be tendered for 
filing in complete form, as directed by the Rules, with the Office of 
the Secretary before 7:00 p.m., at 445 12th St., SW., TW-A325, 
Washington, DC. The Secretary will determine whether a tendered document 
meets the pre-7:00 p.m. deadline. Documents filed electronically 
pursuant to Sec. 1.49(f) must be received by the Commission's electronic 
filing system before midnight. Applications, attachments and pleadings 
filed electronically in the Universal Licensing System (ULS) pursuant to 
Sec. 1.939(b) must be received before midnight on the filing date. Media 
Bureau applications and reports filed electronically pursuant to 
Sec. 73.3500 of this chapter must be received by the electronic filing 
system before midnight on the filing date.
    (g) Unless otherwise provided (e.g., Secs. 1.773 and 76.1502(e)(1) 
of this chapter), if the filing period is less than 7 days, intermediate 
holidays shall not be counted in determining the filing date.

    Example 10: A reply is required to be filed within 5 days after the 
filing of an opposition in a license application proceeding. The 
opposition is filed on Wednesday, June 10, 1987. The first day to be 
counted in computing the 5 day time period is Thursday, June 11, 1987. 
Saturday and Sunday are not counted because they are holidays. The 
document must be filed with the Commission on or before the following 
Wednesday, June 17, 1987.

    (h) If a document is required to be served upon other parties by 
statute or Commission regulation and the document is in fact served by 
mail (see Sec. 1.47(f)), and the filing period for a response is 10 days 
or less, an additional 3 days (excluding holidays) will be allowed to 
all parties in the proceeding for filing a response. This paragraph (h) 
shall not apply to documents filed pursuant to Sec. 1.89, Sec. 1.120(d), 
Sec. 1.315(b) or Sec. 1.316. For purposes of this paragraph (h) service 
by facsimile or by electronic means shall be deemed equivalent to hand 
delivery.

    Example 11: A reply to an opposition for a petition for 
reconsideration must be filed within 7 days after the opposition is 
filed. 47 CFR 1.106(h). The rules require that the opposition be served 
on the person seeking reconsideration. 47 CFR 1.106(g). If the 
opposition is served on the party seeking reconsideration by mail and 
the opposition is filed with the Commission on Monday, November 9, 1987, 
the first day to be counted is Tuesday, November 10, 1987 (the day after 
the day on which the event occurred, Sec. 1.4(c)), and the seventh day 
is Monday, November 16. An additional 3 days (excluding holidays) is 
then added at the end of the 7 day period, and the reply must be filed 
no later than Thursday, November 19, 1987.

[[Page 102]]

    Example 12: Assume that oppositions to a petition in a particular 
proceeding are due 10 days after the petition is filed and must be 
served on the parties to the proceeding. If the petition is filed on 
October 28, 1993, the last day of the filing period for oppositions is 
Sunday, November 7. If service is made by mail, the opposition is due 
three days after November 7, or Wednesday, November 10.

    (i) If both paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section are applicable, 
make the paragraph (g) computation before the paragraph (h) computation.

    Example 13: Section 1.45(b) requires the filing of replies to 
oppositions within five days after the time for filing oppositions has 
expired. If an opposition has been filed on the last day of the filing 
period (Friday, July 10, 1987), and was served on the replying party by 
mail, Sec. 1.4(i) of this section specifies that the paragraph (g) 
computation should be made before the paragraph (h) computation. 
Therefore, since the specified filing period is less than seven days, 
paragraph (g) is applied first. The first day of the filing period is 
Monday, July 13, 1987, and Friday, July 17, 1987 is the fifth day (the 
intervening weekend was not counted). Paragraph (h) is then applied to 
add three days for mailing (excluding holidays). That period begins on 
Monday, July 20, 1987. Therefore, Wednesday, July 22, 1987, is the date 
by which replies must be filed, since the intervening weekend is again 
not counted.

    (j) Unless otherwise provided (e.g. Sec. 76.1502(e) of this chapter) 
if, after making all the computations provided for in this section, the 
filing date falls on a holiday, the document shall befiled on the next 
business day. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

    Example 14: The filing date falls on Friday, December 25, 1987. The 
document is required to be filed on the next business day, which is 
Monday, December 28, 1987.

    (k) Where specific provisions of part 1 conflict with this section, 
those specific provisions of part 1 are controlling. See, 
e.g.,Secs. 1.45(d), 1.773(a)(3) and 1.773(b)(2). Additionally, where 
Sec. 76.1502(e) of this chapter conflicts with this section, those 
specific provisions of Sec. 76.1502 are controlling. See e.g. 47 CFR 
76.1502(e).

final suspension (not merely temporary suspension pending further 
action) or disbarment by such authority, the Commission may, without any 
preliminary hearing, enter an order temporarily suspending the attorney 
from practice before it pending final disposition of a disciplinary 
proceeding brought pursuant to Sec. 1.24(a)(2), which shall afford such 
attorney an opportunity to be heard and directing the attorney to show 
cause within thirty days from the date of said order why identical 
discipline should not be imposed against such attorney by the 
Commission.

not affect the validity of the service. The Commission may allow the 
proof to be amended or supplied at any time, unless to do so would 
result in material prejudice to a party.

telephone or voicemail number, facsimile number, and, if available, 
Internet e-mail address. The carrier shall additionally list any other 
names by which it is known or under which it does business, and, if the 
carrier is an affiliated company, the parent, holding, or management 
company. Within thirty (30) days of the commencement of provision of 
service, each carrier shall file such information with the Chief of the 
Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes Resolution Division. Carriers may 
file a hard copy of the relevant portion of the Telecommunications 
Reporting Worksheet, as delineated by the Commission in the Federal 
Register, to satisfy this requirement. Each Telecommunications Reporting 
Worksheet filed annually by a common carrier must contain a name, 
business address, telephone or voicemail number, facsimile number, and, 
if available, Internet e-mail address for its designated agents, 
regardless of whether such information has been revised since the 
previous filing. Carriers must notify the Commission within one week of 
any changes in their designation information by filing revised portions 
of the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet with the Chief of the 
Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes Resolution Division. A paper copy 
of this designation list shall be maintained in the Office of the 
Secretary of the Commission. Service of any notice, process, orders, 
decisions or requirements of the Commission may be made upon such 
carrier by leaving a copy thereof with such designated agent at his 
office or usual place of residence. If a carrier fails to designate such 
an agent, service of any notice or other process in any proceeding 
before the Commission, or of any order, decision, or requirement of the 
Commission, may be made by posting such notice, process, order, 
requirement, or decision in the Office of the Secretary of the 
Commission.

Sec. 1.48  Length of pleadings.

    (a) Affidavits, statements, tables of contents and summaries of 
filings, and other materials which are submitted with and factually 
support a pleading are not counted in determining the length of the 
pleading. If other materials are submitted with a pleading, they will be 
counted in determining its length; and if the length of the pleadings, 
as so computed, is greater than permitted by the provisions of this

[[Page 110]]

chapter, the pleading will be returned without consideration.
    (b) It is the policy of the Commission that requests for permission 
to file pleadings in excess of the length prescribed by the provisions 
of this chapter shall not be routinely granted. Where the filing period 
is 10 days or less, the request shall be made within 2 business days 
after the period begins to run. Where the period is more than 10 days, 
the request shall be filed at least 10 days before the filing date. (See 
Sec. 1.4.) If a timely request is made, the pleading need not be filed 
earlier than 2 business days after the Commission acts upon the request.

Sec. 1.49  Specifications as to pleadings and documents.

    (a) All pleadings and documents filed in paper form in any 
Commission proceeding shall be typewritten or prepared by mechanical 
processing methods, and shall be filed on A4 (21 cm. x 29.7 cm.) or on 
8\1/2\ x 11 inch (21.6 cm. x 27.9 cm.) paper with the margins set so 
that the printed material does not exceed 6 \1/2\ x 9\1/2\ inches (16.5 
cm. x 24.1 cm.). The printed material may be in any typeface of at least 
12-point (0.42333 cm. or \12/72\<gr-thn-eq>) in height. The body of the 
text must be double spaced with a minimum distance of \7/32\ of an inch 
(0.5556 cm.) between each line of text. Footnotes and long, indented 
quotations may be single spaced, but must be in type that is 12-point or 
larger in height, with at least \1/16\ of an inch (0.158 cm.) between 
each line of text. Counsel are cautioned against employing extended 
single spaced passages or excessive footnotes to evade prescribed 
pleading lengths. If single-spaced passages or footnotes are used in 
this manner the pleading will, at the discretion of the Commission, 
either be rejected as unacceptable for filing or dismissed with leave to 
be refiled in proper form. Pleadings may be printed on both sides of the 
paper. Pleadings that use only one side of the paper shall be stapled, 
or otherwise bound, in the upper left-hand corner; those using both 
sides of the paper shall be stapled twice, or otherwise bound, along the 
left-hand margin so that it opens like a book. The foregoing shall not 
apply to printed briefs specifically requested by the Commission, 
official publications, charted or maps, original documents (or 
admissible copies thereof) offered as exhibits, specially prepared 
exhibits, or if otherwise specifically provided. All copies shall be 
clearly legible.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all 
pleadings and documents filed with the Commission, the length of which 
as computed under this chapter exceeds ten pages, shall include, as part 
of the pleading or document, a table of contents with page references.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all 
pleadings and documents filed with the Commission, the length of which 
filings as computed under this chapter exceeds ten pages, shall include, 
as part of the pleading or document, a summary of the filing, suitably 
paragraphed, which should be a succinct, but accurate and clear 
condensation of the substance of the filing. It should not be a mere 
repetition of the headings under which the filing is arranged. For 
pleadings and documents exceeding ten but not twenty-five pages in 
length, the summary should seldom exceed one and never two pages; for 
pleadings and documents exceeding twenty-five pages in length, the 
summary should seldom exceed two and never five pages.
    (d) The requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall 
not apply to:
    (1) Interrogatories or answers to interrogatories, and depositions;
    (2) FCC forms or applications;
    (3) Transcripts;
    (4) Contracts and reports;
    (5) Letters; or
    (6) Hearing exhibits, and exhibits or appendicies accompanying any 
document or pleading submitted to the Commission.
    (e) Petitions, pleadings, and other documents associated with 
licensing matters in the Wireless Radio Services may be filed 
electronically in ULS. See Sec. 22.6 for specifications.
    (f)(1) In the following types of proceedings, all pleadings, 
including permissible ex parte submissions, notices of ex parte 
presentations, comments,

[[Page 111]]

reply comments, and petitions for reconsideration and replies thereto, 
may be filed in electronic format:
    (i) General rulemaking proceedings other than broadcast allotment 
proceedings;
    (ii) Notice of inquiry proceedings; and
    (iii) Petition for rulemaking proceedings (except broadcast 
allotment proceedings).
    (2) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and any 
prescribed pleading lengths, the length of any document filed in 
electronic form shall be equal to the length of the document if printed 
out and formatted according to the specifications of paragraph (a) of 
this section, or shall be no more that 250 words per page.

    Note: The table of contents and the summary pages shall not be 
included in complying with any page limitation requirements as set forth 
by Commission rule.

and regulations, the number of copies of pleadings, briefs, and other 
papers to be filed is as follows:
    (a) In hearing proceedings, the following number of copies shall be

    (2) If the paper filed relates to matters to be acted on by the 
Commission, an original and 14 copies shall be filed.
    (3) If more than one person presided (is presiding) at the hearing 
an additional copy shall be filed for each such additional person.
    (b) In rulemaking proceedings which have not been designated for 
hearing, see section 1.419 of this chapter.
    (c) In matters other than rule making and hearing cases, the 
following number of copies shall be filed:
    (1) If the paper filed relates to matters to be acted on by the 
Commission, an original and 4 copies shall be filed. If the matter 
relates to Part 22 of the rules, see Sec. 22.6.
    (2) If the paper filed related to matters to be acted on by staff 
officials under delegated authority, an original and 4 copies shall be 
filed. If the matter relates to Part 22 of the rules, see Sec. 22.6.
    (d) Where statute or regulation provides for service by the 
Commission of papers filed with the Commission, an additional copy of 
such papers shall be filed for each person to be served.
    (e) The parties to any proceeding may, on notice, be required to 
file additional copies of any or all filings made in that proceeding.
    (f) For application and licensing matters involving the Wireless 
Radio Services, pleadings, briefs or other documents may be filed 
electronically in ULS, or if filed manually, one original and one copy 
of a pleading, brief or other document must be filed.
    (g) Participants that file pleadings, briefs or other documents 
electronically in ULS need only submit one copy, so long as the 
submission conforms to any procedural or filing requirements established 
for formal electronic comments. (see Sec. 1.49)
    (h) Pleadings, briefs or other documents filed electronically in ULS 
by a party represented by an attorney shall include the name, street 
address, and telephone number of at least one attorney of record. 
Parties not represented by an attorney that file electronically

[[Page 112]]

in ULS shall provide their name, street address, and telephone number.

Sec. 1.52  Subscription and verification.

    The original of all petitions, motions, pleadings, briefs, and other 
documents filed by any party represented by counsel shall be signed by 
at least one attorney of record in his individual name, whose address 
shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall 
sign and verify the document and state his address. Either the original 
document, the electronic reproduction of such original document 
containing the facsimile signature of the attorney or represented party, 
or, in the case of matters in the Wireless Radio Services, an electronic 
filing via ULS is acceptable for filing. If a facsimile or electronic 
reproduction of such original document is filed, the signatory shall 
retain the original until the Commission's decision is final and no 
longer subject to judicial review. If pursuant to Sec. 1.429(h) a 
document is filed electronically, a signature will be considered any 
symbol executed or adopted by the party with the intent that such symbol 
be a signature, including symbols formed by computer-generated 
electronic impulses. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule 
or statute, documents signed by the attorney for a party need not be 
verified or accompanied by affidavit. The signature or electronic 
reproduction thereof by an attorney constitutes a certificate by him 
that he has read the document; that to the best of his knowledge, 
information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it 
is not interposed for delay. If the original of a document is not signed 
or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this section, or an 
electronic reproduction does not contain a facsimile signature, it may 
be stricken as sham and false, and the matter may proceed as though the 
document had not been filed. An attorney may be subjected to appropriate 
disciplinary action, pursuant to Sec. 1.24, for a willful violation of 
this section or if scandalous or indecent matter is inserted.

<R05>
Sec. 1.61  Procedures for handling applications requiring special aeronautical study.

    (a) Antenna Structure Registration is conducted by the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau as follows:
    (1) Each antenna structure owner that must notify the FAA of 
proposed construction using FAA Form 7460-1 shall, upon proposing new or 
modified construction, register that antenna structure with the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau using FCC Form 854.
    (2) If an Environmental Assessment is required under Sec. 1.1307, 
the Bureau will address the environmental concerns prior to processing 
the registration.
    (3) If a final FAA determination of ``no hazard'' is not submitted 
along with FCC Form 854, processing of the registration may be delayed 
or disapproved.
    (4) If the owner of the antenna structure cannot file FCC Form 854 
because it is subject to a denial of Federal benefits under the Anti-
Drug Abuse Act of

[[Page 113]]

1988, 21 U.S.C. 862, the first licensee authorized to locate on the 
structure must register the structure using FCC Form 854, and provide a 
copy of the Antenna Structure Registration (FCCForm 854R) to the owner. 
The owner remains responsible for providing a copy of FCC Form 854R to 
all tenant licensees on the structure and for posting the registration 
number as required by Sec. 17.4(g) of this chapter.
    (5) Upon receipt of FCC Form 854, and attached final FAA 
determination of ``no hazard,'' the Bureau prescribes antenna structure 
painting and/or lighting specifications or other conditions in 
accordance with the FAA airspace recommendation and returns a completed 
Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 854R) to the registrant. If the 
proposed structure is disapproved the registrant is so advised.
    (b) Each operating Bureau or Office examines the applications for 
Commission authorization for which it is responsible to ensure 
compliance with FAA notification procedures as well as Commission 
Antenna Structure Registration as follows:
    (1) If Antenna Structure Registration is required, the operating 
Bureau reviews the application for the Antenna Structure Registration 
Number and proceeds as follows:
    (i) If the application contains the Antenna Structure Registration 
Number or if the applicant seeks a Cellular or PCS system authorization, 
the operating Bureau processes the application.
    (ii) If the application does not contain the Antenna Structure 
Registration Number, but the structure owner has already filed FCC Form 
854, the operating Bureau places the application on hold until 
Registration can be confirmed, so long as the owner exhibits due 
diligence in filing.
    (iii) If the application does not contain the Antenna Structure 
Registration Number, and the structure owner has not filed FCC Form 854, 
the operating Bureau notifies the applicant that FCC Form 854 must be 
filed and places the application on hold until Registration can be 
confirmed, so long as the owner exhibits due diligence in filing.
    (2) If Antenna Structure Registration is not required, the operating 
Bureau processes the application.
    (c) Where one or more antenna farm areas have been designated for a 
community or communities (see Sec. 17.9 of this chapter), an application 
proposing the erection of an antenna structure over 1,000 feet in height 
above ground to serve such community or communities will not be accepted 
for filing unless:
    (1) It is proposed to locate the antenna structure in a designated 
antenna farm area, or
    (2) It is accompanied by a statement from the Federal Aviation 
Administration that the proposed structure will not constitute a menace 
to air navigation, or
    (3) It is accompanied by a request for waiver setting forth reasons 
sufficient, if true, to justify such a waiver.

    Note: By Commission Order (FCC 65-455), 30 FR 7419, June 5, 1965, 
the Commission issued the following policy statement concerning the 
height of radio and television antenna towers:
``We have concluded that this objective can best be achieved by adopting 
the following policy: Applications for antenna towers higher than 2,000 
feet above ground will be presumed to be inconsistent with the public 
interest, and the applicant will have a burden of overcoming that strong 
presumption. The applicant must accompany its application with a 
detailed showing directed to meeting this burden. Only in the 
exceptional case, where the Commission concludes that a clear and 
compelling showing has been made that there are public interest reasons 
requiring a tower higher than 2,000 feet above ground, and after the 
parties have complied with applicable FAA procedures, and full 
Commission coordination with FAA on the question of menace to air 
navigation, will a grant be made. Applicants and parties in interest 
will, of course, be afforded their statutory hearing rights.''

    (a)(1) Where there is pending before the Commission at the time of 
expiration of license any proper and timely application for renewal of 
license with respect to any activity of a continuing

[[Page 114]]

nature, in accordance with the provisions of section 9(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, such license shall continue in effect 
without further action by the Commission until such time as the 
Commission shall make a final determination with respect to therenewal 
application. No operation by any licensee under this section shall be 
construed as a finding by the Commission that the operation will serve 
the public interest, convenience, or necessity, nor shall such operation 
in any way affect or limit the action of the Commission with respect to 
any pending application or proceeding.
    (2) A licensee operating by virtue of this paragraph shall, after 
the date of expiration specified in the license, post, in addition to 
the original license, any acknowledgment received from the Commission 
that the renewal application has been accepted for filing or a signed 
copy of the application for renewal of license which has been submitted 
by the licensee, or in services other than broadcast and common carrier, 
a statement certifying that the licensee has mailed or filed a renewal 
application, specifying the date of mailing or filing.
    (b) Where there is pending before the Commission at the time of 
expiration of license any proper and timely application for renewal or 
extension of the term of a license with respect to any activity not of a 
continuing nature, the Commission may in its discretion grant a 
temporary extension of such license pending determination of such 
application. No such temporary extension shall be construed as a finding 
by the Commission that the operation of any radio station thereunder 
will serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity beyond the 
express terms of such temporary extension of license, nor shall such 
temporary extension in any way affect or limit the action of the 
Commission with respect to any pending application or proceeding.
    (c) Except where an instrument of authorization clearly states on 
its face that it relates to an activity not of a continuing nature, or 
where the non-continuing nature is otherwise clearly apparent upon the 
face of the authorization, all licenses issued by the Commission shall 
be deemed to be related to an activity of a continuing nature.

Sec. 1.65  Substantial and significant changes in information furnished by applicants to the Commission.

    (a) Each applicant is responsible for the continuing accuracy and 
completeness of information furnished in a pending application or in 
Commission proceedings involving a pending application. Whenever the 
information furnished in the pending application is no longer 
substantially accurate and complete in all significant respects, the 
applicant shall as promptly as possible and in any event within 30 days, 
unless good cause is shown, amend or request the amendment of his 
application so as to furnish such additional or corrected information as 
may be appropriate. Whenever there has been a substantial change as to 
any other matter which may be of decisional significance in a Commission 
proceeding involving the pending application, the applicant shall as 
promptly as possible and in any event within 30 days, unless good cause 
is shown, submit a statement furnishing such additional or corrected 
information as may be appropriate, which shall be served upon parties of 
record in accordance with Sec. 1.47. Where the matter is before any 
court for review, statements and requests to amend shall in addition be 
served upon the Commission's General Counsel. For the purposes of this 
section, an application is ``pending'' before the Commission from the 
time it is accepted for filing by the Commission until a Commission 
grant or denial of the application is no longer subject to 
reconsideration by the Commission or to review by any court.
    (b) Applications in ITFS and broadcast services subject to 
competitive bidding will be subject to the provisions of 
Secs. 1.2105(b), 73.5002 and 73.3522 regarding the modification of their 
applications.
    (c) All broadcast permittees and licensees must report annually to 
the Commission any adverse finding or adverse final action taken by any 
court or administrative body that involves conduct bearing on the 
permittee's or licensee's character qualifications and

[[Page 115]]

that would be reportable in connection with an application for renewal 
as reflected in the renewal form. If a report is required by this 
paragraph(s), it shall be filed on the anniversary of the date that the 
licensee's renewal application is required to be filed, except that 
licensees owning multiple stations with different anniversary dates need 
file only one report per year on the anniversary of their choice, 
provided that their reports are not more than one year apart. Permittees 
and licensees bear the obligation to make diligent, good faith efforts 
to become knowledgeable of any such reportable adjudicated misconduct.

    Note: The terms adverse finding and adverse final action as used in 
paragraph (c) of this section include adjudications made by an ultimate 
trier of fact, whether a government agency or court, but do not include 
factual determinations which are subject to review de novo unless the 
time for taking such review has expired under the relevant procedural 
rules. The pendency of an appeal of an adverse finding or adverse final 
action does not relieve a permittee or licensee from its obligation to 
report the finding or action.

    (2) Willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any of the 
provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended; or of any 
rule, regulation or order issued by the Commission under that Act or 
under any treaty, convention, or other agreement to which the United 
States is a party and which is binding on the United States;
    (3) Violated any provision of section 317(c) or 508(a) of the 
Communications Act; or
    (4) Violated any provision of section 1304, 1343, or 1464 of Title 
18, United States Code.


A forfeiture penalty assessed under this section is in addition to any 
other penalty provided for by the Communications Act, except that the 
penalties provided for in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this 
section shall not apply to conduct which is subject to a forfeiture 
penalty under sections 202(c), 203(e), 205(b), 214(d), 219(b), 220(d), 
223(b), 362(a), 362(b), 386(a), 386(b), 503(b), 506, and 634 of the 
Communications Act. The remaining provisions of this section are 
applicable to such conduct.
    (b) Limits on the amount of forfeiture assessed. (1) If the violator 
is a broadcast station licensee or permittee, a cable television 
operator, or an applicant for any broadcast or cable television operator 
license, permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization 
issued by the Commission, except as otherwise noted in this paragraph, 
the forfeiture penalty under this section shall not exceed $27,500 for 
each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that the 
amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of 
$300,000 for any single act or failure to act described in paragraph (a) 
of this section. There is no limit on forfeiture assessments for EEO 
violations by cable operators that occur after notification by the 
Commission of a potential violation. See Section 634(f)(2) of the 
Communications Act.
    (2) If the violator is a common carrier subject to the provisions of 
the Communications Act or an applicant for any common carrier license, 
permit, certificate, or other instrument of authorization issued by the 
Commission, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this 
section shall not exceed $120,000 for each violation or each day of a 
continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing 
violation shall not exceed a total of $1,200,000 for any single act or 
failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) In any case not covered in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section, the amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this 
section shall not exceed $11,000 for each violation or each day of a 
continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing 
violation shall not exceed a total of $87,500 for any single act or 
failure to act described in paragraph (a) of this section.

    Note to paragraph (b)(3):
    For information concerning notices of apparent liability and notices 
of opportunity for hearing, see paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this 
section.

    (4) Factors considered in determining the amount of the forfeiture 
penalty. In determining the amount of the forfeiture penalty, the 
Commission or its designee will take into account the nature, 
circumstances, extent and gravity of the violations and, with respect to 
the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, 
ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.

    Note to paragraph (b)(4):


                  Guidelines for Assessing Forfeitures

    The Commission and its staff may use these guidelines in particular 
cases. The Commission and its staff retain the discretion to issue a 
higher or lower forfeiture than provided in the guidelines, to issue no 
forfeiture at all, or to apply alternative or additional sanctions as 
permitted by the statute. The forfeiture ceiling per violation

[[Page 117]]

or per day for a continuing violation stated in Section 503 of the 
Communications Act and the Commission's Rules are described in 
Sec. 1.80(b)(5)(iii). These statutory maxima are effective November 13, 
2000. Forfeitures issued under other sections of the Act are dealt with 
separately in Section III of this note.

       Section II. Adjustment Criteria for Section 503 Forfeitures

                       Upward Adjustment Criteria

    (1) Egregious misconduct.
    (2) Ability to pay/relative disincentive.
    (3) Intentional violation.
    (4) Substantial harm.
    (5) Prior violations of any FCC requirements.
    (6) Substantial economic gain.
    (7) Repeated or continuous violation.

                      Downward Adjustment Criteria

    (1) Minor violation.
    (2) Good faith or voluntary disclosure.
    (3) History of overall compliance.
    (4) Inability to pay.

   Section III. Non-Section 503 Forfeitures That Are Affected by the 
                       Downward Adjustment Factors

    Unlike Section 503 of the Act, which establishes maximum forfeiture 
amounts, other sections of the Act, with one exception, state prescribed 
amounts of forfeitures for violations of the relevant section. These 
amounts are then subject to mitigation or remission under Section 504 of 
the Act. The one exception is Section 223 of the Act, which provides a 
maximum forfeiture per day. For convenience, the Commission will treat 
this amount as if it were a prescribed base amount, subject to downward 
adjustments. The following amounts are adjusted for inflation pursuant 
to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), 28 U.S.C. 2461. 
These non-Section 503 forfeitures may be adjusted downward using the 
``Downward Adjustment Criteria'' shown for Section 503 forfeitures in 
Section II of this note.

    (5) Inflation adjustments to the maximum forfeiture amount. (i) 
Pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-
134 (110 Stat. 1321-358), which amends the Federal Civil Monetary 
Penalty Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Public Law 101-410 (104 Stat. 
890; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note), the statutory maximum amount of a forfeiture 
penalty assessed under this section shall be adjusted for inflation at 
least once every four years using the following formula. First, obtain 
the inflation factor by dividing the CPI for June of the preceding year 
by the CPI for June of the year the forfeiture was last set or adjusted. 
Then, multiply the inflation factor by the statutory maximum amount. 
Round off this result using the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section. Add the rounded result to the statutory maximum forfeiture 
penalty amount. The sum is the statutory maximum amount, adjusted for 
inflation.
    (ii) The rounding rules are as follows:
    (A) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $10 if the penalty is 
from $0 to $100;
    (B) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $100 if the penalty is 
from $101 to $1,000;
    (C) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $1,000 if the penalty 
is from $1,001 to $10,000;
    (D) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $5,000 if the penalty 
is from $10,001 to $100,000;
    (E) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $10,000 if the penalty 
is from $100,001 to $200,000; or
    (F) Round increase to the nearest multiple of $25,000 if the penalty 
is over $200,001.
    (iii) The application of the inflation adjustments required by the 
DCIA, 28 U.S.C. 2461, results in the following adjusted statutory 
maximum forfeitures authorized by the Communications Act:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note to paragraph (b)(5):
    Pursuant to Public Law 104-134, the first inflation adjustment 
cannot exceed 10 percent of the statutory maximum amount.
    (c) Limits on the time when a proceeding may be initiated. (1) In 
the case of a broadcast station, no forfeiture penalty shall be imposed 
if the violation occurred more than 1 year prior to the issuance of the 
appropriate notice or prior to the date of commencement of the current 
license term, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this paragraph, 
``date of commencement of the current license term'' means the date of 
commencement of the last term of license for which the licensee has been 
granted a license by the Commission. A separate license term shall not 
be deemed to have commenced as a result of continuing a license in 
effect under

[[Page 119]]

section 307(c) pending decision on an application for renewal of the 
license.
    (2) In the case of a forfeiture imposed against a carrier under 
sections 202(c), 203(e), and 220(d), no forfeiture will be imposed if 
the violation occurred more than 5 years prior to the issuance of a 
notice of apparent liability.
    (3) In all other cases, no penalty shall be imposed if the violation 
occurred more than 1 year prior to the date on which the appropriate 
notice is issued.
    (d) Preliminary procedure in some cases; citations. No forfeiture 
penalty shall be imposed upon any person under this section, if such 
person does not hold a license, permit, certificate, or other 
authorization issued by the Commission, and if such person is not an 
applicant for a license, permit, certificate, or other authorization 
issued by the Commission, unless, prior to the issuance of the 
appropriate notice, such person: (1) Is sent a citation reciting the 
violation charged; (2) is given a reasonable opportunity (usually 30 
days) to request a personal interview with a Commission official, at the 
field office which is nearest to such person's place of residence; and 
(3) subsequently engages in conduct of the type described in the 
citation. However, a forfeiture penalty may be imposed, if such person 
is engaged in (and the violation relates to) activities for which a 
license, permit, certificate, or other authorization is required or if 
such person is a cable television operator, or in the case of violations 
of section 303(q), if the person involved is a nonlicensee tower owner 
who has previously received notice of the obligations imposed by section 
303(q) from the Commission or the permittee or licensee who uses that 
tower. Paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the issuance of 
citations. When the requirements of this paragraph have been satisfied 
with respect to a particular violation by a particular person, a 
forfeiture penalty may be imposed upon such person for conduct of the 
type described in the citation without issuance of an additional 
citation.
    (e) Alternative procedures. In the discretion of the Commission, a 
forfeiture proceeding may be initiated either: (1) By issuing a notice 
of apparent liability, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, 
or (2) a notice of opportunity for hearing, in accordance with paragraph 
(g).
    (f) Notice of apparent liability. Before imposing a forfeiture 
penalty under the provisions of this paragraph, the Commission or its 
designee will issue a written notice of apparent liability.
    (1) Content of notice. The notice of apparent liability will:
    (i) Identify each specific provision, term, or condition of any act, 
rule, regulation, order, treaty, convention, or other agreement, 
license, permit, certificate, or instrument of authorizationwhich the 
respondent has apparently violated or with which he has failed to 
comply,
    (ii) Set forth the nature of the act or omission charged against the 
respondent and the facts upon which such charge is based,
    (iii) State the date(s) on which such conduct occurred, and
    (iv) Specify the amount of the apparent forfeiture penalty.
    (2) Delivery. The notice of apparent liability will be sent to the 
respondent, by certified mail, at his last known address (see Sec. 1.5).
    (3) Response. The respondent will be afforded a reasonable period of 
time (usually 30 days from the date of the notice) to show, in writing, 
why a forfeiture penalty should not be imposed or should be reduced, or 
to pay the forfeiture. Any showing as to why the forfeiture should not 
be imposed or should be reduced shall include a detailed factual 
statement and such documentation and affidavits as may be pertinent.
    (4) Forfeiture order. If the proposed forfeiture penalty is not paid 
in full in response to the notice of apparent liability, the Commission, 
upon considering all relevant information available to it, will issue an 
order canceling or reducing the proposed forfeiture or requiring that it 
be paid in full and stating the date by which the forfeiture must be 
paid.
    (5) Judicial enforcement of forfeiture order. If the forfeiture is 
not paid, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice for 
collection under section 504(a) of the Communications Act.
    (g) Notice of opportunity for hearing. The procedures set out in 
this paragraph will ordinarily be followed only

[[Page 120]]

when a hearing is being held for some reason other than the assessment 
of a forfeiture (such as, to determine whether a renewal application 
should be granted) and a forfeiture is to be considered as an 
alternative or in addition to any other Commission action. However, 
these procedures may be followed whenever the Commission, in its 
discretion, determines that they will better serve the ends of justice.
    (1) Before imposing a forfeiture penalty under the provisions of 
this paragraph, the Commission will issue a notice of opportunity for 
hearing. The hearing will be a full evidentiary hearing before an 
administrative law judge, conducted under procedures set out in subpart 
B of this part, including procedures for appeal and review of initial 
decisions. A final Commission order assessing a forfeiture under the 
provisions of this paragraph is subject to judicial review under section 
402(a) of the Communications Act.
    (2) If, after a forfeiture penalty is imposed and not appealed or 
after a court enters final judgment in favor of the Commission, the 
forfeiture is not paid, the Commission will refer the matter to the 
Department of Justice for collection. In an action to recover the 
forfeiture, the validity and appropriateness of the order imposing the 
forfeiture are not subject to review.
    (3) Where the possible assessment of a forfeiture is an issue in a 
hearing case to determine which pending application should be granted, 
and the applicant facing a potential forfeiture is dismissed pursuant to 
a settlement agreement or otherwise, and the presiding judge has not 
made a determination on the forfeiture issue, the order of dismissal 
shall be forwarded to the attention of the full Commission. Within the 
time provided by Sec. 1.117, the Commission may, on its own motion, 
proceed with a determination of whether a forfeiture against the 
dismissing applicant is warranted. If the Commission so proceeds, it 
will provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity to respond to 
the forfeiture issue (see paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and make a 
determination under the procedures outlined in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (h) Payment. The forfeiture should be paid by check or money order 
drawn to the order of the Federal Communications Commission. The 
Commission does not accept responsibility for cash payments sent through 
the mails. The check or money order should be mailed to: Federal 
Communications Commission, P.O. Box 73482, Chicago, Illinois 60673-7482.
    (i) Remission and mitigation. In its discretion, the Commission, or 
its designee, may remit or reduce any forfeiture imposed under this 
section. After issuance of a forfeiture order, any request that it do so 
shall be submittedas a petition for reconsideration pursuant to 
Sec. 1.106.
    (j) Effective date. Amendments to paragraph (b) of this section 
implementing Pub. L. No. 101-239 are effective December 19, 1989.

Sec. 1.85  Suspension of operator licenses.

    Whenever grounds exist for suspension of an operator license, as 
provided in Sec. 303(m) of the Communications Act,

[[Page 121]]

the Chief of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, with respect to 
amateur and commercial radio operator licenses, may issue an order 
suspending the operator license. No order of suspension of any 
operator's license shall take effect until 15 days' notice in writing of 
the cause for the proposed suspension has been given to the operator 
licensee, who may make written application to the Commission at any time 
within the said 15 days for a hearing upon such order. The notice to the 
operator licensee shall not be effective until actually received by him, 
and from that time he shall have 15 days in which to mail the said 
application. In the event that physical conditions prevent mailing of 
the application before the expiration of the 15-day period, the 
application shall then be mailed as soon as possible thereafter, 
accompanied by a satisfactory explanation of the delay. Upon receipt by 
the Commission of such application for hearing, said order of suspension 
shall be designated for hearing by the Chief, Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau and said suspension shall be held in abeyance 
until the conclusion of the hearing. Upon the conclusion of said 
hearing, the Commission may affirm, modify, or revoke said order of 
suspension. If the license is ordered suspended, the operator shall send 
his operator license to the Licensing and Technical Analysis Branch, 
Public Safety and Private Wireless Division, Wireless Telecommunications 
Bureau, in Washington, DC, on or before the effective date of the order, 
or, if the effective date has passed at the time notice is received, the 
license shall be sent to the Commission forthwith.

Sec. 1.87  Modification of license or construction permit on motion of the Commission.

    (a) Whenever it appears that a station license or construction 
permit should be modified, the Commission shall notify the licensee or 
permittee in writing of the proposed action and reasons therefor, and 
afford the licensee or permittee at least thirty days to protest such 
proposed order of modification, except that, where safety of life or 
property is involved, the Commission may by order provide a shorter 
period of time.
    (b) The notification required in paragraph (a) of this section may 
be effectuated by a notice of proposed rule making in regard to a 
modification or addition of an FM or television channel to the Table of 
Allotments (Secs. 73.202 and 73.504) or Table of Assignments 
(Sec. 73.606). The Commission shall send a copy of any such notice of 
proposed rule making to the affected licensee or permittee by certified 
mail, return receipt requested.
    (c) Any other licensee or permittee who believes that its license or 
permit would be modified by the proposed action may also protest the 
proposed action before its effective date.
    (d) Any protest filed pursuant to this section shall be subject to 
the requirements of section 309 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, for petitions to deny.
    (e) In any case where a hearing is conducted pursuant to the 
provisions of this section, both the burden of proceeding with the 
introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the 
Commission except that, with respect to any issue that pertains to the 
question of whether the proposed action would modify the license or 
permit of a person filing a protest pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, such burdens shall be as described by the Commission.
    (f) In order to utilize the right to a hearing and the opportunity 
to appear and give evidence upon the issues specified in any hearing 
order, the licensee or permittee, in person or by attorney, shall, 
within the period of time as may be specified in the hearing order, file 
with the Commission a written statement stating that he or she will 
appear at the hearing and present evidence on the matters specified in 
the hearing order.
    (g) The right to file a protest or have a hearing shall, unless good 
cause is shown in a petition to be filed not later than 5 days before 
the lapse of time specified in paragraph (a) or (f) of this section, be 
deemed waived:
    (1) In case of failure to timely file the protest as required by 
paragraph (a) of this section or a written statement as

[[Page 122]]

required by paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) In case of filing a written statement provided for in paragraph 
(f) of this section but failing to appear at the hearing, either in 
person or by counsel.
    (h) Where the right to file a protest or have a hearing is waived, 
the licensee or permittee will be deemed to have consented to the 
modification as proposed and a final decision may be issued by the 
Commission accordingly. Irrespective of any waiver as provided for in 
paragraph (g) of this section or failure by the licensee or permittee to 
raise a substantial and material question of fact concerning the 
proposed modification in his protest, the Commission may, on its own 
motion, designate the proposed modification for hearing in accordance 
with this section.
    (i) Any order of modification issued pursuant to this section shall 
include a statement of the findings and the grounds and reasons 
therefor, shallspecify the effective date of the modification, and shall 
be served on the licensee or permittee.

Sec. 1.88  Predesignation pleading procedure.

    In cases where an investigation is being conducted by the Commission 
in connection with the operation of a broadcast station or a pending 
application for renewal of a broadcast license, the licensee may file a 
written statement to the Commission setting forth its views regarding 
the matters under investigation; the staff, in its discretion, may in 
writing, advise such licensee of the general nature of the 
investigation, and advise the licensee of its opportunity to submit such 
a statement to the staff. Any filing by the licensee will be forwarded 
to the Commission in conjunction with any staff memorandum recommending 
that the Commission take action as a result of the invesigation. Nothing 
in this rule shall supersede the application of our ex parte rules to 
situations described in Sec. 1.1203 of these rules.

(Secs. 4, 303, 307, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082, 1083; (47 U.S.C.

Sec. 1.89  Notice of violations.

    (a) Except in cases of willfulness or those in which public health, 
interest, or safety requires otherwise, any person who holds a license, 
permit or other authorization appearing to have violated any provision 
of the Communications Act or any provision of this chapter will, before 
revocation, suspension, or cease and desist proceedings are instituted, 
be served with a written notice calling these facts to his or her 
attention and requesting a statement concerning the matter. FCC Form 793 
may be used for this purpose. The Notice of Violation may be combined 
with a Notice of Apparent Liability to Monetary Forfeiture. In such 
event, notwithstanding the Notice of Violation, the provisions of 
Sec. 1.80 apply and not those of Sec. 1.89.
    (b) Within 10 days from receipt of notice or such other period as 
may be specified, the recipient shall send a written answer, in 
duplicate, directly to the Commission office originating the official 
notice. If an answer cannot be sent or an acknowledgment cannot be made 
within such 10-day period by reason of illness or other unavoidable 
circumstance, acknowledgment and answer shall be made at the earliest 
practicable date with a satisfactory explanation of the delay.
    (c) The answer to each notice shall be complete in itself and shall 
not be abbreviated by reference to other communications or answers to 
other notices. In every instance the answer shall contain a statement of 
action taken to correct the condition or omission complained of and to 
preclude its recurrence. In addition:
    (1) If the notice relates to violations that may be due to the 
physical or electrical characteristics of transmitting apparatus and any 
new apparatus is to be installed, the answer shall state the date such 
apparatus was ordered, the name of the manufacturer, and the promised 
date of delivery. If the installation of such apparatus requires a 
construction permit, the file number of the application shall be given, 
or if a file number has not been assigned by the Commission, such 
identification shall be given as will permit ready identification of the 
application.

[[Page 123]]

    (2) If the notice of violation relates to lack of attention to or 
improper operation of the transmitter, the name and license number of 
the operator in charge (where applicable) shall be given.

Sec. 1.91  Revocation and/or cease and desist proceedings; hearings.

    (a) If it appears that a station license or construction permit 
should be revoked and/or that a cease and desist order should be issued, 
the Commission will issue an order directing the person to show cause 
why an order of revocation and/or a cease and desist order, as the facts 
may warrant, should not be issued.
    (b) An order to show cause why an order of revocation and/or a cease 
and desist order should not be issued will contain a statement of the 
matters with respect to which the Commissionis inquiring and will call 
upon the person to whom it is directed (the respondent) to appear before 
the Commission at a hearing, at a time and place stated in the order, 
but not less than thirty days after the receipt of such order, and given 
evidence upon the matters specified in the order to show cause. However, 
if safety of life or property is involved, the order to show cause may 
specify a hearing date less than thirty days from the receipt of such 
order.
    (c) To avail himself of such opportunity for hearing, the 
respondent, personally or by his attorney, shall file with the 
Commission, within thirty days of the service of the order or such 
shorter period as may be specified therein, a written appearance stating 
that he will appear at the hearing and present evidence on the matters 
specified in the order. The Commission in its discretion may accept a 
late appearance. However, an appearance tendered after the specified 
time has expired will not be accepted unless accompanied by a petition 
stating with particularity the facts and reasons relied on to justify 
such late filing. Such petition for acceptance of late appearance will 
be granted only if the Commission determines that the facts and reasons 
stated therein constitute good cause for failure to file on time.
    (d) Hearings on the matters specified in such orders to show cause 
shall accord with the practice and procedure prescribed in this subpart 
and subpart B of this part, with the following exceptions: (1) In all 
such revocation and/or cease and desist hearings, the burden of 
proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof 
shall be upon the Commission; and (2) the Commission may specify in a 
show cause order, when the circumstances of the proceeding require 
expedition, a time less than that prescribed in Secs. 1.276 and 1.277 
within which the initial decision in the proceeding shall become 
effective, exceptions to such initial decision must be filed, parties 
must file requests for oral argument, and parties must file notice of 
intention to participate in oral argument.
    (e) Correction of or promise to correct the conditions or matters 
complained of in a show cause order shall not preclude the issuance of a 
cease and desist order. Corrections or promises to correct the 
conditions or matters complained of, and the past record of the 
licensee, may, however, be considered in determining whether a 
revocation and/or a cease and desist order should be issued.
    (f) Any order of revocation and/or cease and desist order issued 
after hearing pursuant to this section shall include a statement of 
findings and the grounds therefor, shall specify the effective date of 
the order, and shall be served on the person to whom such order is 
directed.

Sec. 1.92  Revocation and/or cease and desist proceedings; after waiver of hearing.

    (a) After the issuance of an order to show cause, pursuant to 
Sec. 1.91, calling upon a person to appear at a hearing before the 
Commission, the occurrence of any one of the following events or 
circumstances will constitute a waiver of such hearing and the 
proceeding thereafter will be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.

[[Page 124]]

    (1) The respondent fails to file a timely written appearance as 
prescribed in Sec. 1.91(c) indicating that he will appear at a hearing 
and present evidence on the matters specified in the order.
    (2) The respondent, having filed a timely written appearance as 
prescribed in Sec. 1.91(c), fails in fact to appear in person or by his 
attorney at the time and place of the duly scheduled hearing.
    (3) The respondent files with the Commission, within the time 
specified for a written appearance in Sec. 1.91(c), a written statement 
expressly waiving his rights to a hearing.
    (b) When a hearing is waived under the provisions of paragraph (a) 
(1) or (3) of this section, a written statement signed by the respondent 
denying or seeking to mitigate or justify the circumstances or conduct 
complained of in the order to show cause may be submitted within the 
time specified inSec. 1.91(c). The Commission in its discretion may 
accept a late statement. However, a statement tendered after the 
specified time has expired will not be accepted unless accompanied by a 
petition stating with particularity the facts and reasons relied on to 
justify such late filing. Such petitions for acceptance of a late 
statement will be granted only if the Commission determines that the 
facts and reasons stated therein constitute good cause for failure to 
file on time.
    (c) Whenever a hearing is waived by the occurrence of any of the 
events or circumstances listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge (or the presiding officer if one has been 
designated) shall, at the earliest practicable date, issue an order 
reciting the events or circumstances constituting a waiver of hearing, 
terminating the hearing proceeding, and certifying the case to the 
Commission. Such order shall be served upon the respondent.
    (d) After a hearing proceeding has been terminated pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission will act upon the matters 
specified in the order to show cause in the regular course of business. 
The Commission will determine on the basis of all the information 
available to it from any source, including such further proceedings as 
may be warranted, if a revocation order and/or a cease and desist order 
should issue, and if so, will issue such order. Otherwise, the 
Commission will issue an order dismissing the proceeding. All orders 
specified in this paragraph will include a statement of the findings of 
the Commission and the grounds and reasons therefor, will specify the 
effective date thereof, and will be served upon the respondent.
    (e) Corrections or promise to correct the conditions or matters 
complained of in a show cause order shall not preclude the issuance of a 
cease and desist order. Corrections or promises to correct the 
conditions or matters complained of, and the past record of the 
licensee, may, however, be considered in determining whether a 
revocation and/or a cease and desist order should be issued.

Sec. 1.93  Consent orders.

    (a) As used in this subpart, a ``consent order'' is a formal decree 
accepting an agreement between a party to an adjudicatory hearing 
proceeding held to determine whether that party has violated statutes or 
Commission rules or policies and the appropriate operating Bureau, with 
regard to such party's future compliance with such statutes, rules or 
policies, and disposing of all issues on which the proceeding was 
designated for hearing. The order is issued by the officer designated to 
preside at the hearing or (if no officer has been designated) by the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge.
    (b) Where the interests of timely enforcement or compliance, the 
nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit, the 
Commission, by its operating Bureaus, may negotiate a consent order with 
a party to secure future compliance with the law in exchange for prompt 
disposition of a matter subject to administrative adjudicative 
proceedings. Consent orders may not be negotiated with respect to 
matters which involve a party's basic statutory

[[Page 125]]

qualifications to hold a license (see 47 U.S.C. 308 and 309).

[41 FR 14871, Apr. 8, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 1.94  Consent order procedures.

    (a) Negotiations leading to a consent order may be initiated by the 
operating Bureau or by a party whose possible violations are issues in 
the proceeding. Negotiations may be initiated at any time after 
designation of a proceeding for hearing. If negotiations are initiated 
the presiding officer shall be notified. Parties shall be prepared at 
the initial prehearing conference to state whether they are at that time 
willing to enter negotiations. See Sec. 1.248(c)(7). If either party is 
unwilling to enter negotiations, the hearing proceeding shall proceed. 
If the parties agree to enter negotiations, they will be afforded an 
appropriate opportunity to negotiate before the hearing is commenced.
    (b) Other parties to the proceeding are entitled, but are not 
required, to participate in the negotiations, and may join in any 
agreement which is reached.
    (c) Every agreement shall contain the following:
    (1) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;
    (2) A waiver of the usual procedures for preparation and review of 
an initial decision;
    (3) A waiver of the right of judicial review or otherwise to 
challenge or contest the validity of the consent order;
    (4) A statement that the designation order may be used in construing 
the consent order;
    (5) A statement that the agreement shall become a part of the record 
of the proceeding only if the consent order is signed by the presiding 
officer and the time for review has passed without rejection of the 
order by the Commission;
    (6) A statement that the agreement is for purposes of settlement 
only and that its signing does not constitute an admission by any party 
of any violation of law, rules or policy (see 18 U.S.C. 6002); and
    (7) A draft order for signature of the presiding officer resolving 
by consent, and for the future, all issues specified in the designation 
order.
    (d) If agreement is reached, it shall be submitted to the presiding 
officer or Chief Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, who shall 
either sign the order, reject the agreement, or suggest to the parties 
that negotiations continue on such portion of the agreement as he 
considers unsatisfactory or on matters not reached in the agreement. If 
he rejects the agreement, the hearing shall proceed. If he suggests 
further negotiations, the hearing will proceed or negotiations will 
continue, depending on the wishes of parties to the agreement. If he 
signs the consent order, he shall close the record.
    (e) Any party to the proceeding who has not joined in any agreement 
which is reached may appeal the consent order under Sec. 1.302, and the 
Commission may review the agreement on its own motion under the 
provisions of that section. If the Commission rejects the consent order, 
the proceeding will be remanded for further proceedings. If the 
Commission does not reject the consent order, it shall be entered in the 
record as a final order and is subject to judicial review on the 
initiative only of parties to the proceeding who did not join in the 
agreement. The Commission may revise the agreement and consent order. In 
that event, private parties to the agreement may either accept the 
revision or withdraw from the agreement. If the party whose possible 
violations are issues in the proceeding withdraws from the agreement, 
the consent order will not be issued or made a part of the record, and 
the proceeding will be remanded for further proceedings.
    (f) The provisions of this section shall not alter any existing 
procedure for informal settlement of any matter prior to designation for 
hearing (see, e.g., 47 U.S.C. 208) or for summary decision after 
designation for hearing.
    (g) Consent orders, pleadings relating thereto, and Commission 
orders with respect thereto shall be served on parties to the 
proceeding. Public notice will be given of orders issued by an 
administrative law judge, the Chief Administrative Law Judge, or the 
Commission. Negotiating papers constitute work product, are available to 
parties participating in negotiations, but are

not routinely available for public inspection.

resulting in the consent order if all of the issues in that proceeding 
had been decided against the consenting party and to any further 
sanctions for violation noted as agreed upon in the consent order. The 
Commission shall have the burden of showing that the consent order has 
been violated in some (but not in every) respect. Violation of the 
consent order and the sanctions to be imposed shall be the only issues 
considered in a proceeding concerning such an alleged violation.

which are made by the Commission. Subpart B of part 0 of this chapter 
sets forth all delegations which have been made by rule. Sections 1.102 
through 1.120 set forth procedural rules governing reconsideration and 
review of actions taken pursuant to authority delegated under section 
5(c) of the Communications Act, and reconsideration of actions taken by

decisions of a commissioner, or panel of commissioners following review 
of an initial decision shall be effective 40 days after public release 
of the full text of such final decision.
    (2) If a petition for reconsideration of such final decision is 
filed, the effect of the decision is stayed until 40 days after release 
of the final order disposing of the petition.
    (3) If an application for review of such final decision is filed, or 
if the Commission on its own motion orders the record of the proceeding 
before it for review, the effect of the decision is stayed until the 
Commission's review of the proceeding has been completed.
    (b) Non-hearing and interlocutory actions. (1) Non-hearing or 
interlocutory actions taken pursuant to delegated authority shall, 
unless otherwise ordered by the designated authority, be effective upon 
release of the document containing the full text of such action, or in 
the event such a document is not released, upon release of a public 
notice announcing the action in question.
    (2) If a petition for reconsideration of a non-hearing action is 
filed, the designated authority may in its discretion stay the effect of 
its action pending disposition of the petition for reconsideration. 
Petitions for reconsideration of interlocutory actions will not be 
entertained.
    (3) If an application for review of a non-hearing or interlocutory 
action is filed, or if the Commission reviews the action on its own 
motion, the Commission may in its discretion stay the effect of any such 
action until its review of the matters at issue has been completed.

shall be the date of public notice of such action as that latter date is 
defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules:

[[Page 127]]

Provided, That the Commission may, on its own motion or on motion by any 
party, designate an effective date that is either earlier or later in

an earlier or later effective date shall have no effect on any pleading 
periods.
    (b) Notwithstanding any determinations made under paragraph (a) of 
this section, Commission action shall be deemed final, for purposes of 
seeking reconsideration at the Commission or judicial review, on the 
date of public notice as defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules.

Sec. 1.104  Preserving the right of review; deferred consideration of application for review.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to all final actions taken 
pursuant to delegated authority, including final actions taken by 
members of the Commission's staff on nonhearing matters. They do not 
apply to interlocutory actions of the Chief Administrative Law Judge in 
hearing proceedings, or to hearing designation orders issued under 
delegated authority. See Secs. 0.351, 1.106(a) and 1.115(e).
    (b) Any person desiring Commission consideration of a final action 
taken pursuant to delegated authority shall file either a petition for 
reconsideration or an application for review (but not both) within 30 
days from the date of public notice of such action, as that date is 
defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules. The petition for reconsideration 
will be acted on by the designated authority or referred by such 
authority to the Commission: Provided, That a petition for 
reconsideration of an order designating a matter for hearing will in all 
cases be referred to the Commission. The application for review will in 
all cases be acted upon by the Commission.

    Note: In those cases where the Commission does not intend to release 
a document containing the full text of its action, it will state that 
fact in the public notice announcing its action.

    (c) If in any matter one party files a petition for reconsideration 
and a second party files an application for review, the Commission will 
withhold action on the application for review until final action has 
been taken on the petition for reconsideration.
    (d) Any person who has filed a petition for reconsideration may file 
an application for review within 30 days from the date of public notice 
of such action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules. 
If a petition for reconsideration has been filed, any person who has 
filed an application for review may: (1) Withdraw his application for 
review, or (2) substitute an amended application therefor.

    Note: In those cases where the Commission does not intend to release 
a document containing the full text of its action, it will state that 
fact in the public notice announcing its action.

Sec. 1.106  Petitions for reconsideration.

    (a)(1) Petitions requesting reconsideration of a final Commission 
action will be acted on by the Commission. Petitions requesting 
reconsideration of other final actions taken pursuant to delegated 
authority will be acted on by the designated authority or referred by 
such authority to the Commission. A petition for reconsideration of an 
order designating a case for hearing will be entertained if, and insofar 
as, the petition relates to an adverse ruling with respect to 
petitioner's participation in the proceeding. Petitions for 
reconsideration of other interlocutory actions will not be entertained. 
(For provisions governing reconsideration of Commission action in notice 
and comment rule making proceedings, see Sec. 1.429. This Sec. 1.106 
does not govern reconsideration of such actions.)
    (2) Within the period allowed for filing a petition for 
reconsideration, any party to the proceeding may request the presiding 
officer to certify to the Commission the question as to whether, on 
policy in effect at the time of

[[Page 128]]

designation or adopted since designation, and undisputed facts, a 
hearing should be held. If the presiding officer finds that there is 
substantial doubt, on established policy and undisputed facts, that a 
hearing should be held, he will certify the policy question to the 
Commission with a statement to that effect. No appeal may be filed from 
an order denying such a request. See also, Secs. 1.229 and 1.251.
    (b)(1) Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, any party to the proceeding, or any other person whose 
interests are adversely affected by any action taken by the Commission 
or by the designated authority, may file a petition requesting 
reconsideration of the action taken. If the petition is filed by a 
person who is not a party to the proceeding, it shall state with 
particularitythe manner in which the person's interests are adversely 
affected by the action taken, and shall show good reason why it was not 
possible for him to participate in the earlier stages of the proceeding.
    (2) Where the Commission has denied an application for review, a 
petition for reconsideration will be entertained only if one or more of 
the following circumstances is present:
    (i) The petition relies on facts which relate to events which have 
occurred or circumstances which have changed since the last opportunity 
to present such matters; or
    (ii) The petition relies on facts unknown to petitioner until after 
his last opportunity to present such matters which could not, through 
the exercise of ordinary diligence, have been learned prior to such 
opportunity.
    (3) A petition for reconsideration of an order denying an 
application for review which fails to rely on new facts or changed 
circumstances may be dismissed by the staff as repetitious.
    (c) A petition for reconsideration which relies on facts not 
previously presented to the Commission or to the designated authority 
may be granted only under the following circumstances:
    (1) The facts fall within one or more of the categories set forth in 
Sec. 1.106(b)(2); or
    (2) The Commission or the designated authority determines that 
consideration of the facts relied on is required in the public interest.
    (d)(1) The petition shall state with particularity the respects in 
which petitioner believes the action taken by the Commission or the 
designated authority should be changed. The petition shall state 
specifically the form or relief sought and, subject to this requirement, 
may contain alternative requests.
    (2) The petition for reconsideration shall also, where appropriate, 
cite the findings of fact and/or conclusions of law which petitioner 
believes to be erroneous, and shall state with particularity the 
respects in which he believes such findings and conclusions should be 
changed. The petition may request that additional findings of fact and 
conclusions of law be made.
    (e) Where a petition for reconsideration is based upon a claim of 
electrical interference, under appropriate rules in this chapter, to an 
existing station or a station for which a construction permit is 
outstanding, such petition, in addition to meeting the other 
requirements of this section, must be accompanied by an affidavit of a 
qualified radio engineer. Such affidavit shall show, either by following 
the procedures set forth in this chapter for determining interference in 
the absence of measurements, or by actual measurements made in 
accordance with the methods prescribed in this chapter, that electrical 
interference will be caused to the station within its normally protected 
contour.
    (f) The petition for reconsideration and any supplement thereto 
shall be filed within 30 days from the date of public notice of the 
final Commission action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these 
rules, and shall be served upon parties to the proceeding. The petition 
for reconsideration shall not exceed 25 double spaced typewritten pages. 
No supplement or addition to a petition for reconsideration which has 
not been acted upon by the Commission or by the designated authority, 
filed after expiration of the 30 day period, will be considered except 
upon leave granted upon a separate pleading for leave to

[[Page 129]]

file, which shall state the grounds therefor.
    (g) Oppositions to a petition for reconsideration shall be filed 
within 10 days after the petition is filed, and shall be served upon 
petitioner and parties to the proceeding. Oppositions shall not exceed 
25 double spaced typewritten pages.
    (h) Petitioner may reply to oppositions within seven days after the 
last day for filing oppositions, and any such reply shall be served upon 
parties to the proceeding. Replies shall not exceed 10 double spaced 
typewritten pages, and shall be limited to matters raised in the 
opposition.
    (i) Petitions for reconsideration, oppositions, and replies shall 
conform to the requirements of Secs. 1.49, 1.51, and 1.52 and shall be 
submitted to the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, D.C., 20554.
    (j) The Commission or designated authority may grant the petition 
for reconsideration in whole or in part or may deny the petition. Its 
order will contain a concise statement of the reasons for the action 
taken. Where the petition for reconsideration relates to an instrument 
of authorization granted without hearing, the Commission or designated 
authority will take such action within 90 days after the petition is 
filed.
    (k)(1) If the Commission or the designated authority grants the 
petition for reconsideration in whole or in part, it may, in its 
decision:
    (i) Simultaneously reverse or modify the order from which 
reconsideration is sought;
    (ii) Remand the matter to a bureau or other Commission personnel for 
such further proceedings, including rehearing, as may be appropriate; or
    (iii) Order such other proceedings as may be necessary or 
appropriate.
    (2) If the Commission or designated authority initiates further 
proceedings, a ruling on the merits of the matter will be deferred 
pending completion of such proceedings. Following completion of such 
further proceedings, the Commission or designated authority may affirm, 
reverse, or modify its original order, or it may set aside the order and 
remand the matter for such further proceedings, including rehearing, as 
may be appropriate.
    (3) Any order disposing of a petition for reconsideration which 
reverses or modifies the original order is subject to the same 
provisions with respect to reconsideration as the original order. In no 
event, however, shall a ruling which denies a petition for 
reconsideration be considered a modification of the original order. A 
petition for reconsideration of an order which has been previously 
denied on reconsideration may be dismissed by the staff as repetitious.

    Note: For purposes of this section, the word ``order'' refers to 
that portion of its action wherein the Commission announces its 
judgment. This should be distinguished from the ``memorandum opinion'' 
or other material which often accompany and explain the order.

    (l) No evidence other than newly discovered evidence, evidence which 
has become available only since the original taking of evidence, or 
evidence which the Commission or the designated authority believes 
should have been taken in the original proceeding shall be taken on any 
rehearing ordered pursuant to the provisions of this section.
    (m) The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a condition 
precedent to judicial review of any action taken by the Commission or by 
the designated authority, except where the person seeking such review 
was not a party to the proceeding resulting in the action, or relies on 
questions of fact or law upon which the Commission or designated 
authority has been afforded no opportunity to pass. (See Sec. 1.115(c).) 
Persons in those categories who meet the requirements of this section 
may qualify to seek judicial review by filing a petition for 
reconsideration.
    (n) Without special order of the Commission, the filing of a 
petition for reconsideration shall not excuse any person from complying 
with or obeying any decision, order, or requirement of the Commission, 
or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof. 
However, upon good cause shown, the Commission will stay the 
effectiveness of its order or requirement pending a decision on the

[[Page 130]]

petition for reconsideration. (This paragraph applies only to actions of 
the Commission en banc. For provisions applicable to actions under 
delegated authority, see Sec. 1.102.)
    (o) Petitions for reconsideration of licensing actions, as well as 
oppositions and replies thereto, that are filed with respect to the 
Wireless Radio Services, may be filed electronically via ULS.

    The Commission may, on its own motion, set aside any action made or 
taken by it within 30 days from the date of public notice of such 
action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of these rules.

(Secs. 4, 303, 307, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082, 1083; 47 U.S.C.

Sec. 1.110  Partial grants; rejection and designation for hearing.

    Where the Commission without a hearing grants any application in 
part, or with any privileges, terms, or conditions other than those 
requested, or subject to any interference that may result to a station 
if designated application or applications are subsequently granted, the 
action of the Commission shall be considered as a grant of such 
application unless the applicant shall, within 30 days from the date on 
which such grant is made or from its effective date if a later date is 
specified, file with the Commission a written request rejecting the 
grant as made. Upon receipt of such request, the Commission will vacate 
its original action upon the application and set the application for 
hearing in the same manner as other applications are set for hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1.113  Action modified or set aside by person, panel, or board.

    (a) Within 30 days after public notice has been given of any action 
taken pursuant to delegated authority, the person, panel, or board 
taking the action may modify or set it aside on its own motion.
    (b) Within 60 days after notice of any sanction imposed under 
delegated authority has been served on the person affected, the person, 
panel, or board which imposed the sanction may modify or set it aside on 
its own motion.
    (c) Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review shall 
be directed to the actions as thus modified, and the time for filing 
such pleadings shall be computed from the date upon which public notice 
of the modified action is given or notice of the modified sanction is 
served on the person affected.


<R05>
Sec. 1.115  Application for review of action taken pursuant to delegated authority.

    (a) Any person aggrieved by any action taken pursuant to delegated 
authority may file an application requesting review of that action by 
the Commission. Any person filing an application for review who has not 
previously participated in the proceeding shall include with his 
application a statement describing with particularity the manner in 
which he is aggrieved by the action taken and showing good reason why it 
was not possible for him to participate in the earlier stages of the 
proceeding. Any application for review which fails to make an adequate 
showing in this respect will be dismissed.
    (b)(1) The application for review shall concisely and plainly state 
the questions presented for review with reference, where appropriate, to 
the findings of fact or conclusions of law.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the 
application for review shall specify with particularity, from among the 
following, the factor(s) which warrant Commission consideration of the 
questions presented:
    (i) The action taken pursuant to delegated authority is in conflict 
with statute, regulation, case precedent, or established Commission 
policy.
    (ii) The action involves a question of law or policy which has not 
previously been resolved by the Commission.

[[Page 131]]

    (iii) The action involves application of a precedent or policy which 
should be overturned or revised.
    (iv) An erroneous finding as to an important or material question of 
fact.
    (v) Prejudicial procedural error.
    (3) The application for review shall state with particularity the 
respects in which the action taken by the designated authority should be 
changed.
    (4) The application for review shall state the form of relief sought 
and, subject to this requirement, may contain alternative requests.
    (c) No application for review will be granted if it relies on 
questions of fact or law upon which the designated authority has been 
afforded no opportunity to pass.

    Note: Subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.106, new questions of 
fact or law may be presented to the designated authority in a petition 
for reconsideration.

    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
application for review and any supplemental thereto shall be filed 
within 30 days of publicnotice of such action, as that date is defined 
in section 1.4(b). Opposition to the application shall be filed within 
15 days after the application for review is filed. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, replies to oppositions shall be filed 
within 10 days after the opposition is filed and shall be limited to 
matters raised in the opposition.
    (e)(1) Applications for review of interlocutory rulings made by the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge (see Sec. 0.351) shall be deferred until 
the time when exceptions are filed unless the Chief Judge certifies the 
matter to the Commission for review. A matter shall be certified to the 
Commission only if the Chief Judge determines that it presents a new or 
novel question of law or policy and that the ruling is such that error 
would be likely to require remand should the appeal be deferred and 
raised as an exception. The request to certify the matter to the 
Commission shall be filed within 5 days after the ruling is made. The 
applicaton for review shall be filed within 5 days after the order 
certifying the matter to the Commission is released or such ruling is 
made. Oppositions shall be filed within 5 days after the application is 
filed. Replies to oppositions shall be filed only if they are requested 
by the Commission. Replies (if allowed) shall be filed within 5 days 
after they are requested. A ruling certifying or not certifying a matter 
to the Commission is final: Provided, however, That the Commission may, 
on its own motion, dismiss the application for review on the ground that 
objections to the ruling should be deferred and raised as an exception.
    (2) The failure to file an application for review of an 
interlocutory ruling made by the Chief Administrative Law Judge or the 
denial of such application by the Commission, shall not preclude any 
party entitled to file exceptions to the initial decision from 
requesting review of the ruling at the time when exceptions are filed. 
Such requests will be considered in the same manner as exceptions are 
considered.
    (3) Applications for review of a hearing designation order issued 
under delegated authority shall be deferred until exceptions to the 
initial decision in the case are filed, unless the presiding 
Administrative Law Judge certifies such an application for review to the 
Commission. A matter shall be certified to the Commission only if the 
presiding Administrative Law Judge determines that the matter involves a 
controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for 
difference of opinion and that immediate consideration of the question 
would materially expedite the ultimate resolution of the litigation. A 
ruling refusing to certify a matter to the Commission is not appealable. 
In addition, the Commission may dismiss, without stating reasons, an 
application for review that has been certified, and direct that the 
objections to the hearing designation order be deferred and raised when 
exceptions in the initial decision in the case are filed. A request to 
certify a matter to the Commission shall be filed with the presiding 
Administrative Law Judge within 5 days after the designation order is 
released. Any application for review authorized by the Administrative 
Law Judge shall be filed within 5 days after the order certifying the 
matter to the Commission is released or such a ruling is made. 
Oppositions shall be filed within 5 days after the

[[Page 132]]

application for review is filed. Replies to oppositions shall be filed 
only if they are requested by the Commission. Replies (if allowed) shall 
be filed within 5 days after they are requested.
    (4) Applications for review of final staff decisions issued on 
delegated authority in formal complaint proceedings on the Enforcement 
Bureau's Accelerated Docket (see, e.g., Sec. 1.730) shall be filed 
within 15 days of public notice of the decision, as that date is defined 
in Sec. 1.4(b). These applications for review oppositions and replies in 
Accelerated Docket proceedings shall be served on parties to the 
proceeding by hand or facsimile transmission.
    (f) Applications for review, oppositions, and replies shall conform 
to the requirements of Secs. 1.49, 1.51, and 1.52, and shall be 
submitted to the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC 20554. Except as provided below, applications for review 
and oppositions thereto shall not exceed 25 double-space typewritten 
pages. Applications for review of interlocutory actions in hearing 
proceedings (including designation orders) and oppositions thereto shall 
not exceed 5 double-spaced typewritten pages. When permitted (see 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section), reply pleadings shall not exceed 5 
double-spaced typewritten pages. The application for review shall be 
served upon the parties to the proceeding. Oppositions to the 
application for review shall be served on the person seeking review and 
on parties to theproceeding. When permitted (see paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section), replies to the opposition(s) to the application for 
review shall be served on the person(s) opposing the application for 
review and on parties to the proceeding.
    (g) The Commission may grant the application for review in whole or 
in part, or it may deny the application with or without specifying 
reasons therefor. A petition requesting reconsideration of a ruling 
which denies an application for review will be entertained only if one 
or more of the following circumstances is present:
    (1) The petition relies on facts which related to events which have 
occurred or circumstances which have changed since the last opportunity 
to present such matters; or
    (2) The petition relies on facts unknown to petitioner until after 
his last opportunity to present such matters which could not, through 
the exercise of ordinary diligence, have been learned prior to such 
opportunity.
    (h)(1) If the Commission grants the application for review in whole 
or in part, it may, in its decision:
    (i) Simultaneously reverse or modify the order from which review is 
sought;
    (ii) Remand the matter to the designated authority for 
reconsideration in accordance with its instructions, and, if an 
evidentiary hearing has been held, the remand may be to the person(s) 
who conducted the hearing; or
    (iii) Order such other proceedings, including briefs and oral 
argument, as may be necessary or appropriate.
    (2) In the event the Commission orders further proceedings, it may 
stay the effect of the order from which review is sought. (See 
Sec. 1.102.) Following the completion of such further proceedings the 
Commission may affirm, reverse or modify the order from which review is 
sought, or it may set aside the order and remand the matter to the 
designated authority for reconsideration in accordance with its 
instructions. If an evidentiary hearing has been held, the Commission 
may remand the matter to the person(s) who conducted the hearing for 
rehearing on such issues and in accordance with such instructions as may 
be appropriate.

    Note: For purposes of this section, the word ``order'' refers to 
that portion of its action wherein the Commission announces its 
judgment. This should be distinguished from the ``memorandum opinion'' 
or other material which often accompany and explain the order.

    (i) An order of the Commission which reverses or modifies the action 
taken pursuant to delegated authority is subject to the same provisions 
with respect to reconsideration as an original order of the Commission. 
In no event, however, shall a ruling which denies an application for 
review be considered a modification of the action taken pursuant to 
delegated authority.
    (j) No evidence other than newly discovered evidence, evidence which 
has become available only since the original taking of evidence, or 
evidence

[[Page 133]]

which the Commission believes should have been taken in the original 
proceeding shall be taken on any rehearing ordered pursuant to the 
provisions of this section.
    (k) The filing of an application for review shall be a condition 
precedent to judicial review of any action taken pursuant to delegated 
authority.

Sec. 1.117  Review on motion of the Commission.

    (a) Within 40 days after public notice is given of any action taken 
pursuant to delegated authority, the Commission may on its own motion 
order the record of the proceeding before it for review.
    (b) If the Commission reviews the proceeding on its own motion, it 
may order such further procedure as may be useful to it in its review of 
the action taken pursuant to delegated authority.
    (c) With or without such further procedure, the Commission may 
either affirm, reverse, modify, or set aside the action taken, or remand 
the proceeding to the designated authority for reconsideration in 
accordance with its instructions. If an evidentiary hearinghas been 
held, the Commission may remand the proceeding to the person(s) who 
conducted the hearing for rehearing on such issues and in accordance 
with such instructions as may be appropriate. An order of the Commission 
which reverses or modifies the action taken pursuant to delegated 
authority, or remands the matter for further proceedings, is subject to 
the same provisions with respect to reconsideration as an original 
action of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1.120  Protests of grants without hearing.

    (a) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any 
application: (1) Filed on or after December 12, 1960; (2) filed before 
December 12, 1960, but substantially amended (as defined in the 
applicable provisions of this chapter) on or after that date; or (3) 
filed before December 12, 1960, and not thereafter substantially 
amended, but with respect to which the rules in this chapter provide an 
opportunity for petitions to deny to be filed under section 309 of the 
Communications Act, as amended. See Secs. 1.580 and 1.962.
    (b) Where any instrument of authorization for a radio station, other 
than a license pursuant to a construction permit, has been granted 
without a hearing, any party in interest may file a protest directed to 
such grant and request a hearing on the application granted. Such 
protest shall be signed by the protestant and subscribed to under oath. 
Such protest must be filed with the Commission within 30 days after 
release of the document containing the full text of such action, or in 
case such a document is not released, after release of a ``Public 
Notice'' announcing the action in question and must separately set 
forth:
    (1) Such allegations of fact as will show the protestant to be a 
party in interest, i.e., a person aggrieved or whose interests are 
adversely affected by the Commission's authorization, protest of which 
is sought. Each such allegation of fact shall be separately stated.
    (2) Facts indicating the reasons why the grant was improperly made 
or would otherwise not be in the public interest. Each such reason shall 
be separately stated, and facts in support thereof shall be specified in 
detail and shall not include general non-specific conclusory arguments 
and allegations.
    (3) The specific issues upon which protestant wishes a hearing to be 
held, which issues must relate directly to a matter specified with 
particularity as part of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Arguments and citations of authority may be set forth in a brief 
accompanying the protest but must be excluded from the protest itself.
    (d) Oppositions to protests and briefs in support thereof shall 
contain all material, including that pertinent to the determination 
referred to in paragraph (i) of this section, deemed appropriate to the 
Commission's resolution of the

[[Page 134]]

protest. Such oppositions and supporting briefs must be filed within 10 
days after the filing of such protest, and any replies to such 
oppositions must be filed within 5 days after the filing of the 
oppositions.
    (e) Protests, oppositions, and replies shall be filed with the 
Commission in original and 14 copies and shall be accompanied by proof 
of service upon the grantee or the protestant, as the case may be, and/
or their respective attorneys.
    (f) The Commission may upon consideration of a protest direct either 
the protestant or grantee or both to submit further statements of fact 
under oath relating to the matters raised in the protest.
    (g) Within 30 days from the date of the filing of the protest, the 
Commission will enter findings as to whether such protest meets the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section. If 
the Commission finds that one of these requirements is not met, it will 
dismiss the protest. If the Commission finds that these requirements are 
met, it will designate the application in question for hearing. As to 
issues which the Commission believes present no grounds for setting 
aside the grant, even if the facts alleged were to be proven, the 
Commission may designate such issues for oral argument only. The other 
issues will be designated for evidentiary hearing except that the 
Commission may redraft the issues in accordance with the facts 
orsubstantive matters alleged in the protest and may also specify such 
additional issues as it deems desirable. In any evidentiary hearing 
subsequently held upon issues specified by the Commission, upon its own 
initiative or adopted by it, both the burden of proceeding with the 
introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the 
grantee. With respect to issues resulting from facts set forth in the 
protest and not adopted or specified by the Commission on its own 
motion, both the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence 
and the burden of proof shall be upon the protestant.
    (h) The procedure in such protest hearing shall be governed by the 
provisions of subpart B of this part, except as otherwise provided in 
this section.
    (i) Pending hearing and decision, the effective date of the 
Commission's action to which protest is made shall be postponed to the 
effective date of the Commission's decision after hearing, unless the 
authorization involved is necessary to the maintenance or conduct of an 
existing service or unless the Commission affirmatively finds that the 
public interest requires that the grant remain in effect, in which event 
the Commission shall authorize the applicant to utilize the facilities 
or authorization in question pending the Commission's decision after 
hearing.

                         Participants and Issues


<R05>
Sec. 1.221  Notice of hearing; appearances.

    (a) Upon designation of an application for hearing, the Commission 
issues an order containing the following:
    (1) A statement as to the reasons for the Commission's action.
    (2) A statement as to the matters of fact and law involved, and the 
issues upon which the application will be heard.
    (3) A statement as to the time, place, and nature of the hearing. 
(If the time and place are not specified, the order will indicate that 
the time and place will be specified at a later date.)
    (4) A statement as to the legal authority and jurisdiction under 
which the hearing is to be held.
    (b) The order designating an application for hearing is mailed to 
the applicant by the Reference Information Center of the Consumer and 
Governmental

[[Page 136]]

Affairs Bureau and this order or a summary thereof is published in the 
Federal Register. Reasonable notice of hearing will be given to the 
parties in all proceedings; and, whenever possible, the Commission will 
give at least 60 days notice of comparative hearings.
    (c) In order to avail himself of the opportunity to be heard, the 
applicant, in person or by his attorney, shall, within 20 days of the 
mailing of the notice of designation for hearing by the Reference 
Information Center of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, file 
with the Commission, in triplicate, a written appearance stating that he 
will appear of the date fixed for hearing and present evidence on the 
issues specified in the order. Where an applicant fails to file such a 
written appearance within the time specified, or has not filed prior to 
the expiration of that time a petition to dismiss without prejudice, or 
a petition to accept, for good cause shown, such written appearance 
beyond expiration of said 20 days, the application will be dismissed 
with prejudice for failure to prosecute.
    (d) The Commission will on its own motion name as parties to the 
hearing any person found to be a party in interest.
    (e) In order to avail himself of the opportunity to be heard, any 
person named as a party pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall, 
within 20 days of the mailing of the notice of his designation as a 
party, file with the Commission, in person or by attorney, a written 
appearance in triplicate, stating that he will appear at the hearing. 
Any person so named who fails to file this written statement within the 
time specified, shall, unless good cause for such failure is shown, 
forfeit his hearing rights.
    (f)(1) A fee must accompany each written appearance filed with the 
Commission in certain cases designated for hearing. See subpart G, part 
1 for the amount due. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section, the fee must accompany each written appearance at the time of 
its filing and must be in conformance with the requirements of subpart G 
of the rules. A written appearance that does not contain the proper fee, 
or is not accompanied by a deferral request as per Sec. 1.1115 of the 
rules, shall be dismissed and returned to the applicant by the fee 
processing staff. The presiding judge will be notified of this action 
and may dismiss the applicant with prejudice for failure to prosecute if 
the written appearance is not resubmitted with the correct fee within 
the original 20 day filing period.

    Note: If the parties file a settlement agreement prior to filing the 
Notice of Appearance or simultaneously with it, the hearing fee need not 
accompany the Notice of Appearance. In filing the Notice of Appearance, 
the applicant should clearly indicate that a settlement agreement has 
been filed. (The fact that there are ongoing negotiations that may lead 
to a settlement does not affect the requirement to pay the fee.) If a 
settlement agreement is not effectuated, the Presiding Judge will 
require immediate payment of the fee.

    (2) When a fee is required to accompany a written appearance as 
described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the written appearance 
must also contain FCC Registration Number (FRN) in conformance with 
subpart W of this part. The presiding judge will notify the party filing 
the appearance of the omitted FRN and dismiss the applicant with 
prejudice for failure to prosecute if the written appearance is not 
resubmitted with the FRN within ten (10) business days of the date of 
notification.
    (g) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving applicants for 
new facilities, where the hearing fee was paid before designation of the 
applications for hearing as required by the Public Notice described at 
Sec. 73.3571(c), Sec. 73.3572(d), or Sec. 73.3573(g) of this chapter, a 
hearing fee payment should not be made with the filing of the Notice of 
Appearance.

Sec. 1.223  Petitions to intervene.

    (a) Where, in cases involving applications for construction permits 
and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, the 
Commission has failed to notify and name as a party to

[[Page 137]]

the hearing any person who qualifies as a party in interest, such person 
may acquire the status of a party by filing, under oath and not more 
than 30 days after the publication in the Federal Register of the 
hearing issues or any substantial amendment thereto, a petition for 
intervention showing the basis of its interest. Where such person's 
interest is based upon a claim that a grant of the application would 
cause objectionable interference under applicable provisions of this 
chapter to such person as a licensee or permittee of an existing or 
authorized station, the petition to intervene must be accompanied by an 
affidavit of a qualified radio engineer which shall show, either by 
following the procedures prescribed in this chapter for determining 
interference in the absence of measurements or by actual measurements 
made in accordance with the methods prescribed in this chapter, the 
extent of such interference. Where the person's status as a party in 
interest is established, the petition to intervene will be granted.
    (b) Any other person desiring to participate as a party in any 
hearing may file a petition for leave to intervene not later than 30 
days after the publication in the Federal Register of the full text or a 
summary of the order designating an application for hearing or any 
substantial amendment thereto. The petition must set forth the interest 
of petitioner in the proceedings, must show how such petitioner's 
participation will assist the Commission in the determination of the 
issues in question, must set forth any proposed issues in addition to 
those already designated for hearing, and must be accompanied by the 
affidavit of a person with knowledge as to the facts set forth in the 
petition. The presiding officer, in his discretion, may grant or deny 
such petition or may permit intervention by such persons limited to a 
particular stage of the proceeding.
    (c) Any person desiring to file a petition for leave to intervene 
later than 30 days after the publication in the Federal Register of the 
full text or a summary of the order designating an application for 
hearing or any substantial amendment thereto shall set forth the 
interest of petitioner in the proceeding, show how such 
petitioner'sparticipation will assist the Commission in the 
determination of the issues in question, must set forth any proposed 
issues in addition to those already designated for hearing, and must set 
forth reasons why it was not possible to file a petition within the time 
prescribed by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Such petition 
shall be accompanied by the affidavit of a person with knowledge of the 
facts set forth in the petition, and where petitioner claims that a 
grant of the application would cause objectionable interference under 
applicable provisions of this chapter, the petition to intervene must be 
accompanied by the affidavit of a qualified radio engineer showing the 
extent of such alleged interference according to the methods prescribed 
in paragraph (a) of this section. If, in the opinion of the presiding 
officer, good cause is shown for the delay in filing, he may in his 
discretion grant such petition or may permit intervention limited to 
particular issues or to a particular stage of the proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1.224  Motion to proceed in forma pauperis.

    (a) A motion to proceed in forma pauperis may be filed by an 
individual, a corporation, and unincorporated entity, an association or 
other similar group, if the moving party is either of the following:
    (1) A respondent in a revocation proceeding, or a renewal applicant, 
who cannot carry on his livelihood without the radio license at stake in 
the proceeding; or
    (2) An intervenor in a hearing proceeding who is in a position to 
introduce testimony which is of probable decisional significance, on a 
matter of substantial public interest importance, which cannot, or 
apparently will not, be introduced by other parties to the proceeding, 
and who is not seeking personal financial gain.
    (b) In the case of a licensee, the motion to proceed in forma 
pauperis shall

[[Page 138]]

contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the moving 
party is eligible under paragraph (a) of this section and that he 
cannot, because of his poverty, pay the expenses of litigation and still 
be able to provide himself and his dependents with the necessities of 
life. Such allegations of fact shall be supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The information 
submitted shall detail the income and assets of the individual and his 
financial obligations and responsibilities, and shall contain an 
estimate of the cost of participation in the proceeding. Personal 
financial information may be submitted to the presiding officer in 
confidence.
    (c)(1) In the case of an individual intervenor, the motion to 
proceed in forma pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact 
sufficient to show that he is eligible under paragraph (a) of this 
section and that he has dedicated financial resources to sustain his 
participation which are reasonable in light of his personal resources 
and other demands upon them but are inadequate for effective 
participation in the proceeding. Such allegations of fact shall be 
supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge 
thereof. The information submitted shall detail the income and assets of 
the individual and his immediate family and his financial obligations 
and responsibilities, and shall contain an estimate of the cost of 
participation. Personal financial information may be submitted to the 
presiding officer in confidence.
    (2) In the case of an intervening group, the motion to proceed in 
forma pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to 
show that the moving party is eligible under paragraph (a) of this 
section and that it cannot pay the expenses of litigation and still be 
able to carry out the activities and purposes for which it was 
organized. Such allegations of fact shall be supported by affidavit of 
the President and Treasurer of the group, and/or by other persons having 
personal knowledge thereof. The information submitted shall include a 
copy of the corporate charter or other documents that describe the 
activities and purposes of the organization; a currentbalance sheet and 
profit and loss statement; facts showing, under all the circumstances, 
that it would not be reasonable to expect added resources of individuals 
composing the group to be pooled to meet the expenses of participating 
in the proceeding; and an estimate of the cost of participation. 
Personal financial information pertaining to members of the group may be 
submitted to the presiding officer in confidence.
    (d) If the motion is granted, the presiding officer may direct that 
a free copy of the transcript of testimony be made available to the 
moving party and may relax the rules of procedure in any manner which 
will ease his financial burden, is fair to other parties to the 
proceeding, and does not involve the payment of appropriated funds to a 
party.

Sec. 1.225  Participation by non-parties; consideration of communications.

    (a) Any person who wishes to appear and give evidence on any matter 
and who so advises the Secretary, will be notified by the Secretary if 
that matter is designated for hearing. In the case of requests bearing 
more than one signature, notice of hearing will be given to the person 
first signing unless the request indicates that such notice should be 
sent to someone other than such person.
    (b) No person shall be precluded from giving any relevant, material, 
and competent testimony at a hearing because he lacks a sufficient 
interest to justify his intervention as a party in the matter.
    (c) When a hearing is held, no communication will be considered in 
determining the merits of any matter unless it has been received into 
evidence. The admissibility of any communication shall be governed by 
the applicable rules of evidence, and no communication shall be 
admissible on the basis of a stipulation unless Commission counsel as 
well as counsel for all of the parties shall join in such stipulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.227  Consolidations.

    (a) The Commission, upon motion or upon its own motion, will, where 
such action will best conduce to the proper

[[Page 139]]

dispatch of business and to the ends of justice, consolidate for 
hearing:
    (1) Any cases which involve the same applicant or involve 
substantially the same issues, or
    (2) Any applications which present conflicting claims, except where 
a random selection process is used.
    (b)(1) In broadcast cases, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section, and except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1601, et seq., 
no application will be consolidated for hearing with a previously filed 
application or applications unless such application, or such application 
as amended, if amended so as to require a new file number, is 
substantially complete and tendered for filing by the close of business 
on the day preceding the day designated by Public Notice as the day any 
one of the previously filed applications is available and ready for 
processing.
    (2) In other than broadcast, common carrier, and safety and special 
radio services cases, any application that is mutually exclusive with 
another application or applications already designated for hearing will 
be consolidated for hearing with such other application or applications 
only if the later application in question has been filed within 5 days 
after public notice has been given in the Federal Register of the 
Commission's order which first designated for hearing the prior 
application or applications with which such application is in conflict.
    (3) Common carrier cases: (i) General rule. Where an application is 
mutually exclusive with a previously filed application, the second 
application will be entitled to comparative consideration with the first 
or entitled to be included in a random selection process, only if the 
second has been properly filed at least one day before the Commission 
takes action on the first application. Specifically, the later filed 
application must have been received by the Commission, in a condition 
acceptable for filing, before the close of business on the day prior to 
the grant date or designation date of the earlier filed application.
    (ii) Domestic public fixed and public mobile. See Rule Sec. 21.31 of 
this chapter for the requirements as to mutually exclusive applications. 
See also Rule Sec. 21.23 of this chapter for the requirements as to 
amendments of applications.
    (iii) Public coast stations (Maritime mobile service). See paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section.
    (4) This paragraph applies when mutually exclusive applications 
subject to section 309(b) of the Communications Act and not subject to 
competitive bidding procedures pursuant to Sec. 1.2102 of this chapter 
are filed in the Private Radio Services, or when there are more such 
applications for initial licenses than can be accommodated on available 
frequencies. Except for applications filed under part 101, subparts H 
and O, Private Operational Fixed Microwave Service, and applications for 
high seas public coast stations (see Secs. 80.122(b)(1) (first 
sentence), 80.357, 80.361, 80.363(a)(2), 80.371(a), (b), and (d), and 
80.374 of this chapter) mutual exclusivity will occur if the later 
application or applications are received by the Commission's offices in 
Gettysburg, PA (or Pittsburgh, PA for applications requiring the fees 
set forth at part 1, subpart G of the rules) in a condition acceptable 
for filing within 30 days after the release date of public notice 
listing the first prior filed application (with which subsequent 
applications are in conflict) as having been accepted for filing or 
within such other period as specified by the Commission. For 
applications in the Private Operational Fixed Microwave Service, mutual 
exclusivity will occur if two or more acceptable applications that are 
in conflict are filed on the same day. Applications for high seas public 
coast stations will be processed on a first come, first served basis, 
with the first acceptable application cutting off the filing rights of 
subsequent, conflicting applications. Applications for high seas public 
coast stations received on the same day will be treated as 
simultaneously filed and, if granting more than one would result in 
harmful interference, must be resolved through settlement or technical 
amendment.
    (5) Any mutually exclusive application filed after the date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4)

[[Page 140]]

of this section will be dismissed without prejudice and will be eligible 
for refiling only after a final decision is rendered by the Commission 
with respect to the prior application or applications or after such 
application or applications are dismissed or removed from the hearing 
docket.
    (6) An application which is mutually exclusive with an application 
for renewal of license of a broadcast station filed on or before May 1, 
1995 will be designated for comparative hearing with such license 
renewal application if it is substantially complete and tendered for 
filing no later than the date prescribed in Sec. 73.3516(e).

<R05>
Sec. 1.229  Motions to enlarge, change, or delete issues.

    (a) A motion to enlarge, change or delete the issues may be filed by 
any party to a hearing. Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this 
section, such motions must be filed within 15 days after the full text 
or a summary of the order designating the case for hearing has been 
published in the Federal Register.
    (b)(1) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving applicants for 
only new facilities, such motions shall be filed within 30 days of the 
release of the designation order, except that persons not named as 
parties to the proceeding in the designation order may file such motions 
with their petitions to intervene up to 30 days after publication of the 
full text or a summary of the designation order in the Federal Register. 
(See Sec. 1.223 of this part).
    (2) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving renewal 
applicants, such motions shall be filed within 30 days after publication 
of the full text or a summary of the designation order in the Federal 
Register.
    (3) Any person desiring to file a motion to modify the issues after 
the expiration of periods specified in paragraphs (a), (b)(1), and 
(b)(2), of this section, shall set forth the reason why it was not 
possible to file the motion within the prescribed period. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the motion will be granted 
only if good cause is shown for the delay in filing. Motions for 
modifications of issues which are based on new facts or newly discovered 
facts shall be filed within 15 days after such facts are discovered by 
the moving party.
    (c) In the absence of good cause for late filing of a motion to 
modify the issues, the motion to enlarge will be considered fully on its 
merits if (and onlyif) initial examination of the motion demonstrates 
that it raises a question of probable decisional significance and such 
substantial public interest importance as to warrant consideration in 
spite of its untimely filing.
    (d) Such motions, opposition thereto, and replies to oppositions 
shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to support the 
action requested. Such allegations of fact, except for those of which 
official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavits of a 
person or persons having personal knowledge thereof. The failure to file 
an opposition or a reply will not necessarily be construed as an 
admission of any fact or argument contained in a pleading.
    (e) In comparative broadcast proceedings involving applicants for 
only new facilities, in addition to the showing with respect to the 
requested issue modification described in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the party requesting the enlargement of issues against an applicant in 
the proceeding shall identify those documents the moving party wishes to 
have produced and any other discovery procedures the moving party wishes 
to employ in the event the requested issue is added to the proceeding.
    (1) In the event the motion to enlarge issues is granted, the 
Commission or delegated authority acting on the motion will also rule on 
the additional discovery requests, and, if granted, such additional 
discovery will be scheduled to be completed within 30 days of the action 
on the motion.
    (2) The moving party may file supplemental discovery requests on the 
basis of information provided in responsive pleadings or discovered as a 
result of

[[Page 141]]

initial discovery on the enlarged issue. The grant or denial of any such 
supplemental requests and the timing of the completion of such 
supplemental discovery are subject to the discretion of the presiding 
judge.
    (3) The 30-day time limit for completion of discovery on enlarged 
issues shall not apply where the persons subject to such additional 
discovery are not parties to the proceeding. In such case, additional 
time will be required to afford such persons adequate notice of the 
discovery procedures being employed.
    (f) In any case in which the presiding judge or the Commission 
grants a motion to enlarge the issues to inquire into allegations that 
an applicant made misrepresentations to the Commission or engaged in 
other misconduct during the application process, the enlarged issues 
include notice that, after hearings on the enlarged issue and upon a 
finding that the alleged misconduct occurred and warrants such penalty, 
in addition to or in lieu of denying the application, the applicant may 
be liable for a forfeiture of up to the maximum statutory amount. See 47 
U.S.C. 503(b)(2)(A).

Sec. 1.244  Designation of a settlement judge.

    (a) In broadcast comparative cases involving applicants for only new 
facilities, the applicants may request the appointment of a settlement 
judge to facilitate the resolution of the case by settlement.
    (b) Where all applicants in the case agree that such procedures may 
be beneficial, such requests may be filed with the presiding judge no 
later than 15 days prior to the date scheduled by the presiding judge 
for the commencement of hearings. The presiding judge shall

suspend the procedural dates in the case and forward the request to the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge for action.
    (c) If, in the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge, it 
appears that the appointment of a settlement judge will facilitate the 
settlement of the case, the Chief Judge will appoint a ``neutral'' as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 581 and 583(a) to act as the settlement judge.
    (1) The parties may request the appointment of a settlement judge of 
their own choosing so long as that person is a ``neutral'' as defined in 
5 U.S.C. 581.
    (2) The appointment of a settlement judge in a particular case is 
subject to the approval of all the applicants in the proceeding. See 5 
U.S.C. 583(b).
    (3) The Commission's Administrative Law Judges are eligible to act 
as settlement judges, except that an Administrative Law Judge will not 
be appointed as a settlement judge in any case in which the 
Administrative Law Judge also acts as the presiding officer.
    (4) Other members of the Commission's staff who qualify as neutrals 
may be appointed as settlement judges, except that staff members whose 
duties include drafting, review, and/or recommendations in adjudicatory 
matters pending before the Commission shall not be appointed as 
settlement judges.
    (d) The settlement judge shall have the authority to require 
applicants to submit their Standardized Integration Statements and/or 
their written direct cases for review. The settlement judge may also 
meet with the applicants and/or their counsel, individually and/or at 
joint conferences, to discuss their cases and the cases of their 
competitors. All such meetings will be off-the-record, and the 
settlement judge may express an opinion as to the relative comparative 
standing of the applicants and recommend possible means to resolve the 
proceeding by settlement. The proceedings before the settlement judge 
shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of 5 U.S.C. 574. 
Moreover, no statements, offers of settlement, representations or 
concessions of the parties or opinions expressed by the settlement judge 
will be admissible as evidence in any Commission licensing proceeding.

and desires to withdraw from the case, he shall notify the Commission of 
his withdrawal at least 7 days prior to the date set for hearing.
    (b) Any party may request the presiding officer to withdraw on the 
groundsof personal bias or other disqualification.
    (1) The person seeking disqualification shall file with the

if he believes himself not disqualified, shall so rule and proceed with 
the hearing.
    (3) The person seeking disqualification may appeal a ruling of 
disqualification, and, in that event, shall do so at the time the ruling

certify the question, together with the affidavit and any response filed 
in connection therewith, to the Commission. The hearing shall be 
suspended pending a ruling on the question by the Commission.
    (5) The Commission may rule on the question without hearing, or it 
may require testimony or argument on the issues raised.

                          Prehearing Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 1.246  Admission of facts and genuineness of documents.

    (a) Within 20 days after the time for filing a notice of appearance 
has expired; or within 20 days after the release of an order adding 
parties to the proceeding (see Secs. 1.223 and 1.227) or changing the 
issues (see Sec. 1.229); or within such shorter or longer time as the 
presiding officer may allow on motion or notice, a party may serve upon 
any other party a written request for the admission by the latter of the 
genuineness of any relevant documents identified in and exhibited by a 
clear copy with the request or of the truth of any relevant matters of 
fact set forth in the request.
    (b) Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be 
deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request, not 
less than 10 days after service thereof, or within such shorter or 
longer time as the presiding officer may allow on motion or notice, the 
party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting 
the admission either: (1) A sworn statement denying specifically the 
matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail 
the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny those matters, or (2) 
written objections on the ground that some or all of the requested 
admissions are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise 
improper in whole or in part. If written objections to a part of the 
request are made, the remainder of the request shall be answered within 
the period designated in the request. A denial shall fairly meet the 
substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that 
a party deny only a part or a qualification of a matter of which an 
admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and 
deny only the remainder.
    (c) A copy of the request and of any answer shall be served by the 
party filing on all other parties to the proceeding and upon the 
presiding officer.
    (d) Written objections to the requested admissions may be ruled upon 
by the presiding officer without additional pleadings.

or at the request of any party, may direct the parties or their 
attorneys to appear at a specified time and place for a conference prior 
to or during the course of a hearing, or to submit suggestions in 
writing, for the purpose of considering any of the matters set forth in

be scheduled 30 days after the effective date of the order designating a 
case for hearing, unless good cause is shown for scheduling such 
conference at a later date.
    (2) Except as circumstances otherwise require, the presiding officer 
shall allow a reasonable period prior to commencement of the hearing for 
the orderly completion of all prehearing procedures, including 
discovery, and for the submission and disposition of all prehearing 
motions. Where the circumstances so warrant, the presiding officer 
shall, promptly after the hearing is ordered, call a preliminary 
prehearing conference, to inquire into the use of available procedures 
contemplated by the parties and the time required for their completion, 
to formulate a schedule for their completion, and to set a date for 
commencement of the hearing.

[[Page 144]]

    (c) In conferences held, or in suggestions submitted, pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the following matters, among 
others, may be considered:
    (1) The necessity or desirability of simplification, clarification,

    (v) Network programming;
    (vi) Assumptions regarding the availability of networks proposed;

(see Sec. 1.93), the parties shall be prepared to state at the initial 
prehearing conference whether they are at that time willing to enter 
negotiations leading to a consent agreement.
    (d) This paragraph applies to broadcast proceedings only.
    (1) At the prehearing conference prescribed by this section, the 
parties to the proceeding shall be prepared to discuss the advisability 
of reducing any or all phases of their affirmative direct cases to 
written form.
    (2) In hearings involving applications for new, improved and changed 
facilities and in comparative hearings involving only applications for 
new facilities, where it appears that it will contribute significantly 
to the disposition of the proceeding for the parties to submit all or 
any portion of their affirmative direct cases in writing, the presiding 
officer may, in his discretion, require them to do so.
    (3) In other broadcast proceedings, where it appears that it will 
contributesignificantly to the disposition of the proceeding for the 
parties to submit all or any portion of their affirmative direct cases 
in writing, it is the policy of the Commission to encourage them to do 
so. However, the phase or phases of the proceeding to be submitted in 
writing, the dates for the exchange of the written material, and other 
limitations upon the effect of adopting the written case procedure (such 
as whether material ruled out as incompetent may be restored by other 
competent testimony) is to be left to agreement of the parties as 
approved by the presiding officer.
    (4) In broadcast comparative cases involving applicants for only new 
facilities, oral testimony and cross examination will be permitted only 
where, in the discretion of the presiding judge, material issues of 
decisional fact cannot be resolved without oral evidentiary hearing 
procedures or the public interest otherwise requires oral evidentiary 
proceedings.
    (e) An official transcript of all conferences shall be made.
    (f) The presiding officer may, upon the written request of a party 
or parties, approve the use of a speakerphone as a means of attendance 
at a prehearing conference if such use is found to conduce to the proper 
dispatch of business and the ends of justice.

Sec. 1.249  Prehearing statement.

    Immediately upon convening the formal hearing in any proceeding, the 
presiding officer shall enter upon the record a statement reciting all

govern the course of the proceeding.

    For provisions relating to prehearing discovery and preservation of 
admissible evidence, see Secs. 1.311 through 1.325.

[33 FR 463, Jan. 12, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 1.251  Summary decision.

    (a)(1) Any party to an adjudicatory proceeding may move for summary 
decision of all or any of the issues set for hearing. The motion shall 
be filed at least 20 days prior to the date set for commencement of the 
hearing. The party filing the motion may not rest upon mere allegations 
or denials but must show, by affidavit or by other materials subject to 
consideration by the presiding officer, that there is no genuine issue 
of material fact for determination at the hearing.
    (2) With the permission of the presiding officer, or upon his 
invitation, a motion for summary decision may be filed at any time 
before or after the commencement of the hearing. No appeal from an order 
granting or denying a request for permission to file a motion for 
summary decision shall be allowed. If the presiding officer authorizes a 
motion for summary decision after the commencement of the hearing, 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on those issues which 
the moving party believes can be resolved shall be attached to the 
motion, and any other party may file findings of fact and conclusions of 
law as an attachment to pleadings filed by him pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Within 14 days after a motion for summary decision is filed, any 
other party to the proceeding may file an opposition or a countermotion 
for summary decision. A party opposing the motion may not rest upon mere 
allegations or denials but must show, by affidavit or by other materials 
subject to consideration by the presiding officer, that there is a 
genuine issue of material fact for determination at the hearing, that he 
cannot, for good cause, present by affidavit or otherwise facts 
essential to justify his opposition, or that summary decision is 
otherwise inappropriate.
    (c) Affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show 
affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters 
stated therein.
    (d) The presiding officer may, in his discretion, set the matter for 
argument and call for the submission of proposed findings, conclusions, 
briefs or memoranda of law. The presiding officer, giving appropriate 
weight to the nature of the proceeding, the issue or issues, the proof, 
and to the need for cross-examination, may grant a motion for summary 
decision to the extent that the pleadings, affidavits, materials 
obtained by discovery or otherwise, admissions, or matters officially 
noticed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and 
that a party is otherwise entitled to summary decision. If it appears 
from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot, for 
good cause shown, present by affidavit or otherwise facts essential to 
justify his opposition, the presiding officer may deny the motion, may 
order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to 
be had, or make such other order as is just.
    (e) If all of the issues (or a dispositive issue) are determined on 
a motion for summary decision no hearing (or further hearing) will be 
held. The presiding officer will issue a Summary Decision, which is 
subject to appeal or review in the same manner as an Initial Decision. 
See Secs. 1.271 through 1.282. If some of the issues only (including no 
dispositive issue) are decided on a motion for summary decision, or if 
the

[[Page 146]]

motion is denied, the presiding officer will issue a memorandum opinion 
and order, interlocutory in character, and the hearing will proceed on 
the remaining issues. Appeal from interlocutory rulings is governed by 
Sec. 1.301.
    (f) The presiding officer may take any action deemed necessary to 
assure that summary decision procedures are not abused. He may rule in 
advance of a motion that the proceeding is not appropriate for summary 
decision, and may take such other measures as are necessary to prevent 
any unwarranted delay.
    (1) Should it appear to the satisfaction of the presiding officer 
that a motion for summary decision has been presented in bad faith or 
solely for the purpose of delay, or that such a motion is patently 
frivolous, he will enter a determination to that effect upon the record.
    (2) If, on making such determination, the presiding officer 
concludes that the facts warrant disciplinary action against an 
attorney, he will certify the matter to the Commission with his findings 
and recommendations, for consideration under Sec. 1.24.
    (3) If, on making such determination, the presiding officer 
concludes that the facts warrant a finding of bad faith on the part of a 
party to the proceeding, he will certify the matter to the Commission, 
with his findings and recommendations, for a determination as to whether 
the facts warrant addition of an issue as to the character 
qualifications of that party.

hearing sessions are to be held.
    (c) If the Commission specifies that a hearing is to commence in the 
District of Columbia, it shall be moved therefrom only by order of the 
Commission.
    (d) If the Commission specifies that a hearing is to commence at a 
field location, all appropriate proceedings will be completed at such 
location before the hearing is moved therefrom. When such proceedings 
are completed, the presiding officer may move the hearing from the field 
location specified to another appropriate field location or to the 
District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 1.254  Nature of the hearing; burden of proof.

    Any hearing upon an application shall be a full hearing in which the 
applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to

introduction of evidence upon any issue specified by the Commission,as 
well as the burden of proof upon all such issues, shall be upon the

for any instrument of authorization which the Commission is empowered to 
issue, the complainant, petitioner, or applicant, as the case may be, 
shall, unless the Commission otherwise orders, open and close. At 
hearings on protests, the protestant opens and closes the proceedings in 
case the issues are not specifically adopted by the Commission; 
otherwise the grantee does so. At hearings on orders to show cause, to 
cease and desist, to revoke or modify a station license under sections 
312 and 316 of the Communications Act, or other like proceedings 
instituted by the Commission, the Commission shall open and close.
    (b) At all hearings under Title II of the Communications Act, other 
than hearings on formal complaints, petitions, or applications, the 
respondent shall open and close unless otherwise specified by the 
Commission.
    (c) In all other cases, the Commission or presiding officer shall 
designate the order of presentation. Intervenors shall follow the party 
in whose behalf intervention is made, and in all cases where the 
intervention is not in support of an

[[Page 147]]

original party, the Commission or presiding officer shall designate at 
what stage such intervenors shall be heard.

Sec. 1.258  Closing of the hearing.

    The record of hearing shall be closed by an announcement to that 
effect at the hearing by the presiding officer when the taking of 
testimony has been concluded. In the discretion of the presiding 
officer, the record may be closed as of a future specified date in order 
to permit the admission into the record of exhibits to be prepared: 
Provided, The parties to the proceeding stipulate on the record that 
they waive the opportunity to cross-examine or present evidence with 
respect to such exhibits. The record in any hearing which has been 
adjourned may not be closed by such officer prior to the day on which 
the hearing is to resume, except upon 10 days' notice to all parties to 
the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1.260  Certification of transcript.

    After the close of the hearing, the complete transcript of

Commission. Notice of such certification shall be served on all parties 
to the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 1.261  Corrections to transcript.

    At any time during the course of the proceeding, or as directed by 
the presiding officer, but not later than 10 days after the date of 
notice of certification of the transcript, any party to the proceeding 
may file with the presiding officer a motion requesting the correction 
of the transcript, which motion shall be accompanied by proof of service 
thereof upon all other parties to the proceeding. Within 5 days after 
the filing of such a motion, other parties may file a pleading in 
support of or in opposition to such motion. Thereafter, the presiding 
officer shall, by order, specify the corrections to be made in the 
transcript, and a copy of the order shall be served upon all parties and 
made a part of the record. The presiding officer, on his own initiative, 
may specify corrections to be made in the transcript on 5 days' notice.

to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions, briefs, or memoranda 
of law. Such proposed findings of fact, conclusions, briefs, and 
memoranda of law shall be filed within 20 days after the record is 
closed, unless additional time is allowed.
    (b) All pleadings and other papers filed pursuant to this section 
shall beaccompanied by proof of service thereof upon all other counsel 
in the proceeding; if a party is not represented by counsel, proof of 
service upon such party shall be made.
    (c) In the absence of a showing of good cause therefor, the failure 
to file proposed findings of fact, conclusions, briefs, or memoranda of 
law, when directed to do so, may be deemed a waiver of the right to 
participate further in the proceeding.

[[Page 148]]

where the proceeding is terminated on motion (see Sec. 1.302), the 
presiding officer shall prepare an initial (or recommended) decision, 
which shall be transmitted to the Secretary of the Commission. In the 
case of rate making proceedings conducted under sections 201-205 of the 
Communications Act, the presumption shall be that the presiding officer

where the Commission finds upon the record that due and timely execution 
of its functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires, the 
Commission may direct that the record in a pending proceeding be

imperatively and unavoidably so requires, the Commission may (as an 
alternative) order that the hearing be continued by another presiding 
officer designated in accordance with Sec. 1.241 or by the Commission 
itself. In that event, the officer continuing the hearing shall, upon 
completion of the hearing, certify the proceeding to the Commission for 
an initial or final decision. Unless the Commission finds upon the 
record that due and timely execution of its functions imperatively and 
unavoidably requires that no recommended decision be issued, the officer 
continuing the hearing shall prepare and file a recommended decision to 
be released with the Commission's initial or final decision. If all the 
parties expressly consent, and if the Commission does not order 
otherwise, the officer continuing the hearing may prepare an initial 
decision.

<R05>
Sec. 1.276  Appeal and review of initial decision.

    (a)(1) Within 30 days after the date on which public release of the 
full text of an initial decision is made, or such other time as the 
Commission may specify, any of the parties may appeal to the Commission 
by filing exceptions to the initial decision, and such decision shall 
not become effective and shall then be reviewed by the Commission, 
whether or not such exceptions may thereafter be withdrawn. It is the 
Commission's policy that extensions of time for filing exceptions shall 
not be routinely granted.
    (2) Exceptions shall be consolidated with the argument in a 
supporting brief and shall not be submitted separately. As used in this 
subpart, the term exceptions means the document consolidating the 
exceptions and supporting brief. The brief shall contain (i) a table of 
contents, (ii) a table of citations, (iii) a concise statement of the 
case, (iv) a statement of the questions of law presented, and (v) the 
argument, presenting clearly the points of fact and law relied upon in 
support of the position taken on each question, with specific reference 
to the record and all legal or other materials relied on.
    (b) The Commission may on its own initiative provide, by order 
adopted notlater than 20 days after the time for filing exceptions 
expires, that an initial decision shall not become final, and that it 
shall be further reviewed or considered by the Commission.
    (c) In any case in which an initial decision is subject to review in 
accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Commission 
may, on its own initiative or upon appropriate requests by a party, take 
any one or more of the following actions:
    (1) Hear oral argument on the exceptions;
    (2) Require the filing of briefs;
    (3) Prior to or after oral argument or the filing of exceptions or 
briefs, reopen the record and/or remand the proceedings to the presiding 
officer to take further testimony or evidence;
    (4) Prior to or after oral argument or the filing of exceptions or 
briefs, remand the proceedings to the presiding officer to make further 
findings or conclusions; and
    (5) Prior to or after oral argument or the filing of exceptions or 
briefs, issue, or cause to be issued by the presiding officer, a 
supplemental initial decision.
    (d) No initial decision shall become effective before 50 days after 
public release of the full text thereof is made unless otherwise ordered 
by the Commission. The timely filing of exceptions, the further review 
or consideration of an initial decision on the Commission's initiative, 
or the taking of action by the Commission under paragraph (c) of this 
section shall stay the effectiveness of the initial decision until the 
Commission's review thereof

[[Page 150]]

has been completed. If the effective date of an initial decision falls 
within any further time allowed for the filing of exceptions, it shall 
be postponed automatically until 30 days after time for filing 
exceptions has expired.
    (e) If no exceptions are filed, and the Commission has not ordered 
the review of an initial decision on its initiative, or has not taken 
action under paragraph (c) of this section, the initial decision shall 
become effective, an appropriate notation to that effect shall be 
entered in the docket of the case, and a ``Public Notice'' thereof shall 
be given by the Commission. The provisions of Sec. 1.108 shall not apply 
to such public notices.
    (f) When any party fails to file exceptions within the specified 
time to an initial decision which proposes to deny its application, such 
party shall be deemed to have no interest in further prosecution of its 
application, and its application may be dismissed with prejudice for 
failure to prosecute.

<R05>
Sec. 1.277  Exceptions; oral arguments.

    (a) The consolidated supporting brief and exceptions to the initial 
decision (see Sec. 1.276(a)(2)), including rulings upon motions or 
objections, shall point out with particularity alleged material errors 
in the decision or ruling and shall contain specific references to the 
page or pages of the transcript of hearing, exhibit or order if any on 
which the exception is based. Any objection not saved by exception filed 
pursuant to this section is waived.
    (b) Within the period of time allowed in Sec. 1.276(a) for the 
filing of exceptions, any party may file a brief in support of an 
initial decision, in whole or in part, which may contain exceptions and 
which shall be similar in form to the brief in support of exceptions 
(see Sec. 1.276(a)(2)).
    (c) Except by special permission, the consolidated brief and 
exceptions will not be accepted if the exceptions and argument exceed 25 
double-spaced typewritten pages in length. (The table of contents and 
table of citations are not counted in the 25 page limit; however, all 
other contents of and attachments to the brief are counted.) Within 10 
days, or such other time as the Commission or delegated authority may 
specify, after the time for filing exceptions has expired, any other 
party may file a reply brief, which shall not exceed 25 double spaced 
typewritten pages and shall contain a table of contents and a table of 
citations. If exceptions have been filed, any party may request oral 
argument not later than five days after the time for filing replies to 
the exceptions has expired. The Commission or delegated authority, in 
its discretion, will grant oral argument by order only in cases where 
such oralpresentations will assist in the resolution of the issues 
presented. Within five days after release of an order designating an 
initial decision for oral argument, as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, any party who wishes to participate in oral argument shall file 
a written notice of intention to appear and participate in oral 
argument. Failure to file a written notice shall constitute a waiver of 
the opportunity to participate.
    (d) Each order scheduling a case for oral argument will contain the 
allotment of time for each party for oral argument before the 
Commission. The Commission will grant, in its discretion, upon good 
cause shown, an extension of such time upon petition by a party, which 
petition must be filed within 5 days after issuance of said order for 
oral argument.
    (e) Within 10 days after a transcript of oral argument has been 
filed in the office of the Secretary of the Commission, any party who 
participated in the oral argument may file with the Commission a motion 
requesting correction of the transcript, which motion shall be 
accompanied by proof of service thereof upon all other parties who 
participated in the oral argument. Within 5 days after the filing of 
such a motion, other parties may file a pleading in support of or in 
opposition to such motion. Thereafter, the officer who presided at the 
oral argument shall, by order, specify the corrections to be made in the 
transcript, and a copy of the order shall be served upon all parties to 
the proceeding. The officer who presided at the oral argument may, on

[[Page 151]]

his own initiative, by order, specify corrections to be made in the 
transcript on 5 days notice of the proposed corrections to all parties 
who participated in the oral argument.
    (f) Any commissioner who is not present at oral argument and who is 
otherwise authorized to participate in a final decision may participate 
in making that decision after reading the transcript of oral argument.

    Upon review of any initial decision, the Commission may, in its 
discretion, limit the issues to be reviewed to those findings and 
conclusions to which exceptions have been filed, or to those findings 
and conclusions specified in the Commission's order of review issued 
pursuant to Sec. 1.276(b).

Sec. 1.282  Final decision of the Commission.

    (a) After opportunity has been afforded for the filing of proposed

briefs, and for the holding of oral argument as provided in this 
subpart, the Commission will issue a final decision in each case in 
which an initial decision has not become final.
    (b) The final decision shall contain:
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions, as well as the reasons or 
basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law or discretion 
presented on the record;
    (2) Rulings on each relevant and material exception filed; the 
Commission will deny irrelevant exceptions, or those which are not of 
decisional significance, without a specific statement of reasons 
prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (3) The appropriate rule or oder and the sanction, relief or denial 
thereof.

        Appeal and Reconsideration of Presiding Officer's Ruling


<R05>
Sec. 1.301  Appeal from presiding officer's interlocutory ruling; effective date of ruling.

    (a) Interlocutory rulings which are appealable as a matter of right. 
Rulings listed in this paragraph are appealable as a matter of right. An 
appeal from such a ruling may not be deferred and raised as an exception 
to the initial decision.

[[Page 153]]

    (1) If the presiding officer's ruling denies or terminates the right 
of any person to participate as a party to a hearing proceeding, such 
person, as a matter of right, may file an appeal from that ruling.
    (2) If the presiding officer's ruling requires testimony or the 
production of documents, over objection based on a claim of privilege, 
the ruling on the claim of privilege is appealable as a matter of right.
    (3) If the presiding officer's ruling denies a motion to disqualify 
the presiding judge, the ruling is appealable as a matter of right.
    (4) Rulings granting a joint request filed under Sec. 1.525 without 
terminating the proceeding are appealable by any party as a matter of 
right.
    (5) A ruling removing counsel from the hearing is appealable as a 
matter of right, by counsel on his own behalf or by his client. (In the 
event of such ruling, the presiding officer will adjourn the hearing for 
such period as is reasonably necessary for the client to secure new 
counsel and for counsel to familiarize himself with the case).
    (b) Other interlocutory rulings. Except as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section, appeals from interlocutory rulings of the presiding 
officer shall be filed only if allowed by the presiding officer. Any 
party desiring to file an appeal shall first file a request for 
permission to file appeal. The request shall be filed within 5 days 
after the order is released or (if no written order) after the ruling is 
made. Pleadings responsive to the request shall be filed only if they 
are requested by the presiding officer. The request shall contain a 
showing that the appeal presents a new or novel question of law or 
policy and that the ruling is such that error would be likely to require 
remand should the appeal be deferred and raised as an exception. The 
presiding officer shall determine whether the showing is such as to 
justify an interlocutory appeal and, in accordance with his 
determination, will either allow or disallow the appeal or modify the 
ruling. If the presiding officer allows or disallows the appeal, his 
ruling is final: Provided, however, That the Commission may, on its own 
motion, dismiss an appeal allowed by the presiding officer on the ground 
that objection to the ruling should be deferred and raised as an 
exception. In the discretion of the presiding officer, the request for 
permission to file appeal may be made orally, on the record of the 
proceeding. The request may be disposed of orally.
    (1) If an appeal is not allowed, or is dismissed by the Commission, 
or if permission to file an appeal is not requested, objection to the 
ruling may be raised on review of the initial decision.
    (2) If an appeal is allowed and is considered on its merits, the 
disposition on appeal is final. Objection to the ruling or to the action 
on appeal may not be raised on review of the initial decision.
    (3) If the presiding officer modifies the ruling, any party 
adversely affected by the modified ruling may file a request for 
permission to file appeal, pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
    (c) Procedures, effective date. (1) Unless the presiding officer 
orders otherwise, rulings made by him shall be effective when the order 
is released or (if no written order) when the ruling is made. The 
Commission may stay the effect of any ruling which comes before it for 
consideration on appeal.
    (2) Appeals filed under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed 
within 5 days after the order is released or (if no written order) after 
the ruling is made. Appeals filed under paragraph (b) of this section 
shall be filed within 5 days after the appeal is allowed.
    (3) The appeal shall conform with the specifications set out in 
Sec. 1.49 and shall be subscribed and verified as provided in Sec. 1.52.
    (4) The appeal shall be served on parties to the proceeding (see 
Secs. 1.47 and 1.211), and shall be filed with the Secretary, Federal 
Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554.
    (5) The appeal shall not exceed 5 double-spaced typewritten pages.
    (6) Appeals are acted on by the Commission.
    (7) Oppositions and replies shall be served and filed in the same 
manner as appeals and shall be served on appellant if he is not a party 
to the proceeding. Oppositions shall be filed within 5 days after the 
appeal is filed.

[[Page 154]]

Replies shall not be permitted, unless the Commission specifically 
requests them. Oppositions shall not exceed 5 double-spaced typewritten 
pages. Replies shall not exceed 5 double-spaced typewritten pages.

an appeal from that ruling within 30 days after the ruling is released.
    (b) Any party who desires to preserve the right to appeal shall file 
a notice of appeal within 10 days after the ruling is released. If a 
notice of appeal is not filed within 10 days, the ruling shall be 
effective 30 days after the ruling is released and within this period, 
may be reviewed by the Commission on its own motion. If an appeal is not 
filed following notice of appeal, the ruling shall be effective 50 days 
after the day of its release and, within this period, may be reviewed by 
the Commission on its own motion. If an appeal is filed, or if the 
Commission reviews the ruling on its own motion, the effect of the 
ruling is further stayed pending the completion of proceedings on appeal 
or review.
    (c) The appeal shall conform with the specifications set out in 
Sec. 1.49 and shall be subscribed and verified as provided in Sec. 1.52.
    (d) The appeal shall be served on parties to the proceeding (see

    (e) The appeal shall not exceed 25 double-spaced typewritten pages.
    (f) The Commission will act on the appeal.

manner as the appeal. Oppositions to an appeal shall be filed within 15 
days after the appeal is filed. Replies to oppositions shall be filed 
within 10 days after the opposition is filed and shall be limited to 
matters raised in the oppositions. Oppositions shall not exceed 25

spaced typewritten pages.

               The Discovery and Preservation of Evidence

    Authority: Sections 1.311 through 1.325 are issued under secs. 4, 
303, 409, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082, 1096; 47 U.S.C. 154, 303, 
409, 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 1.311  General.

    Sections 1.311 through 1.325 provide for taking the deposition of 
any person (including a party), for interrogatories to parties, and for 
orders to parties relating to the production of documents and things and 
for entry upon real property. These procedures may be used for the 
discovery of relevant facts, for the production and preservation of 
evidence for use at the hearing, or for both purposes.
    (a) Applicability. For purposes of discovery, these proecdures may 
be used in any case of adjudication (as defined in the Administrative 
Procedure Act)which has been designated for hearing. For the 
preservation of evidence, they may be used in any case which has been 
designated for hearing and is conducted under the provisions of this 
subpart (see Sec. 1.201).
    (b) Scope of examination. Persons and parties may be examined 
regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the hearing 
issues, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition 
and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the 
identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts. It 
is not ground for objection to use of these procedures that the 
testimony will be inadmissible at the hearing if the testimony sought 
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible 
evidence. The use of these procedures against the Commission is subject 
to the following additional limitations:

[[Page 155]]

    (1) The informer's privilege shall encompass information which may 
lead to the disclosure of an informer's identity.
    (2) Commission personnel may not be questioned by deposition for the 
purposes of discovery except on special order of the Commission, but may 
be questioned by written interrogatories under Sec. 1.323. 
Interrogatories shall be served on the appropriate Bureau Chief (see 
Sec. 1.21(b)). They will be answered and signed by those personnel with 
knowledge of the facts. The answers will be served by the Secretary of 
the Commission upon parties to the proceeding.
    (3) Commission records are not subject to discovery under 
Sec. 1.325. The inspection of Commission records is governed by the 
Freedom of Information Act, as amended, and by Secs. 0.451 through 0.467 
of this chapter. Commission employees may be questioned by written 
interrogatories regarding the existence, nature, description, custody, 
condition and location of Commission records, but may not be questioned 
concerning their contents unless the records are available (or are made 
available) for inspection under Secs. 0.451 through 0.467. See 
Sec. 0.451(b)(5) of this chapter.
    (4) Subject to paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, 
Commission personnel may be questioned generally by written 
interrogatories regarding the existence, description, nature, custody, 
condition and location of relevant documents and things and regarding 
the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts, 
and may otherwise only be examined regarding facts of the case as to 
which they have direct personal knowledge.
    (c) Schedule for use of the procedures. (1) In comparative broadcast 
proceedings involving applicants for only new facilities, discovery 
commences with the release of the hearing designation order, and, in 
routine cases, the discovery phase of the proceeding will be conducted 
in a manner intended to conclude that portion of the case within 90 days 
of the release of the designation order.
    (2) In all other proceedings, except as provided by special order of 
the presiding officer, discovery may be initiated before or after the 
prehearing conference provided for in Sec. 1.248 of this part.
    (3) In all proceedings, the presiding officer may at any time order 
the parties or their attorneys to appear at a conference to consider the 
proper use of these procedures, the time to be allowed for such use, 
and/or to hear agrument and render a ruling on disputes that arise under 
these rules.
    (d) Who shall act. Actions provided for in Secs. 1.311 through 1.325 
will, in most cases, be taken by the officer designated to preside at 
the hearing (see Sec. 1.241). If the proceeding, or a particular matter 
to which the action relates, is before the Commission, a commissioner or 
panel of commissioners, or the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the 
action will be taken by such officer or body. The term presiding 
officer, as used in Secs. 1.311 through 1.325 shall be understood to 
refer to the appropriate officer or body. See Secs. 0.341, 0.351, 0.365,

be taken before any judge of any court of the United States; any U.S. 
Commissioner; any clerk of a district court; any chancellor, justice or 
judge of a supreme or superior court; the mayor or chief magistrate of a 
city; any judge of a county court, or court of common pleas of any of 
the United States; any notary public, not being of counsel or attorney 
to any party, nor interested in the event of the proceeding; or 
presiding officers, as provided in Sec. 1.243.
    (b) Attendance of witnesses. The attendance of witnesses at the 
taking of depositions may be compelled by the use of subpena as provided 
in Secs. 1.331 through 1.340.
    (c) Oath; transcript. The officer before whom the deposition is to 
be taken shall administer an oath or affirmation to the witness and 
shall personally, or by someone acting under his direction and in his 
presence record the testimony of the witness. The testimony may be taken 
stenographically or, upon approval by the presiding officer, testimony 
may be taken through the use of telephonically or electronically 
recorded methods, including videotape. In the event these latter methods 
are used for the deposition, the parties may agree to the waiver of the 
provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) as appropriate and as approved by 
the presiding officer.
    (d) Examination. (1) In the taking of depositions upon oral 
examination, the parties may proceed with examination and cross-
examination of deponents as permitted at the hearing. In lieu of 
participating in the oral examination, parties served with the notice to 
take depositions may transmit written interrogatories to the officer 
designated in the notice, who shall propound them to the witness and 
record the answers verbatim.
    (2) In the taking of depositions upon written interrogatories, the 
party who served the original interrogatories shall transmit copies of 
all interrogatories to the officer designated in the notice, who shall 
propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim.
    (e) Submission of deposition to witness; changes; signing. When the 
testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition of each witness shall be 
submitted to him for examination and shall be read to or by him, unless 
such examination and reading are waiver by the witness and by the 
parties. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to 
make shall be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a 
statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The 
deposition shall then be signed by the witness, unless the parties by 
stipulation waive the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, 
or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the 
officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, 
the illness or absence of the witness, or of his refusal to sign, 
together with the reason (if any) given therefor; and the deposition may 
then be used as fully as though signed, unless upon a motion tosuppress, 
the presiding officer holds that the reason given for the refusal to 
sign requires rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.
    (f) Certification of deposition and filing by officer; copies. The 
officer shall certify on the deposition that the witness was duly sworn 
by him, that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by 
the witness, and that said officer is not of counsel or attorney to

investigation. He shall then securely seal the deposition in an envelope 
endorsed with the title of the action and marked ``Deposition of (here

copies of the deposition and of all exhibits, together with

[[Page 159]]

the notice and any interrogatories received by him, by certified mail to 
the Secretary of the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 1.319  Objections to the taking of depositions.

    (a) Objections to be made by motion prior to the taking of 
depositions. If there is objection to the substance of any interrogatory 
or to examination on any matter clearly covered by the notice to take 
depositions, the objection shall be made in a motion opposing the taking 
of depositions or in a motion to limit or suppress the interrogatory as 
provided in Secs. 1.315(b) and 1.316(d) and shall not be made at the 
taking of the deposition.
    (b) Objections to be made at the taking of depositions. Errors and 
irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking 
the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or 
affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which 
might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived 
unless reasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the 
deposition. If such objection is made, counsel shall, if possible, agree 
upon the measures required to obviate, remove, or cure such errors. The 
measures agreed upon shall be taken. If agreement cannot be reached, the 
objection shall be noted on the deposition by the officer taking it, and 
the testimony objected to shall be taken subject to the objection.
    (c) Additional objections which may be made at the taking of 
depositions. Objection may be made at the taking of depositions on the 
ground of relevancy or privilege, if the notice to take depositions does 
not clearly indicate that the witness is to be examined on the matters 
to which the objection relates. See paragraph (a) of this section. 
Objection may also be made on the ground that the examination is being 
conducted in such manner as to unreasonably annoy, embarrass, or oppress 
a deponent or party.
    (1) When there is objection to a line of questioning, as permitted 
by this paragraph, counsel shall, if possible, reach agreement among 
themselves regarding the proper limits of the examination.
    (2) If counsel cannot agree on the proper limits of the examination 
the taking of depositions shall continue on matters not objected to and 
counsel shall, within 24 hours, either jointly or individually, 
telegraph statements of their positions to the presiding officer, 
together with the telephone numbers at which they and the officer taking 
the depositions can be reached, or shall otherwise jointly confer with 
the presiding officer. If individual statements are submitted, copies 
shall be provided to all counsel participating in the taking of 
depositions.
    (3) The presiding officer shall promptly rule upon the question 
presented or take such other action as may be appropriate under 
Sec. 1.313, and shall give notice of his ruling, by telephone, to 
counsel who submitted statements and to the officer taking the 
depositions. The presiding officer shall thereafter reduce his ruling to 
writing.
    (4) The taking of depositions shall continue in accordance with the 
presiding officer's ruling. Such rulings are not subject to appeal.

[33 FR 463, Jan. 12, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 1.321  Use of depositions at the hearing.

    (a) No inference concerning the admissibility of a deposition in 
evidence shall be drawn because of favorable action on the notice to 
take depositions.
    (b) Except as provided in this paragraph and in Sec. 1.319, 
objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any 
deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the 
exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and 
testifying.
    (1) Objections to the competency of a witness, or the competency, 
relevancy or materiality of testimony are waived by failure to make them 
before or during the taking of depositions if (and only if) the ground 
of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if 
presented at that time.
    (2) Objection on the ground of privilege is waived by failure to 
make it before or during the taking of depositions.
    (c) A party shall not be deemed to make a person his own witness for 
any

[[Page 160]]

purpose by taking his deposition. The introduction in evidence of the 
deposition or any part thereof for any purpose other than that of 
contradicting or impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness 
of the party introducing the deposition, but this shall not apply to the 
use by an adverse party of a deposition as described in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section. At the hearing any party may rebut any relevant 
evidence contained in a deposition whether introduced by him or by any 
other party.
    (d) At the hearing (or in a pleading), any part or all of a 
deposition, so far as admissible, may be used against any party who was 
present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due 
notice thereof, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:
    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness.
    (2) The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time of 
taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent of a 
public or private corporation, partnership or association which is a 
party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.
    (3) To the extent that the affirmative direct case of a party is 
made in writing pursuant to Sec. 1.248(d), the deposition of any 
witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any 
purpose, provided the witness is made available for cross-examination. 
In all cases, the deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may 
be used by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer finds: (i) 
That the witness is dead; or (ii) that the witness is out of the United 
States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured 
by the party offering the deposition; or (iii) that the witness is 
unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or 
imprisonment; or (iv) upon application and notice, that such exceptional 
circumstances exist as to make it desirable in the interest of justice 
and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of 
witnesses orally in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
an adverse party may require him to introduce all of it which is 
relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other 
parts.
    (5) Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use 
depositions previously taken; and, when an action in any hearing has 
been dismissed and another action involving the same subject matter is 
afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or 
successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in 
the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken 
therefor.

Sec. 1.323  Interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Interrogatories. Any party may serve upon any other party 
written interrogatories to be answered in writing by the party served 
or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a 
partnership or association, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish 
such information as is available to the party. A copy of the 
interrogatories shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. An 
original and three copies of the interrogatories, answers, and all 
related pleadings shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission. A 
copy of the interrogatories, answersand all related pleadings shall be 
served on the presiding officer.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided in a protective order, the number 
of interrogatories or sets of interrogatories is not limited.
    (2) Except as provided in such an order, interrogatories may be 
served after a deposition has been taken, and a deposition may be sought 
after interrogatories have been answered.
    (b) Answers and objections. Each interrogatory shall be answered 
separately and fully in writing under oath or affirmation, unless it is 
objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in 
lieu of an answer. The answers shall be signed by the person making 
them, and the objections by the attorney making them. The party upon 
whom the interrogatories were served shall serve a copy of the

[[Page 161]]

answers and objections upon all parties to the proceeding within 14 days 
after service of the interrogatories, or within such shorter or longer 
period as the presiding officer may allow. Answers may be used in the 
same manner as depositions of a party (see Sec. 1.321(d)).
    (c) Motion to compel an answer. Any party to the proceeding may, 
within 7 days, move for an order with respect to any objection or other 
failure to answer an interrogatory. For purposes of this paragraph, an 
evasive or incomplete answer is a failure to answer; and if the motion 
is based on the assertion that the answer is evasive or incomplete, it 
shall contain a statement as to the scope and detail of an answer which 
would be considered responsive and complete. The party upon whom the 
interrogatories were served may file a response within 7 days after the 
motion is filed, to which he may append an answer or an amended answer. 
Additional pleadings should not be submitted and will not be considered.
    (d) Action by the presiding officer. If the presiding officer 
determines that an objection is not justified, he shall order that the 
answer be served. If an interrogatory has not been answered, the 
presiding officer may rule that the right to object has been waived and 
may order that an answer be served. If an answer does not comply fully 
with the requirements of this section, the presiding officer may order 
that an amended answer be served, may specify the scope and detail of 
the matters to be covered by the amended answer, and may specify any 
appropriate procedural consequences (including adverse findings of fact 
and dismissal with prejudice) which will follow from the failure to make 
a full and responsive answer. If a full and responsive answer is not 
made, the presiding officer may issue an order invoking any of the 
procedural consequences specified in the order to compel an answer.
    (e) Appeal. As order to compel an answer is not subject to appeal.

    (b) Requests for a subpena duces tecum shall be submitted in 
writing, duly subscribed and verified, and shall specify with 
particularity the books, papers, and documents desired and the facts

directed to a nonparty to the proceeding, the presiding officer may 
issue the same, upon request, without an accompanying subpena to enforce 
a notice to take depositions, provided for in paragraph (e) of this 
section, where it appears that the testimony of said person is not 
required in connection with the subpena duces tecum.
    (c) All requests for subpenas shall be supported by a showing of the

taking of depositions has expired or, if a motion has been filed, until

request is submitted, it need not be accompanied by a showing that 
relevant and material evidence will be adduced, but merely that the 
person will be examined regarding a nonprivileged matter which is 
relevant to the hearing issues. The subpena request may ask that a 
subpena duces tecum be contemporaneously issued commanding the person to 
whom it is directed to produce designated books, papers, documents, or 
tangible things which constitute or contain evidence relating to any of 
the matters within the scope of the examination permitted by 
Sec. 1.311(b) but in that event the subpena request will be subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 1.313 and paragraph (b) of this section.

request is submitted, it need not be accompanied by a showing that 
relevant and material evidence will be adduced, but merely that the 
documents and things to be examined contain nonprivileged matter which 
is relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding.

Bureau...........................................................      2
Reference Information Center.....................................      1
                                                                  ------
      Total......................................................      5

    However, members of the general public who wish to express their 
interest by participating informally in a rulemaking proceeding may do 
so by submitting an original and one copy of their comments, without 
regard to form, provided only that the Docket Number is specified in the 
heading. Informal comments filed after close of the reply comment 
period, or, if on reconsideration, the reconsideration reply comment 
period, should be labeled ``ex parte'' pursuant to section 1.1206(a) of 
this chapter. Letters submitted to Commissioners or Commission staff 
will be treated in the same way as informal comments, as set forth

      Total......................................................      9
 

    (c) Any person desiring to file identical documents in more than one 
docketed rulemaking proceeding shall furnish the Commission two 
additional copies of any such document for each additional docket. This 
requirement does not apply if the proceedings have been consolidated.
    (d) Participants that file comments and replies in electronic form 
need only submit one copy of those comments, so long as the submission 
conforms to any procedural or filing requirements established for formal 
electronic comments.
    (e) Comments and replies and other documents filed in electronic 
form by a party represented by an attorney shall include the name and 
mailing address of at least one attorney of record. Parties not

<R05>
Sec. 1.420  Additional procedures in proceedings for amendment of the FM or TV Tables of Allotments.

    (a) Comments filed in proceedings for amendment of the FM Table of 
Allotments (Sec. 73.202 of this chapter) or the Television Table of 
Allotments (Sec. 73.606 of this chapter) which are initiated on a 
petition for rule making shall be served on petitioner by the person who 
files the comments.
    (b) Reply comments filed in proceedings for amendment of the FM or 
Television Tables of Allotments shall be served on the person(s) who 
filed the comments to which the reply is directed.
    (c) Such comments and reply comments shall be accompanied by a 
certificate of service.
    (d) Counterproposals shall be advanced in initial comments only and 
will not be considered if they are advanced in reply comments.
    (e) An original and 4 copies of all petitions for rulemaking, 
comments, reply comments, and other pleadings shall be filed with the 
Commission.
    (f) Petitions for reconsideration and responsive pleadings shall be 
served on

[[Page 171]]

parties to the proceeding and on any licensee or permittee whose 
authorization may be modified to specify operation on a different 
channel, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of service.
    (g) The Commission may modify the license or permit of an FM station 
to another class of channel or of a UHFTV station to a VHF channel in 
the same community in the course of the rule making proceeding to amend 
Sec. 73.202(b), Sec. 73.504(a) or Sec. 73.606(b) if any of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) There is no other timely filed expression of interest, or
    (2) If another interest in the proposed channel is timely filed an 
additional equivalent class of channel is also allotted, assigned or 
available for application, or
    (3) With respect to FM, the modification of license or permit would 
occur on a mutually exclusive higher class adjacent or co-channel.

    Note 1 to paragraph (g):
    In certain situations, a licensee or permittee may seek an adjacent, 
intermediate frequency or co-channel upgrade by application. See 
Sec. 73.203(b) of this chapter.
    Note 2 to paragraph (g):
    The reclassification of a Class C station in accordance with the 
procedure set forth in Note 4 to Sec. 73.3573 may be initiated through 
the filing of an original petition for amendment of the FM Table of 
Allotments. The Commission will notify the affected Class C station 
licensee of the proposed reclassification by issuing a notice of 
proposed rule making, except that where a triggering petition proposes 
an amendment or amendments to the FM Table of Allotments in addition to 
the proposed reclassification, the Commission will issue an order to 
show cause as set forth in Note 4 to Sec. 73.3573, and a notice of 
proposed rule making will be issued only after the reclassification 
issue is resolved. Triggering petitions will be dismissed upon the 
filing, rather than the grant, of an acceptable construction permit 
application to increase antenna height to at least 451 meters HAAT by a 
subject Class C station.

    (h) Where licensees (or permittees) of television broadcast stations 
jointly petition to amend Sec. 73.606(b) and to exchange channels, and 
where one of the licensees (or permittees) operates on a commercial 
channel while the other operates on a reserved noncommercial educational 
channel within the same band, and the stations serve substantially the 
same market, then the Commission may amend Sec. 73.606(b) and modify the 
licenses (or permits) of the petitioners to specify operation on the 
appropriate channels upon a finding that such action will promote the 
public interest, convenience, and necessity.

    Note 1 to paragraph (h):
    Licensees and permittees operating Class A FM stations who seek to 
upgrade their facilities to Class B1, B, C3, C2, C1, or C on Channel 
221, and whose proposed 1 mV/m signal contours would overlap the Grade B 
contour of a television station operating on Channel 6 must meet a 
particularly heavy burden by demonstrating that grants of their upgrade 
requests are in the public interest. In this regard, the Commission will 
examine the record in rule making proceedings to determine the 
availability of existing and potential non-commercial education service.

    (i) In the course of the rule making proceeding to amend 
Sec. 73.202(b) or Sec. 73.606(b), the Commission may modify the license 
or permit of an FM or television broadcast station to specify a new 
community of license where the amended allotment would be mutually 
exclusive with the licensee's or permittee's present assignment.
    (j) Whenever an expression of interest in applying for, 
constructing, and operating a station has been filed in a proceeding to 
amend the FM or TV Table of Allotments, and the filing party seeks to 
dismiss or withdraw the expression of interest, either unilaterally or 
in exchange for financial consideration, that party must file with the 
Commission a request for approval of the dismissal or withdrawal, a copy 
of any written agreement related to the dismissal or withdrawal, and an 
affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the party withdrawing its interest 
nor its principals has received or will receive any money or other 
consideration in excess of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange 
for the dismissal or withdrawal of the expression of interest;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and

[[Page 172]]

    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the dismissal or 
withdrawal of the expression of interest.
    (5) In addition, within 5 days of a party's request for approval, 
each remaining party to any written or oral agreement must submit an 
affidavit setting forth:
    (i) A certification that neither it nor its principals has paid or 
will pay money or other consideration in excess of the legitimate and 
prudent expenses of the party withdrawing its expression of interest; 
and
    (ii) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the dismissal or 
withdrawal of the expression of interest.

comments in conformity with Secs. 1.415 and 1.419.


<R05>
Sec. 1.423  Oral argument and other proceedings.

    In any rulemaking where the Commission determines that an oral 
argument, hearing or any other type of proceeding is warranted, notice 
of the time, place and nature of such proceeding will be published in 
the Federal Register.

[58 FR 66300, Dec. 20, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 1.425  Commission action.

    The Commission will consider all relevant comments and material of 
record before taking final action in a rulemaking proceeding and will 
issue a decision incorporating its finding and a brief statement of the 
reasons therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 1.427  Effective date of rules.

    (a) Any rule issued by the Commission will be made effective not 
less than 30 days from the time it is published in the Federal Register 
except as otherwise specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) For good cause found and published with the rule, any rule 
issued by the Commission may be made effective within less than 30 days 
from the time it is published in the Federal Register. Rules involving 
any military, naval or foreign affairs function of the United States; 
matters relating to agency management or personnel, public property, 
loans, grants, benefits or contracts; rules granting or recognizing 
exemption or relieving restriction; rules of organization, procedure or 
practice; or interpretative rules; and statements of policy may be made 
effective without regard to the 30-day requirement.
    (c) In cases of alterations by the Commission in the required manner 
or form of keeping accounts by carriers, notice will be served upon 
affected carriers not less than 6 months prior to the effective date of 
such alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 1.429  Petition for reconsideration.

    (a) Any interested person may petition for reconsideration of a 
final action in a proceeding conducted under this subpart (see 
Secs. 1.407 and 1.425). Where the action was taken by the Commission, 
the petition will be acted on by the Commission. Where action was taken 
by a staff official under delegated authority, the petition may be acted 
on by the staff official or referred to the Commission for action.

    Note: The staff has been authorized to act on rulemaking proceedings 
described in Sec. 1.420 and is authorized to make editorial changes in 
the rules (see Sec. 0.231(d)).

    (b) A petition for reconsideration which relies on facts which have 
not previously been presented to the Commission will be granted only 
under the following circumstances:
    (1) The facts relied on relate to events which have occurred or 
circumstances which have changed since the last opportunity to present 
them to the Commission;

[[Page 173]]

    (2) The facts relied on were unknown to petitioner until after his 
last opportunity to present them to the Commission, and he could not 
through the exercise of ordinary diligence have learned of the facts in 
question prior to such opportunity; or
    (3) The Commission determines that consideration of the facts relied 
on is required in the public interest.
    (c) The petition for reconsideration shall state with particularity 
the respects in which petitioner believes the action taken should be 
changed.
    (d) The petition for reconsideration and any supplement thereto 
shall be filed within 30 days from the date of public notice of such 
action, as that date is defined in Sec. 1.4(b). No supplement to a 
petition for reconsideration filed after expiration of the 30 day period 
will be considered, except upon leave granted pursuant to a separate 
pleading stating the grounds for acceptance of the supplement. The 
petition for reconsideration shall not exceed 25 double-spaced 
typewritten pages. See also Sec. 1.49(f).
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 1.420(f), petitions for 
reconsideration need not be served on parties to the proceeding. 
(However, where the number of parties is relatively small, the 
Commission encourages the service of petitions for reconsideration and 
other pleadings, and agreements among parties to exchange copies of 
pleadings. See also Sec. 1.47(d) regarding electronic service of 
documents.) When a petition for reconsideration is timely filed in 
proper form, public notice of its filing is published in the Federal 
Register. The time for filing oppositions to the petition runs from the 
date of public notice. See Sec. 1.4(b).
    (f) Oppositions to a petition for reconsideration shall be filed 
within 15 days after the date of public notice of the petition's filing 
and need be served only on the person who filed the petition. See also 
Sec. 1.49(d). Oppositions shall not exceed 25 double-spaced typewritten 
pages. See Sec. 1.49(f).
    (g) Replies to an opposition shall be filed within 10 days after the 
time for filing oppositions has expired and need be served only on the 
person who filed the opposition. Replies shall not exceed 10 double-
spaced typewritten pages. See also Secs. 1.49(d) and 1.49(f).
    (h) Petitions for reconsideration, oppositions and replies shall 
conform to the requirements of Secs. 1.49 and 1.52, except that they 
need not be verified. Except as provided in Sec. 1.420(e), an original 
and 11 copies shall be submitted to the Secretary, Federal 
Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554. Parties filing in 
electronic form need only submit one copy.
    (i) The Commission may grant the petition for reconsideration in 
whole or in part or may deny the petition. Its order will contain a 
concise statement of the reasons for the action taken. Any order 
disposing of a petition for reconsideration which modifies rules adopted 
by the original order is, to the extent of such modification, subject to 
reconsideration in the same manner as the original order. Except in such 
circumstance, a second petition for reconsideration may be dismissed by 
the staff as repetitious.
    (j) The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a condition 
precedent to judicial review of any action taken by the Commission, 
except where the person seeking such review was not a party to the 
proceeding resulting in the action or relies on questions of fact or law 
upon which the Commission has been afforded no opportunity to pass. 
Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, such a 
person may qualify to seek judicial review by filing a petition for 
reconsideration.
    (k) Without special order of the Commission, the filing of a 
petition for reconsideration shall not excuse any person from complying 
with any rule or operate in any manner to stay or postpone its 
enforcement. However, upon good cause shown, the Commission will stay 
the effective date of a rule pending a decision on a petition for 
reconsideration. See, however, Sec. 1.420(f).

the reasons for such action, and will call upon the carrier to appear

<R05>
Sec. 1.716  Form.

    An informal complaint shall be in writing and should contain: (a) 
The name, address and telephone number of the complaint, (b) the name of

Sec. 1.717  Procedure.

    The Commission will forward informal complaints to the appropriate 
carrier for investigation. The carrier will,

[[Page 177]]

within such time as may be prescribed, advise the Commission in writing, 
with a copy to the complainant, of its satisfaction of the complaint or 
of its refusal or inability to do so. Where there are clear indications 
from the carrier's report or from other communications with the parties 
that the complaint has been satisfied, the Commission may, in its 
discretion, consider a complaint proceeding to be closed, without 
response to the complainant. In all other cases, the Commission will 
contact the complainant regarding its review and disposition of the 
matters raised. If the complainant is not satisfied by the carrier's 
response and the Commission's disposition, it may file a formal 
complaint in accordance with Sec. 1.721 of this part.

[51 FR 16039, Apr. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.718  Unsatisfied informal complaints; formal complaints relating back to the filing dates of informal complaints.

    When an informal complaint has not been satisfied pursuant to 
Sec. 1.717, the complainant may file a formal complaint with this 
Commission in the form specified in Sec. 1.721. Such filing will be 
deemed to relate back to the filing date of the informal complaint: 
Provided, That the formal complaint: (a) Is filed within 6 months from 
the date of the carrier's report, (b) makes reference to the date of the 
informal complaint, and (c) is based on the same cause of action as the 
informal complaint. If no formal complaint is filed within the 6-month 
period, the complainant will be deemed to have abandoned the unsatisfied 
informal complaint.

[51 FR 16040, Apr. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.719  Informal complaints filed pursuant to section 258.

    (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of Secs. 1.716 through 1.718, 
the following procedures shall apply to complaints alleging that a 
carrier has violated section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, by making an unauthorized 
change of a subscriber's preferred carrier, as defined by 
Sec. 64.1100(e) of this chapter.
    (b) Form. The complaint shall be in writing, and should contain: The 
complainant's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address (if the 
complainant has one); the name of both the allegedly unauthorized 
carrier, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(d) of this chapter, and authorized 
carrier, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(c) of this chapter; a complete 
statement of the facts (including any documentation) tending to show 
that such carrier engaged in an unauthorized change of the subscriber's 
preferred carrier; a statement of whether the complainant has paid any 
disputed charges to the allegedly unauthorized carrier; and the specific 
relief sought.
    (c) Procedure. The Commission will resolve slamming complaints under 
the definitions and procedures established in Secs. 64.1100 through 
64.1190 of this chapter. The Commission will issue a written (or 
electronic) order informing the complainant, the unauthorized carrier, 
and the authorized carrier of its finding, and ordering the appropriate 
remedy, if any, as defined by Secs. 64.1160 through 64.1170 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Unsatisfied Informal Complaints Involving Unauthorized Changes 
of a Subscriber's Preferred Carrier; Formal Complaints Relating Back to 
the Filing Dates of Informal Complaints. If the complainant is 
unsatisfied with the resolution of a complaint under this section, the 
complainant may file a formal complaint with the Commission in the form 
specified in Sec. 1.721. Such filing will be deemed to relate back to 
the filing date of the informal complaint filed under this section, so 
long as the informal complaint complied with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section and provided that: The formal complaint is 
filed within 45 days from the date an order resolving the informal 
complaint filed under this section is mailed or delivered electronically 
to the complainant; makes reference to both the informal complaint 
number assigned to and the initial date of filing the informal complaint 
filed under this section; and is based on the same cause of action as 
the informal complaint filed under this section. If no formal complaint 
is filed within the 45-day period, the complainant will be deemed to 
have abandoned its right to

[[Page 178]]

bring a formal complaint regarding the cause of action at issue.

Sec. 1.720  General pleading requirements.

    Formal complaint proceedings are generally resolved on a written 
record consisting of a complaint, answer, and joint statement of 
stipulated facts, disputed facts and key legal issues, along with all 
associated affidavits, exhibits and other attachments. Commission 
proceedings may also require or permit other written submissions such as 
briefs, written interrogatories, and other supplementary documents or 
pleadings. Those formal complaint proceedings handled on the Enforcement 
Bureau's Accelerated Docket are subject to pleading and procedural rules 
that differ in some respects from the general rules for formal complaint 
proceedings.
    (a) Pleadings must be clear, concise, and explicit. All matters 
concerning a claim, defense or requested remedy, including damages, 
should be pleaded fully and with specificity.
    (b) Pleadings must contain facts which, if true, are sufficient to 
constitute a violation of the Act or Commission order or regulation, or 
a defense to such alleged violation.
    (c) Facts must be supported by relevant documentation or affidavit.
    (d) Legal arguments must be supported by appropriate judicial, 
Commission, or statutory authority.
    (e) Opposing authorities must be distinguished.
    (f) Copies must be provided of all non-Commission authorities relied 
upon which are not routinely available in national reporting systems, 
such as unpublished decisions or slip opinions of courts or 
administrative agencies.
    (g) Parties are responsible for the continuing accuracy and 
completeness of all information and supporting authority furnished in a 
pending complaint proceeding. Information submitted, as well as relevant 
legal authorities, must be current and updated as necessary and in a 
timely manner at any time before a decision is rendered on the merits of 
the complaint.
    (h) Specific reference shall be made to any tariff provision relied 
on in support of a claim or defense. Copies of relevant tariffs or 
relevant portions of tariffs that are referred to or relied upon in a 
complaint, answer, or other pleading shall be appended to such 
complaint, answer, or other pleading.
    (i) All statements purporting to summarize or explain Commission 
orders or policies must cite, in standard legal form, the Commission 
ruling upon which such statements are based.
    (j) Pleadings shall identify the name, address, telephone number, 
and facsimile transmission number for either the filing party's attorney 
or, where a party is not represented by an attorney, the filing party.

Sec. 1.722  Damages.

    (a) If a complainant wishes to recover damages, the complaint must 
contain a clear and unequivocal request for damages.
    (b) If a complainant wishes a determination of damages to be made in 
the same proceeding as the determinations of liability and prospective 
relief, the complaint must contain the allegations and information 
required by paragraph (h) of this section.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, in any proceeding 
to which no statutory deadline applies, if the Commission decides that a 
determination of damages would best be made in a proceeding that is 
separate from and subsequent to the proceeding in which the 
determinations of liability and prospective relief are made, the 
Commission may at any time order that the initial proceeding will 
determine only liability and prospective relief, and that a separate, 
subsequent proceeding initiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section will determine damages.
    (d) If a complainant wishes a determination of damages to be made in 
a proceeding that is separate from and subsequent to the proceeding in 
which the determinations of liability and prospective relief are made, 
the complainant must:

[[Page 182]]

    (1) Comply with paragraph (a) of this section, and
    (2) State clearly and unequivocally that the complainant wishes a 
determination of damages to be made in a proceeding that is separate 
from and subsequent to the proceeding in which the determinations of 
liability and prospective relief will be made.
    (e) If a complainant proceeds pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, or if the Commission invokes its authority under paragraph (c) 
of this section, the complainant may initiate a separate proceeding to 
obtain a determination of damages by filing a supplemental complaint 
that complies with Sec. 1.721(e) and paragraph (h) of this section 
within sixty days after public notice (as defined in Sec. 1.4(b) of this 
chapter) of a decision that contains a finding of liability on the 
merits of the original complaint.
    (f) If a complainant files a supplemental complaint for damages in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the supplemental 
complaint shall be deemed, for statutory limitations purposes, to relate 
back to the date of the original complaint.
    (g) Where a complainant chooses to seek the recovery of damages upon 
a supplemental complaint in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (e) of this section, the Commission will resolve the separate, 
preceding liability complaint within any applicable complaint resolution 
deadlines contained in the Act.
    (h) In all cases in which recovery of damages is sought, it shall be 
the responsibility of the complainant to include, within either the 
complaint or supplemental complaint for damages filed in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section, either:
    (1) A computation of each and every category of damages for which 
recovery is sought, along with an identification of all relevant 
documents and materials or such other evidence to be used by the 
complainant to determine the amount of such damages; or
    (2) An explanation of:
    (i) The information not in the possession of the complaining party 
that is necessary to develop a detailed computation of damages;
    (ii) Why such information is unavailable to the complaining party;
    (iii) The factual basis the complainant has for believing that such 
evidence of; damages exists;
    (iv) A detailed outline of the methodology that would be used to 
create a computation of damages with such evidence.
    (i) Where a complainant files a supplemental complaint for damages 
in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the following 
procedures may apply:
    (1) Issues concerning the amount, if any, of damages may be either 
designated by the Enforcement Bureau for hearing before, or, if the 
parties agree, submitted for mediation to, a Commission Administrative 
Law Judge. Such Administrative Law Judge shall be chosen in the 
following manner:
    (i) By agreement of the parties and the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge; or
    (ii) In the absence of such agreement, the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge shall designate the Administrative Law Judge.
    (2) The Commission may, in its discretion, order the defendant 
either to post a bond for, or deposit into an interest bearing escrow 
account, a sum equal to the amount of damages which the Commission 
finds, upon preliminary investigation, is likely to be ordered after the 
issue of damages is fully litigated, or some lesser sum which may be 
appropriate, provided the Commission finds that the grant of this relief 
is favored on balance upon consideration of the following factors:
    (i) The complainant's potential irreparable injury in the absence of 
such deposit;
    (ii) The extent to which damages can be accurately calculated;
    (iii) The balance of the hardships between the complainant and the 
defendant; and
    (iv) Whether public interest considerations favor the posting of the 
bond or ordering of the deposit.
    (3) The Commission may, in its discretion, suspend ongoing damages 
proceedings for fourteen days, to provide the parties with a time within 
which to pursue settlement negotiations and/or

[[Page 183]]

alternative dispute resolution procedures.
    (4) The Commission may, in its discretion, end adjudication of 
damages with a determination of the sufficiency of a damages computation 
method or formula. No such method or formula shall contain a provision 
to offset any claim of the defendant against the complainant. The 
parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the exact 
amount of damages pursuant to the Commission-mandated method or formula. 
Within thirty days of the release date of the damages order, parties 
shall submit jointly to the Commission either:
    (i) A statement detailing the parties' agreement as to the amount of 
damages;
    (ii) A statement that the parties are continuing to negotiate in 
good faith and a request that the parties be given an extension of time 
to continue negotiations; or
    (iii) A statement detailing the bases for the continuing dispute and 
the reasons why no agreement can be reached.
    (j) Except where otherwise indicated, the rules governing initial 
formal complaint proceedings govern supplemental formal complaint 
proceedings, as well.

for admitting or denying such averment. General denials are prohibited. 
Denials based on information and belief are expressly prohibited unless 
made in good faith and accompanied by an affidavit explaining the basis 
for the defendant's belief and why the defendant could not reasonably 
ascertain the facts from the complainant or any other source. If the 
defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a 
belief as to the truth of an averment, the defendant shall so state and 
this has the effect of a denial. When a defendant intends in good faith 
to deny only part of an averment, the defendant shall specify so much of 
it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. The defendant may deny 
the allegations of the complaint as specific denials of either 
designated averments or paragraphs.
    (c) The answer shall contain proposed findings of fact, conclusions 
of law, and legal analysis relevant to the claims and arguments set 
forth in the answer.
    (d) Averments in a complaint or supplemental complaint filed 
pursuant to Sec. 1.722 are deemed to be admitted when not denied in the 
answer.
    (e) Affirmative defenses to allegations contained in the complaint 
shall be specifically captioned as such and presented separately from 
any denials made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) The answer shall include an information designation containing:
    (1) The name, address, and position of each individual believed to 
have firsthand knowledge of the facts alleged with particularity in the 
answer, along with a description of the facts within any such 
individual's knowledge;

[[Page 184]]

    (2) A description of all documents, data compilations and tangible 
things in the defendant's possession, custody, or control, that are 
relevant to the facts alleged with particularity in the answer. Such 
description shall include for each document:
    (i) The date it was prepared, mailed, transmitted, or otherwise 
disseminated;
    (ii) The author, preparer, or other source;
    (iii) The recipient(s) or intended recipient(s);
    (iv) Its physical location; and
    (v) A description of its relevance to the matters in dispute.
    (3) A complete description of the manner in which the defendant 
identified all persons with information and designated all documents, 
data compilations and tangible things as being relevant to the dispute, 
including, but not limited to, identifying the individual(s) that 
conducted the information search and the criteria used to identify such 
persons, documents, data compilations, tangible things, and information;
    (g) The answer shall attach copies of all affidavits, documents, 
data compilations and tangible things in the defendant's possession, 
custody, or control, upon which the defendant relies or intends to rely 
to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in the answer.
    (h) The answer shall contain certification that the defendant has, 
in good faith, discussed or attempted to discuss, the possibility of 
settlement with the complainant prior to the filing of the formal 
complaint. Such certification shall include a brief summary of all steps 
taken to resolve the dispute prior to the filing of the formal 
complaint. If no such steps were taken, such certificate shall state the 
reason(s) why the defendant believed such steps would be fruitless;
    (i) Where the complaint is filed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B), 
the defendant shall clearly indicate its willingness to waive the 90-day 
resolution deadline contained within 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B), in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.736.
    (j) The defendant may petition the staff, pursuant to Sec. 1.3, for 
a waiver of any of the requirements of this section. Such waiver may be 
granted for good cause shown.
    (k) Accelerated Docket Proceedings. For the purpose of this 
paragraph (k), the term document also shall include data compilations 
and tangible things.
    (1) Any party named as a defendant in an Accelerated Docket formal 
complaint shall answer such complaint in the manner prescribed under 
this section within ten days of service of the complaint by the 
complainant, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. Except as set 
forth in this paragraph (k), answers in Accelerated Docket proceedings 
shall comply with the requirements of this section.
    (2) The requirement in Sec. 1.720(c) and paragraph (g) of this 
section that factual assertions be supported by affidavit shall not 
apply to answers in Accelerated Docket proceedings. Nevertheless, 
allegations of material fact, whether based on personal knowledge or 
information and belief, that cannot be supported by documentation remain 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.52.
    (3) Answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to include 
proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and legal analysis 
relevant to the defenses and arguments set forth in the answer, as 
required in paragraph (c) of this section. Nevertheless, answers on the 
Accelerated Docket shall fully set out the facts and legal theories on 
which the defendant premises its defenses.
    (4) In light of the requirement for staff-supervised settlement 
negotiations required in Sec. 1.730(b), answers on the Accelerated 
Docket are not required to include a certification that the defendant 
has discussed, or attempted to discuss, the possibility of settlement 
with the complainant, as required in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (5) As required in Sec. 1.729(i)(1), answers on the Accelerated 
Docket shall be accompanied, when served on complainants, by copies of 
documents, within the defendant's possession, custody or control, that 
are likely to bear significantly on the issues raised in the proceeding. 
Unless otherwise directed, these documents shall not be filed with

[[Page 185]]

the Commission. In light of this automatic document production 
requirement, answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to 
include a description of all relevant documents in the defendant's 
possession, custody or control, as required in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section.
    (6) Answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to provide 
the description, required in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, of the 
manner in which the defendant identified persons with knowledge of, and 
documents relevant to, the dispute.
    (7) In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the defendant, as required in 
Sec. 1.729(i)(1), shall serve, contemporaneously with its answer, the 
complainant(s) with copies of documents, within the defendant's 
possession, custody or control, that are likely to bear significantly on 
the issues raised in the complaint and/or the answer.

Sec. 1.725  Cross-complaints and counterclaims.

    Cross-complaints seeking any relief within the jurisdiction of the 
Commission against any carrier that is a party (complainant or 
defendant) to that proceeding are expressly prohibited. Any claim that 
might otherwise meet the requirements of a cross-complaint may be filed 
as a separate complaint in accordance with Secs. 1.720 through 1.736. 
For purposes of this subpart, the term ``cross-complaint'' shall include 
counterclaims.

Sec. 1.726  Replies.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (g) of this section governing Accelerated 
Docket proceedings, within three days after service of an answer 
containing affirmative defenses presented in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 1.724(e), a complainant may file and serve a reply 
containing statements of relevant, material facts and legal arguments 
that shall be responsive to only those specific factual allegations and 
legal arguments made by the defendant in support of its affirmative 
defenses. Replies which contain other allegations or arguments will not 
be accepted or considered by the Commission.
    (b) Failure to reply to an affirmative defense shall be deemed an 
admission of such affirmative defense and of any facts supporting such 
affirmative defense that are not specifically contradicted in the 
complaint.
    (c) The reply shall contain proposed findings of fact, conclusions 
of law, and legal analysis relevant to the claims and arguments set 
forth in the reply.
    (d) The reply shall include an information designation containing:
    (1) The name, address and position of each individual believed to 
have firsthand knowledge about the facts alleged with particularity in 
the reply, along with a description of the facts within any such 
individual's knowledge.
    (2) A description of all documents, data compilations and tangible 
things in the complainant's possession, custody, or control that are 
relevant to the facts alleged with particularity in the reply. Such 
description shall include for each document:
    (i) The date prepared, mailed, transmitted, or otherwise 
disseminated;
    (ii) The author, preparer, or other source;
    (iii) The recipient(s) or intended recipient(s);
    (iv) Its physical location; and
    (v) A description of its relevance to the matters in dispute.
    (3) A complete description of the manner in which the complainant 
identified all persons with information and designated all documents, 
data compilations and tangible things as being relevant to the dispute, 
including, but not limited to, identifying the individual(s) that 
conducted the information search and the criteria used to identify such 
persons, documents, data compilations, tangible things, and information;
    (e) The reply shall attach copies of all affidavits, documents, data 
compilations and tangible things in the complainant's possession, 
custody, or control upon which the complainant relies or intends to rely 
to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in the reply.
    (f) The complainant may petition the staff, pursuant to Sec. 1.3, 
for a waiver of

[[Page 186]]

any of the requirements of this section. Such waiver may be granted for 
good cause shown.
    (g) Accelerated Docket Proceedings. For the purpose of this 
paragraph (g), the term document also shall include data compilations 
and tangible things.
    (1) The filing of a separate pleading to reply to affirmative 
defenses is not permitted in Accelerated Docket proceedings. 
Complainants in such proceedings may include, in the Sec. 1.733(i)(4) 
pre-status-conference filing, those statements that otherwise would have 
been the subject of a reply.
    (2) In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the failure to reply, in the 
pre-status-conference filing, to an affirmative defense shall be deemed 
an admission of such affirmative defense and of any facts supporting 
such affirmative defense that are not specifically contradicted in the 
complaint.
    (3) If a complainant replies to an affirmative defense in its 
Sec. 1.733(i)(4), pre-status-conference filing, it shall include in that 
filing the information, required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
identifying individuals with firsthand knowledge of the facts alleged in 
the reply.
    (4) An Accelerated Docket complainant that replies to an affirmative 
defense in its Sec. 1.733(i)(4), pre-status-conference filing also shall 
serve on the defendant, at the same time as that filing, those documents 
in the complainant's possession, custody or control that were not 
previously produced to the defendant and that are likely to bear 
significantly on the issues raised in the reply. Such a complainant is 
not required to comply with the remainder of the requirements in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

Sec. 1.727  Motions.

    (a) A request to the Commission for an order shall be by written 
motion, stating with particularity the grounds and authority therefor, 
and setting forth the relief or order sought.
    (b) All dispositive motions shall contain proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions of law, with supporting legal analysis, relevant to the 
contents of the pleading. Motions to compel discovery must contain a 
certification by the moving party that a good faith attempt to resolve 
the dispute was made prior to filing the motion. All facts relied upon 
in motions must be supported by documentation or affidavits pursuant to 
the requirements of Sec. 1.720(c), except for those facts of which 
official notice may be taken.
    (c) The moving party shall provide a proposed order for adoption, 
which appropriately incorporates the basis therefor, including proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to the pleading. The 
proposed order shall be clearly marked as a ``Proposed Order.'' The 
proposed order shall be submitted both as a hard copy and on computer 
disk in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.734(d). Where 
appropriate, the proposed order format should conform to that of a 
reported FCC order.
    (d) Oppositions to any motion shall be accompanied by a proposed 
order for adoption, which appropriately incorporates the basis therefor, 
including proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to 
the pleading. The proposed order shall be clearly captioned as a 
``Proposed Order.'' The proposed order shall be submitted both as a hard 
copy and on computer disk in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. 1.734(d). Where appropriate, the proposed order format should 
conform to that of a reported FCC order.
    (e) Oppositions to motions may be filed and served within five 
business days after the motion is filed and served and not after. 
Oppositions shall be limited to the specific issues and allegations 
contained in such motion; when a motion is incorporated in an answer to 
a complaint, the opposition to such motion shall not address any issues 
presented in the answer that are not also specifically raised in the 
motion. Failure to oppose any motion may constitute grounds for granting 
of the motion.
    (f) No reply may be filed to an opposition to a motion.
    (g) Motions seeking an order that the allegations in the complaint 
be made more definite and certain are prohibited.

[[Page 187]]

    (h) Amendments or supplements to complaints to add new claims or 
requests for relief are prohibited. Parties are responsible, however, 
for the continuing accuracy and completeness of all information and 
supporting authority furnished in a pending complaint proceeding as 
required under Sec. 1.720(g).

Sec. 1.728  Formal complaints not stating a cause of action; defective pleadings.

    (a) Any document purporting to be a formal complaint which does not

In such case, any amendment or supplement to such document will be 
considered a new filing which must be made within the statutory periods 
of limitations of actions contained in section 415 of the Communications 
Act.
    (b) Any other pleading filed in a formal complaint proceeding not in 
conformity with the requirements of the applicable rules in this part 
may be deemed defective. In such case the Commission may strike the 
pleading or request that specified defects be corrected and that proper 
pleadings be filed with the Commission and served on all parties within 
a prescribed time as a condition to being made a part of the record in 
the proceeding.

Sec. 1.729  Discovery.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (i) of this section governing Accelerated 
Docket proceedings, a complainant may file with the Commission and serve 
on a defendant, concurrently with its complaint, a request for up to ten 
written interrogatories. A defendant may file with the Commission and 
serve on a complainant, during the period starting with the service of 
the complaint and ending with the service of its answer, a request for 
up to ten written interrogatories. A complainant may file with the 
Commission and serve on a defendant, within three calendar days of 
service of the defendant's answer, a request for up to five written 
interrogatories. Subparts of any interrogatory will be counted as 
separate interrogatories for purposes of compliance with this limit. 
Requests for interrogatories filed and served pursuant to this procedure 
may be used to seek discovery of any non-privileged matter that is 
relevant to the material facts in dispute in the pending proceeding, 
provided, however, that requests for interrogatories filed and served by 
a complainant after service of the defendant's answer shall be limited 
in scope to specific factual allegations made by the defendant in 
support of its affirmative defenses. This procedure may not be employed 
for the purpose of delay, harassment or obtaining information that is 
beyond the scope of permissible inquiry related to the material facts in 
dispute in the pending proceeding.
    (b) Requests for interrogatories filed and served pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section shall contain a listing of the 
interrogatories requested and an explanation of why the information 
sought in each interrogatory is both necessary to the resolution of the 
dispute and not available from any other source.
    (c) A responding party shall file with the Commission and serve on 
the propounding party any opposition and objections to the requests for 
interrogatories as follows:
    (1) By the defendant, within ten calendar days of service of the 
requests for interrogatories served simultaneously with the complaint 
and within five calendar days of the requests for interrogatories served 
following service of the answer;
    (2) By the complainant, within five calendar days of service of the 
requests for interrogatories; and
    (3) In no event less than three calendar days prior to the initial 
status conference as provided for in Sec. 1.733(a).
    (d) Commission staff will consider the requests for interrogatories, 
properly filed and served pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
along with any objections or oppositions thereto, properly filed and 
served pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, at the initial status 
conference, as provided for in Sec. 1.733(a)(5), and at that time 
determine the interrogatories, if any, to which parties shall respond, 
and set the schedule of such response.

[[Page 188]]

    (e) The interrogatories ordered to be answered pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section are to be answered separately and fully in writing 
under oath or affirmation by the party served, or if such party is a 
public or private corporation or partnership or association, by any 
officer or agent who shall furnish such information as is available to 
the party. The answers shall be signed by the person making them. The 
answers shall be filed with the Commission and served on the propounding 
party.
    (f) A propounding party asserting that a responding party has 
provided an inadequate or insufficient response to Commission-ordered 
discovery request may file a motion to compel within ten days of the 
service of such response, or as otherwise directed by Commission staff, 
pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 1.727.
    (g) The Commission may, in its discretion, require parties to 
provide documents to the Commission in a scanned or other electronic 
format that provides:
    (1) Indexing by useful identifying information about the documents; 
and
    (2) Technology that allows staff to annotate the index so as to make 
the format an efficient means of reviewing the documents.
    (h) The Commission may allow additional discovery, including, but 
not limited to, document production, depositions and/or additional 
interrogatories. In its discretion, the Commission may modify the scope, 
means and scheduling of discovery in light of the needs of a particular 
case and the requirements of applicable statutory deadlines.
    (i) Discovery in Accelerated Docket proceedings. (1) Each party to 
an Accelerated Docket proceeding shall serve, with its initial pleading 
and with any reply statements in the pre-status-conference filing (see 
Sec. 1.726(g)(1)), copies of all documents in the possession, custody or 
control of the party that are likely to bear significantly on any claim 
or defense. For the purpose of this paragraph (i), document also shall 
include data compilations and tangible things. A document is likely to 
bear significantly on a claim or defense if it:
    (i) Appears likely to have an influence on, or affect the outcome 
of, a claim or defense;
    (ii) Reflects the relevant knowledge of persons who, if their 
potential testimony were known, might reasonably be expected to be 
deposed or called as a witness by any of the parties;
    (iii) Is something that competent counsel would consider reasonably 
necessary to prepare, evaluate or try a claim or defense; or
    (iv) Would not support the disclosing party's contentions.
    (2) In their Sec. 1.733(i)(4) pre-status-conference filings, parties 
to Accelerated Docket proceedings may request the production of 
additional documents. In their Sec. 1.733(i)(4) filings, parties may 
also seek leave to conduct a reasonable number of depositions, including 
depositions of expert witnesses, if any. When requesting additional 
discovery, each party shall be prepared at the status conference to 
justify its requests by identifying the specific issue or issues on 
which it expects to obtain evidence from each request.
    (3) Interrogatories shall not be routinely granted in Accelerated 
Docket proceedings. A party to an Accelerated Docket proceeding that 
prefers interrogatories to the other forms of available discovery, for 
reasons of convenience or expense, may seek leave in its 
Sec. 1.733(i)(4) pre-status-conference filing to propound a limited 
number of interrogatories.
    (4) Expert Witnesses.
    (i) Any complainant in an Accelerated Docket proceeding that intends 
to rely on expert testimony for a purpose other than to rebut a 
defendant's expert evidence, shall identify its expert witnesses in the 
information designation required by Sec. 1.721(a)(10)(i). In its 
Sec. 1.721(a)(10)(i) information designation, such a complainant shall 
also provide its expert statement. For purposes of this paragraph 
(i)(4), an expert statement shall include a brief statement of the 
opinions to be expressed by the expert, the basis and reasons therefor 
and any data or other information that the witness considered in forming 
her opinions.
    (ii) Any defendant in an Accelerated Docket proceeding that intends 
to rely on expert testimony shall identify its

[[Page 189]]

expert witnesses in the information designation required by 
Sec. 1.724(f)(1). Such a defendant shall provide its expert statement 
with its Sec. 1.733(i)(4), pre-status-conference filing.
    (iii) Any complainant in an Accelerated Docket proceeding that 
intends to rely on previously undisclosed expert testimony to rebut any 
portion of the defendant's case shall identify the expert and provide 
the appropriate expert statement at the initial status conference.
    (iv) Expert witnesses shall be subject to deposition in Accelerated 
Docket proceedings under the same rules and limitations applicable to 
fact witnesses.

Sec. 1.730  The Enforcement Bureau's Accelerated Docket.

    (a) Parties to formal complaint proceedings against common carriers 
within the responsibility of the Enforcement Bureau (see Secs. 0.111, 
0.311, 0.314 of this chapter) may request inclusion on the Bureau's 
Accelerated Docket. As set out in Secs. 1.720 through 1.736, proceedings 
on the Accelerated Docket are subject to shorter pleading deadlines and 
certain other procedural rules that do not apply to other formal 
complaint proceedings before the Enforcement Bureau.
    (b) Any party that contemplates filing a formal complaint may submit 
a request to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes 
Resolution Division, either by phone or in writing, seeking inclusion of 
its complaint, once filed, on the Accelerated Docket. In appropriate 
cases, Commission staff shall schedule and supervise pre-filing 
settlement negotiations between the parties to the dispute. If the 
parties do not resolve their dispute and the matter is accepted for 
handling on the Accelerated Docket, the complainant shall file its 
complaint with a letter stating that it has gained admission to the 
Accelerated Docket. When it files its complaint, such a complainant 
shall also serve a copy of its complaint on the Commission staff that 
supervised the pre-filing settlement discussions.
    (c) Within five days of receiving service of a complaint, any 
defendant in a formal complaint proceeding may submit by facsimile or 
hand delivery, to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes 
Resolution Division, a request seeking inclusion of its proceeding on 
the Accelerated Docket. Such a defendant contemporaneously shall 
transmit, in the same manner, a copy of its request to all parties to 
the proceeding. A defendant submitting such a request shall file and 
serve its answer in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 1.724(k), 
except that the defendant shall not be required to serve with its answer 
the automatic document production required by Secs. 1.724(k)(7) and 
1.729(i)(1). In proceedings accepted onto the Accelerated Docket at a 
defendant's request, the Commission staff will conduct supervised 
settlement discussions as appropriate. After accepting such a proceeding 
onto the Accelerated Docket, Commission staff will establish a schedule 
for the remainder of the proceeding, including the parties' 
Sec. 1.729(i)(1) automatic production of documents.
    (d) During the thirty days following the effective date of these 
rules, any party to a pending formal complaint proceeding in which an 
answer has been filed or is past due may seek admission of the 
proceeding to the Accelerated Docket by submitting a request by 
facsimile or hand delivery to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's 
Market Disputes Resolution Division, with facsimile copies to all other 
parties to the proceeding by the same mode of transmission. If a pending 
proceeding is accepted onto the Accelerated Docket, Commission staff 
will conduct supervised settlement discussions if appropriate and 
establish a schedule for the remainder of the proceeding, including the 
parties' Sec. 1.729(i)(1) automatic production of documents if 
necessary.
    (e) In determining whether to admit a proceeding onto the 
Accelerated Docket, Commission staff may consider factors from the 
following, non-exclusive list:
    (1) Whether it appears that the parties to the dispute have 
exhausted the

[[Page 190]]

reasonable opportunities for settlement during the staff-supervised 
settlement discussions.
    (2) Whether the expedited resolution of a particular dispute or 
category of disputes appears likely to advance competition in the 
telecommunications market.
    (3) Whether the issues in the proceeding appear suited for decision 
under the constraints of the Accelerated Docket. This factor may entail, 
inter alia, examination of the number of distinct issues raised in a 
proceeding, the likely complexity of the necessary discovery, and 
whether the complainant bifurcates any damages claims for decision in a 
separate proceeding. See Sec. 1.722(b).
    (4) Whether the complainant states a claim for violation of the Act, 
or Commission rule or order that falls within the Commission's 
jurisdiction.
    (5) Whether it appears that inclusion of a proceeding on the 
Accelerated Docket would be unfair to one party because of an 
overwhelming disparity in the parties' resources.
    (6) Such other factors as the Commission staff, within its 
substantial discretion, may deem appropriate and conducive to the prompt 
and fair adjudication of complaint proceedings.
    (f) If it appears at any time that a proceeding on the Accelerated 
Docket is no longer appropriate for such treatment, Commission staff may 
remove the matter from the Accelerated Docket either on its own motion 
or at the request of any party.
    (g) Minitrials.
    (1) In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the Commission may conduct a 
minitrial, or hearing-type proceeding, as an alternative to requiring 
that parties submit briefs in support of their cases. Minitrials 
typically will take place between 40 and 45 days after the filing of the 
complaint. A Commission Administrative Law Judge (``ALJ'') typically 
will preside at the minitrial, administer oaths to witnesses, and time 
the parties' presentation of their cases. In consultation with the 
Commission staff, the ALJ will rule on objections or procedural issues 
that may arise during the course of the minitrial.
    (2) Before a minitrial, each party will receive a specific time 
allotment in which it may present evidence and make argument during the 
minitrial. The ALJ or other Commission staff presiding at the minitrial 
will deduct from each party's time allotment any time that the party 
spends presenting either evidence or argument during the proceeding. The 
presiding official shall have broad discretion in determining any time 
penalty or deduction for a party who appears to be intentionally 
delaying either the proceeding or the presentation of another party's 
case. Within the limits imposed by its time allotment, a party may 
present evidence and argument in whatever manner or format it chooses, 
provided, however, that the submission of written testimony shall not be 
permitted.
    (3) Three days before a minitrial, each party to a proceeding shall 
serve on all other parties a copy of all exhibits that the party intends 
to introduce during the minitrial and a list of all witnesses, including 
expert witnesses, that the party may call during the minitrial. Service 
of this material shall be accomplished either by hand or by facsimile 
transmission. Objections to any exhibits or proposed witness testimony 
will be heard before the beginning of the minitrial.
    (4) No party will be permitted to call as a witness in a minitrial, 
or otherwise offer evidence from, an individual in that party's employ, 
unless the individual appears on the party's information designation 
(see Secs. 1.721(a)(10)(i) or 1.724(f)(1)) with a general description of 
the issues on which she will offer evidence. No party will be permitted 
to present expert evidence unless the party has complied fully with the 
expert-disclosure requirements of Sec. 1.729(i)(4). The Commission may 
permit exceptions to the rules in this paragraph (g)(4) for good cause 
shown.
    (5) Two days before the beginning of the minitrial, parties shall 
file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. These submissions 
shall not exceed 40 pages per party. Within three days after the 
conclusion of the minitrial, parties may submit revised proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law to meet evidence introduced or 
arguments raised at the minitrial.

[[Page 191]]

These submissions shall not exceed 20 pages per party.
    (6) The parties shall arrange for the stenographic transcription of 
minitrial proceedings so that transcripts are available and filed with 
the Commission no more than three days after the conclusion of the 
minitrial. Absent an agreement to the contrary, the cost of the 
transcript shall be shared equally between the parties to the 
proceeding.
    (h) Applications for review of staff decisions issued on delegated 
authority in Accelerated Docket proceedings shall comply with the filing 
and service requirements in Sec. 1.115(e)(4). In those Accelerated 
Docket proceedings which raise issues that may not be decided on 
delegated authority (see 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(1); 47 CFR 0.291(d)), the 
staff decision issued after the minitrial will be a recommended decision 
subject to adoption or modification by the Commission. Any party to the 
proceeding that seeks modification of the recommended decision may do so 
by filing comments challenging the decision within 15 days of its 
release by the Commission's Office of Media Relations. (Compare 
Sec. 1.4(b)(2).) Opposition comments may be filed within 15 days of the 
comments challenging the decision; reply comments may be filed 10 days 
thereafter and shall be limited to issues raised in the opposition 
comments.
    (i) If no party files comments challenging the recommended decision, 
the Commission will issue its decision adopting or modifying the 
recommended decision within 45 days of its release. If parties to the 
proceeding file comments to the recommended decision, the Commission 
will issue its decision adopting or modifying the recommended decision 
within 30 days of the filing of the final comments.

Sec. 1.731  Confidentiality of information produced or exchanged by the parties.

    (a) Any materials generated in the course of a formal complaint 
proceeding may be designated as proprietary by that party if the party 
believes in good faith that the materials fall within an exemption to 
disclosure contained in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 
552(b) (1) through (9). Any party asserting confidentiality for such 
materials shall so indicate by clearly marking each page, or portion 
thereof, for which a proprietary designation is claimed. If a 
proprietary designation is challenged, the party claiming 
confidentiality shall have the burden of demonstrating, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that the material designated as 
proprietary falls under the standards for nondisclosure enunciated in 
the FOIA.
    (b) Materials marked as proprietary may be disclosed solely to the 
following persons, only for use in prosecuting or defending a party to 
the complaint action, and only to the extent necessary to assist in the 
prosecution or defense of the case:
    (1) Counsel of record representing the parties in the complaint 
action and any support personnel employed by such attorneys;
    (2) Officers or employees of the opposing party who are named by the 
opposing party as being directly involved in the prosecution or defense 
of the case;
    (3) Consultants or expert witnesses retained by the parties;
    (4) The Commission and its staff; and
    (5) Court reporters and stenographers in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of this section.
    (c) These individuals shall not disclose information designated as 
proprietary to any person who is not authorized under this section to 
receive such information, and shall not use the information in any 
activity or function other than the prosecution or defense in the case 
before the Commission. Each individual who is provided access to the 
information shall sign a notarized statement affirmatively stating that 
the individual has personally reviewed the Commission's rules and 
understands the limitations they impose on the signing party.
    (d) No copies of materials marked proprietary may be made except 
copies to be used by persons designated in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Each party shall maintain a log recording the number of copies 
made of all proprietary material and the persons to whom the copies have 
been provided.

[[Page 192]]

    (e) Upon termination of a formal complaint proceeding, including all 
appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any 
proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received 
copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party. In 
addition, upon final termination of the complaint proceeding, any notes 
or other work product derived in whole or in part from the proprietary 
materials of an opposing or third party shall be destroyed.

Sec. 1.732  Other required written submissions.

    (a) The Commission may, in its discretion, or upon a party's motion 
showing good cause, require the parties to file briefs summarizing the 
facts and issues presented in the pleadings and other record evidence.
    (b) Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, all briefs shall 
include all legal and factual claims and defenses previously set forth 
in the complaint, answer, or any other pleading submitted in the 
proceeding. Claims and defenses previously made but not reflected in the 
briefs will be deemed abandoned. The Commission may, in its discretion, 
limit the scope of any briefs to certain subjects or issues. A party 
shall attach to its brief copies of all documents, data compilations, 
tangible things, and affidavits upon which such party relies or intends 
to rely to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in its 
brief and such brief shall contain a full explanation of how each 
attachment is relevant to the issues and matters in dispute. All such 
attachments to a brief shall be documents, data compilations or tangible 
things, or affidavits made by persons, that were identified by any party 
in its information designations filed pursuant to Secs. 1.721(a)(10)(i), 
(a)(10)(ii), 1.724(f)(1), (f)(2), and 1.726(d)(1), (d)(2). Any other 
supporting documentation or affidavits that is attached to a brief must 
be accompanied by a full explanation of the relevance of such materials 
and why such materials were not identified in the information 
designations. These briefs shall contain the proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions of law which the filing party is urging the Commission 
to adopt, with specific citation to the record, and supporting relevant 
authority and analysis.
    (c) In cases in which discovery is not conducted, absent an order by 
the Commission that briefs be filed, parties may not submit briefs. If 
the Commission does authorize the filing of briefs in cases in which 
discovery is not conducted, briefs shall be filed concurrently by both 
the complainant and defendant at such time as designated by the 
Commission staff and in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (d) In cases in which discovery is conducted, briefs shall be filed 
concurrently by both the complainant and defendant at such time 
designated by the Commission staff.
    (e) Briefs containing information which is claimed by an opposing or 
third party to be proprietary under Sec. 1.731 shall be submitted to the 
Commission in confidence pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 0.459 of 
this chapter and clearly marked ``Not for Public Inspection.'' An edited 
version removing all proprietary data shall also be filed with the 
Commission for inclusion in the public file. Edited versions shall be 
filed within five days from the date the unedited brief is submitted, 
and served on opposing parties.
    (f) Initial briefs shall be no longer than twenty-five pages. Reply 
briefs shall be no longer than ten pages. Either on its own motion or 
upon proper motion by a party, the Commission staff may establish other 
page limits for briefs.
    (g) The Commission may require the parties to submit any additional 
information it deems appropriate for a full, fair, and expeditious 
resolution of the proceeding, including affidavits and exhibits.
    (h) The parties shall submit a joint statement of stipulated facts, 
disputed facts, and key legal issues no later than two business days 
prior to the initial status conference, scheduled in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1.733(a).

Sec. 1.733  Status conference.

    (a) In any complaint proceeding, the Commission may, in its 
discretion, direct the attorneys and/or the parties to appear before it 
for a status conference. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, and 
with the exception of Accelerated Docket proceedings, governed by 
paragraph (i) of this section, an initial status conference shall take 
place, at the time and place designated by the Commission staff, ten 
business days after the date the answer is due to be filed. A status 
conference may include discussion of:
    (1) Simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (2) The necessity for or desirability of additional pleadings or 
evidentiary submissions;
    (3) Obtaining admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties 
as to any or all of the matters in controversy;
    (4) Settlement of all or some of the matters in controversy by 
agreement of the parties;
    (5) Whether discovery is necessary and, if so, the scope, type and 
schedule for such discovery;
    (6) The schedule for the remainder of the case and the dates for any 
further status conferences; and
    (7) Such other matters that may aid in the disposition of the 
complaint.
    (b)(1) Subject to paragraph (i) of this section governing 
Accelerated Docket proceedings, parties shall meet and confer prior to 
the initial status conference to discuss:
    (i) Settlement prospects;
    (ii) Discovery;
    (iii) Issues in dispute;
    (iv) Schedules for pleadings;
    (v) Joint statement of stipulated facts, disputed facts, and key 
legal issues; and
    (vi) In a 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B) proceeding, whether or not the 
parties agree to waive the 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B) 90-day resolution 
deadline.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (i) of this section governing Accelerated 
Docket proceedings, parties shall submit a joint statement of all 
proposals agreed to and disputes remaining as a result of such meeting 
to Commission staff at least two business days prior to the scheduled 
initial status conference.
    (c) In addition to the initial status conference referenced in 
paragraph (a) of this section, any party may also request that a 
conference be held at any time after the complaint has been filed.
    (d) During a status conference, the Commission staff may issue oral 
rulings pertaining to a variety of interlocutory matters relevant to the 
conduct of a formal complaint proceeding including, inter alia, 
procedural matters, discovery, and the submission of briefs or other 
evidentiary materials.
    (e) Parties may make, upon written notice to the Commission and all 
attending parties at least three business days prior to the status 
conference, an audio recording of the Commission staff's summary of its 
oral rulings. Alternatively, upon agreement among all attending parties 
and written notice to the Commission at least three business days prior 
to the status conference, the parties may make an audio recording of, or 
use a stenographer to transcribe, the oral presentations and exchanges 
between and among the participating parties, insofar as such 
communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the Commission 
staff, as well as the Commission staff's summary of its oral rulings. A 
complete transcript of any audio recording or stenographic transcription 
shall be filed with the Commission as part of the record, pursuant to 
the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The parties shall 
make all necessary arrangements for the use of a stenographer and the 
cost of transcription, absent agreement to the contrary, will be shared 
equally by all parties that agree to make the record of the status 
conference.
    (f) The parties in attendance, unless otherwise directed, shall 
either:
    (1) Submit a joint proposed order memorializing the oral rulings 
made during the conference to the Commission by 5:30 pm, Eastern Time, 
on the business day following the date of the status conference, or as 
otherwise directed by Commission staff. In the event the parties in 
attendance cannot reach agreement as to the rulings that were made, the 
joint proposed order shall include the rulings on which the parties

[[Page 194]]

agree, and each party's alternative proposed rulings for those rulings 
on which they cannot agree. Commission staff will review and make 
revisions, if necessary, prior to signing and filing the submission as 
part of the record. The proposed order shall be submitted both as hard 
copy and on computer disk in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. 1.734(d); or
    (2) Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, 
submit to the Commission by 5:30 pm., Eastern Time, on the third 
business day following the status conference or as otherwise directed by 
Commission staff either:
    (i) A transcript of the audio recording of the Commission staff's 
summary of its oral rulings;
    (ii) A transcript of the audio recording of the oral presentations 
and exchanges between and among the participating parties, insofar as 
such communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the 
Commission staff, and the Commission staff's summary of its oral 
rulings; or
    (iii) A stenographic transcript of the oral presentations and 
exchanges between and among the participating parties, insofar as such 
communications are ``on-the-record'' as determined by the Commission 
staff, and the Commission staff's summary of its oral rulings.
    (g) Status conferences will be scheduled by the Commission staff at 
such time and place as it may designate to be conducted in person or by 
telephone conference call.
    (h) The failure of any attorney or party, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a waiver by 
that party and will not preclude the Commission staff from conferring 
with those parties and/or counsel present.
    (i) Accelerated Docket Proceedings. (1) In Accelerated Docket 
proceedings, the initial status conference will be held 10 days after 
the answer is due to be filed.
    (2) Prior to the initial status conference, the parties shall 
confer, either in person or by telephone, about:
    (i) Discovery to which they can agree;
    (ii) Facts to which they can stipulate; and
    (iii) Factual and legal issues in dispute.
    (3) Two days before the status conference, parties shall submit to 
Commission staff a joint statement of:
    (i) The agreements that they have reached with respect to discovery;
    (ii) The facts to which they have agreed to stipulate; and
    (iii) The disputed facts or legal issues of which they can agree to 
a joint statement.
    (4) Two days before the status conference, each party also shall 
submit to Commission staff a separate statement which shall include, as 
appropriate, the party's statement of the disputed facts and legal 
issues presented by the complaint proceeding and any additional 
discovery that the party seeks. A complainant that wishes to reply to a 
defendant's affirmative defense shall do so in its pre-status-conference 
filing. To the extent that this filing contains statements replying to 
an affirmative defense, the complainant shall include, and/or serve with 
the statement, the witness information and documents required in 
Sec. 1.726(g)(3)-(4). A defendant that intends to rely on expert 
evidence shall include its expert statement in its pre-status conference 
filing. (See Sec. 1.729(i)(4)(ii).)

    (a) All papers filed in any formal complaint proceeding must be 
drawn in conformity with the requirements of Secs. 1.49 and 1.50.
    (b) All averments of claims or defenses in complaints and answers 
shall be made in numbered paragraphs. The contents of each paragraph 
shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of 
circumstances. Each claim founded on a separatetransaction or occurrence 
and each affirmative defense shall be separately stated to facilitate 
the clear presentation of the matters set forth.
    (c) The original of all pleadings and other submissions filed by any 
party shall be signed by the party, or by the party's attorney. The 
signing party

[[Page 195]]

shall include in the document his or her address, telephone number, 
facsimile number and the date on which the document was signed. Copies 
should be conformed to the original. Unless specifically required by 
rule or statute, pleadings need not be verified. The signature of an 
attorney or party shall be a certificate that the attorney or party has 
read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of his or 
her knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, 
it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good 
faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing 
law; and that it is not interposed solely for purposes of delay or for 
any other improper purpose.
    (d) All proposed orders shall be submitted both as hard copies and 
on computer disk formatted to be compatible with the Commission's 
computer system and using the Commission's current wordprocessing 
software. Each disk should be submitted in ``read only'' mode. Each disk 
should be clearly labelled with the party's name, proceeding, type of 
pleading, and date of submission. Each disk should be accompanied by a 
cover letter. Parties who have submitted copies of tariffs or reports 
with their hard copies need not include such tariffs or reports on the 
disk. Upon showing of good cause, the Commission may waive the 
requirements of this paragraph.

carrier; such actions may not be brought against multiple defendants 
unless the defendant carriers are commonly owned or controlled, are 
alleged to have acted in concert, are alleged to be jointly liable to 
complainant, or the complaint concerns common questions of law or fact. 
Complaints may, however, be consolidated by the Commission for 
disposition.
    (b) The complainant shall file an original copy of the complaint, 
accompanied by the correct fee, in accordance with part I, subpart G

Bureau; and
    (4) If a complaint is addressed against multiple defendants, pay a 
separate fee, in accordance with part I, subpart G (see 
Sec. 1.1105(1)(c) and (d)), and file three copies of the complaint with 
the Office of the Commission Secretary for each additional defendant.
    (c) Generally, a separate file is set up for each defendant. An 
original plus two copies shall be filed of all pleadings and documents, 
other than the complaint, for each file number assigned.
    (d) The complainant shall serve the complaint by hand delivery on 
either the named defendant or one of the named defendant's registered 
agents for service of process on the same date that the complaint is 
filed with the Commission in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Upon receipt of the complaint by the Commission, the Commission 
shall promptly send, by facsimile transmission to each defendant named 
in the complaint, notice of the filing of the complaint. The Commission 
shall send, by regular U.S. mail delivery, to each defendant named in 
the complaint, a copy of the complaint. The Commission shall 
additionally send, by regular U.S. mail to all parties, a schedule 
detailing the date the answer will be due and the date, time and 
location of the initial status conference.
    (f) All subsequent pleadings and briefs filed in any formal 
complaint proceeding, as well as all letters, documents or other written 
submissions, shall be served by the filing party on the attorney of 
record for each party to the proceeding, or, where a party is not 
represented by an attorney, each party

to the proceeding either by hand delivery, overnight delivery, or by 
facsimile transmission followed by regular U.S. mail delivery, together 
with a proof of such service in accordance with the requirements of

    (1) Service by hand delivery that is delivered to the office of the 
recipient by 5:30 pm, local time of the recipient, on a business day 
will be deemed served that day. Service by hand delivery that is 
delivered to the office of the recipient after 5:30 pm, local time of 
the recipient, on a business day will be deemed served on the following 
business day;
    (2) Service by overnight delivery will be deemed served the business 
day following the day it is accepted for overnight delivery by a 
reputable overnight delivery service such as, or comparable to, the US 
Postal Service Express Mail, United Parcel Service or Federal Express; 
or
    (3) Service by facsimile transmission that is fully transmitted to 
the office of the recipient by 5:30 pm, local time of the recipient, on 
a business day will be deemed served that day. Service by facsimile 
transmission that is fully transmitted to the office of the recipient 
after 5:30 pm, local time of the recipient, on a business day will be 
deemed served on the following business day.
    (g) Supplemental complaint proceedings. Supplemental complaints 
filed pursuant to section 1.722 shall conform to the requirements set 
out in this section, except that the complainant need not submit a 
filing fee, and the complainant may effect service pursuant to paragraph 
(f) of this section rather than paragraph (d) of this section numerals.

laws of the applicable jurisdiction.
    (b) Applications, amendments thereto, and related statements of fact

United States. The attorney shall in that event separately set forth the 
reason why the application is not signed by the applicant. In addition, 
if any matter is stated on the basis of the attorney's belief only 
(rather than his knowledge), he shall separately set forth his reasons 
for believing that such statements are true.
    (c) Only the original of applications, amendments, or related 
statements of fact need be signed; copies may be conformed.
    (d) Applications, amendments, and related statements of fact need

    (a) Any application not designated for hearing may be amended at any 
time by the filing of signed amendments in the same manner, and with the

deny (or to designate for hearing) has been filed, the amendment shall 
be served on the petitioner.
    (b) After any application is designated for hearing, requests to 
amend such application may be granted by the presiding officer upon good 
cause shown by petition, which petition shall be properly served upon 
all other parties to the proceeding.
    (c) The applicant may at any time be ordered to amend his 
application so as to make it more definite and certain. Such order may 
be issued upon motion of the Commission (or the presiding officer, if

Sec. 1.746  Defective applications.

    (a) Applications not in accordance with the applicable rules in this 
chapter may be deemed defective and returned by the Commission without 
acceptance of such applications for filing and consideration. Such 
applications will be accepted for filing and consideration if 
accompanied by petition showing good cause for waiver of the rule with 
which the application does not conform.
    (b) The assignment of a file number, if any, to an application is 
for the administrative convenience of the Commission and does not

Sec. 1.747  Inconsistent or conflicting applications.

    When an application is pending or undecided, no inconsistent or 
conflicting application filed by the same applicant, his successor or

<R05>
Sec. 1.748  Dismissal of applications.

    (a) Before designation for hearing. Any application not designated 
for hearing may be dismissed without prejudice at any time upon request 
of the applicant. An applicant's request for the return of an 
application that has been accepted for filing and consideration, but not 
designated for hearing, will be deemed a request for dismissal without 
prejudice. The Commission may dismiss an application without prejudice 
before it has been designated for hearing when the applicant fails to 
comply or justify noncompliance with Commission requests for additional 
information in connection with such application.
    (b) After designation for hearing. A request to dismiss an 
application without prejudice after it has been designated for hearing 
shall be made by petition properly served upon all parties to the 
hearing and will be granted only for good cause shown. An application 
may be dismissed with prejudice after it has been designated for hearing 
when the applicant:
    (1) Fails to comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.221(c);
    (2) Otherwise fails to prosecute his application; or
    (3) Fails to comply or justify noncompliance with Commission 
requests for additional information in connection with such application.

Sec. 1.767  Cable landing licenses.

    (a) Applications for cable landing licenses under 47 U.S.C. 34-39 
and Executive Order No. 10530, dated May 10, 1954, should be filed in 
duplicate and in accordance with the provisions of that Executive Order. 
These applications should contain:
    (1) The name, address and telephone number(s) of the applicant;
    (2) The Government, State, or Territory under the laws of which each 
corporate or partnership applicant is organized;
    (3) The name, title, post office address, and telephone number of 
the officer and any other contact point, such as legal counsel, to whom 
correspondence concerning the application is to be addressed;
    (4) A description of the submarine cable, including the type and 
number of channels and the capacity thereof;
    (5) A specific description of the cable landing stations on the 
shore of the United States and in foreign countries where the cable will 
land. The description shall include a map showing specific geographic 
coordinates, and may also include street addresses, of each landing 
station. The map must also specify the coordinates of any beach joint 
where those coordinates differ from the coordinates of the cable 
station. The applicant initially may file a general geographic 
description of the landing points; however, grant of the application 
will be conditioned on the Commission's final approval of a more 
specific description of the landing points, including all information 
required by this paragraph, to be filed by the applicant no later than 
ninety (90) days prior to construction. The Commission will give public 
notice of the filing of this description, and grant of the license will 
be considered final if the Commission does not notify the applicant 
otherwise in writing no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the 
specific description of the landing

[[Page 200]]

points, unless the Commission designates a different time period;
    (6) A statement as to whether the cable will be operated on a common 
carrier or non-common carrier basis;
    (7) A list of the proposed owners of the cable system, including 
each U.S. cable landing station, their respective voting and ownership 
interests in each U.S. cable landing station, their respective voting 
interests in the wet link portion of the cable system, and their 
respective ownership interests by segment in the cable;
    (8) For each applicant of the cable system, a certification as to 
whether the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier, 
including an entity that owns or controls a foreign cable landing 
station in any of the cable's destination markets. Include the 
citizenship of each applicant and information and certifications 
required in Sec. 63.18(h) through (k), and in Sec. 63.18(o), of this 
chapter;
    (9) A certification that the applicant accepts and will abide by the 
routine conditions specified in paragraph (g) of this section; and
    (10) Any other information that may be necessary to enable the 
Commission to act on the application.
    (11) (i) If applying for authority to assign or transfer control of 
an interest in a cable system, the applicant shall complete paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section for both the transferor/assignor 
and the transferee/assignee. Only the transferee/assignee needs to 
complete paragraphs (a)(8) through (a)(9) of this section. At the 
beginning of the application, the applicant should also include a 
narrative of the means by which the transfer or assignment will take 
place. The application shall also specify, on a segment specific basis, 
the percentage of voting and ownership interests being transferred or 
assigned in the cable system, including in a U.S. cable landing station. 
The Commission reserves the right to request additional information as 
to the particulars of the transaction to aid it in making its public 
interest determination.
    (ii) In the event the transaction requiring an assignment or 
transfer of control application also requires the filing of a foreign 
carrier affiliation notification pursuant to Sec. 1.768, the applicant 
shall reference in the application the foreign carrier affiliation 
notification and the date of its filing. See Sec. 1.768. See also 
paragraph (g)(7) of this section (providing for post-transaction 
notification of pro forma assignments and transfers of control).
    (iii) An assignee or transferee shall notify the Commission no later 
than thirty (30) days after either consummation of the assignment or 
transfer or a decision not to consummate the assignment or transfer. The 
notification may be by letter and shall identify the file numbers under 
which the initial license and the authorization of the assignment or 
transfer were granted.
    (b) These applications are acted upon by the Commission after 
obtaining the approval of the Secretary of State and such assistance 
from any executive department or establishment of the Government as it 
may require.
    (c) Original files relating to submarine cable landing licenses and 
applications for licenses since June 30, 1934, are kept by the 
Commission. Such applications for licenses (including all documents and 
exhibits filed with and made a part thereof, with the exception of any 
maps showing the exact location of the submarine cable or cables to be 
licensed) and the licenses issued pursuant thereto, with the exception 
of such maps, shall, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, be open 
to public inspection in the offices of the Commission in Washington, 
D.C.
    (d) Original files relating to licenses and applications for 
licenses for the landing operation of cables prior to June 30, 1934, 
were kept by the Department of State, and such files prior to 1930 have 
been transferred to the Executive and Foreign Affairs Branch of the 
General Records Office of the National Archives. Requests for inspection 
of these files should, however, be addressed to the Federal 
Communications Commission, Washington, D.C., 20554; and the Commission 
will obtain such files for a temporary period in order to permit 
inspection at the offices of the Commission.
    (e) A separate application shall be filed with respect to each 
individual cable system for which a license is requested, or for which 
modification or

[[Page 201]]

amendment of a previous license is requested. The application fee for a 
non common-carrier cable landing license is payment type code BJT. 
Applicants for common carrier cable landing licenses shall pay the fees 
for both a common carrier cable landing license (payment type code CXT) 
and overseas cable construction (payment type code BIT). There is no 
application fee for modification of a cable landing license, except that 
the fee for assignment or transfer of control of a cable landing license 
is payment type code CUT. See Sec. 1.1107(2) of this chapter.
    (f) Applicants shall disclose to any interested member of the 
public, upon written request, accurate information concerning the 
location and timing for the construction of a submarine cable system 
authorized under this section. This disclosure shall be made within 30 
days of receipt of the request.
    (g) Routine conditions. Except as otherwise ordered by the 
Commission, the following rules apply to each licensee of a cable 
landing license granted on or after March 15, 2002:
    (1) Grant of the cable landing license is subject to:
    (i) All rules and regulations of the Federal Communications 
Commission;
    (ii) Any treaties or conventions relating to communications to which 
the United States is or may hereafter become a party; and
    (iii) Any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United 
States rescinding, changing, modifying or amending any rights accruing 
to any person by grant of the license;
    (2) The location of the cable system within the territorial waters 
of the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and 
upon its shores shall be in conformity with plans approved by the 
Secretary of the Army. The cable shall be moved or shifted by the 
licensee at its expense upon request of the Secretary of the Army, 
whenever he or she considers such course necessary in the public 
interest, for reasons of national defense, or for the maintenance and 
improvement of harbors for navigational purposes;
    (3) The licensee shall at all times comply with any requirements of 
United States government authorities regarding the location and 
concealment of the cable facilities, buildings, and apparatus for the 
purpose of protecting and safeguarding the cables from injury or 
destruction by enemies of the United States of America;
    (4) The licensee, or any person or company controlling it, 
controlled by it, or under direct or indirect common control with it, 
does not enjoy and shall not acquire any right to handle traffic to or 
from the United States, its territories or its possessions unless such 
service is authorized by the Commission pursuant to section 214 of the 
Communications Act, as amended;
    (5)(i) The licensee shall be prohibited from agreeing to accept 
special concessions directly or indirectly from any foreign carrier, 
including any entity that owns or controls a foreign cable landing 
station, where the foreign carrier possesses sufficient market power on 
the foreign end of the route to affect competition adversely in the U.S. 
market, and from agreeing to accept special concessions in the future.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, a special concession is defined 
as an exclusive arrangement involving services, facilities, or functions 
on the foreign end of a U.S. international route that are necessary to 
land, connect, or operate submarine cables, where the arrangement is not 
offered to similarly situated U.S. submarine cable owners, indefeasible-
right-of-user holders, or lessors, and includes arrangements for the 
terms for acquisition, resale, lease, transfer and use of capacity on 
the cable; access to collocation space; the opportunity to provide or 
obtain backhaul capacity; access to technical network information; and 
interconnection to the public switched telecommunications network.
    Note to paragraph (g)(5):
    Licensees may rely on the Commission's list of foreign carriers that 
do not qualify for the presumption that they lack market power in 
particular foreign points for purposes of determining which foreign 
carriers are the subject of the requirements of this section. The 
Commission's list of foreign carriers that do not qualify for the 
presumption that they lack market power is available from the 
International Bureau's World Wide Web site at http://www.fcc.gov/ib.
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section, the 
cable landing

[[Page 202]]

license and rights granted in the license shall not be transferred, 
assigned, or disposed of, or disposed of indirectly by transfer of 
control of the licensee, unless the Federal Communications Commission 
gives prior consent in writing;
    (7) A pro forma assignee or a person or company that is the subject 
of a pro forma transfer of control of a cable landing license is not 
required to seek prior approval for the pro forma transaction. A pro 
forma assignee or person or company that is the subject of a pro forma 
transfer of control must notify the Secretary, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, with a copy to the Chief, 
International Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, no later than 
thirty (30) days after the assignment or transfer of control is 
consummated. The notification may be in the form of a letter (in 
duplicate to the Secretary), and it must contain a certification that 
the assignment or transfer of control was pro forma, as defined in 
Sec. 63.24(a) of this chapter, and, together with all previous pro forma 
transactions, does not result in a change of the licensee's ultimate 
control. A single letter may be filed for an assignment or transfer of 
control of more than one license issued in the name of a licensee if 
each license is identified by the file number under which it was 
granted;
    (8) Unless the licensee has notified the Commission in the 
application of the precise locations at which the cable will land, as 
required by paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the licensee shall notify 
the Commission no later than ninety (90) days prior to commencing 
construction at that landing location. The Commission will give public 
notice of the filing of each description, and grant of the cable landing 
license will be considered final with respect to that landing location 
unless the Commission issues a notice to the contrary no later than 
sixty (60) days after receipt of the specific description. See paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section;
    (9) The Commission reserves the right to require the licensee to 
file an environmental assessment should it determine that the landing of 
the cable at the specific locations and construction of necessary cable 
landing stations may significantly affect the environment within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.1307 implementing the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969. See Sec. 1.1307(a) and (b). The cable landing license is 
subject to modification by the Commission under its review of any 
environmental assessment or environmental impact statement that it may 
require pursuant to its rules. See also Sec. 1.1306 note 1 and 
Sec. 1.1307(c) and (d);
    (10) The Commission reserves the right, pursuant to section 2 of the 
Cable Landing License Act, 47 U.S.C. 35, Executive Order No. 10530 as 
amended, and section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
47 U.S.C. 214, to impose common carrier regulation or other regulation 
consistent with the Cable Landing License Act on the operations of the 
cable system if it finds that the public interest so requires;
    (11) The licensee, or in the case of multiple licensees, the 
licensees collectively, shall maintain de jure and de facto control of 
the U.S. portion of the cable system, including the cable landing 
stations in the United States, sufficient to comply with the 
requirements of the Commission's rules and any specific conditions of 
the license;
    (12) The licensee shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.768;
    (13) The cable landing license is revocable by the Commission after 
due notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to section 2 of the 
Cable Landing License Act, 47 U.S.C. 35, or for failure to comply with 
the terms of the license or with the Commission's rules; and
    (14) The licensee shall notify the Secretary, Federal Commissions 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, in writing, within thirty (30) days of 
the date the cable is placed into service, of the date the cable was 
placed into service. The cable landing license shall expire twenty-five 
(25) years from the in-service date, unless renewed or extended upon 
proper application. Upon expiration, all rights granted under the 
license shall be terminated.
    (h) Applicants/Licensees. Except as otherwise required by the 
Commission, the following entities, at a minimum, shall be applicants 
for, and licensees on, a cable landing license:

[[Page 203]]

    (1) Any entity that owns or controls a cable landing station in the 
United States; and
    (2) All other entities owning or controlling a five percent (5%) or 
greater interest in the cable system and using the U.S. points of the 
cable system.
    (i) Processing of cable landing license applications. The Commission 
will take action upon an application eligible for streamlined 
processing, as specified in paragraph (k) of this section, within forty-
five (45) days after release of the public notice announcing the 
application as acceptable for filing and eligible for streamlined 
processing. If the Commission deems an application seeking streamlined 
processing acceptable for filing but ineligible for streamlined 
processing, or if an applicant does not seek streamlined processing, the 
Commission will issue public notice indicating that the application is 
ineligible for streamlined processing. Within ninety (90) days of the 
public notice, the Commission will take action upon the application or 
provide public notice that, because the application raises questions of 
extraordinary complexity, an additional 90-day period for review is 
needed. Each successive 90-day period may be so extended.
    (j) Applications for streamlining. Each applicant seeking to use the 
streamlined grant procedure specified in paragraph (i) of this section 
shall caption its application and any cover letter with ``Application 
for Cable Landing License--Streamlined Processing Requested.'' 
Applications for streamlined processing shall include the information 
and certifications required by paragraph (k) of this section. On the 
date of filing with the Commission, the applicant shall also send a 
complete copy of the application, or any major amendments or other 
material filings regarding the application, to: U.S. Coordinator, EB/
CIP, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW, Washington, DC 20520-
5818; Office of Chief Counsel/NTIA, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th 
St. and Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20230; and Defense 
Information Systems Agency, Code RGC, 701 S. Courthouse Road, Arlington, 
Va. 22204, and shall certify such service on a service list attached to 
the application or other filing.
    (k) Eligibility for streamlining. Each applicant must demonstrate 
eligibility for streamlining by:
    (1) Certifying that it is not a foreign carrier and it is not 
affiliated with a foreign carrier in any of the cable's destination 
markets;
    (2) Demonstrating pursuant to Sec. 63.12(c)(l)(i) through (iii) of 
this chapter that any such foreign carrier or affiliated foreign carrier 
lacks market power; or
    (3) Certifying that the destination market where the applicant is, 
or has an affiliation with, a foreign carrier is a World Trade 
Organization (WTO) Member and the applicant agrees to accept and abide 
by the reporting requirements set out in paragraph (l) of this section. 
An application that includes an applicant that is, or is affiliated 
with, a carrier with market power in a cable's non-WTO Member 
destination country is not eligible for streamlining.
    (l) Reporting Requirements Applicable to Licensees Affiliated with a 
Carrier with Market Power in a Cable's WTO Destination Market. Any 
licensee that is, or is affiliated with, a carrier with market power in 
any of the cable's WTO Member destination countries, and that requests 
streamlined processing of an application under paragraphs (j) and (k) of 
this section, must comply with the following requirements:
    (1) File quarterly reports summarizing the provisioning and 
maintenance of all network facilities and services procured from the 
licensee's affiliate in that destination market, within ninety (90) days 
from the end of each calendar quarter. These reports shall contain the 
following:
    (i) The types of facilities and services provided (for example, a 
lease of wet link capacity in the cable, collocation of licensee's 
equipment in the cable station with the ability to provide backhaul, or 
cable station and backhaul services provided to the licensee);
    (ii) For provisioned facilities and services, the volume or quantity 
provisioned, and the time interval between order and delivery; and
    (iii) The number of outages and intervals between fault report and 
facility or service restoration; and

[[Page 204]]

    (2) File quarterly circuit status reports, within ninety (90) days 
from the end of each calendar quarter and in the format set out by the 
Sec. 43.82 of this chapter annual circuit status manual with the 
exception that activated or idle circuits must be reported on a 
facility-by-facility basis and derived circuits need not be specified. 
See Sec. 63.10(c)(5) of this chapter.
    (m) (1) Except as specified in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, 
amendments to pending applications, and applications to modify a 
license, including amendments or applications to add a new applicant or 
licensee, shall be signed by each initial applicant or licensee, 
respectively. Joint applicants or licensees may appoint one party to act 
as proxy for purposes of complying with this requirement.
    (2) Any licensee that seeks to relinquish its interest in a cable 
landing license shall file an application to modify the license. Such 
application must include a demonstration that the applicant is not 
required to be a licensee under paragraph (h) of this section and that 
the remaining licensee(s) will retain collectively de jure and de facto 
control of the U.S. portion of the cable system sufficient to comply 
with the requirements of the Commission's rules and any specific 
conditions of the license, and must be served on each other licensee of 
the cable system.
    Note to Sec. 1.767: The terms ``affiliated'' and ``foreign 
carrier,'' as used in this section, are defined as in Sec. 63.09 of this 
chapter except that the term ``foreign carrier'' also shall include any 
entity that owns or controls a cable landing station in a foreign 
market.

Sec. 1.768  Notification by and prior approval for submarine cable landing licensees that are or propose to become affiliated with a foreign carrier.

    Any entity that is licensed by the Commission (``licensee'') to land 
or operate a submarine cable landing in a particular foreign destination 
market that becomes, or seeks to become, affiliated with a foreign 
carrier that is authorized to operate in that market, including an 
entity that owns or controls a cable landing station in that market, 
shall notify the Commission of that affiliation.
    (a) Affiliations requiring prior notification: Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the licensee must notify the Commission, 
pursuant to this section, forty-five (45) days before consummation of 
either of the following types of transactions:
    (1) Acquisition by the licensee, or by any entity that controls the 
licensee, or by any entity that directly or indirectly owns more than 
twenty-five percent (25%) of the capital stock of the licensee, of a 
controlling interest in a foreign carrier that is authorized to operate 
in a market where the cable lands; or
    (2) Acquisition of a direct or indirect interest greater than 
twenty-five percent (25%), or of a controlling interest, in the capital 
stock of the licensee by a foreign carrier that is authorized to operate 
in a market where the cable lands, or by an entity that controls such a 
foreign carrier.
    (b) Exceptions: (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, 
the notification required by this section need not be filed before 
consummation, and may instead by filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, if either of the following is true with respect to the named 
foreign carrier, regardless of whether the destination market where the 
cable lands is a World Trade Organization (WTO) or non-WTO Member:
    (i) The Commission has previously determined in an adjudication that 
the foreign carrier lacks market power in that destination market (for 
example, in an international section 214 application or a declaratory 
ruling proceeding); or
    (ii) The foreign carrier owns no facilities in that destination 
market. For this purpose, a carrier is said to own facilities if it 
holds an ownership, indefeasible-right-of-user, or leasehold interest in 
a cable landing station or in bare capacity in international or domestic 
telecommunications facilities (excluding switches).
    (2) In the event paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot be 
satisfied, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the 
notification required by this

[[Page 205]]

section need not be filed before consummation, and may instead be filed 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, if the licensee certifies 
that the destination market where the cable lands is a WTO Member and 
provides certification to satisfy either of the following:
    (i) The licensee demonstrates that its foreign carrier affiliate 
lacks market power in the cable's destination market pursuant to 
Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter (see Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter); 
or
    (ii) The licensee agrees to comply with the reporting requirements 
contained in Sec. 1.767(l) effective upon the acquisition of the 
affiliation. See Sec. 1.767(l).
    (c) Notification after consummation: Any licensee that becomes 
affiliated with a foreign carrier and has not previously notified the 
Commission pursuant to the requirements of this section shall notify the 
Commission within thirty (30) days after consummation of the 
acquisition.

    Example 1 to paragraph (c). Acquisition by a licensee (or by any 
entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is 
under direct or indirect common control with the licensee) of a direct 
or indirect interest in a foreign carrier that is greater than twenty-
five percent (25%) but not controlling is subject to paragraph (c) of 
this section but not to paragraph (a) of this section.
    Example 2 to paragraph (c). Notification of an acquisition by a 
licensee of a hundred percent (100%) interest in a foreign carrier may 
be made after consummation, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, 
if the foreign carrier operates only as a resale carrier.
    Example 3 to paragraph (c). Notification of an acquisition by a 
foreign carrier from a WTO Member of a greater than twenty-five percent 
(25%) interest in the capital stock of the licensee may be made after 
consummation, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, if the licensee 
demonstrates in the post-notification that the foreign carrier lacks 
market power in the cable's destination market or the licensee agrees to 
comply with the reporting requirements contained in Sec. 1.767(l) 
effective upon the acquisition of the affiliation.

    (d) Cross-reference: In the event a transaction requiring a foreign 
carrier notification pursuant to this section also requires a transfer 
of control or assignment application pursuant to the requirements of the 
license granted under Sec. 1.767 or Sec. 1.767(g), the foreign carrier 
notification shall reference in the notification the transfer of control 
or assignment application and the date of its filing. See Sec. 1.767(g).
    (e) Contents of notification: The notification shall certify the 
following information:
    (1) The name of the newly affiliated foreign carrier and the country 
or countries at the foreign end of the cable in which it is authorized 
to provide telecommunications services to the public or where it owns or 
controls a cable landing station;
    (2) Which, if any, of those countries is a Member of the World Trade 
Organization;
    (3) The name of the cable system that is the subject of the 
notification, and the FCC file number(s) under which the license was 
granted;
    (4) The name, address, citizenship, and principal business of any 
person or entity that directly or indirectly owns at least ten percent 
(10%) of the equity of the licensee, and the percentage of equity owned 
by each of those entities (to the nearest one percent (1%));
    (5) Interlocking directorates. The name of any interlocking 
directorates, as defined in Sec. 63.09(g) of this chapter, with each 
foreign carrier named in the notification. See Sec. 63.09(g) of this 
chapter.
    (6) With respect to each foreign carrier named in the notification, 
a statement as to whether the notification is subject to paragraph (a) 
or (c) of this section. In the case of a notification subject to 
paragraph (a) of this section, the licensee shall include the projected 
date of closing. In the case of a notification subject to paragraph (c) 
of this section, the licensee shall include the actual date of closing.
    (7) If a licensee relies on an exception in paragraph (b) of this 
section, then a certification as to which exception the foreign carrier 
satisfies and a citation to any adjudication upon which the licensee is 
relying. Licensees relying upon the exceptions in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section must make the required certified demonstration in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section or the certified commitment to comply with the 
reporting requirements in paragraph

[[Page 206]]

(b)(2)(ii) of this section in the notification required by paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (f) If the licensee seeks to be excepted from the reporting 
requirements contained in Sec. 1.767(l), the licensee should demonstrate 
that each foreign carrier affiliate named in the notification lacks 
market power pursuant to Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter. See 
Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter.
    (g) Procedure. After the Commission issues a public notice of the 
submissions made under this section, interested parties may file 
comments within fourteen (14) days of the public notice.
    (1) If the Commission deems it necessary at any time before or after 
the deadline for submission of public comments, the Commission may 
impose reporting requirements on the licensee based on the provisions of 
Sec. 1.767(l). See Sec. 1.767(l).
    (2) In the case of a prior notification filed pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section in which the foreign carrier is authorized to 
operate in, or own a cable landing station in, a non-WTO Member, the 
licensee must demonstrate that it continues to serve the public interest 
for it to retain its interest in the cable landing license for that 
segment of the cable that lands in the non-WTO destination market by 
demonstrating either that the foreign carrier lacks market power in that 
destination market pursuant to Sec. 63.10(a)(3) of this chapter or the 
market offers effective opportunities for U.S. companies to land and 
operate a submarine cable in that country. If the licensee is unable to 
make either required showing or is notified that the affiliation may 
otherwise harm the public interest pursuant to the Commission's policies 
and rules under 47 U.S.C. 34 through 39 and Executive Order No. 10530, 
dated May 10, 1954, then the Commission may impose conditions necessary 
to address any public interest harms or may proceed to an immediate 
authorization revocation hearing.
    Note to paragraph (g)(2):
    The assessment of whether a destination market offers effective 
opportunities for U.S. companies to land and operate a submarine cable 
will be made under the standard established in Rules and Policies on 
Foreign Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications Market, Market 
Entry and Regulation of Foreign-Affiliated Entities, IB Docket Nos. 97-
142 and 95-22, Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, 12 FCC Rcd 
23891, 23946 at paragraph 130, 62 FR 64741, December 9, 1997.
    (h) All licensees are responsible for the continuing accuracy of 
information provided pursuant to this section for a period of forty-five 
(45) days after filing. During this period if the information furnished 
is no longer accurate, the licensee shall as promptly as possible, and 
in any event within ten (10) days, unless good cause is shown, file with 
the Secretary in duplicate a corrected notification referencing the FCC 
file numbers under which the original notification was provided.
    (i) A licensee that files a prior notification pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section may request confidential treatment of its filing, 
pursuant to Sec. 0.459 of this chapter, for the first twenty (20) days 
after filing. Such a request must be made prominently in a cover letter 
accompanying the filing.
    Note to Sec. 1.768: The terms ``affiliated'' and ``foreign 
carrier,'' as used in this section, are defined as in Sec. 63.09 of this 
chapter except that the term ``foreign carrier'' also shall include an 
entity that owns or controls a cable landing station in a foreign 
market.

[[Page 207]]

rejection of a new or revised tariff filing or any provision thereof

number and carrier transmittal number, the items against which protest 
is made, and the specific reasons why the protested tariff filing 
warrants investigation, suspension, or rejection under the 
Communications Act. No petition shall include a prayer that it also be 
considered a formal complaint. Any formal complaint shall be filed as a 
separate pleading as provided in Sec. 1.721.

complaint. Formal complaints must be separately lodged, as provided in 
Sec. 1.721.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, tariff filings by nondominant

suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension 
shows:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That the harm alleged to competition would be more substantial 
than the injury to the public arising from the unavailability of the 
service pursuant to the rates and conditions proposed in the tariff 
filing;
    (C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not 
suspended; and
    (D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the 
public interest.
    (iii) For the purpose of this section, any tariff filing by a local 
exchange carrier filed pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 61.39 will 
be considered prima facie lawful and will not be suspended by the 
Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows that the cost 
and demand studies or average schedule information was not provided upon 
reasonable request. If such a showing is not made, then the filing will 
be considered prima facie lawful and will not be suspended by the 
Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows each of the 
following:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That any unreasonable rate would not be corrected in a 
subsequent filing;
    (C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not 
suspended; and
    (D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the 
public interest.
    (iv) For the purposes of this section, tariff filings made pursuant 
to Sec. 61.49(b) by carriers subject to price cap regulation will be 
considered prima facie lawful, and will not be suspended by the 
Commission unless the petition shows that the support information 
required in Sec. 61.49(b) was not provided, or unless the petition 
requesting suspension shows each of the following:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That the suspension would not substantially harm other 
interested parties;
    (C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not 
suspended; and
    (D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the 
public interest.
    (v) For the purposes of this section, any tariff filing by a price 
cap LEC filed pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 61.42(d)(4)(ii) of 
this chapter will be considered prima facie lawful, and will not be 
suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension 
shows each of the following:
    (A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found 
unlawful after investigation;
    (B) That any unreasonable rate would not be corrected in a 
subsequent filing;

[[Page 208]]

suspended; and

public interest.

rejection of a new or revised tariff filing shall meet the filing 
requirements of this paragraph. In case of emergency and within the time 
limits provided, a telegraphic request for such relief may be sent to 
the Commission setting forth succinctly the substance of the matters 
required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A copy of any such 
telegraphic request shall be sent simultaneously to the Chief, Wireline

Sec. 1.924  Quiet zones.

    Quiet zones are those areas where it is necessary to restrict 
radiation so as to minimize possible impact on the operations of radio 
astronomy or other facilities that are highly sensitive to interference. 
The areas involved and procedures required are as follows:
    (a) NRAO, NRRO. The requirements of this paragraph are intended to 
minimize possible interference at the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, West 
Virginia, and at the Naval Radio Research Observatory site at Sugar 
Grove, Pendleton County, West Virginia.
    (1) Applicants and licensees planning to construct and operate a new 
or modified station at a permanent fixed location within the area 
bounded by N 39[deg] 15<gr-thn-eq> 0.4[sec] on the north, W 78[deg] 
29<gr-thn-eq> 59.0[sec] on the east, N 37[deg] 30<gr-thn-eq> 0.4[sec] on 
the south, and W 80[deg] 29<gr-thn-eq> 59.2[sec] on the west must notify 
the Director, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Post Office Box No. 
2, Green Bank, West Virginia 24944, in writing, of the technical details 
of the proposed operation. The notification must include the 
geographical coordinates of the antenna location, the antenna height, 
antenna directivity (if any), the channel, the emission type and power.
    (2) When an application for authority to operate a station is filed 
with the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section should be sent at the same time. The application must state the 
date that notification in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section was made. After receipt of such applications, the FCC will allow 
a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
notifications indicated.
    (3) If an objection is received during the 20-day period from the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the 
Naval Radio Research Observatory, the FCC will, after consideration of 
the record, take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (b) Table Mountain. The requirements of this paragraph are intended 
to minimize possible interference at the Table Mountain Radio Receiving 
Zone of the Research Laboratories of the Department of Commerce located 
in Boulder County, Colorado.
    (1) Licensees and applicants planning to construct and operate a new 
or modified station at a permanent fixed location in the vicinity of 
Boulder County, Colorado are advised to give consideration, prior to 
filing applications, to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio 
Receiving Zone from interference. To prevent degradation of the present 
ambient radio signal level

[[Page 221]]

at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure that the field 
strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected signals) received 
on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 
40[deg]07[min]49.9[sec] North Latitude, 105[deg]14[min]42.0[sec] West 
Longitude) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) 
or from the modification or relocation of existing facilities do not 
exceed the values given in the following table:

              Field Strength Limits for Table Mountain \1\

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Note: Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated
  assuming free space characteristic impedance of 376.7 omega (120[pi]
  [omega]

    (2) Advance consultation is recommended, particularly for applicants 
that have no reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or 
power flux density figures in the above table would be exceeded by their 
proposed radio facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for:
    (i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) of the Table 
Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) transmitting 
with 50 watts or more effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary 
plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain 
Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations located with 16 kilometers (10 miles) transmitting 
with 1 kW or more ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) transmitting 
with 25 kW or more ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (3) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services NOAAR/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the FCC.
    (4) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, such consultation may 
avoid the filing of objections from the Department of Commerce or 
institution of proceedings to modify the authorizations of stations that 
radiate signals with a field strength or power flux density at the site 
in excess of those specified herein.
    (c) Federal Communications Commission protected field offices. The 
requirements of this paragraph are intended to minimize possible 
interference to FCC monitoring activities.
    (1) Licensees and applicants planning to construct and operate a new 
or modified station at a permanent fixed location in the vicinity of an 
FCC protected field office are advised to give consideration, prior to 
filing applications, to the need to avoid interfering with the 
monitoring activities of that office. FCC protected field offices are 
listed in Sec. 0.121 of this chapter.
    (2) Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that could 
produce on any channel a direct wave fundamental field strength of 
greater than 10 mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m\2\ power flux density assuming a free 
space characteristic impedance of 120[pi] [OHgr]) in the authorized 
bandwidth at the protected field office may be examined to determine the 
potential for interference with monitoring activities. After 
consideration of the effects of the predicted field strength of the 
proposed station, including the cumulative effects of the signal from 
the proposed station with other ambient radio field strength levels at 
the protected field office, the FCC may add a condition restricting 
radiation toward the protected field office to the station 
authorization.
    (3) In the event that the calculated field strength exceeds 10 mV/m 
at the protected field office site, or if there is any question whether 
field strength levels might exceed that level, advance consultation with 
the FCC to discuss possible measures to avoid interference to monitoring 
activities should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Enforcement

[[Page 222]]

Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.
    (4) Advance consultation is recommended for applicants that have no 
reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or power flux 
density figure indicated would be exceeded by their proposed radio 
facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for:
    (i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) of the 
protected field office;
    (ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the protected field offices.
    (iii) Stations located within 16 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kw or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the protected field office;
    (iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kw or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the protected field office;
    (v) Advance coordination for stations transmitting on channels above 
1000 MHz is recommended only if the proposed station is in the vicinity 
of a protected field office designated as a satellite monitoring 
facility in Sec. 0.121 of this chapter.
    (vi) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, such consultation may 
serve to avoid the need for later modification of the authorizations of 
stations that interfere with monitoring activities at protected field 
offices.
    (d) Notification to the Arecibo Observatory. The requirements in 
this section are intended to minimize possible interference at the 
Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Licensees must make reasonable 
efforts to protect the Observatory from interference. Licensees planning 
to construct and operate a new station at a permanent fixed location on 
the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques or Culebra in 
services in which individual station licenses are issued by the FCC; 
planning to construct and operate a new station at a permanent fixed 
location on these islands that may cause interference to the operations 
of the Arecibo Observatory in services in which individual station 
licenses are not issued by the FCC; or planning a modification of any 
existing station at a permanent fixed location on these islands that 
would increase the likelihood of causing interference to the operations 
of the Arecibo Observatory must notify the Interference Office, Arecibo 
Observatory, Post Office Box 995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00613, in writing 
or electronically (e-mail address: prcz@naic.edu), of the technical 
parameters of the planned operation. Carriers may wish to use the 
interference guidelines provided by Cornell University as guidance in 
designing facilities to avoid interference to the Observatory. The 
notification must include identification of the geographical coordinates 
of the antenna location (NAD-83 datum), the antenna height, antenna 
directivity (if any), proposed channel and FCC Rule Part, type of 
emission, and effective isotropic radiated power.
    (1) In the Amateur radio service:
    (i) The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to 
repeaters that transmit on the 1.2 cm or shorter wavelength bands; and
    (ii) The coordination provision of paragraph (d) of this section 
does not apply to repeaters that are located 16 km or more from the 
Arecibo observatory.
    (2) In services in which individual station licenses are issued by 
the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (d) of this section 
should be sent the same time the application is filed with the FCC, and 
at least 20 days in advance of the applicant's planned operation. The 
application must state the date that notification in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section was made. In services in which individual 
station licenses are not issued by the FCC, the notification required in 
paragraph (d) of this section should be sent at least 45 days in advance 
of the applicant's planned operation. In the latter services, the 
Interference Office must inform the FCC of a notification by an 
applicant within 20 days if the Office plans to file comments or 
objections to

[[Page 223]]

the notification. After the FCC receives an application from a service 
applicant or is informed by the Interference Office of a notification 
from a service applicant, the FCC will allow the Interference Office a 
period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
application or notification.
    (3) If an objection to any planned service operation is received 
during the 20-day period from the Interference Office, the FCC will take 
whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (e) Government satellite earth stations. (1) To minimize or avoid 
harmful interference to Government Satellite Earth Stations located in 
the Denver, Colorado and Washington, DC areas, any application for a new 
station license to operate in the 17.8-19.7 GHz band (except for low 
power operations governed by Sec. 101.147(r)(10) of this chapter), or 
for modification of an existing station license in this band which would 
change the frequency, power, emission, modulation, polarization, antenna 
height or directivity, or location of such a station, must be 
coordinated with the Federal Government by the Commission before an 
authorization will be issued, if the station or proposed station is 
located in whole or in part within any of the areas defined by the 
following rectangles or circles:

Sec. 1.925  Waivers.

    (a) Waiver requests generally. The Commission may waive specific 
requirements of the rules on its own motion or upon request. The fees 
for such waiver requests are set forth in Sec. 1.1102 of this part.
    (b) Procedure and format for filing waiver requests. (1) Requests 
for waiver of rules associated with licenses or applications in the 
Wireless Radio Services must be filed on FCC Form 601, 603, or 605.
    (2) Requests for waiver must contain a complete explanation as to 
why the waiver is desired. If the information necessary to support a 
waiver request is already on file, the applicant may cross-reference the 
specific filing where the information may be found.
    (3) The Commission may grant a request for waiver if it is shown 
that:
    (i) The underlying purpose of the rule(s) would not be served or 
would be frustrated by application to the instant case, and that a grant 
of the requested waiver would be in the public interest; or
    (ii) In view of unique or unusual factual circumstances of the 
instant case, application of the rule(s) would be inequitable, unduly 
burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or the applicant has no 
reasonable alternative.
    (4) Applicants requiring expedited processing of their request for 
waiver shall clearly caption their request for waiver with the words 
``WAIVER--EXPEDITED ACTION REQUESTED.''
    (c) Action on Waiver Requests.
    (i) The Commission, in its discretion, may give public notice of the 
filing of a waiver request and seek comment from the public or affected 
parties.
    (ii) Denial of a rule waiver request associated with an application

discretion of the referring agency.
    (d) Assignments proposed in any radio service in frequency bands 
below 470 MHz appropriate to this arrangement, other than those for 
stations in the Domestic Public (land mobile or fixed) category, may be 
excepted from this arrangement at the discretion of the referring agency 
if a base station assignment has been made previously under the terms of 
this arrangement or prior to its adoption in the same radio service and 
on the same frequency and in the local area, and provided the basic 
characteristics of the additional station are sufficiently similar 
technically to the original assignment to preclude harmful interference 
to existing stations across the border.
    (e) For bands below 470 MHz, the areas which are involved lie 
between Lines A and B and between Lines C and D, which are described as 
follows:

    Line A--Begins at Aberdeen, Wash., running by great circle arc to 
the intersection of 48 deg. N., 120 deg. W., thence along parallel 48

<R05>
Sec. 1.931  Application for special temporary authority.

    (a) Wireless Telecommunications Services. (1) In circumstances 
requiring immediate or temporary use of station in the Wireless 
Telecommunications Services, carriers may request special temporary 
authority (STA) to operate new or modified equipment. Such requests must 
be filed electronically using FCC Form 601 and must contain complete 
details about the proposed operation and the circumstances that fully 
justify and necessitate the grant of STA. Such requests should be filed 
in time to be received by the Commission at least 10 days prior to the 
date of proposed operation or, where an extension is sought, 10 days 
prior to the expiration date of the existing STA. Requests received less 
than 10 days prior to the desired date of operation may be given 
expedited consideration only if compelling reasons are given for the 
delay in submitting the request. Otherwise, such late-filed requests are 
considered in turn, but action might not be taken prior to the desired 
date of operation. Requests for STA must be accompanied by the proper 
filing fee.
    (2) Grant without Public Notice. STA may be granted without being 
listed in a Public Notice, or prior to 30 days after such listing, if:
    (i) The STA is to be valid for 30 days or less and the applicant 
does not plan to file an application for regular authorization of the 
subject operation;
    (ii) The STA is to be valid for 60 days or less, pending the filing 
of an application for regular authorization of the subject operation;
    (iii) The STA is to allow interim operation to facilitate completion 
of authorized construction or to provide substantially the same service 
as previously authorized; or
    (iv) The STA is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary 
circumstances requiring operation in the public interest and that delay 
in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public 
interest.

[[Page 230]]

    (3) Limit on STA term. The Commission may grant STA for a period not 
to exceed 180 days under the provisions of section 309(f) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, (47 U.S.C. 309(f)) if 
extraordinary circumstances so require, and pending the filing of an 
application for regular operation. The Commission may grant extensions 
of STA for a period of 180 days, but the applicant must show that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.
    (b) Private Wireless Services. (1) A licensee of, or an applicant 
for, a station in the Private Wireless Services may request STA not to 
exceed 180 days for (A) operation of a new station or (B) operation of a 
licensed station in a manner which is beyond the scope of that 
authorized by the existing license. See Secs. 1.962(b)(5) and (f). Where 
the applicant, seeking a waiver of the 180 day limit, requests STA to 
operate as a private mobile radio service provider for a period 
exceeding 180 days, evidence of frequency coordination is required. 
Requests for shorter periods do not require coordination and, if 
granted, will be authorized on a secondary, non-interference basis.
    (2) STA may be granted in the following circumstances:
    (i) In emergency situations;
    (ii) To permit restoration or relocation of existing facilities to 
continue communication service;
    (iii) To conduct tests to determine necessary data for the 
preparation of an application for regular authorization;
    (iv) For a temporary, non-recurring service where a regular 
authorization is not appropriate;
    (v) In other situations involving circumstances which are of such 
extraordinary nature that delay in the institution of temporary 
operation would seriously prejudice the public interest.
    (3) The nature of the circumstance which, in the opinion of the 
applicant justifies issuance of STA, must be fully described in the 
request. Applications for STA must be filed at least 10 days prior to 
the proposed operation. Applications filed less than 10 days prior to 
the proposed operation date will be accepted only upon a showing of good 
cause.
    (4) The Commission may grant extensions of STA for a period of 180 
days, but the applicant must show that extraordinary circumstances 
warrant such an extension.
    (5) In special situations defined in Sec. 1.915(b)(1), a request for 
STA may be made by telephone or telegraph provided a properly signed 
application is filed within 10 days of such request.
    (6) An applicant for an Aircraft Radio Station License may operate 
the radio station pending issuance of an Aircraft Radio Station License 
by the Commission for a period of 90 days under temporary operating 
authority, evidenced by a properly executed certification made on FCC 
Form 605.
    (7) Unless the Commission otherwise prescribes, a person who has 
been granted an operator license of Novice, Technician, Technician Plus, 
General, or Advanced class and who has properly submitted to the 
administering VEs an application document for an operator license of a 
higher class, and who holds a CSCE indicating that he/she has completed 
the necessary examinations within the previous 365 days, is authorized 
to exercise the rights and privileges of the higher operator class until 
final disposition of the application or until 365 days following the 
passing of the examination, whichever comes first.
    (8) An applicant for a Ship Radio station license may operate the 
radio station pending issuance of the ship station authorization by the 
Commission for a period of 90 days, under a temporary operating 
authority, evidenced by a properly executed certification made on FCC 
Form 605.
    (9) An applicant for a station license in the Industrial/Business 
pool (other than an applicant who seeks to provide commercial mobile 
radio service as defined in Part 20 of this chapter) utilizing an 
already authorized facility may operate the station for a period of 180 
days, under a temporary permit, evidenced by a properly executed 
certification made on FCC Form 601, after filing an application for a 
station license together with evidence of frequency coordination, if 
required, with the Commission. The temporary operation of stations, 
other than mobile

[[Page 231]]

stations, within the Canadian coordination zone will be limited to 
stations with a maximum of 5 watts effective radiated power and a 
maximum antenna height of 20 feet (6.1 meters) above average terrain.
    (10) An applicant for a radio station license under Part 90, Subpart 
S, of this chapter (other than an applicant who seeks to provide 
commercial mobile radio service as defined in part 20 of this chapter) 
to utilize an already existing Specialized Mobile Radio System (SMR) 
facility or to utilize an already licensed transmitter may operate the 
radio station for a period of up to 180 days, under a temporary permit. 
Such request must be evidenced by a properly executed certification of 
FCC Form 601 after the filing of an application for station license, 
provided that the antenna employed by the control station is a maximum 
of 20 feet (6.1 meters) above a man-made structure (other than an 
antenna tower) to which it is affixed.
    (11) An applicant for an itinerant station license, an applicant for 
a new private land mobile radio station license in the frequency bands 
below 470 MHz and in the one-way paging 929-930 MHz band (other than a 
commercial mobile radio service applicant or licensee on these bands) or 
an applicant seeking to modify or acquire through assignment or transfer 
an existing station below 470 MHz or in the one-way paging 929-930 MHz 
band may operate the proposed station during the pendency of its 
application for a period of up to 180 days under a conditional permit. 
Conditional operations may commence upon the filing of a properly 
completed application that complies with Sec. 90.127 if the application, 
when frequency coordination is required, is accompanied by evidence of 
frequency coordination in accordance with Sec. 90.175 of this chapter. 
Operation under such a permit is evidenced by the properly executed Form 
601 with certifications that satisfy the requirements of Sec. 90.159(b).
    (12) An applicant for a General Mobile Radio Service system license, 
sharing a multiple-licensed or cooperative shared base station used as a 
mobile relay station, may operate the system for a period of 180 days, 
under a Temporary Permit, evidenced by a properly executed certification 
made on FCC Form 605.

received by the Commission in a condition acceptable for filing, or 
which have been returned to an applicant for correction. Any application 
that has been listed in a public notice as acceptable for filing and is 
(1) subject to a major amendment, or (2) has been returned as defective 
or incomplete and resubmitted to the Commission, shall be listed in a 
subsequent public notice. Acceptance for filing shall not preclude the 
subsequent dismissal of an application as defective.

Sec. 1.934  Defective applications and dismissal.

    (a) Dismissal of applications. The Commission may dismiss any 
application in the Wireless Radio Services at the request of the 
applicant; if the application is mutually exclusive with another 
application that is selected or granted in accordance with the rules in 
this part; for failure to prosecute or if the application is found to be 
defective; if the requested spectrum is not available; or if the 
application is untimely filed. Such dismissal may be ``without 
prejudice,'' meaning that the Commission may accept from the applicant 
another application for the same purpose at a later time, provided that 
the application is otherwise timely. Dismissal ``with prejudice'' means 
that the Commission will not accept another application from the 
applicant for the same purpose for a period of one year. Unless 
otherwise provided in this part, a dismissed application will not be 
returned to the applicant.
    (1) Dismissal at request of applicant. Any applicant may request 
that its application be withdrawn or dismissed. A request for the 
withdrawal of an application after it has been listed on Public Notice 
as tentatively accepted for filing is considered to be a request for 
dismissal of that application without prejudice.
    (i) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application with 
prejudice, the Commission will dismiss that application with prejudice.
    (ii) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application without 
prejudice, the Commission will dismiss that application without 
prejudice, unless:
    (A) It has been designated for comparative hearing; or
    (B) It is an application for which the applicant submitted the 
winning bid in a competitive bidding process.
    (2) If an applicant who is a winning bidder for a license in a 
competitive bidding process requests dismissal of its short-form or 
long-form application, the Commission will dismiss that application with 
prejudice. The applicant will also be subject to default payments under 
Subpart Q of this part.
    (3) An applicant who requests dismissal of its application after 
that application has been designated for comparative hearing may submit 
a written petition requesting that the dismissal be without prejudice. 
Such petition must demonstrate good cause and be served upon all parties 
of record. The Commission may grant such petition and dismiss the 
application without prejudice or deny the petition and dismiss the 
application with prejudice.
    (b) Dismissal of mutually exclusive applications not granted. The 
Commission may dismiss mutually exclusive applications:
    (1) For which the applicant did not submit the winning bid in a 
competitive bidding process; or
    (2) That receive comparative consideration in a hearing but are not 
granted by order of the presiding officer.

[[Page 233]]

    (c) Dismissal for failure to prosecute. The Commission may dismiss 
applications for failure of the applicant to prosecute or for failure of 
the applicant to respond substantially within a specified time period to 
official correspondence or requests for additional information. Such 
dismissal will generally be without prejudice if the failure to 
prosecute or respond occurred prior to designation of the application 
for comparative hearing, but may be with prejudice in cases of non-
compliance with Sec. 1.945 of this part. Dismissal will generally be 
with prejudice if the failure to prosecute or respond occurred after 
designation of the application for comparative hearing. The Commission 
may dismiss applications with prejudice for failure of the applicant to 
comply with requirements related to a competitive bidding process.
    (d) Dismissal as defective. The Commission may dismiss without 
prejudice an application that it finds to be defective. An application 
is defective if:
    (1) It is unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers to 
questions, informational showings, or other matters of a formal 
character;
    (2) It requests an authorization that would not comply with one or 
more of the Commission's rules and does not contain a request for waiver 
of these rule(s), or in the event the Commission denies such a waiver 
request, does not contain an alternative proposal that fully complies 
with the rules;
    (3) The appropriate filing fee has not been paid; or
    (4) The FCC Registration Number (FRN) has not been provided.
    (e) Dismissal because spectrum not available. The Commission may 
dismiss applications that request spectrum which is unavailable because:
    (1) It is not allocated for assignment in the specific service 
requested;
    (2) It was previously assigned to another licensee on an exclusive 
basis or cannot be assigned to the applicant without causing harmful 
interference; or
    (3) Reasonable efforts have been made to coordinate the proposed 
facility with foreign administrations under applicable international 
agreements, and an unfavorable response (harmful interference 
anticipated) has been received.
    (f) Dismissal as untimely. The Commission may dismiss without 
prejudice applications that are premature or late filed, including 
applications filed prior to the opening date or after the closing date 
of a filing window, or after the cut-off date for a mutually exclusive 
application filing group.

[63 FR 68930, Dec. 14, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 47895, Sept. 14, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 1.935  Agreements to dismiss applications, amendments or pleadings.

    Parties that have filed applications that are mutually exclusive 
with one or more other applications, and then enter into an agreement to 
resolve the mutual exclusivity by withdrawing or requesting dismissal of 
the application(s), specific frequencies on the application or an 
amendment thereto, must obtain the approval of the Commission. Parties 
that have filed or threatened to file a petition to deny, informal 
objection or other pleading against an application and then seek to 
withdraw or request dismissal of, or refrain from filing, the petition, 
either unilaterally or in exchange for a financial consideration, must 
obtain the approval of the Commission.
    (a) The party withdrawing or requesting dismissal of its application 
(or specific frequencies on the application), petition to deny, informal 
objection or other pleading or refraining from filing a pleading must 
submit to the Commission a request for approval of the withdrawal or 
dismissal, a copy of any written agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal, and an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the party nor its principals has 
received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess of 
the legitimate and prudent expenses incurred in preparing and 
prosecuting the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading in exchange for the withdrawal or dismissal of the 
application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading, or 
threat to file a pleading, except that this provision does not apply to 
dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to bona fide merger 
agreements;

[[Page 234]]

    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading, or threat to file a pleading.
    (b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant's 
or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining party to any 
written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for 
withdrawing or dismissing the application, petition to deny, informal 
objection or other pleading; and
    (2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading.
    (c) No person shall make or receive any payments in exchange for 
withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing a petition to 
deny, informal objection, or any other pleading against an application. 
For the purposes of this section, reimbursement by an applicant of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of a potential petitioner or objector, 
incurred reasonably and directly in preparing to file a petition to 
deny, will not be considered to be payment for refraining from filing a 
petition to deny or an informal objection. Payments made directly to a 
potential petitioner or objector, or a person related to a potential 
petitioner or objector, to implement non-financial promises are 
prohibited unless specifically approved by the Commission.
    (d) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by 
the filing party, if an individual; a partner having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a partnership; or an officer having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) Each application, petition to deny, informal objection or other 
pleading is deemed to be pending before the Commission from the time the 
petition to deny is filed with the Commission until such time as an 
order or correspondence of the Commission granting, denying or 
dismissing it is no longer subject to reconsideration by the Commission 
or to review by any court.
    (3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting 
and/or settling its application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading for which reimbursement is sought.
    (4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets or the provision 
of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any payments 
made or received in exchange for withdrawing a short-form application 
for a Commission authorization awarded through competitive bidding shall 
be subject to the restrictions set forth in Sec. 1.2105(c) of this 
chapter.

[63 FR 68931, Dec. 14, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1.937  Repetitious or conflicting applications.

    (a) Where the Commission has, for any reason, dismissed with 
prejudice or denied any license application in the Wireless Radio 
Services, or revoked any such license, the Commission will not consider 
a like or new application involving service of the same kind to 
substantially the same area by substantially the same applicant, its 
successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the benefit of the 
original parties in interest, until after the lapse of 12 months from 
the effective date of final Commission action.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) If an appeal has been taken from the action of the Commission 
dismissing with prejudice or denying any application in the Wireless 
Radio Services, or if the application is subsequently designated for 
hearing, a like application for service of the same type to the same 
area, in whole or in part,

[[Page 235]]

filed by that applicant or by its successor or assignee, or on behalf or 
for the benefit of the parties in interest to the original application, 
will not be considered until the final disposition of such appeal.
    (d) While an application is pending, any subsequent inconsistent or 
conflicting application submitted by, on behalf of, or for the benefit 
of the same applicant, its successor or assignee will not be accepted 
for filing.

<R05>
Sec. 1.939  Petitions to deny.

    (a) Who may file. Any party in interest may file with the Commission 
a petition to deny any application listed in a Public Notice as accepted 
for filing, whether as filed originally or upon major amendment as 
defined in Sec. 1.929 of this part.
    (1) For auctionable license applications, petitions to deny and 
related pleadings are governed by the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 1.2108 of this part.
    (2) Petitions to deny for non-auctionable applications that are 
subject to petitions under Sec. 309(d) of the Communications Act must 
comply with the provisions of this section and must be filed no later 
than 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the application 
or major amendment to the application as accepted for filing.
    (b) Filing of petitions. Petitions to deny and related pleadings may 
be filed electronically via ULS. Manually filed petitions to deny must 
be filed with the Office of the Secretary, 445 Twelfth Street, S.W., 
Room TW-B204, Washington, DC 20554. Manually filed petitions to deny 
must be filed with the Office of the Secretary, 1919 M Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20554. Attachments to manually filed applications may be 
filed on a standard 31/4'' magnetic diskette formatted to be readable by 
high density floppy drives operating under MS-DOS (version 3.X or later 
compatible versions). Each diskette submitted must contain an ASCII text 
file listing each filename and a brief description of the contents of 
each file on the diskette. The files on the diskette, other than the 
table of contents, should be in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format 
(PDF) whenever possible. Petitions to deny and related pleadings must 
reference the file number of the pending application that is the subject 
of the petition.
    (c) Service. A petitioner shall serve a copy of its petition to deny 
on the applicant and on all other interested parties pursuant to 
Sec. 1.47. Oppositions and replies shall be served on the petitioner and 
all other interested parties.
    (d) Content. A petition to deny must contain specific allegations of 
fact sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the petitioner is a 
party in interest and that a grant of the application would be 
inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. Such 
allegations of fact, except for those of which official notice may be 
taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with 
personal knowledge thereof.
    (e) Petitions to deny amended applications. Petitions to deny a 
major amendment to an application may raise only matters directly 
related to the major amendment that could not have been raised in 
connection with the application as originally filed. This paragraph does 
not apply to petitioners who gain standing because of the major 
amendment.
    (f) Oppositions and replies. The applicant and any other interested 
party may file an opposition to any petition to deny and the petitioner 
may file a reply thereto in which allegations of fact or denials 
thereof, except for those of which official notice may be taken, shall 
be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge 
thereof. Time for filing of oppositions and replies is governed by 
Sec. 1.45 of this part for non-auctionable services and Sec. 1.2108 of 
this part for auctionable services.
    (g) Dismissal of petition. The Commission may dismiss any petition 
to deny that does not comply with the requirements of this section if 
the issues raised become moot, or if the petitioner or his/her attorney 
fails to appear at a settlement conference pursuant to Sec. 1.956 of 
this part. The reasons for the dismissal will be stated in the dismissal 
letter or order. When a petition to deny is dismissed, any related 
responsive pleadings are also dismissed

[[Page 236]]

    (h) Grant of petitioned application. If a petition to deny has been 
filed and the Commission grants the application, the Commission will 
dismiss or deny the petition by issuing a concise statement of the 
reason(s) for dismissing or denying the petition, disposing of all 
substantive issues raised in the petition.

Sec. 1.945  License grants.

    (a) License grants--auctionable license applications. Procedures for 
grant of licenses that are subject to competitive bidding under section 
309(j) of the Communications Act are set forth in Secs. 1.2108 and 
1.2109 of this part.
    (b) License grants--non-auctionable license applications. No 
application that is not subject to competitive bidding under Sec. 309(j) 
of the Communications Act will be granted by the Commission prior to the 
31st day following the issuance of a Public Notice of the acceptance for 
filing of such application or of any substantial amendment thereof, 
unless the application is not subject to Sec. 309(b) of the 
Communications Act.
    (c) Grant without hearing. In the case of both auctionable license 
applications and non-mutually exclusive non-auctionable license 
applications, the Commission will grant the application without a 
hearing if it is proper upon its face and if the Commission finds from 
an examination of such application and supporting data, any pleading 
filed, or other matters which it may officially notice, that:
    (1) There are no substantial and material questions of fact;
    (2) The applicant is legally, technically, financially, and 
otherwise qualified;
    (3) A grant of the application would not involve modification, 
revocation, or non-renewal of any other existing license;
    (4) A grant of the application would not preclude the grant of any 
mutually exclusive application; and
    (5) A grant of the application would serve the public interest, 
convenience, and necessity.
    (d) Grant of petitioned applications. The FCC may grant, without a 
formal hearing, an application against which petition(s) to deny have 
been filed. If any petition(s) to deny are pending (i.e. have not been 
dismissed or withdrawn by the petitioner) when an application is 
granted, the FCC will deny the petition(s) and issue a concise statement 
of the reason(s) for the denial, disposing of all substantive issues 
raised in the petitions.
    (e) Partial and conditional grants. The FCC may grant applications 
in part, and/or subject to conditions other than those normally applied 
to authorizations of the same type. When the FCC does this, it will 
inform the applicant of the reasons therefor. Such partial or 
conditional grants are final unless the FCC revises its action in 
response to a petition for reconsideration. Such petitions for 
reconsideration must be filed by the applicant within thirty days after 
the date of the letter or order stating the reasons for the partial or 
conditional grant, and must reject the partial or conditional grant and 
return the instrument of authorization.
    (f) Designation for hearing. If the Commission is unable to make the 
findings prescribed in subparagraph (c), it will formally designate the 
application for hearing on the grounds or reasons then obtaining and 
will notify the applicant and all other known parties in interest of 
such action.
    (1) Orders designating applications for hearing will specify with 
particularity the matters in issue.
    (2) Parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the 
Commission of its action in designating a particular application for 
hearing may acquire the status of a party to the proceeding by filing a 
petition for intervention showing the basis of their interest not more 
than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register of the hearing 
issues or any substantial amendment thereto.
    (3) The applicant and all other parties in interest shall be 
permitted to participate in any hearing subsequently held upon such 
applications. Hearings may be conducted by the Commission or by the 
Chief of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, or, in the case of a 
question which requires oral testimony for its resolution, an 
Administrative Law Judge.

[[Page 237]]

The burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and burden of 
proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with respect to any issue 
presented by a petition to deny or a petition to enlarge the issues, 
such burdens shall be as determined by the Commission or the Chief of 
the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.

<R05>
Sec. 1.946  Construction and coverage requirements.

    (a) Construction and commencement of service requirements. For each 
of the Wireless Radio Services, requirements for construction and 
commencement of service or commencement of operations are set forth in 
the rule part governing the specific service. For purposes of this 
section, the period between the date of grant of an authorization and 
the date of required commencement of service or operations is referred 
to as the construction period.
    (b) Coverage and substantial service requirements. In certain 
Wireless Radio Services, licensees must comply with geographic coverage 
requirements or substantial service requirements within a specified time 
period. These requirements are set forth in the rule part governing each 
specific service. For purposes of this section, the period between the 
date of grant of an authorization and the date that a particular degree 
of coverage or substantial service is required is referred to as the 
coverage period.
    (c) Termination of authorizations. If a licensee fails to commence 
service or operations by the expiration of its construction period or to 
meet its coverage or substantial service obligations by the expiration 
of its coverage period, its authorization terminates automatically, 
without specific Commission action, on the date the construction or 
coverage period expires.
    (d) Licensee notification of compliance. A licensee who commences 
service or operations within the construction period or meets its 
coverage or substantial service obligations within the coverage period 
must notify the Commission by filing FCC Form 601. The notification must 
be filed with the Commission within 15 days of the expiration of the 
applicable construction or coverage period. Where the authorization is 
site-specific, if service or operations have begun using some, but not 
all, of the authorized transmitters, the notification must show to which 
specific transmitters it applies.
    (e) Requests for extension of time. Licensees may request to extend 
a construction period or coverage period by filing FCC Form 601. The 
request must be filed before the expiration of the construction or 
coverage period.
    (1) An extension request may be granted if the licensee shows that 
failure to meet the construction or coverage deadline is due to 
involuntary loss of site or other causes beyond its control.
    (2) Extension requests will not be granted for failure to meet a 
construction or coverage deadline due to delays caused by a failure to 
obtain financing, to obtain an antenna site, or to order equipment in a 
timely manner. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days of its 
initial license grant, a presumption of diligence is established.
    (3) Extension requests will not be granted for failure to meet a 
construction or coverage deadline because the licensee undergoes a 
transfer of control or because the licensee intends to assign the 
authorization. The Commission will not grant extension requests solely 
to allow a transferee or assignee to complete facilities that the 
transferor or assignor failed to construct.
    (4) The filing of an extension request does not automatically extend 
the construction or coverage period unless the request is based on 
involuntary loss of site or other circumstances beyond the licensee's 
control, in which case the construction period is automatically extended 
pending disposition of the extension request.
    (5) A request for extension of time to construct a particular 
transmitter or other facility does not extend the construction period 
for other transmitters and facilities under the same authorization.

Sec. 1.947  Modification of licenses.

    (a) All major modifications, as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this part, 
require prior Commission approval. Applications for major modifications 
also shall

[[Page 238]]

be treated as new applications for determination of filing date, Public 
Notice, and petition to deny purposes.
    (b) Licensees may make minor modifications to station 
authorizations, as defined in Sec. 1.929 of this part (other than pro 
forma transfers and assignments), as a matter of right without prior 
Commission approval. Where other rule parts permit licensees to make 
permissive changes to technical parameters without notifying the 
Commission (e.g., adding, modifying, or deleting internal sites), no 
notification is required. For all other types of minor modifications 
(e.g., name, address, point of contact changes), licensees must notify 
the Commission by filing FCC Form 601 within thirty (30) days of 
implementing any such changes.
    (c) Multiple pending modification applications requesting changes to 
the same or related technical parameters on an authorization are not 
permitted. If a modification application is pending, any additional 
changes to the same or related technical parameters may be requested 
only in an amendment to the pending modification application.
    (d) Any proposed modification that requires a fee as set forth at 
part 1, subpart G, of this chapter must be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 1.913.

Sec. 1.948  Assignment of authorization or transfer of control, notification of consummation.

    (a) General. Except as provided in this section, authorizations in 
the Wireless Radio Services may be assigned by the licensee to another 
party, voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, or the 
control of a licensee holding such authorizations may be transferred, 
only upon application to and approval by the Commission.
    (b) Limitations on transfers and assignments. (1) A change from less 
than 50% ownership to 50% or more ownership shall always be considered a 
transfer of control.
    (2) In other situations a controlling interest shall be determined 
on a case-by-case basis considering the distribution of ownership, and 
the relationships of the owners, including family relationships.
    (3) Designated Entities, as defined in Sec. 1.2110(a) of this part, 
must comply with Secs. 1.2110 and 1.2111 of this part when seeking to 
assign or transfer control of an authorization.
    (4) Stations must meet all applicable requirements regarding 
transfers and assignments contained in the rules pertaining to the 
specific service in which the station is licensed.
    (5) Licenses, permits, and authorizations for stations in the 
Amateur, Ship, Aircraft, Commercial Operator and Personal Radio Services 
(except 218-219 MHz Service) may not be assigned or transferred, unless 
otherwise stated.
    (c) Application required. In the case of an assignment of 
authorization or transfer of control, the assignor must file an 
application for approval of the assignment on FCC Form 603. If the 
assignee or transferee is subject to the ownership reporting 
requirements of Sec. 1.2112, the assignee or transferee must also file 
an updated FCC Form 602 or certify that a current FCC Form 602 is on 
file.
    (1) In the case of a non-substantial (pro forma) transfer or 
assignment involving a telecommunications carrier, as defined in 
Sec. 153(44) of the Communications Act, filing of the Form 603 and 
Commission approval in advance of the proposed transaction is not 
required, provided that:
    (i) the affected license is not subject to unjust enrichment 
provisions under subpart Q of this part;
    (ii) the transfer or assignment does not involve a proxy contest; 
and
    (iii) the transferee or assignee provides notice of the transaction 
by filing FCC Form 603 within 30 days of its completion, and provides 
any necessary updates of ownership information on FCC Form 602.
    (2) In the case of an involuntary assignment or transfer, FCC Form 
603 must be filed no later than 30 days after the event causing the 
involuntary assignment or transfer.
    (d) Notification of consummation. In all Wireless Radio Services, 
licensees are required to notify the Commission of consummation of an 
approved transfer or assignment using FCC Form 603. The

[[Page 239]]

assignee or transferee is responsible for providing this notification, 
including the date the transaction was consummated. For transfers and 
assignments that require prior Commission approval, the transaction must 
be consummated and notification provided to the Commission within 180 
days of public notice of approval, and notification of consummation must 
occur no later than 30 days after actual consummation, unless a request 
for an extension of time to consummate is filed on FCC Form 603 prior to 
the expiration of this 180-day period. For transfers and assignments 
that do not require prior Commission approval, notification of 
consummation must be provided on FCC Form 603 no later than 30 days 
after consummation, along with any necessary updates of ownership 
information on FCC Form 602.
    (e) Partial assignment of authorization. If the authorization for 
some, but not all, of the facilities of a radio station in the Wireless 
Radio Services is assigned to another party, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, such action is a partial assignment of authorization. To 
request Commission approval of a partial assignment of authorization, 
the assignor must notify the Commission on FCC Form 603 of the 
facilities that will be deleted from its authorization upon consummation 
of the assignment.
    (f) Partitioning and disaggregation. Where a licensee proposes to 
partition or disaggregate a portion of its authorization to another 
party, the application will be treated as a request for partial 
assignment of authorization. The assignor must notify the Commission on 
FCC Form 603 of the geographic area or spectrum that will be deleted 
from its authorization upon consummation of the assignment.
    (g) Involuntary transfer and assignment. In the event of the death 
or legal disability of a permittee or licensee, a member of a 
partnership, or a person directly or indirectly in control of a 
corporation which is a permittee or licensee, the Commission shall be 
notified promptly of the occurrence of such death or legal disability. 
Within 30 days after the occurrence of such death or legal disability 
(except in the case of a ship or amateur station), an application shall 
be filed for consent to involuntary assignment of such permit or 
license, or for involuntary transfer of control of such corporation, to 
a person or entity legally qualified to succeed to the foregoing 
interests under the laws of the place having jurisdiction over the 
estate involved. The procedures and forms to be used are the same 
procedures and forms as those specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. In the case of Ship, aircraft, Commercial Operator, Amateur, 
and Personal Radio Services (except for 218-219 MHz Service) involuntary 
assignment of licenses will not be granted; such licenses shall be 
surrendered for cancellation upon the death or legal disability of the 
licensee. Amateur station call signs assigned to the station of a 
deceased licensee shall be available for reassignment pursuant to 
Sec. 97.19 of this chapter.
    (h) Disclosure requirements. Applicants for transfer or assignment 
of licenses in auctionable services must comply with the disclosure 
requirements of Secs. 1.2111 and 1.2112 of this part.
    (i) Trafficking. Applications for approval of assignment or transfer 
may be reviewed by the Commission to determine if the transaction is for 
purposes of trafficking in service authorizations.
    (1) Trafficking consists of obtaining or attempting to obtain an 
authorization for the principal purpose of speculation or profitable 
resale of the authorization rather than for the provision of 
telecommunication services to the public or for the licensee's own 
private use.
    (2) The Commission may require submission of an affirmative, factual 
showing, supported by affidavit of persons with personal knowledge 
thereof, to demonstrate that the assignor did not acquire the 
authorization for the principal purpose of speculation or profitable 
resale of the authorization. This showing may include, for example, a 
demonstration that the proposed assignment is due to changed 
circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee after the 
grant of the authorization, or that the proposed assignment is 
incidental to a sale of

other facilities or a merger of interests.

Sec. 1.949  Application for renewal of license.

    (a) Applications for renewal of authorizations in the Wireless Radio 
Services must be filed no later than the expiration date of the 
authorization for which renewal is sought, and no sooner than 90 days 
prior to expiration. Renewal applications must be filed on the same form 
as applications for initial authorization in the same service, i.e., FCC 
Form 601 or 605. Additional renewal requirements applicable to specific 
services are set forth in the subparts governing those services.
    (b) Licensees with multiple authorizations in the same service may 
request a common day and month on which such authorizations expire for 
renewal purposes. License terms may be shortened by up to one year but 
will not be extended to accommodate the applicant's selection.

Sec. 1.951  Duty to respond to official communications.

    Licensees or applicants in the Wireless Radio Services receiving 
official notice of an apparent or actual violation of a federal statute, 
international agreement, Executive Order, or regulation pertaining to 
communications shall respond in writing within 10 days to the office of 
the FCC originating the notice, unless otherwise specified. Responses to 
official communications must be complete and self-contained without 
reference to other communications unless copies of such other 
communications are attached to the response. Licensees or applicants may 
respond via ULS.

Sec. 1.955  Termination of authorizations.

    (a) Authorizations in general remain valid until terminated in 
accordance with this section, except that the Commission may revoke an 
authorization pursuant to section 312 of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended. See 47 U.S.C. 312.
    (1) Expiration. Authorizations automatically terminate, without 
specific Commission action, on the expiration date specified therein, 
unless a timely application for renewal is filed. See Sec. 1.949 of this 
part. No authorization granted under the provisions of this part shall 
be for a term longer than ten years.
    (2) Failure to meet construction or coverage requirements. 
Authorizations automatically terminate, without specific Commission 
action, if the licensee fails to meet applicable construction or 
coverage requirements. See Sec. 1.948(c) of this part.
    (3) Service discontinued. Authorizations automatically terminate, 
without specific Commission action, if service is permanently 
discontinued. The Commission authorization or the individual service 
rules govern the definition of permanent discontinuance for purposes of 
this section. A licensee who discontinues operations shall notify the 
Commission of the discontinuance of operations by submitting FCC Form 
601 or 605 requesting license cancellation.
    (b) Special temporary authority (STA) automatically terminates 
without specific Commission action upon failure to comply with the terms 
and conditions therein, or at the end of the period specified therein, 
unless a timely request for an extension of the STA term is filed in 
accordance with Sec. 1.931 of this part. If a timely filed request for 
extension of the STA term is dismissed or denied, the STA automatically 
terminates, without specific Commission action, on the day after the 
applicant or the applicant's attorney is notified of the Commission's 
action dismissing or denying the request for extension.
    (c) Authorizations submitted by licensees for cancellation terminate 
when the Commission gives Public Notice of such action.

[63 FR 68934, Dec. 14, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 53240, Oct. 1, 1999]

    Editorial Note: At 64 FR 53240, Oct. 1, 1999, Sec. 1.955 was amended 
by revising the last sentence of paragraph (b)(2) to read ``See 
Sec. 1.946(c) of this part.'', effective Nov. 30, 1999.

However, paragraph (b)(2) does not exist in the 1998 volume.

Sec. 1.956  Settlement conferences.

    Parties are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution 
procedures to settle disputes. See subpart E of this part. In any 
contested proceeding, the Commission, in its discretion, may direct the 
parties or their attorneys to appear before it for a conference.
    (a) The purposes of such conferences are:
    (1) To obtain admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties 
as to any or all of the matters in controversy;
    (2) To consider the necessity for or desirability of amendments to 
the pleadings, or of additional pleadings or evidentiary submissions;
    (3) To consider simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (4) To encourage settlement of the matters in controversy by 
agreement between the parties; and
    (5) To consider other matters that may aid in the resolution of the 
contested proceeding.
    (b) Conferences are scheduled by the Commission at a time and place 
it may designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone conference 
call.
    (c) The failure of any party or attorney, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a failure to 
prosecute, subjecting that party's application or petition to dismissal 
by the Commission.

Sec. 1.957  Procedure with respect to amateur radio operator license.

    Each candidate for an amateur radio license which requires the 
applicant to pass one or more examination elements must present the 
Volunteer Examiners (VEs) with a properly completed FCC Form 605 prior 
to the examination. Upon completion of the examination, the VEs will 
grade the test papers. If the applicant is successful, the VEs will 
forward the candidate's application to a Volunteer-Examiner Coordinator 
(VEC). The VEs will then issue a certificate for sucessful completion of 
an amateur radio operator examination. The VEC will forward the 
application to the Commission's Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, facility.

alternatively may be sent to the Commission electronically via the ULS, 
no later than three months after the close of the licensee's fiscal 
year.

    The charges required to accompany a request for the Commission 
regulatory services listed in Secs. 1.1102 through 1.1107 of this 
subpart will not be refundable to the applicant irrespective of the 
Commission's disposition of that request. Return or refund of charges 
will be made in certain limited instances as set out at Sec. 1.1113 of 
this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1109  Payment of charges.

    (a) Electronic fee payments do not require the use of a FCC Form 
159, Remittance Advice. An electronic fee payment must be made on or 
before the day the application and appropriate processing form are 
filed.
    (b) The schedule of fees for applications and other filings lists 
those applications and other filings that must be accompanied by a FCC 
Form 159, Remittance Advice. A separate FCC Form 159 will not be 
required once the information requirements of that form (payor 
information) is incorporated into the underlying application form.
    (c) Applications and other filings that are not submitted in 
accordance with these instructions will be returned as unprocessable.

    Note: This requirement for the simultaneous submission of fees forms 
with applications or other filings does not apply to the payment of fees 
for which the Commission has established a billing process. See 
Sec. 1.1119 of this subpart.

    (d) Applications returned to applicants for additional information 
or corrections will not require an additional fee when resubmitted, 
unless the additional information results in an increase of the original 
fee amount. Those applications not requiring an additional fee should be 
resubmitted directly to the Bureau/Office requesting the additional 
information. The original fee will be forfeited if the additional 
information or corrections are not resubmitted to the appropriate 
Bureau/Office by the prescribed deadline. A forfeited application fee 
will not be refunded. If an additional fee is required, the original fee 
will be returned and the application must be resubmitted with a new 
remittance in the amount of the required fee to the Commission's lockbox 
bank. Applicants should attach a copy of the Commission's request for 
additional or corrected information to their resubmission.
    (1) If the Bureau/Office staff discovers within 30 days after the 
resubmission that the required fee was not submitted, the application 
will be dismissed.
    (2) If after 30 days the Bureau/Office staff discovers the required 
fee has not been paid, the application will be retained and a 25 percent 
late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if the Commission 
has completed its action on the application. Any Commission actions 
taken prior to timely payment of these charges are contingent and 
subject to recession.
    (e) Should the staff change the status of an application, resulting 
in an increase in the fee due, the applicant will be billed for the 
remainder under the conditions established by Sec. 1.1116(b) of the 
rules.

    Note: Due to the statutory requirements applicable to tariff 
filings, the procedures for handling tariff filings may vary from the 
procedures set out in the rules.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1110  Form of payment.

    (a) Fee payments should be in the form of a check, bank draft, on 
money order denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a United States 
financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications 
Commission or by a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover 
credit card. No other credit card is acceptable. Fees for applications 
and other filings paid by credit card will not be accepted unless the 
credit card section of FCC Form 159 is completed in full. The Commission 
discourages applicants from submitting cash and will not be responsible 
for cash sent through the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated more 
than six months prior to their submission to the Commission's lockbox 
bank and postdated checks will not be accepted and will be returned as 
deficient. Third party checks (i.e., checks with a third party as maker 
or endorser) will not be accepted.
    (1) Specific procedures for electronic payments are announced in 
Bureau/Office fee filing guides.
    (2) It is the responsibility of the payer to insure that any 
electronic payment is made in the manner required by the Commission. 
Failure to comply with the Commission's procedures will result in the 
return of the

[[Page 264]]

application or other filing and the fee payment.
    (3) Payments by wire transfer will be accepted; however, to insure 
proper credit, applicants must follow the instructions set out in the 
appropriate Bureau/Office fee filing guide.
    (b) Applicants are required to submit one payment instrument (check, 
bank draft or money order) and FCC Form 159 with each application or 
filing. Multiple payment instruments for a single application or filing 
are not permitted. Except that a separate Fee Form (FCC Form 159) will 
not be required once the information requirements of that form (the Fee 
Code, fee amount, and total fee remitted) are incorporated into the 
underlying application form.
    (c) The Commission may accept multiple money orders in payment of a 
fee for a single application where the fee exceeds the maximum amount 
for a money order established by the issuing agency and the use of 
multiple money orders is the only practical method available for fee 
payment.
    (d) The Commission may require payment of fees with a cashier's 
check upon notification to an applicant or filer or prospective group of 
applicants under the conditions set forth below in paragraphs (d) (1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) Payment by cashier's check may be required when a person or 
organization has made payment, on one or more occasions with a payment 
instrument on which the Commission does not receive final payment and 
such failure is not excused by bank error.
    (2) The Commission will notify the party in writing that future 
payments must be made by cashier's check until further notice. If, 
subsequent to such notice, payment is not made by cashier's check, the 
party's payment will not be accepted and its application or other filing 
will be returned.
    (e) All fees collected will be paid into the general fund of the 
United States Treasury in accordance with Pub. L. 99-272.
    (f) The Commission will furnish a stamped receipt of an application 
only upon request that complies with the following instructions. In 
order to obtain a stamped receipt for an application (or other filing), 
the application package must include a copy of the first page of the 
application, clearly marked ``copy'', submitted expressly for the 
purpose of serving as a receipt of the filing. The copy should be the 
top document in the package. The copy will be date-stamped immediately 
and provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For 
submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return 
mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-
addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the date stamped copy 
of the application. No remittance receipt copies will be furnished.

later than ten (10) days after receipt of the application on ULS or the 
application will be dismissed. Payment received more than ten (10) days 
after electronic filing of an application on a Bureau/Office electronic 
filing system (e.g., ULS) will be forfeited (see Secs. 1.034 and 
1.1109.)

Multichannel Video and Cable Television Service (MVCTS) and the Cable 
Television Relay Service (CARS) that are submitted electronically via 
the Cable Operations and Licensing System (COALS) may be paid 
electronically or sent to the Commission's lock box bank manually. When 
paying manually, applicants must include the FCC Form 159 generated by 
COALS (pre-filled with the transaction confirmation number) and 
completed with the necessary additional payment information to allow the 
Commission to verify that payment was made. Manual payments must be 
received no later than ten (10) days after receipt of the application or 
filing in COALS or the application or filing will be dismissed.

Sec. 1.1112  Conditionality of Commission or staff authorizations.

    (a) Any instrument of authorization granted by the Commission, or by 
its staff under delegated authority, will be conditioned upon final 
payment of the applicable fee and timely payment of bills issued by the 
Commission. As applied to checks, bank drafts and money orders, final 
payment shall mean receipt by the Treasury of funds cleared by the 
financial institution on which the check, bank draft or money order is 
drawn.
    (1) If, prior to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the 
Commissionis notified that final payment has not been made, the 
application or filing will be:
    (i) Dismissed and returned to the applicant;
    (ii) Shall lose its place in the processing line;
    (iii) And will not be accorded nunc pro tunc treatment if 
resubmitted after the relevant filing deadline.
    (2) If, subsequent to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the 
Commission is notified that final payment has not been made, the 
Commission will:
    (i) Automatically rescind that instrument of authorization for 
failure to meet the condition imposed by this subsection; and
    (ii) Notify the grantee of this action; and
    (iii) Not permit nunc pro tunc treatment for the resubmission of the 
application or filing if the relevant deadline has expired.

[[Page 266]]

    (3) Upon receipt of a notification of rescision of the 
authorization, the grantee will immediately cease operations initiated 
pursuant to the authorization.
    (b) In those instances where the Commission has granted a request 
for deferred payment of a fee or issued a bill payable at a future date, 
further processing of the application or filing, or the grant of 
authority, shall be conditioned upon final payment of the fee, plus 
other required payments for late payments, by the date prescribed by the 
deferral decision or bill. Failure to comply with the terms of the 
deferral decision or bill shall result in the automatic dismissal of the 
submission or rescision of the Commission authorization for failure to 
meet the condition imposed by this subpart. The Commission reserves the 
right to return payments received after the date established on the bill 
and exercise the conditions attached to the application. The Commission 
shall:
    (1) Notify the grantee that the authorization has been rescinded;
    (i) Upon such notification, the grantee will immediately cease 
operations initiated pursuant to the authorization.
    (2) Not permit nunc pro tunc treatment to applicants who attempt to 
refile after the original deadline for the underlying submission.
    (c) Where the procedures outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section would not provide a meaningful incentive to pay a fee that is 
due or would not be a meaningful sanction for failure to pay such a fee, 
in the alternative to those procedures, the Commission may, in its 
discretion, withhold processing and/or grant of any other application or 
filing made by a person or organization who has failed to make full 
payment of any fee due under this subpart.
    (1) Before taking such action, the staff will make a written request 
for the fee, together with any penalties that may be due under this 
subpart. Such request shall inform the applicant/filer that failure to 
pay will result in the Commission's withholding action on any other 
application or request filed by the applicant. The staff shall also 
inform the applicant of the procedures for seeking Commission review of 
the staff's fee determination.
    (2) If, after final determination that the fee is due, the applicant 
fails to pay the fee in a timely manner, the staff may terminate the 
processing and/or withhold a grant of any other application or filing 
pending or later filed by the applicant, until the matter is resolved.

    Note: Payments in excess of an application fee will be refunded only 
if the overpayment is $10 or more.

filed in accordance with the filing window as established by the 
Commission in a public notice specifying the earliest and latest dates 
for filing such applications.
    (b) Comparative hearings are no longer required.

Sec. 1.1115  Adjustments to charges.

    (a) The Schedule of Charges established by Sections 1.1102 through 
1.1107 of this subpart shall be adjusted by the Commission on October 1, 
1999 and every two years thereafter.
    (1) The fees will be adjusted by the Commission to reflect the 
percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers 
(CPI-U) from the date of enactment of the authorizing legislation 
(December 19, 1989) to the date of adjustment, and every two years 
thereafter, to reflect the percentage change in the CPI-U in the period 
between the enactment date and the adjustment date.
    (2) Adjustments based upon the percentage change in the CPI-U will 
be applied against the base fees as enacted or amended by Congress. 
Adjustmentswill not be calculated by using the previously adjusted fee 
as the base.
    (b) Increases or decreases in charges will apply to all categories 
of fees covered by this subpart. Individual fees will not be adjusted 
until the increase or decrease, as determined by the net change in the 
CPI-U since the date of enactment of the authorizing legislation, 
amounts to at least $5 in the case of fees under $100, or 5% or more in 
the case of fees of $100 or greater. All fees will be adjusted upward to 
the next $5 increment.
    (c) Adjustments to fees made pursuant to these procedures will not 
be subject to notice and comment rulemakings, nor will these decisions 
be subject to petitions for reconsideration under Sec. 1.429 of the 
rules. Requests for modifications will be limited to correction of 
arithmetical errors made during an adjustment cycle.

Sec. 1.1117  Petitions and applications for review.

    (a) The fees established by this subpart may be waived or deferred 
in specific instances where good cause is shown and where waiver or 
deferral of the fee would promote the public interest.
    (b) Requests for waivers or deferrals will only be considered when 
received from applicants acting in respect to their own applications. 
Requests for waivers or deferrals of entire classes of services will not 
be considered.
    (c) Petitions for waivers, deferrals, fee determinations, 
reconsiderations and applications for review will be acted upon by the 
Managing Director with the concurrence of the General Counsel. All such 
filings within the scope of the fee rules shall be filed as a separate 
pleading and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director. 
Any such request that is not filed as a separate pleading will not be 
considered by the Commission. Requests for deferral of a fee payment for 
financial hardship must be accompanied by supporting documentation.
    (1) Petitions and applications for review submitted with a fee must 
be submitted to the Commission's lock box bank at the address for the 
appropriate service set forth in Secs. 1.1102 through 1.1107.
    (2) If no fee payment is submitted, the request should be filed with 
the Commission's Secretary.
    (d) Deferrals of fees will be granted for an established period of 
time not to exceed six months.
    (e) Applicants seeking waivers must submit the request for waiver 
with the application or filing, required fee and FCC Form 159, or a 
request for deferral. A petition for waiver and/or deferral of payment 
must be submitted to the Office of the Managing Director as specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section. Waiver requests that do not include these 
materials will be dismissed in accordance with Sec. 1.1109 of this 
subpart. Submitted fees will be returned if a waiver is granted. The 
Commission will not be responsible for delays in acting upon these 
requests.
    (f) Petitions for waiver of a fee based on financial hardship will 
be subject to the provisions of paragraph 1.1166(e).

Sec. 1.1157  Payment of charges for regulatory fees.

    Payment of a regulatory fee, required under Secs. 1.1152 through 
1.1156, shall be filed in the following manner:
    (a) (1) The amount of the regulatory fee payment that is due with 
any application for authorization shall be the multiple of the number of 
years in the entire term of the requested license or other authorization 
multiplied by the annual fee payment required in the Schedule of 
Regulatory Fees, effective at the time the application is filed. Except 
as set forth in Sec. 1.1160, advance payments shall be final and shall 
not be readjusted during the term of the license or authorization, 
notwithstanding any subsequent increase or decrease in the annual amount 
of a fee required under the Schedule of Regulatory Fees.
    (2) Failure to file the appropriate regulatory fee due with an 
application for authorization will result in the return of the 
accompanying application, including an application for which the 
Commission has assigned a specific filing deadline.
    (b)(1) Payments of standard regulatory fees applicable to certain 
wireless radio, mass media, common carrier, cable and international 
services shall be filed in full on an annual basis at a time announced 
by the Commission or the Managing Director, pursuant to delegated 
authority, and published in the Federal Register.
    (2) Large regulatory fees, as annually defined by the Commission, 
may be submitted in installment payments or in a single payment on a 
date certain as announced by the Commission or the Managing Director, 
pursuant to delegated authority, and published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Standard regulatory fee payments, as well as any installment 
payment, must be filed with a FCC Form 159, FCC Remittance Advice, and a 
FCC Form 159C, Remittance Advice Continuation Sheet, if additional space 
is needed. Failure to submit a copy of

[[Page 275]]

FCC Form 159 with a standard regulatory fee payment, or an installment 
payment, will result in the return of the submission and a 25 percent 
penalty if the payment is resubmitted after the date the Commission 
establishes for the payment of standard regulatory fees and for any 
installment payment.
    (1) Any late filed regulatory fee payment will be subject to the 
penalties set forth in section 1.1164.
    (2) If one or more installment payments are untimely submitted or 
not submitted at all, the eligibility of the subject regulatee to submit 
installment payments may be cancelled.
    (d) Any Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) licensee subject to 
payment of an annual regulatory fee shall retain for a period of two (2) 
years from the date on which the regulatory fee is paid, those business 
records which were used to calculate the amount of the regulatory fee.

[60 FR 34031, June 29, 1995, as amended at 62 FR 59825, Nov. 5, 1997; 67 
FR 46306, July 12, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1158  Form of payment for regulatory fees.

    Any regulatory fee payment must be submitted in the form of a check, 
bank draft or money order denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a 
United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal 
Communications Commission or by Visa, Mastercard, American Express or 
Discover credit cards only. The Commission discourages applicants from 
submitting cash payments and will not be responsible for cash sent 
through the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated more than six 
months prior to their submission to the Commission's lockbox bank and 
postdated checks will not be accepted and will be returned as deficient.
    (a) Upon authorization from the Commission following a written 
request, electronic fund transfer (EFT) payment of a regulatory fee may 
be made as follows:
    (1)(i) The payor may instruct its bank to make payment of the 
regulatory fee directly to the Commission's lockbox bank, or
    (ii) The payor may authorize the Commission to direct its lockbox 
bank to withdraw funds directly from the payor's bank account.
    (2) No EFT payment of a regulatory fee will be accepted unless the 
payor has obtained the written authorization of the Commission to submit 
regulatory fees electronically. Procedures for electronic payment of 
regulatory fees will be announced by Public Notice. It is the 
responsibility of the payor to insure that any electronic payment is 
made in the manner required by the Commission. Failure to comply with 
the Commission's procedures for electronic fee payment will result in 
the return of the fee payment, and a penalty fee of 25 percent if the 
subsequent refiling of the fee payment is late. Failure to comply will 
also subject the payor to the penalties set forth in Sec. 1.1164.
    (b) Multiple payment instruments for a single regulatory fee are not 
permitted, except that the Commission will accept multiple money orders 
in payment of any fee where the fee exceeds the maximum amount for a 
money order established by the issuing entity and the use of multiple 
money orders is the only practicable means available for payment.
    (c) Payment of multiple standard regulatory fees (including an 
installment payment) due on the same date, may be made with a single 
payment instrument and cover mass media, common carrier, international, 
and cable service fee payments. Each regulatee is solely responsible for 
accurately accounting for and listing each license or authorization and 
the number of subscribers, access lines, or other relevant units on the 
accompanying FCC Form 159 and, if needed, FCC Form 159C and for making 
full payment for every regulatory fee listed on the accompanying form. 
Any omission or payment deficiency of a regulatory fee will result in a 
25 percent penalty of the amount due and unpaid.
    (d) Any regulatory fee payment (including a regulatory fee payment 
submitted with an application in the wireless radio service) made by 
credit card or money order must be submitted with a completed FCC Form 
159. Failure to accurately enter the credit card

[[Page 276]]

number and date of expiration and the payor's signature in the 
appropriate blocks on FCC Form 159 will result in rejection of the 
credit card payment.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1159  Filing locations and receipts for regulatory fees.

    (a) Regulatory fee payments must be directed to the location and 
address set forth in Secs. 1.1152 through 1.1156 for the specific 
category of fee involved. Any regulatory fee required to be submitted 
with an application must be filed as a part of the application package 
accompanying the application. The Commission will not take 
responsibility for matching fees, forms and applications submitted at 
different times or locations.
    (b) Petitions for reconsideration or applications for review of fee 
decisions submitted with a standard regulatory fee payment pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 1.1152 through 1.1156 of the rules are to be filed with the 
Commission's lockbox bank in the manner set forth in Secs. 1.1152 
through 1.1156 for payment of the feesubject to the petition for 
reconsideration or the application for review. Petitions for 
reconsideration and applications for review that are submitted with no 
accompanying payment should be filed with the Secretary, Federal 
Communications Commission, Attention: Managing Director, Washington, 
D.C. 20554.
    (c) Any request for exemption from a regulatory fee shall be filed 
with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention: 
Managing Director, Washington, D.C. 20554, except that requests for 
exemption accompanied by a tentative fee payment shall be filed at the 
lockbox set forth for the appropriate service in Sec. Sec. 1.1152 
through 1.1156.
    (d) The Commission will furnish a receipt for a regulatory fee 
payment only upon request. In order to obtain a receipt for a regulatory 
fee payment, the package must include an extra copy of the Form FCC 159 
or, if a Form 159 is not required with the payment, a copy of the first 
page of the application or other filing submitted with the regulatory 
fee payment, submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt 
for the regulatory fee payment and application fee payment, if required. 
The document should be clearly marked ``copy'' and should be the top 
document in the package. The copy will be date stamped immediately and 
provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For 
submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return 
mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-
addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the receipt document.
    (e) The Managing Director may issue annually, at his discretion, a 
Public Notice setting forth the names of all commercial regulatees that 
have paid a regulatory fee and shall publish the Public Notice in the 
Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1160  Refunds of regulatory fees.

    (a) Regulatory fees will be refunded, upon request, only in the 
following instances:
    (1) When no regulatory fee is required or an excessive fee has been 
paid. In the case of an overpayment, the refund amount will be based on 
the applicants', permittees', or licensees' entire submission. All 
refunds will be issued to the payor named in the appropriate block of 
the FCC Form 159. Payments in excess of a regulatory fee will be 
refunded only if the overpayment is $10.00 or more.
    (2) In the case of advance payment of regulatory fees, subject to 
Sec. 1.1152, a refund will be issued based on unexpired full years:
    (i) When the Commission adopts new rules that nullify a license or 
other authorization, or a new law or treaty renders a license or other 
authorization useless;
    (ii) When a licensee in the wireless radio service surrenders the 
license or other authorization subject to a fee payment to the 
Commission; or
    (iii) When the Commission declines to grant an application submitted 
with a regulatory fee payment.
    (3) When a waiver is granted in accordance with Sec. 1.1166.
    (b) No pro-rata refund of an annual fee will be issued.

[[Page 277]]

    (c) No refunds will be issued based on unexpired partial years.
    (d) No refunds will be processed without a written request from the 
applicant, permittee, licensee or agent.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1161  Conditional license grants and delegated authorizations.

    (a) Grant of any application or an instrument of authorization or 
other filing, for which a regulatory fee is required to accompany the 
application or filing, will be conditioned upon final payment of the 
regulatory fee. Final payment shall mean receipt by the U.S. Treasury of 
funds cleared by the financial institution on which the check, bank 
draft, money order, credit card, wire or electronic payment is drawn.
    (1) If, prior to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the 
Commission is notified that final payment of the regulatory fee has not 
been made, the application or filing:
    (i) Will be dismissed and returned;
    (ii) Shall lose its place in the processing line; and
    (iii) Will not be treated as timely filed if resubmitted after the 
relevant filing deadline.
    (2) If, subsequent to a grant of an instrument of authorization or 
other filing, the Commission is notified that final payment has not been 
made, the Commission will:
    (i) Automatically rescind that instrument of authorization for 
failure tomeet the condition imposed by this subsection;
    (ii) Notify the grantee of this action; and
    (iii) Treat as late filed any application resubmitted after the 
original deadline for filing the application.
    (3) Upon receipt of a notification of rescission of the 
authorization, the grantee will immediately cease operations initiated 
pursuant to the authorization.
    (b) In those instances where the Commission has granted a request 
for deferred payment of a regulatory fee, further processing of the 
application or filing or the grant of authority shall be conditioned 
upon final payment of the regulatory fee and any required penalties for 
late payment prescribed by the deferral decision. Failure to comply with 
the terms of the deferral decision shall result in the automatic 
dismissal of the submission or rescission of the Commission 
authorization. Further, the Commission shall:
    (1) Notify the grantee that the authorization has been rescinded. 
Upon such notification, the grantee will immediately cease operations 
initiated pursuant to the authorization; and
    (2) Treat as late filed any application resubmitted after the 
original deadline for filing the application.
    (c) Where the procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section would not provide a meaningful incentive to pay a regulatory fee 
that is due or would not be a meaningful sanction for failure to pay 
such a fee, the Commission may, in its discretion, whether the 
regulatory fee is required to be paid with an application for an 
instrument of authorization or otherwise, withhold processing and/or 
grant of any application or filing made by a person or organization who 
has failed to make full payment of any regulatory fee due.
    (1) Before taking such action, the staff will make a written request 
for the fee, together with any penalties that may be rendered under this 
subpart. Such request shall inform the regulatee that failure to pay may 
result in the Commission withholding action on any application or 
request filed by the applicant. The staff shall also inform the 
regulatee of the procedures for seeking Commission review of the staff's 
fee determination.
    (2) If, after final determination that the fee is due, payment is 
not made in a timely manner, the staff may terminate processing and/or 
withhold any grant or petition requested by the person or organization 
subject to the fee payment requirement, until the matter is resolved.

Sec. 1.1162  General exemptions from regulatory fees.

    No regulatory fee established in Secs. 1.1152 through 1.1156, unless 
otherwise qualified herein, shall be required for: (a) Applicants, 
permittees or licensees in the Amateur Radio Service, except that any 
person requesting a

[[Page 278]]

vanity call-sign shall be subject to the payment of a regulatory fee, as 
prescribed in Sec. 1.1152.
    (b) Applicants, permittees, or licensees who qualify as government 
entities. For purposes of this exemption, a government entity is defined 
as any state, possession, city, county, town, village, municipal 
corporation, or similar political organization or subpart thereof 
controlled by publicly elected or duly appointed public officials 
exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective 
communities or programs.
    (c) Applicants and permittees who qualify as nonprofit entities. For 
purposes of this exemption, a nonprofit entity is defined as: an 
organization duly qualified as a nonprofit, tax exempt entity under 
section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501; or an entity 
with current certification as a nonprofit corporation or other nonprofit 
entity by state or other governmental authority.
    (1) Any permittee, licensee or other entity subject to a regulatory 
fee and claiming an exemption from a regulatory fee based upon its 
status as a nonprofit entity, as described above, shall file with the 
Secretary of the Commission (Attn: Managing Director) written 
documentation establishing the basis for its exemption within 60 days of 
its coming under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission or at the 
time its fee payment would otherwise be due, whichever is sooner, or at 
such other time as required by the Managing Director. Acceptable 
documentation may include Internal Revenue Service determination 
letters, state or government certifications or other documentation that 
non-profit status has been approved by a state or other governmental 
authority. Applicants, permittees and licensees are required to file 
documentation of their nonprofit status only once, except upon request 
of the Managing Director.
    (2) Within sixty (60) days of a change in nonprofit status, a 
licensee or permittee previously claiming a 501(C) exemption is required 
to file with the Secretary of the Commission (Attn: Managing Director) 
written notice of such change in its nonprofit status or ownership. 
Additionally, for-profit purchasers or assignees of a license, station 
or facility previously licensed or operated by a non-profit entity not 
subject to regulatory fees must notify the Secretary of the Commission 
(Attn: Managing Director) of such purchase or reassignment within 60 
days of the effective date of the purchase or assignment.
    (d) Applicants, permittees or licensees in the Special Emergency 
Radio and Public Safety Radio services.
    (e) Applicants, permittees or licensees of noncommercial educational 
broadcast stations in the FM or TV services, as well as AM applicants, 
permittees or licensees operating in accordance with Sec. 73.503 of this 
chapter.
    (f) Applicants, permittees, or licensees qualifying under paragraph 
(e) of this section requesting Commission authorization in any other 
mass mediaradio service (except the international broadcast (HF) 
service), wireless radio service, common carrier radio service, or 
international radio service requiring payment of a regulatory fee, if 
the service is used in conjunction with their noncommercial educational 
broadcast station on a noncommercial educational basis.
    (g) Other applicants, permittees or licensees providing, or 
proposing to provide, a noncommercial educational or instructional 
service, but not qualifying under paragraph (e) of this section, may be 
exempt from regulatory fees, or be entitled to a refund, in the 
following circumstances:
    (1) The applicant, permittee or licensee is an organization that, 
like the Public Broadcasting Service or National Public Radio, receives 
funding directly or indirectly through the Public Broadcasting Fund, 47 
U.S.C. 396(k), distributed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 
where the authorization requested will be used in conjunction with the 
organization on a noncommercial educational basis;
    (2) An applicant, permittee or licensee of a translator or low power 
television station operating or proposing to operate a noncommercial 
educational service who, after grant, provides proof that it has 
received funding for the construction of the station

[[Page 279]]

through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA) or other showings as required by the Commission; or
    (3) An applicant, permittee, or licensee provided a fee refund under 
Sec. 1.1160 and operating as a noncommercial education station, is 
exempt from fees for broadcast auxiliary stations (subparts D, E, and F 
of part 74 of this chapter) or stations in the wireless radio, common 
carrier, or international services where such authorization is to be 
used in conjunction with the noncommercial educational translator or low 
power station.
    (h) An applicant, permittee or licensee that is the licensee of an 
instructional television fixed station (Secs. 74.901 through 74.996 of 
this chapter) is exempt from regulatory fees where the authorization 
requested will be used by the applicant in conjunction with the 
provision of the instructional service.
    (i) Applications filed in the wireless radio service for the sole 
purpose of modifying an existing authorization (or a pending application 
for authorization). However, if the applicant also requests a renewal or 
reinstatement of its license or other authorization for which the 
submission of a regulatory fee is required, the appropriate regulatory 
fee for such additional request must accompany the application.

    (a) For Fiscal Year 1995, the amounts assessed for regulatory fees 
are set forth in Secs. 1.1152 through 1.1156.
    (b) For Fiscal year 1996 and thereafter, the Schedule of Regulatory 
Fees, contained in Secs. 1.1152 through 1.1156, may be adjusted annually 
by the Commission pursuant to section 9 of the Communications Act. 47 
U.S.C. 159. Adjustments to the fees established for any category of 
regulatory fee payment shall include projected cost increases or 
decreases and an estimate of the volume of licensees or units upon which 
the regulatory fee is calculated.
    (c) The fees assessed shall:
    (1) Be derived by determining the full-time equivalent number of 
employees performing enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking 
activities, user information services, and international activities 
within the Wireline Competition Bureau, Media Bureau, International 
Bureau and other offices of the Commission, adjusted to take into 
account factors that are reasonably related to the benefits provided to 
the payor of the fee by the Commission's activities, including such 
factors as service coverage area, shared use versus exclusive use, and 
other factors that the Commission determines are necessary in the public 
interest;
    (2) Be established at amounts that will result in collection, during 
each fiscal year, of an amount that can reasonably be expected to equal 
the amount appropriated for such fiscalyear for the performance of the 
activities described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) The Commission shall by rule amend the Schedule of Regulatory 
Fees by proportionate increases or decreases that reflect, in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, changes in the amount 
appropriated for the performance of the activities described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for such fiscal year. Such 
proportionate increases or decreases shall be adjusted to reflect 
unexpected increases or decreases in the number of licensees or units 
subject to payment of such fees and result in collection of an aggregate 
amount of fees that will approximately equal the amount appropriated for 
the subject regulatory activities.
    (e) The Commission shall, by rule, amend the Schedule of Regulatory 
Fees if the Commission determines that the Schedule requires amendment 
to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In 
making such amendments, the Commission shall add, delete or reclassify 
services in the Schedule to reflect additional deletions or changes in 
the nature of its services as a consequence of Commission rulemaking 
proceedings or changes in law.
    (f) In making adjustments to regulatory fees, the Commission will 
round such fees to the nearest $5.00 in the case of fees under 
$1,000.00, or to the

[[Page 280]]

nearest $25.00 in the case of fees of $1,000.00 or more.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1164  Penalties for late or insufficient regulatory fee payments.

    Any late payment or insufficient payment of a regulatory fee, not 
excused by bank error, shall subject the regulatee to a 25 percent 
penalty of the amount of the fee of installment payment which was not 
paid in a timely manner. A timely fee payment or installment payment is 
one received at the Commission's lockbox bank by the due date specified 
by the Commission or by the Managing Director. A payment will also be 
considered late filed if the payment instrument (check, money order, 
bank draft or credit card) is uncollectible.
    (a) The Commission may, in its discretion, following one or more 
late filed installment payments, require a regulatee to pay the entire 
balance of its regulatory fee by a date certain, in addition to 
assessing a 25 percent penalty.
    (b) In cases were a fee payment fails due to error by the payor's 
bank, as evidenced by an affidavit of an officer of the bank, the date 
of the original submission will be considered the date of filing.
    (c) If a regulatory fee is paid in a timely manner, the regulatee 
will be notified of its deficiency. This notice will automatically 
assess a 25 percent penalty, subject the delinquent payor's pending 
applications to dismissal, and may require a delinquent payor to show 
cause why its existing instruments of authorization should not be 
subject to rescission.
    (d)(1) Where a regulatee's new, renewal or reinstatement application 
is required to be filed with a regulatory fee (as is the case with 
wireless radio services), the application will be dismissed if the 
regulatory fee is not included with the application package. In the case 
of a renewal or reinstatement application, the application may not be 
refiled unless the appropriate regulatory fee plus the 25 percent 
penalty charge accompanies the refiled application.
    (2) If the application that must be accompanied by a regulatory fee 
is a mutually exclusive application with a filing deadline, or any other 
application that must be filed by a date certain, the application will 
be dismissed if not accompanied by the proper regulatory fee and will be 
treated as late filed if resubmitted after the original date for filing 
application.
    (e) Any pending or subsequently filed application submitted by a 
party will be dismissed if that party is determined to be delinquent in 
paying a standard regulatory fee or an installment payment. The 
application may be resubmitted only if accompanied by the required 
regulatory fee and by any assessed penalty payment.
    (f) In instances where the Commission may revoke an existing 
instrument of authorization for failure to file a regulatory fee, the 
Commission will provide prior notice to the regulatee of such action and 
shall allow the licenseeno less than 60 days to either pay the fee or 
show cause why the payment assessed is inapplicable or should otherwise 
be waived or deferred.
    (1) An adjudicatory hearing will not be designated unless the 
response by the regulatee to the Order to Show Cause presents a 
substantial and material question of fact.
    (2) Disposition of the proceeding shall be based upon written 
evidence only and the burden of proceeding with the introduction of 
evidence and the burden of proof shall be on the respondent regulatee.
    (3) Unless the regulatee substantially prevails in the hearing, the 
Commission may assess costs for the conduct of the proceeding against 
the respondent regulatee. See 47 U.S.C. 402(b)(5).
    (4) Any regulatee failing to submit a regulatory fee, following 
notice to the regulatee of failure to submit the required fee, is 
subject to collection of the fee, including interest thereon, any 
associated penalties, and the full cost of collection to the Federal 
government pursuant to section 3720A of the Internal Revenue Code, 31 
U.S.C. 3717, and to the provisions of the Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 
3717. See 47 CFR 1.1901 through 1.1952. The debt collection processes 
described above may

[[Page 281]]

proceed concurrently with any other sanction in this paragraph.

Sec. 1.1165  Payment by cashier's check for regulatory fees.

    Payment by cashier's check may be required when a person or 
organization makes payment, on one or more occasions, with a payment 
instrument on which the Commission does not receive final payment and 
such error is not excused by bank error.

[60 FR 34034, June 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1166  Waivers, reductions and deferrals of regulatory fees.

    The fees established by sections 1.1152 through 1.1156 may be 
waived, reduced or deferred in specific instances, on a case-by-case 
basis, where good cause is shown and where waiver, reduction or deferral 
of the fee would promote the public interest. Requests for waivers, 
reductions or deferrals of regulatory fees for entire categories of 
payors will not be considered.
    (a) Requests for waivers, reductions or deferrals will be acted upon 
by the Managing Director with the concurrence of the General Counsel. 
All such filings within the scope of the fee rules shall be filed as a 
separate pleading and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing 
Director. Any such request that is not filed as a separate pleading will 
not be considered by the Commission.
    (1) If the request for waiver, reduction or deferral is accompanied 
by a fee payment, the request must be submitted to the Commission's 
lockbox bank at the address for the appropriate service set forth in 
Secs. 1.1152 through 1.1156 of this subpart.
    (2) If no fee payment is submitted, the request should be filed with 
the Commission's Secretary.
    (b) Deferrals of fees will be granted for a period of six months 
following the date that the fee is initially due.
    (c) Petitions for waiver of a regulatory fee must be accompanied by 
the required fee and FCC Form 159. Submitted fees will be returned if a 
waiver is granted. Waiver requests that do not include the required fees 
or forms will be dismissed unless accompanied by a petition to defer 
payment due to financial hardship, supported by documentation of the 
financial hardship.
    (d) Petitions for reduction of a fee must be accompanied by the full 
fee payment and Form 159. Petitions for reduction accompanied by a fee 
payment must be addressed to the Federal Communications Commission, 
Attention: Petitions, Post Office Box 358835, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
15251-5835. Petitions for reduction that do not include the required 
fees or forms will be dismissed unless accompanied by a petition to 
defer payment due to financial hardship, supported by documentation of 
the financial hardship.
    (e) Petitions for waiver of a fee based on financial hardship, 
including bankruptcy, will not be granted, even if otherwise consistent 
with Commission policy, to the extent that the total regulatory and 
application fees for which waiver is sought exceeds $500,000 in any 
fiscal year, including regulatory fees due in any fiscal year, but paid 
prior to the due date. In computing this amount, the amounts owed by an 
entity and its subsidiaries and other affiliated entities will be 
aggregated. In cases where the claim of financial hardship is not based 
on bankruptcy, waiver, partial waiver, or deferral of fees above the 
$500,000 cap may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1167  Error claims related to regulatory fees.

    (a) Challenges to determinations of an insufficient regulatory fee 
payment should be made in writing. challenges submitted with a fee 
payment must be submitted to the same location as the original fee 
payment, marked ``Attention: Fee Supervisor''. Challenges not 
accompanied by a fee payment should be filed with the Commission's 
Secretary and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director.
    (b) The filing of a petition for reconsideration or an application 
for review of a fee determination will not relievelicensees from the 
requirement that full and proper payment of the underlying fee payment 
be submitted, as required by the Commission's action,

[[Page 282]]

or delegated action, on a request for waiver, reduction or deferment. 
Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review submitted with 
a fee payment must be submitted to the same location as the original fee 
payment. Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review not 
accompanied by a fee payment should be filed with the Commission's 
Secretary and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director.
    (1) Failure to submit the fee by the date required will result in 
the assessment of a 25 percent penalty.
    (2) If the fee payment should fail while the Commission is 
considering the matter, the petition for reconsideration or application 
for review will be dismissed.

    Source: 52 FR 21052, June 4, 1987, unless otherwise noted.

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 1.1200  Introduction.

    (a) Purpose. To ensure the fairness and integrity of its decision-
making, the Commission has prescribed rules to regulate ex parte 
presentations in Commission proceedings. These rules specify ``exempt'' 
proceedings, in which ex parte presentations may be made freely 
(Sec. 1.1204(b)), ``permit-but-disclose'' proceedings, in which ex parte 
presentations to Commission decision-making personnel are permissible 
but subject to certain disclosure requirements (Sec. 1.1206), and 
``restricted'' proceedings in which ex parte presentations to and from 
Commission decision-making personnel are generally prohibited 
(Sec. 1.1208). In all proceedings, a certain period (''the Sunshine 
Agenda period'') is designated in which all presentations to Commission 
decision-making personnel are prohibited (Sec. 1.1203). The limitations 
on ex parte presentations described in this section are subject to 
certain general exceptions set forth in Sec. 1.1204(a). Where the public 
interest so requires in a particular proceeding, the Commission and its 
staff retain the discretion to modify the applicable ex parte rules by 
order, letter, or public notice. Joint Boards may modify the ex parte 
rules in proceedings before them.
    (b) Inquiries concerning the propriety of ex parte presentations 
should be directed to the Office of General Counsel.

[62 FR 15853, Apr. 3, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1202  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:

[[Page 283]]

    (a) Presentation. A communication directed to the merits or outcome 
of a proceeding, including any attachments to a written communication or 
documents shown in connection with an oral presentation directed to the 
merits or outcome of a proceeding. Excluded from this term are 
communications which are inadvertently or casually made, inquiries 
concerning compliance with procedural requirements if the procedural 
matter is not an area of controversy in the proceeding, statements made 
by decisionmakers that are limited to providing publicly available 
information about pending proceedings, and inquiries relating solely to 
the status of a proceeding, including inquiries as to the approximate 
time that action in a proceeding may be taken. However, a status inquiry 
which states or implies a view as to the merits or outcome of the 
proceeding or a preference for a particular party, which states why 
timing is important to a particular party or indicates a view as to the 
date by which a proceeding should be resolved, or which otherwise is 
intended to address the merits or outcome or to influence the timing of 
a proceeding is a presentation.

    Note to paragraph (a):
    A communication expressing concern about administrative delay or 
expressing concern that a proceeding be resolved expeditiously will be 
treated as a permissible status inquiry so long as no reason is given as 
to why the proceeding should be expedited other than the need to resolve 
administrative delay, no view is expressed as to the merits or outcome 
of the proceeding, and no view is expressed as to a date by which the 
proceeding should be resolved. A presentation by a party in a restricted 
proceeding not designated for hearing requesting action by a particular 
date or giving reasons that a proceeding should be expedited other than 
the need to avoid administrative delay (and responsive presentations by 
other parties) may be made on an ex parte basis subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1204(a)(11).

    (b) Ex parte presentation. Any presentation which:
    (1) If written, is not served on the parties to the proceeding; or
    (2) If oral, is made without advance notice to the parties and 
without opportunity for them to be present.

    Note to paragraph (b):
    Written communications include electronic submissions transmitted in 
the form of texts, such as by Internet electronic mail.

    (c) Decision-making personnel. Any member, officer, or employee of 
the Commission, or, in the case of a Joint Board, its members or their 
staffs, who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in 
formulating a decision, rule, or order in a proceeding. Any person who 
has been made a party to a proceeding or who otherwise has been excluded 
from the decisional process shall not be treated as a decision-maker 
with respect to that proceeding. Thus, any person designated as part of 
a separate trial staff shall not be considered a decision-making person 
in the designated proceeding. Unseparated Bureau or Office staff shall 
be considered decision-making personnel with respect to decisions, 
rules, and orders in which their Bureau or Office participates in 
enacting, preparing, or reviewing.
    (d) Party. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the following 
persons are parties:
    (1) In a proceeding not designated for hearing, any person who files 
an application, waiver request, petition, motion, request for a 
declaratory ruling, or other filing seeking affirmative relief 
(including a Freedom of Information Act request), and any person (other 
than an individual viewer or listener filing comments regarding a 
pending broadcast application or members of Congress or their staffs or 
branches of the federal government or their staffs) filing a written 
submission referencing and regarding such pending filing which is served 
on the filer, or, in the case of an application, any person filing a 
mutually exclusive application;
    Note 1 to paragraph (d)(1):
    Persons who file mutually exclusive applications for services that 
the Commission has announced will be subject to competitive bidding or 
lotteries shall not be deemed parties with respect to each others' 
applications merely because their applications are mutually exclusive. 
Therefore, such applicants may make presentations to the Commission 
about their own applications provided that no one has become a party 
with respect to their application by other means, e.g., by filing a 
petition or other opposition against the applicant or an associated 
waiver request, if the petition or opposition has been served on the 
applicant.

[[Page 284]]

    (2) Any person who files a complaint or request to revoke a license 
or other authorization or for an order to show cause which shows that 
the complainant has served it on the subject of the complaint or which 
is a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 and Sec. 1.721 of this chapter 
or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either Secs. 6.21 or 7.21 of this chapter, and the 
person who is the subject of such a complaint or request that shows 
service or is a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 and Sec. 1.721 of 
this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either Secs. 6.21 or 7.21 of this 
chapter;
    (3) The subject of an order to show cause, hearing designation 
order, notice of apparent liability, or similar notice or order, or 
petition for such notice or order;
    (4) In a proceeding designated for hearing, any person who has been 
given formal party status; and
    (5) In an informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 
of the Administrative Procedure Act (other than a proceeding for the 
allotment of a broadcast channel) or a proceeding before a Joint Board 
or before the Commission to consider the recommendation of a Joint 
Board, members of the general public after the issuance of a notice of 
proposed rulemaking or other order as provided under Sec. 1.1206(a) (1) 
or (2).
    (6) In an informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 
of the Administrative Procedure Act (other than a proceeding for the 
allotment of a broadcast channel) or a proceeding before a Joint Board 
or before the Commission to consider the recommendation of a Joint 
Board, members of the general public after the issuance of a notice of 
proposed rulemaking or other order as provided under Sec. 1.1206(a) (1) 
or (2).

    Note 2 to paragraph (d):
    To be deemed a party, a person must make the relevant filing with 
the Secretary, the relevant Bureau or Office, or the Commission as a 
whole. Written submissions made only to the Chairman or individual 
Commissioners will not confer party status.
    Note 3 to paragraph (d):
    The fact that a person is deemed a party for purposes of this 
subpart does not constitute a determination that such person has 
satisfied any other legal or procedural requirements, such as the 
operative requirements for petitions to deny or requirements as to 
timeliness. Nor does it constitute a determination that such person has 
any other procedural rights, such as the right to intervene in hearing 
proceedings. The Commission or the staff may also determine in 
particular instances that persons who qualify as ``parties'' under 
Sec. 1.1202(d) should nevertheless not be deemed parties for purposes of 
this subpart.
    Note 4 to paragraph (d):
    Individual listeners or viewers submitting comments regarding a 
pending broadcast application pursuant to Sec. 1.1204(a)(8) will not 
become parties simply by service of the comments. The Media Bureau may, 
in its discretion, make such a commenter a party, if doing so would be 
conducive to the Commission's consideration of the application or would 
otherwise be appropriate.
    Note 5 to paragraph (d):
    A member of Congress or his or her staff, or other agencies or 
branches of the federal government or their staffs will not become a 
party by service of a written submission regarding a pending proceeding 
that has not been designated for hearing unless the submission 
affirmatively seeks and warrants grant of party status.

    (e) Matter designated for hearing. Any matter that has been 
designated for hearing before an administrative law judge or which is 
otherwise designated for hearing in accordance with procedures in 5 
U.S.C. 554.

                       Sunshine Period Prohibition


<R05>
Sec. 1.1203  Sunshine period prohibition.

    (a) With respect to any Commission proceeding, all presentations to 
decisionmakers concerning matters listed on a Sunshine Agenda, whether 
ex parte or not, are prohibited during the period prescribed in 
paragraph (b) of this section unless:
    (1) The presentation is exempt under Sec. 1.1204(a);
    (2) The presentation relates to settlement negotiations and 
otherwise complies with any ex parte restrictions in this subpart;
    (3) The presentation occurs in the course of a widely attended 
speech or panel discussion and concerns a Commission action in an exempt 
or a permit-but-disclose proceeding that has been adopted (not including 
private presentations made on the site of a

[[Page 285]]

widely attended speech or panel discussion); or
    (4) The presentation is made by a member of Congress or his or her 
staff, or by other agencies or branches of the Federal government or 
their staffs in a proceeding exempt under Sec. 1.1204 or subject to 
permit-but-disclose requirements under Sec. 1.1206. If the presentation 
is of substantial significance and clearly intended to affect the 
ultimate decision, the presentation (or, if oral, a summary of the 
presentation) must be placed in the record of the proceeding by 
Commission staff or by the presenter in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in Sec. 1.1206(b).
    (b) The prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
applies from the release of a public notice that a matter has been 
placed on the Sunshine Agenda until the Commission:
    (1) Releases the text of a decision or order relating to the matter;
    (2) Issues a public notice stating that the matter has been deleted 
from the Sunshine Agenda; or
    (3) Issues a public notice stating that the matter has been returned 
to the staff for further consideration, whichever occurs first.

    (a) Exempt ex parte presentations. The following types of 
presentations are exempt from the prohibitions in restricted proceedings 
(Sec. 1.1208), the disclosure requirements in permit-but-disclose

    (4) The presentation involves a military or foreign affairs function 
of the United States or classified security information;
    (5) The presentation is to or from an agency or branch of the

agency or branch and the Commission share jurisdiction provided that, 
any new factual information obtained through such a presentation that is 
relied on by the Commission in its decision-making process will, if not 
otherwise submitted for the record, be disclosed by the Commission no 
later than at the time of the release of the Commission's decision;
    (6) The presentation is to or from the United States Department of 
Justice or Federal Trade Commission and involves a telecommunications 
competition matter in a proceeding which has not been designated for 
hearing and in which the relevant agency is not a party or commenter (in 
an informal rulemaking or Joint board proceeding) provided that, any new 
factual information obtained through such a presentation that is relied 
on by the Commission in its decision-making process will be disclosed by 
the Commission no later than at the time of the release of the 
Commission's decision;

    Note 1 to paragraph (a):
    Under paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, information will 
be relied on and disclosure will be made only after advance coordination 
with the agency involved in order to ensure that the agency involved 
retains control over the timing and extent of any disclosure that may 
have an impact on that agency's jurisdictional responsibilities. If the 
agency involved does not wish such information to be disclosed, the 
Commission will not disclose it and will disregard it in its decision-
making process, unless it fits within another exemption not requiring 
disclosure (e.g., foreign affairs). The fact that an agency's views are 
disclosed under paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) does not preclude further 
discussions pursuant to, and in accordance with, the exemption.


[[Page 286]]


    (7) The presentation is between Commission staff and an advisory 
coordinating committee member with respect to the coordination of 
frequency assignments to stations in the private land mobile services or 
fixed services as authorized by 47 U.S.C. 332;
    (8) The presentation is a written presentation made by a listener or 
viewer of a broadcast station who is not a party under 
Sec. 1.1202(d)(1), and the presentation relates to a pending application 
that has not been designated for hearing for a new or modified broadcast 
station or license, for renewal of a broadcast station license or for 
assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast permit or license;
    (9) The presentation is made pursuant to an express or implied 
promise of confidentiality to protect an individual from the possibility 
of reprisal, or there is a reasonable expectation that disclosure would 
endanger the life or physical safety of an individual;
    (10) The presentation is requested by (or made with the advance 
approval of) the Commission or staff for the clarification or adduction 
of evidence, or for resolution of issues, including possible settlement, 
subject to the following limitations:
    (i) This exemption does not apply to restricted proceedings 
designated for hearing;
    (ii) In restricted proceedings not designated for hearing, any new 
written information elicited from such request or a summary of any new 
oral information elicited from such request shall promptly be served by 
the person making the presentation on the other parties to the 
proceeding. Information relating to how a proceeding should or could be 
settled, as opposed to new information regarding the merits, shall not 
be deemed to be new information for purposes of this section. The 
Commission or its staff may waive the service requirement if service 
would be too burdensome because the parties are numerous or because the 
materials relating to such presentation are voluminous. If the service 
requirement is waived, copies of the presentation or summary shall be 
placed in the record of the proceeding and the Commission or its staff 
shall issue a public notice which states that copies of the presentation 
or summary are available for inspection. The Commission or its staff may 
determine that service or public notice would interfere with the 
effective conduct of an investigation and dispense with the service and 
public notice requirements;
    (iii) If the presentation is made in a proceeding subject to permit-
but-disclose requirements, disclosure of any new written information 
elicited from such request or a summary of any new oral information 
elicited from such request must be made in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 1.1206(b), provided, however, that the Commission 
or its staff may determine that disclosure would interfere with the 
effective conduct of an investigation and dispense with the disclosure 
requirement. As in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section, information 
relating to how a proceeding should or could be settled, as opposed to 
new information regarding the merits, shall not be deemed to be new 
information for purposes of this section;

    Note 2 to paragraph (a):
    If the Commission or its staff dispenses with the service or notice 
requirement to avoid interference with an investigation, a determination 
will be made in the discretion of the Commission or its staff as to when 
and how disclosure should be made if necessary. See Amendment of Subpart 
H, Part I, 2 FCC Rcd 6053, 6054 [para][para] 10-14 (1987).

    (iv) If the presentation is made in a proceeding subject to the 
Sunshine period prohibition, disclosure must be made in accordance with 
the requirements of Sec. 1.1206(b) or by other adequate means of notice 
that the Commission deems appropriate;
    (v) In situations where new information regarding the merits is 
disclosed during settlement discussions, and the Commission or staff 
intends that the product of the settlement discussions will be disclosed 
to the other parties or the public for comment before any action is 
taken, the Commission or staff in its discretion may defer disclosure of 
such new information until comment is sought on the settlement proposal 
or the settlement discussions are terminated.
    (11) The presentation is an oral presentation in a restricted 
proceeding not

[[Page 287]]

designated for hearing requesting action by a particular date or giving 
reasons that a proceeding should be expedited other than the need to 
avoid administrative delay. A detailed summary of the presentation shall 
promptly be filed in the record and served by the person making the 
presentation on the other parties to the proceeding, who may respond in 
support or opposition to the request for expedition, including by oral 
ex parte presentation, subject to the same service requirement.
    (12) The presentation is between Commission staff and:
    (i) The administrator of the interstate telecommunications relay 
services fund relating to administration of the telecommunications relay 
services fund pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 225;
    (ii) The North American Numbering Plan Administrator or the North 
American Numbering Plan Billing and Collection Agent relating to the 
administration of the North American Numbering Plan pursuant to 47 
U.S.C. 251(e);
    (iii) The Universal Service Administrative Company relating to the 
administration of universal service support mechanisms pursuant to 47 
U.S.C. 254; or
    (iv) The Number Portability Administrator relating to the 
administration of local number portability pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 
251(b)(2) and (e); provided that the relevant administrator has not 
filed comments or otherwise participated as a party in the proceeding.
    (b) Exempt proceedings. Unless otherwise provided by the Commission 
or the staff pursuant to Sec. 1.1200(a), ex parte presentations to or 
from Commission decision-making personnel are permissible and need not 
be disclosed with respect to the following proceedings, which are 
referred to as ``exempt'' proceedings:
    (1) A notice of inquiry proceeding;
    (2) A petition for rulemaking, except for a petition requesting the 
allotment of a broadcast channel (see alsoSec. 1.1206(a)(1)), or other 
request that the Commission modify its rules, issue a policy statement 
or issue an interpretive rule, or establish a Joint Board;
    (3) A tariff proceeding (including directly associated waiver 
requests or requests for special permission) prior to it being set for 
investigation (see also Sec. 1.1206(a)(4));
    (4) A proceeding relating to prescription of common carrier 
depreciation rates under section 220(b) of the Communications Act prior 
to release of a public notice of specific proposed depreciation rates 
(see also Sec. 1.1206(a)(9));
    (5) An informal complaint proceeding under 47 U.S.C. 208 and 
Sec. 1.717 of this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either Secs. 6.17 or 
7.17 of this chapter; and
    (6) A complaint against a cable operator regarding its rates that is 
not filed on the standard complaint form required by Sec. 76.951 of this 
chapter (FCC Form 329).

    Notes 1-3 to paragraph (b):
    [Reserved]
    Note 4 to paragraph (b):
    In the case of petitions for rulemaking that seek Commission 
preemption of state or local regulatory authority, the petitioner must 
serve the original petition on any state or local government, the 
actions of which are specifically cited as a basis for requesting 
preemption. Service should be made on those bodies within the state or 
local governments that are legally authorized to accept service of legal 
documents in a civil context. Such pleadings that are not served will be 
dismissed without consideration as a defective pleading and treated as a 
violation of the ex parte rules unless the Commission determines that 
the matter should be entertained by making it part of the record under 
Sec. 1.1212(d) and the parties are so informed.

                       Non-Restricted Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.1206  Permit-but-disclose proceedings.

    (a) Unless otherwise provided by the Commission or the staff 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1200(a), until the proceeding is no longer subject to 
administrative reconsideration or review or to judicial review, ex parte 
presentations (other than ex parte presentations exempt under 
Sec. 1.1204(a)) to or from Commission decision-making personnel are 
permissible in the following proceedings, which are referred to as 
permit-but-disclose proceedings, provided that ex parte presentations to 
Commission decision-making personnel are disclosed pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section:

[[Page 288]]

    Note 1 to paragraph (a):
    In the case of petitions for declaratory ruling that seek Commission 
preemption of state or local regulatory authority and petitions for 
relief under 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)(v), the petitioner must serve the 
original petition on any state or local government, the actions of which 
are specifically cited as a basis for requesting preemption. Service 
should be made on those bodies within the state or local governments 
that are legally authorized to accept service of legal documents in a 
civil context. Such pleadings that are not served will be dismissed 
without consideration as a defective pleading and treated as a violation 
of the ex parte rules unless the Commission determines that the matter 
should be entertained by making it part of the record under 
Sec. 1.1212(d) and the parties are so informed.

    (1) An informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 of 
the Administrative Procedure Act other than a proceeding for the 
allotment of a broadcast channel, upon release of a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (see also Sec. 1.1204(b)(2));
    (2) A proceeding involving a rule change, policy statement or 
interpretive rule adopted without a Notice of Proposed Rule Making upon 
release of the order adopting the rule change, policy statement or 
interpretive rule;
    (3) A declaratory ruling proceeding;
    (4) A tariff proceeding which has been set for investigation under 
section 204 or 205 of the Communications Act (including directly 
associated waiver requests or requests for special permission) (see also 
Sec. 1.1204(b)(4));
    (5) Unless designated for hearing, a proceeding under section 214(a) 
of the Communications Act that does not also involve applications under 
Title III of the Communications Act (see also Sec. 1.1208);
    (6) Unless designated for hearing, a proceeding involving an 
application for a Cable Landing Act license that does not also involve 
applications under Title III of the Communications Act (see also 
Sec. 1.1208);
    (7) A proceeding involving a request for information filed pursuant 
to the Freedom of Information Act;

    Note 2 to paragraph (a):
    Where the requested information is the subject of a request for 
confidentiality, the person filing the request for confidentiality shall 
be deemed a party.

    (8) A proceeding before a Joint Board or a proceeding before the 
Commission involving a recommendation from a Joint Board;
    (9) A proceeding conducted pursuant to section 220(b) of the 
Communications Act for prescription of common carrier depreciation rates 
upon release of a public notice of specific proposed depreciation rates 
(see also Sec. 1.1204(b)(4));
    (10) A proceeding to prescribe a rate of return for common carriers 
under section 205 of the Communications Act; and
    (11) A cable rate complaint proceeding pursuant to section 623(c) of 
the Communications Act where the complaint is filed on FCC Form 329.
    (12) A modification request filed pursuant to Sec. 64.1001 of this 
chapter;
    (13) Applications by Bell Operating Companies to provide in-region, 
interLATA services pursuant to Sec. 271(d) of the Communications Act; 
and
    (14) Petitions for Commission preemption of authority to review 
interconnection agreements under Sec. 252(e)(5) of the Communications 
Act and petitions for preemption under Sec. 253 of the Communications 
Act.

    Note 3 to paragraph (a):
    In a permit-but-disclose proceeding involving only one ``party,'' as 
defined in Sec. 1.1202(d) of this section, the party and the Commission 
may freely make presentations to each other and need not comply with the 
disclosure requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

    (b) The following disclosure requirements apply to ex parte 
presentations in permit but disclose proceedings:
    (1) Written presentations. A person who makes a written ex parte 
presentation subject to this section shall, no later than the next 
business day after the presentation, submit two copies of the 
presentation to the Commission's secretary under separate cover for 
inclusion in the public record. The presentation (and cover letter) 
shall clearly identify the proceeding to which it relates, including the 
docket number, if any, shall indicate that two copies have been 
submitted to the Secretary, and must be labeled as an ex parte 
presentation. If the presentation relates to more than one proceeding, 
two copies shall be filed for each proceeding. Alternatively, in 
rulemaking

[[Page 289]]

proceedings governed by Sec. 1.49(f), the person making the presentation 
may file one copy of the presentation electronically; no additional 
paper copies need to be filed.
    (2) Oral presentations. A person who makes an oral ex parte 
presentation subject to this section that presents data or arguments not 
already reflected in that person's written comments, memoranda or other 
filings in that proceeding shall, no later than the next business day 
after the presentation, submit to the Commission's Secretary, an 
original and one copy of a memorandum which summarizes the new data or 
arguments. Except in proceedings subject to Sec. 1.49(f) in which 
pleadings are filed electronically, a copy of the memorandum must also 
be submitted to the Commissioners or Commission employees involved in 
the oral presentation. In proceedings governed by Sec. 1.49(f), the 
person making the presentation may, alternatively, electronically file 
one copy of the memorandum, which will be available to Commissioners and 
Commission employees involved in the presentation through the 
Commission's electronic comment filing system. Memoranda must contain a 
summary of the substance of the ex parte presentation and not merely a 
listing of the subjects discussed. More than a one or two sentence 
description of the views and arguments presented is generally required. 
The memorandum (and cover letter) shall clearly identify the proceeding 
to which it relates, including the docket number, if any, shall indicate 
that an original and one copy have been submitted to the Secretary or 
that one copy has been filed electronically, and must be labeled as an 
ex parte presentation. If the presentation relates to more than one 
proceeding, two copies of the memorandum (or an original and one copy) 
shall be filed for each proceeding.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b):
    Where, for example, presentations occur in the form of discussion at 
a widely attended meeting, preparation of a memorandum as specified in 
the rule might be cumbersome. Under these circumstances, the rule may be 
satisfied by submitting a transcript or tape recording of the discussion 
as an alternative to a memorandum.

    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, in 
permit-but-disclose proceedings presentations made by members of 
Congress or their staffs or by an agency or branch of the Federal 
Government or its staff shall be treated as ex parte presentations only 
if the presentations are of substantial significance and clearly 
intended to affect the ultimate decision. The Commission staff shall 
prepare a written summary of any such oral presentations and place them 
in the record in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section and 
place any such written presentations in the record in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Notice of ex parte presentations. The Commission's Secretary or, 
in the case of non-docketed proceedings, the relevant Bureau or Office 
shall place in the public file or record of the proceeding written ex 
parte presentations and memoranda reflecting oral ex parte 
presentations. The Secretary shall issue a public notice listing any 
written ex parte presentations or written summaries of oral ex parte 
presentations received by his or her office relating to any permit-but-
disclose proceeding. Such public notices should generally be released at 
least twice per week.

    Note 2 to paragraph (b):
    Interested persons should be aware that some ex parte filings, for 
example, those not filed in accordance with the requirements of this 
paragraph (b), might not be placed on the referenced public notice. All 
ex parte presentations and memoranda filed under this section will be 
available for public inspection in the public file or record of the 
proceeding, and parties wishing to ensure awareness of all filings 
should review the public file or record.
    Note 3 to paragraph (b):
    As a matter of convenience, the Secretary may also list on the 
referenced public notices materials, even if not ex parte presentations, 
that are filed after the close of the reply comment period or, if the 
matter is on reconsideration, the reconsideration reply comment period.

                         Restricted Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.1208  Restricted proceedings.

    Unless otherwise provided by the Commission or its staff pursuant to

[[Page 290]]

Sec. 1.1200(a) of this section, ex parte presentations (other than ex 
parte presentations exempt under Sec. 1.1204(a) of this section) to or 
from Commission decision-making personnel are prohibited in all 
proceedings not listed as exempt in Sec. 1.1204(b) or permit-but-
disclose in Sec. 1.1206(a) of this section until the proceeding is no 
longer subject to administrative reconsideration or review or judicial 
review. Proceedings in which ex parte presentations are prohibited, 
referred to as ``restricted'' proceedings, include, but are not limited 
to, all proceedings that have been designated for hearing, proceedings 
involving amendments to the broadcast table of allotments, applications 
for authority under Title III of the Communications Act, and all waiver 
proceedings (except for those directly associated with tariff filings).

    Note 1 to Sec. 1.1208: In a restricted proceeding involving only one 
``party,'' as defined in Sec. 1.1202(d), the party and the Commission 
may freely make presentations to each other because there is no other 
party to be served or with a right to have an opportunity to be present. 
See Sec. 1.1202(b). Therefore, to determine whether presentations are 
permissible in a restricted proceeding without service or notice and an 
opportunity for other parties to be present the definition of a 
``party'' should be consulted.

    Examples: After the filing of an uncontested application or waiver 
request, the applicant or other filer would be the sole party to the 
proceeding. The filer would have no other party to serve with or give 
notice of any presentations to the Commission, and such presentations 
would therefore not be ``ex parte presentations'' as defined by 
Sec. 1.1202(b) and would not be prohibited. On the other hand, in the 
example given, because the filer is a party, a third person who wished 
to make a presentation to the Commission concerning the application or 
waiver request would have to serve or notice the filer. Further, once 
the proceeding involved additional ``parties'' as defined by 
Sec. 1.1202(d) (e.g., an opponent of the filer who served the opposition 
on the filer), the filer and other parties would have to serve or notice 
all other parties.

    Note 2 to Sec. 1.1208: Consistent with Sec. 1.1200(a), the 
Commission or its staff may determine that a restricted proceeding not 
designated for hearing involves primarily issues of broadly applicable 
policy rather than the rights and responsibilities of specific parties 
and specify that the proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1206 governing permit-but-disclose proceedings.

      Procedures for Handling of Prohibited Ex Parte Presentations


<R05>
Sec. 1.1212  Procedures for handling of prohibited ex parte presentations.

    (a) Commission personnel who believe that an oral presentation which 
is being made to them or is about to be made to them is prohibited shall 
promptly advise the person initiating the presentation that it is 
prohibited and shall terminate the discussion.
    (b) Commission personnel who receive oral ex parte presentations 
which they believe are prohibited shall forward to the Office of General 
Counsel a statement containing the following information:
    (1) The name of the proceeding;
    (2) The name and address of the person making the presentation and 
that person's relationship (if any) to the parties to the proceeding;
    (3) The date and time of the presentation, its duration, and the 
circumstances under which it was made;
    (4) A full summary of the substance of the presentation;
    (5) Whether the person making the presentation persisted in doing so 
after being advised that the presentation was prohibited; and
    (6) The date and time that the statement was prepared.
    (c) Commission personnel who receive written ex parte presentations 
which they believe are prohibited shall forward them to the Office of 
General Counsel. If the circumstances in which the presentation was made 
are not apparent from the presentation itself, a statement describing 
those circumstances shall be submitted to the

[[Page 291]]

Office of General Counsel with the presentation.
    (d) Prohibited written ex parte presentations and all documentation 
relating to prohibited written and oral ex parte presentations shall be 
placed in a public file which shall be associated with but not made part 
of the record of the proceeding to which the presentations pertain. Such 
materials may be considered in determining the merits of a restricted 
proceeding only if theyare made part of the record and the parties are 
so informed.
    (e) If the General Counsel determines that an ex parte presentation 
or presentation during the Sunshine period is prohibited by this 
subpart, he or she shall notify the parties to the proceeding that a 
prohibited presentation has occurred and shall serve on the parties 
copies of the presentation (if written) and any statements describing 
the circumstances of the presentation. Service by the General Counsel 
shall not be deemed to cure any violation of the rules against 
prohibited ex parte presentations.
    (f) If the General Counsel determines that service on the parties 
would be unduly burdensome because the parties to the proceeding are 
numerous, he or she may issue a public notice in lieu of service. The 
public notice shall state that a prohibited presentation has been made 
and may also state that the presentation and related materials are 
available for public inspection.
    (g) The General Counsel shall forward a copy of any statement 
describing the circumstances in which the prohibited ex parte 
presentation was made to the person who made the presentation. Within 
ten days thereafter, the person who made the presentation may file with 
the General Counsel a sworn declaration regarding the presentation and 
the circumstances in which it was made. The General Counsel may serve 
copies of the sworn declaration on the parties to the proceeding.
    (h) Where a restricted proceeding precipitates a substantial amount 
of correspondence from the general public, the procedures in paragraphs 
(c) through (g) of this section will not be followed with respect to 
such correspondence. The correspondence will be placed in a public file 
and be made available for public inspection.

Sec. 1.1214  Disclosure of information concerning violations of this subpart.

    Any party to a proceeding or any Commission employee who has 
substantial reason to believe that any violation of this subpart has 
been solicited, attempted, or committed shall promptly advise the Office 
of General Counsel in writing of all the facts and circumstances which 
are known to him or her.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1216  Sanctions.

    (a) Parties. Upon notice and hearing, any party to a proceeding who 
directly or indirectly violates or causes the violation of any provision 
of this subpart, or who fails to report the facts and circumstances 
concerning any such violation as required by this subpart, may be 
disqualified from further participation in that proceeding. In 
proceedings other than a rulemaking, a party who has violated or caused 
the violation of any provision of this subpart may be required to show 
cause why his or her claim or interest in the proceeding should not be 
dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected. In any 
proceeding, such alternative or additional sanctions as may be 
appropriate may also be imposed.
    (b) Commission personnel. Commission personnel who violate 
provisions of this subpart may be subject to appropriate disciplinary or 
other remedial action as provided in part 19 of this chapter.
    (c) Other persons. Such sanctions as may be appropriate under the 
circumstances shall be imposed upon other persons who violate the 
provisions of this subpart.

Subpart I--Procedures Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act 
                                 of 1969

    Source: 51 FR 15000, Apr. 22, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1301  Basis and purpose.

    The provisions of this subpart implement Subchapter I of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321-
4335.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1302  Cross-reference; Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality.

    A further explanation regarding implementation of the National 
Environmental Policy Act is provided by theregulations issued by the 
Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR 1500-1508.28.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1303  Scope.

    The provisions of this subpart shall apply to all Commission actions 
that may or will have a significant impact on the quality of the human 
environment. To the extent that other provisions of the Commission's 
rules and regulations are inconsistent with the subpart, the provisions 
of this subpart shall govern.

[55 FR 20396, May 16, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1304  Information and assistance.

    For general information and assistance concerning the provisions of 
this subpart, the Office of General Counsel may be contacted, (202) 632-
6990. For more specific information, the Bureau responsible for 
processing a specific application should be contacted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1305  Actions which normally will have a significant impact upon the environment, for which Environmental Impact Statements must be prepared.

    Any Commission action deemed to have a significant effect upon the 
quality of the human environment requires the preparation of a Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Final Environmental Impact 
Statement (FEIS) (collectively referred to as EISs) (see Secs. 1.1314, 
1.1315 and 1.1317). The Commission has reviewed representative actions 
and has found no common pattern which would enable it to specify actions 
that will thus automatically require EISs.

    Note: Our current application forms refer applicants to Sec. 1.1305 
to determine if their proposals are such that the submission of 
environmental information is required (see Sec. 1.1311). Until the 
application forms are revised to reflect our new environmental rules, 
applicants should refer to Sec. 1.1307. Section 1.1307 now delineates 
those actions for which applicants must submit environmental 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1306  Actions which are categorically excluded from environmental processing.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 1.1307 (c) and (d), Commission 
actions not covered by Sec. 1.1307 (a) and (b) are deemed individually 
and cumulatively to have no significant effect on the quality of the 
human environment and are categorically excluded from environmental 
processing.
    (b) Specifically, any Commission action with respect to any new 
application, or minor or major modifications of existing or authorized 
facilities or equipment, will be categorically excluded, provided such 
proposals do not:
    (1) Involve a site location specified under Sec. 1.1307(a) (1)-(7), 
or
    (2) Involve high intensity lighting under Sec. 1.1307(a)(8).
    (3) Result in human exposure to radiofrequency radiation in excess 
of the applicable safety standards specified in Sec. 1.1307(b).

    Note 1: The provisions of Sec. 1.1307(a) of this part requiring the 
preparation of EAs do not encompass the mounting of antenna(s) on an 
existing building or antenna tower unless Sec. 1.1307(a)(4) of this part 
is applicable. Such antennas are subject to Sec. 1.1307(b) of this part 
and require EAs if their construction would result in human exposure to 
radiofrequency radiation in excess of the applicable health and safety 
guidelines cited in Sec. 1.1307(b) of this part. The provisions of 
Sec. 1.1307 (a) and (b) of this part do not encompass the installation 
of aerial wire or cable over existing aerial corridors of prior or 
permitted use or the underground installation of wire or cable along 
existing underground corridors of prior or permitted use, established by 
the applicant or others. The use of existing buildings, towers or 
corridors is an environmentally desirable alternative to the 
construction of new facilities and is encouraged. The provisions of 
Sec. 1.1307(a) and (b) of this part do not

[[Page 293]]

encompass the construction of new submarine cable systems.
    Note 2: The specific height of an antenna tower or supporting 
structure, as well as the specific diameter of a satellite earth 
station, in and of itself, will not be deemed sufficient to warrant 
environmental processing, see Secs. 1.1307 and 1.1308.
    Note 3: The construction of an antenna tower or supporting structure 
in an established ``antenna farm'': (i.e., an area in which similar 
antenna towers are clustered, whether or not such area has been 
officially designated as an antenna farm), will be categorically 
excluded unless one or more of the antennas to be mounted on the tower 
or structure are subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.1307(b) and the 
additional radiofrequency radiation from the antenna(s) on the new tower 
or structure would cause human exposure in excess of the applicable 
health and safety guidelines cited in Sec. 1.1307(b).

Sec. 1.1307  Actions that may have a significant environmental effect, for which Environmental Assessments (EAs) must be prepared.

    (a) Commission actions with respect to the following types of 
facilities may significantly affect the environment and thus require the 
preparation of EAs by the applicant (see Secs. 1.1308 and 1.1311) and 
may require further Commission environmental processing (see 
Secs. 1.1314, 1.1315 and 1.1317):
    (1) Facilities that are to be located in an officially designated 
wilderness area.
    (2) Facilities that are to be located in an officially designated 
wildlife preserve.
    (3) Facilities that: (i) May affect listed threatened or endangered 
species or designated critical habitats; or (ii) are likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of any proposed endangered or 
threatened species or likely to result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of proposed critical habitats, as determined by the 
Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 
1973.

    Note: The list of endangered and threatened species is contained in 
50 CFR 17.11, 17.22, 222.23(a) and 227.4. The list of designated 
critical habitats is contained in 50 CFR 17.95, 17.96 and part 226. To 
ascertain the status of proposed species and habitats, inquiries may be 
directed to the Regional Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
Department of the Interior.

    (4) Facilities that may affect districts, sites, buildings, 
structures or objects, significant in American history, architecture, 
archeology, engineering or culture, that are listed, or are eligible for 
listing, in the National Register of Historic Places. (See 16 U.S.C. 
470w(5); 36 CFR 60 and 800.)

    Note: The National Register is updated and re-published in the 
Federal Register each year in February. To ascertain whether a proposal 
affects a historical property of national significance, inquiries also 
may be made to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer, see 
16 U.S.C. 470a(b); 36 CFR parts 63 and 800.

    (5) Facilities that may affect Indian religious sites.
    (6) Facilities to be located in a flood Plain (See Executive Order 
11988.)
    (7) Facilities whose construction will involve significant change in 
surface features (e.g., wetland fill, deforestation or water diversion). 
(In the case of wetlands on Federal property, see Executive Order 
11990.)
    (8) Antenna towers and/or supporting structures that are to be 
equipped with high intensity white lights which are to be located in 
residential neighborhoods, as defined by the applicable zoning law.
    (b) In addition to the actions listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, Commission actions granting construction permits, licenses to 
transmit or renewals thereof, equipment authorizations or modifications 
in existing facilities, require the preparation of an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) if the particular facility, operation or transmitter 
would cause human exposure to levels of radiofrequency radiation in 
excess of the limits in Secs. 1.1310 and 2.1093 of this chapter. 
Applications to the Commission for construction permits, licenses to 
transmit or renewals thereof, equipment authorizations or modifications 
in existing facilities must contain a statement confirming compliance 
with the limits unless the facility, operation, or transmitter is 
categorically excluded, as discussed below. Technical information 
showing the basis for this statement must be

[[Page 294]]

submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (1) The appropriate exposure limits in Secs. 1.1310 and 2.1093 of 
this chapter are generally applicable to all facilities, operations and 
transmitters regulated by the Commission. However, a determination of 
compliance with the exposure limits in Sec. 1.1310 or Sec. 2.1093 of 
this chapter (routine environmental evaluation), and preparation of an 
EA if the limits are exceeded, is necessary only for facilities, 
operations and transmitters that fall into the categories listed in 
table 1, or those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. All 
other facilities, operations and transmitters are categorically excluded 
from making such studies or preparing an EA, except as indicated in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For purposes of table 1, 
building-mounted antennas means antennas mounted in or on a building 
structure that is occupied as a workplace or residence. The term powerin 
column 2 of table 1 refers to total operating power of the transmitting 
operation in question in terms of effective radiated power (ERP), 
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), or peak envelope power 
(PEP), as defined in Sec. 2.1 of this chapter. For the case of the 
Cellular Radiotelephone Service, subpart H of part 22 of this chapter; 
the Personal Communications Service, part 24 of this chapter and the 
Specialized Mobile Radio Service, part 90 of this chapter, the phrase 
total power of all channels in column 2 of table 1 means the sum of the 
ERP or EIRP of all co-located simultaneously operating transmitters 
owned and operated by a single licensee. When applying the criteria of 
table 1, radiation in all directions should be considered. For the case 
of transmitting facilities using sectorized transmitting antennas, 
applicants and licensees should apply the criteria to all transmitting 
channels in a given sector, noting that for a highly directional antenna 
there is relatively little contribution to ERP or EIRP summation for 
other directions.

Maritime Services (ship earth stations only) and the Specialized Mobile 
Radio Service authorized under Subpart H of parts 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 
80, and 90 of this chapter are subject to routine environmental 
evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment authorization or use, as 
specified in Secs. 2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter. Unlicensed PCS, 
unlicensed NII and millimeter wave devices are also subject to routine

authorization or use, as specified in Secs. 15.253(f), 15.255(g), 
15.319(i), and

[[Page 296]]

15.407(f) of this chapter. Portable transmitting equipment for use in 
the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) is subject to routine 
environment evaluation as specified in Secs. 2.1093 and 95.1125 of this 
chapter. Equipment authorized for use in the Medical Implant 
Communications Service (MICS) as a medical implant transmitter (as 
defined in Appendix 1 to Subpart E of part 95 of this chapter) is 
subject to routine environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to 
equipment authorization, as specified in Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter by 
finite difference time domain computational modeling or laboratory 
measurement techniques. Where a showing is based on computational 
modeling, the Commission retains the discretion to request that specific 
absorption rate measurement data be submitted. All other mobile, 
portable, and unlicensed transmitting devices are categorically excluded 
from routine environmental evaluation for RF exposure under 
Secs. 2.1091, 2.1093 of this chapter except as specified in paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section.
    (3) In general, when the guidelines specified in Sec. 1.1310 are 
exceeded in an accessible area due to the emissions from multiple fixed 
transmitters, actions necessary to bring the area into compliance are 
the shared responsibility of all licensees whose transmitters produce, 
at the area in question, power density levels that exceed 5% of the 
power density exposure limit applicable to their particular transmitter 
or field strength levels that, when squared, exceed 5% of the square of 
the electric or magnetic field strength limit applicable to their 
particular transmitter. Owners of transmitter sites are expected to 
allow applicants and licensees to take reasonable steps to comply with 
the requirements contained in Sec. 1.1307(b) and, where feasible, should 
encourage co-location of transmitters and common solutions for 
controlling access to areas where the RF exposure limits contained in 
Sec. 1.1310 might be exceeded.
    (i) Applicants for proposed (not otherwise excluded) transmitters, 
facilities or modifications that would cause non-compliance with the 
limits specified in Sec. 1.1310 at an accessible area previously in 
compliance must submit an EA if emissions from the applicant's 
transmitter or facility would result, at the area in question, in a 
power density that exceeds 5% of the power density exposure limit 
applicable to that transmitter or facility or in a field strength that, 
when squared, exceeds 5% of the square of the electric or magnetic field 
strength limit applicable to that transmitter or facility.
    (ii) Renewal applicants whose (not otherwise excluded) transmitters 
or facilities contribute to the field strength or power density at an 
accessible area not in compliance with the limits specified in 
Sec. 1.1310 must submit an EA if emissions from the applicant's 
transmitter or facility results, at the area in question, in a power 
density that exceeds 5% of the power density exposure limit applicable 
to that transmitter or facility or in a field strength that, when 
squared, exceeds 5% of the square of the electric or magnetic field 
strength limit applicable to that transmitter of facility.
    (4) Transition Provisions. Applications filed with the Commission 
prior to October 15, 1997 (or January 1, 1998, for the Amateur Radio 
Service only), for construction permits, licenses to transmit or 
renewals thereof, modifications in existing facilities or other 
authorizations or renewals thereof require the preparation of an 
Environmental Assessment if the particular facility, operation or 
transmitter would cause human exposure to levels of radiofrequency 
radiation that are in excess of the requirements contained in paragraphs 
(b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(iii) of this section. In accordance with 
Sec. 1.1312, if no new application or Commission action is required for 
a licensee to construct a new facility or physically modify an existing 
facility, e.g., geographic area licensees, and construction begins on or 
after October 15, 1997, the licensee will be required to prepare an 
Environmental Assessment if construction or modification of the facility 
would not comply with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. These transition provisions do not apply to applications for 
equipment authorization or use for mobile, portable and unlicensed 
devices as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1308  Consideration of environmental assessments (EAs); findings of no significant impact.

    (a) Applicants shall prepare EAs for actions that may have a 
significant environmental impact (see Sec. 1.1307). An EA is described 
in detail in Sec. 1.1311 of this part of the Commission rules.
    (b) The EA is a document which shall explain the environmental 
consequences of the proposal and set forth sufficient analysis for the 
Bureau or the Commission to reach a determination that the proposal will 
or will not have a significant environmental effect. To assist in making 
that determination, the Bureau or the Commission may request further 
information from the applicant, interested persons, and agencies and 
authorities which have jurisdiction by law or which have relevant 
expertise.

    Note: With respect to actions specified under Sec. 1.1307 (a)(3) and 
(a)(4), the Commission shall solicit and consider the comments of the 
Department of Interior, and the State Historic Preservation Officer and 
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, respectively, in 
accordance with their established procedures. See Interagency 
Cooperation--Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 50 CFR part 
402; Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties, 36 CFR part 800. In 
addition, when an action interferes with or adversely affects an 
American Indian tribe's religious site, the Commission shall solicit the 
views of that American Indian tribe. See Sec. 1.1307(a)(5).

    (c) If the Bureau or the Commission determines, based on an 
independent review of the EA and any applicable mandatory consultation 
requirements imposed upon Federal agencies (see note above), that the 
proposal will have a significant environmental impact upon the quality 
of the human environment, it will so inform the applicant. The applicant 
will then have an opportunity to amend its application so as to reduce, 
minimize, or eliminate environmental problems. See Sec. 1.1309. If the 
environmental problem is not eliminated, the Bureau will publish in the 
Federal Register a Notice of Intent (see Sec. 1.1314) that EISs will be 
prepared (see Secs. 1.1315 and 1.1317), or
    (d) If the Bureau or Commission determines, based on an independent 
review of the EA, and any mandatory consultation requirements imposed 
upon Federal agencies (see the note to paragraph (b) of this section), 
that the proposal would not have a significant impact, it will make a 
finding of no significant impact. Thereafter, the application will be 
processed without further documentation of environmental effect. 
Pursuant to CEQ regulations, see 40 CFR 1501.4 and 1501.6, the applicant 
must provide the community notice of the Commission's finding of no 
significant impact.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1309  Application amendments.

    Applicants are permitted to amend their applications to reduce, 
minimize or eliminate potential environmentalproblems. As a routine 
matter, an applicant will be permitted to amend its application within 
thirty (30) days after the Commission or the Bureau informs the 
applicant that the proposal will have a significant impact upon the 
quality of the human environment (see Sec. 1.1308(c)). The period of 
thirty (30) days may be extended upon a showing of good cause.

Sec. 1.1310  Radiofrequency radiation exposure limits.

    The criteria listed in table 1 shall be used to evaluate the 
environmental impact of human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) radiation 
as specified in Sec. 1.1307(b), except in the case of portable devices 
which shall be evaluated according to the provisions of Sec. 2.1093 of 
this chapter. Further information on evaluating compliance with these 
limits can be found in the FCC's OST/OET Bulletin Number 65, 
``Evaluating Compliance with FCC-Specified Guidelines for Human Exposure 
to Radiofrequency Radiation.''

    Note to Introductory Paragraph: These limits are generally based on 
recommended exposure guidelines published by the National Council on 
Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in ``Biological Effects and 
Exposure Criteria for Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields,'' NCRP 
Report No. 86, Sections 17.4.1, 17.4.1.1, 17.4.2 and 17.4.3. Copyright 
NCRP, 1986, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. In the frequency range from 100 
MHz to 1500 MHz, exposure limits for field strength and power density 
are also generally based on guidelines recommended by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) in Section 4.1 of ``IEEE Standard 
for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency 
Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz,'' ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992,

Sec. 1.1311  Environmental information to be included in the environmental assessment (EA).

    (a) The applicant shall submit an EA with each application that is 
subject to environmental processing (see Sec. 1.1307). The EA shall 
contain the following information:
    (1) For antenna towers and satellite earth stations, a description 
of the facilities as well as supporting structures and appurtenances, 
and a description of the site as well as the surrounding area and uses. 
If high intensity white lighting is proposed or utilized within a 
residential area, the EA must also address the impact of this lighting 
upon the residents.
    (2) A statement as to the zoning classification of the site, and 
communications with, or proceedings before and determinations (if any) 
made by zoning, planning, environmental or other local, state or Federal 
authorities on matters relating to environmental effect.
    (3) A statement as to whether construction of the facilities has 
been a

[[Page 300]]

source of controversy on environmental grounds in the local community.
    (4) A discussion of environmental and other considerations which led 
to the selection of the particular site and, if relevant, the particular 
facility; the nature and extent of any unavoidable adverse environmental 
effects, and any alternative sites or facilities which have been or 
might reasonably be considered.
    (5) Any other information that may be requested by the Bureau or 
Commission.
    (6) If endangered or threatened species or their critical habitats 
may be affected, the applicant's analysis must utilize the best 
scientific and commercial data available, see 50 CFR 402.14(c).
    (b) The information submitted in the EA shall be factual (not 
argumentative or conclusory) and concise with sufficient detail to 
explain the environmental consequences and to enable the Commission or 
Bureau, after an independent review of the EA, to reach a determination 
concerning the proposal's environmental impact, if any. The EA shall 
deal specifically with any feature of the site which has special 
environmental significance (e.g., wilderness areas, wildlife preserves, 
natural migration paths for birds and other wildlife, and sites of 
historic, architectural, or archeological value). In the case of 
historically significant sites, it shall specify the effect of the 
facilities on any district, site, building, structure or object listed, 
or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places. It 
shall also detail any substantial change in the character of the land 
utilized (e.g., deforestation, water diversion, wetland fill, or other 
extensive change of surface features). In the case of wilderness areas, 
wildlife preserves, or other like areas, the statement shall discuss the 
effect of any continuing pattern of human intrusion into the area (e.g., 
necessitated by the operation and maintenance of the facilities).
    (c) The EA shall also be accompanied with evidence of site approval 
which has been obtained from local or Federal land use authorities.
    (d) To the extent that such information is submitted in another part 
of the application, it need not be duplicated in the EA, but adequate 
cross-reference to such information shall be supplied.
    (e) An EA need not be submitted to the Commission if another agency 
of the Federal Government has assumed responsibility for determining 
whether of the facilities in question will have a significant effect on 
the quality of the human environment and, if it will, for invoking the 
environmental impact statement process.

Sec. 1.1314  Environmental impact statements (EISs).

    (a) Draft Environmental Impact Statements (DEISs) (Sec. 1.1315) and 
Final Environmental Impact Statements (FEISs) (referred to collectively 
as EISs) (Sec. 1.1317) shall be prepared by the Bureau responsible for 
processing the proposal when the Commission's or the Bureau's analysis 
of the EA (Sec. 1.1308) indicates that the proposal will have a 
significant effect upon the environment and the matter has not been 
resolved by an amendment.
    (b) As soon as practically feasible, the Bureau will publish in the 
Federal Register a Notice of Intent to prepare EISs. The Notice shall 
briefly identify the proposal, concisely describe the environmental 
issues and concerns presented by the subject application, and generally 
invite participation from affected or involved agencies, authorities and 
other interested persons.
    (c) The EISs shall not address non-environmental considerations. To 
safeguard against repetitive and unnecessarily lengthy documents, the 
Statements, where feasible, shall incorporate by reference material set 
forth in previous documents, with only a brief summary of its content. 
In preparing the EISs, the Bureau will identify and address the 
significant environmental issues and eliminate the insignificant issues 
from analysis.
    (d) To assist in the preparation of the EISs, the Bureau may request 
further information from the applicant, interested persons and agencies 
and authorities, which have jurisdiction by law or which have relevant 
expertise. The Bureau may direct that technical studies be made by the 
applicant and that the applicant obtain expert opinion concerning the 
potential environmental problems and costs associated with the proposed 
action, as well as comparative analyses of alternatives. The Bureau may 
also consult experts in an effort to identify measures that could be 
taken to minimize the adverse effects and alternatives to the proposed 
facilities that are not, or are less, objectionable. The Bureau may also 
direct that objections be raised with appropriate local, state or 
Federal land use agencies or authorities (if their views have not been 
previously sought).
    (e) The Bureau responsible for processing the particular application 
and, thus, preparing the EISs shall draft supplements to Statements 
where significant new circumstances occur or information arises relevant 
to environmental concerns and bearing upon the application.
    (f) The Application, the EA, the DEIS, and the FEIS and all related 
documents, including the comments filed by the public and any agency, 
shall be part of the administrative record and will be routinely 
available for public inspection.
    (g) If EISs are to be prepared, the applicant must provide the 
community with notice of the availability of environmental documents and 
the scheduling of any Commission hearings in that action.
    (h) The timing of agency action with respect to applications subject 
to EISsis set forth in 40 CFR 1506.10. No decision shall be made until 
ninety (90) days after the Notice of Availability of the Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement is published in the Federal Register, and 
thirty (30) days after the Notice of Availability of the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement is published in the Federal Register, 
which time period may run concurrently, See 40 CFR 1506.10(c); see also 
Secs. 1.1315(b) and 1.1317(b).

in the proceeding and shall note

[[Page 306]]

the section which specifically determines the treatment and amount of 
accumulated deferred taxes.
    (x) The rate of return authorized for the utility for intrastate 
service. With its pleading, the utility shall file a copy of the latest 
decision of the state regulatory body or state court which establishes 
this authorized rate of return if the rate of return is at issue in the 
proceeding and shall note the section which specifically establishes 
this authorized rate and whether the decision is subject to further 
proceedings before the state regulatory body or a court. In the absence 
of a state authorized rate of return, the rate of return set by the 
Commission for local exchange carriers shall be used as a default rate 
of return;
    (xi) The average amount of usable space per pole for those poles 
used for pole attachments (13.5 feet may be in lieu of actual 
measurement, but may be rebutted);
    (xii) The average amount of unusable space per pole for those poles 
used for pole attachments (a 24 foot presumption may be used in lieu of

also specify any other information and argument relied upon to attempt 
to establish that a rate, term, or condition is not just and reasonable.
    (h) With respect to attachments within a duct or conduit system, 
where it is claimed that either a rate is unjust or unreasonable, or a 
term or condition is unjust or unreasonable and examination of such term 
or condition requires review of the associated rate, the complaint shall 
provide data and information in support of said claim.
    (1) The data and information shall include, where applicable:
    (i) The gross investment by the utility for conduit;
    (ii) The accumulated depreciation from the gross conduit investment;
    (iii) The system duct length or system conduit length and the method

this authorized rate and whether the decision is subject to further 
proceedings before the state regulatory body or a court. In the absence 
of a state authorized rate of return, the rate of return set by the 
Commission for local exchange carriers shall be used as a default rate 
of return; and
    (ix) Reimbursements received by utilities from CATV operators and 
telecommunications carriers for non-recurring costs.
    (2) Data and information should be based upon historical or original 
cost methodology, insofar as possible. Data should be derived from 
ARMIS, FERC 1, or other reports filed with state or federal regulatory 
agencies (identify

[[Page 307]]

source). Calculations made in connection with these figures should be 
provided to the complainant. The complainant shall also specify any 
other information and argument relied upon to attempt to establish that 
a rate, term, or condition is not just and reasonable.
    (i) With respect to rights-of-way, where it is claimed that either a 
rate is unjust or unreasonable, or a term or condition is unjust or 
unreasonable and examination of such term or condition requires review

required in paragraph (g), (h) or (i) of this section, as applicable, 
along with the supporting pages from its ARMIS, FERC Form 1, or other 
report to a regulatory body, within 30 days of the request by the cable 
television operator or telecommunications carrier. The cable television 
operator or telecommunications carrier, in turn, shall submit these 
pages with its complaint. If the utility did not supply these pages to 
the cable television operator or telecommunications carrier in response 
to the information request, the utility shall supply this information in 
its response to the complaint.
    (k) The complaint shall include a brief summary of all steps taken 
to resolve the problem prior to filing. If no such steps were taken, the 
complaint shall state the reason(s) why it believed such steps were 
fruitless.
    (l) Factual allegations shall be supported by affidavit of a person 
or persons with actual knowledge of the facts, and exhibits shall be 
verified by the person who prepares them.
    (m) In a case where a cable television system operator or 
telecommunications carrier claims that it has been denied access to a 
pole, duct, conduit or right-of-way despite a request made pursuant to 
section 47 U.S.C. Sec. 224(f), the complaint shall be filed within 30 
days of such denial. In addition to meeting the other requirements of 
this section, the complaint shall include the data and information 
necessary to support the claim, including:
    (1) The reasons given for the denial of access to the utility's 
poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way;
    (2) The basis for the complainant's claim that the denial of access 
is improper;
    (3) The remedy sought by the complainant;
    (4) A copy of the written request to the utility for access to its 
poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-way; and
    (5) A copy of the utility's response to the written request 
including all information given by the utility to support its denial of 
access. A complaint alleging improper denial of access will not be 
dismissed if the complainant is unable to obtain a utility's written 
response, or if the utility denies the complainant any other information 
needed to establish a prima facie case.

Sec. 1.1405  File numbers.

    Each complaint which appears to be essentially complete under 
Sec. 1.1404 will be accepted and assigned a file number. Such assignment 
is for administrative purposes only and does not necessarily mean that 
the complaint has been found to be in full compliance with other 
sections in this subpart. Petitions for temporary stay will also be 
assigned a file number upon receipt.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1406  Dismissal of complaints.

    (a) The complaint shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in any 
case where a suitable certificate has been filed by a State pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1414 of this subpart. Such certificate shall be conclusive proof 
of lack of jurisdiction of this Commission. A complaint against a 
utility shall also be dismissed if the utility does not use or control 
poles, ducts, or conduits used or designated, in whole or in part, for 
wire communication or if the utility does not meet the criteria of 
Sec. 1.1402(a) of this subpart.
    (b) If the complaint does not contain substantially all the 
information required under Sec. 1.1404 the Commission may dismiss the 
complaint or may require the complainant to file additional information. 
The complaint shall not be dismissed if the information is not available 
from public records or from the respondent utility after reasonable 
request.
    (c) Failure by the complainant to respond to official correspondence 
or a request for additional information will be cause for dismissal.
    (d) Dismissal under provisions of paragraph (b) of this section 
above will be with prejudice if the complaint has been dismissed 
previously. Such a complaint may be refiled no earlier than six months 
from the date it was so dismissed.

Sec. 1.1407  Response and reply.

    (a) Respondent shall have 30 days from the date the complaint was 
filed within which to file a response. Complainant shall have 20 days 
from the date the response was filed within which to file a reply. 
Extensions of time to file are not contemplated unless justification is 
shown pursuant to Sec. 1.46. Except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 1.1403, no other filings and no motions other than for extension of 
time will be considered unless authorized by the Commission. The 
response should set forth justification for the rate, term, or condition 
alleged in the complaint not to be just and reasonable. Factual 
allegations shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with 
actual knowledge of the facts and exhibits shall be verified by the 
person who prepares them. The response, reply, and other pleadings may 
be signed by counsel.
    (b) The response shall be served on the complainant and all parties 
listed in complainant's certificate of service.
    (c) The reply shall be served on the respondent and all parties 
listed in respondent's certificate of service.
    (d) Failure to respond may be deemed an admission of the material 
factual allegations contained in the complaint.

[44 FR 31650, June 1, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1408  Number of copies and form of pleadings.

    (a) An original and three copies of the complaint, response, and 
reply shall be filed with the Commission.
    (b) All papers filed in the complaint proceeding must be drawn in 
conformity with the requirements of Secs. 1.49, 1.50 and 1.52.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1409  Commission consideration of the complaint.

    (a) In its consideration of the complaint, response, and reply, the 
Commission may take notice of any information contained in publicly 
available filings made by the parties and may accept, subject to 
rebuttal, studies that

[[Page 309]]

have been conducted. The Commission may also request that one or more of 
the parties make additional filings or provide additional information. 
Where one of the parties has failed to provide information required to 
be provided by these rules or requested by the Commission, or where 
costs, values or amounts are disputed, the Commission may estimate such 
costs, values or amounts it considers reasonable, or may decide 
adversely to a party who has failed to supply requested information 
which is readily available to it, or both.
    (b) The complainant shall have the burden of establishing a prima 
facie case that the rate, term, or condition is not just and reasonable 
or that the denial of access violates 47 U.S.C. Sec. 224(f). If, 
however, a utility argues that the proposed rate is lower than its 
incremental costs, the utility has the burden of establishing that such 
rate is below the statutory minimum just and reasonable rate. In a case 
involving a denial of access, the utility shall have the burden of 
proving that the denial was lawful, once a prima facie case is 
established by the complainant.
    (c) The Commission shall determine whether the rate, term or 
condition complained of is just and reasonable. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, a rate is just and reasonable if it assures a utility the 
recovery of not less than the additional costs of providing pole 
attachments, nor more than an amount determined by multiplying the 
percentage of the total usable space, or the percentage of the total 
duct or conduit capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by 
the sum of the operating expenses and actual capital costs of the 
utility attributable to the entire pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.
    (d) The Commission shall deny the complaint if it determines that 
the complainant has not established a prima facie case, or that the 
rate, termor condition is just and reasonable, or that the denial of 
access was lawful.
    (e) When parties fail to resolve a dispute regarding charges for 
pole attachments and the Commission's complaint procedures under Section 
1.1404 are invoked, the Commission will apply the following formulas for 
determining a maximum just and reasonable rate:
    (1) The following formula shall apply to attachments to poles by 
cable operators providing cable services. This formula shall also apply 
to attachments to poles by any telecommunications carrier (to the extent 
such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment agreement) or cable 
operator providing telecommunications services until February 8, 2001:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.011

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.012

    (2) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section the following formula 
shall apply to attachments to poles by any telecommunications carrier 
(to the extent such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment 
agreement) or cable operator providing telecommunications services 
beginning February 8, 2001:

[[Page 310]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.013

    (3) The following formula shall apply to attachments to conduit by 
cable operators and telecommunications carriers:

    simplified as:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.015
    
    If no inner-duct is installed the fraction, ``1 Duct divided by the 
No. of Inner-Ducts'' is presumed to be \1/2\.
    (f) Paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall become effective February 
8, 2001 (i.e., five years after the effective date of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996). Any increase in the rates for pole 
attachments that results from the adoption of such regulations shall be 
phased in over a period of five years beginning on the effective date of 
such regulations in equal annual increments. The five-year phase-in is 
to apply to rate increases only. Rate reductions are to be implemented 
immediately. The determination of any rate increase shall be based on 
data currently available at the time of the calculation of the rate 
increase.

Sec. 1.1410  Remedies.

    If the Commission determines that the rate, term, or condition 
complained of is not just and reasonable, it may prescribe a just and 
reasonable rate, term, or condition and may:
    (a) Terminate the unjust and unreasonable rate, term, or condition;
    (b) Substitute in the pole attachment agreement the just and 
reasonable rate, term, or condition established by the Commission; and
    (c) Order a refund, or payment, if appropriate. The refund or 
payment will normally be the difference between the amount paid under 
the unjust and/or

[[Page 311]]

unreasonable rate, term, or condition and the amount that would have 
been paid under the rate, term, or condition established by the 
Commission from the date that the complaint, as acceptable, was filed, 
plus interest.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1411  Meetings and hearings.

    The Commission may decide each complaint upon the filings and 
information before it, may require one or more informal meetings with 
the parties to clarify the issues or to consider settlement of the 
dispute, or may, in its discretion, order evidentiary procedures upon 
any issues it finds to have been raised by the filings.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1412  Enforcement.

    If the respondent fails to obey any order imposed under this 
subpart, the Commission on its own motion or by motion of the 
complainant may order the respondent to show cause why it should not 
cease and desist from violating the Commission's order.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1413  Forfeiture.

    (a) If any person willfully fails to obey any order imposed under 
this subpart, or any Commission rule, or
    (b) If any person shall in any written response to Commission 
correspondence or inquiry or in any application, pleading, report, or 
any other written statement submitted to the Commission pursuant to this 
subpart make any misrepresentation bearing on any matter within the 
jurisdiction of the Commission, the Commission may, in addition to any 
other remedies, including criminal penalties under section 1001 of Title 
18 of the United States Code, impose a forfeiture pursuant to section 
503(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 503(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1414  State certification.

    (a) If the Commission does not receive certification from a state 
that:
    (1) It regulates rates, terms and conditions for pole attachments;
    (2) In so regulating such rates, terms and conditions, the state has 
the authority to consider and does consider the interests of the 
subscribers of cable television services as well as the interests of the 
consumers of the utility services; and,
    (3) It has issued and made effective rules and regulations 
implementing the state's regulatory authority over pole attachments 
(including a specific methodology for such regulation which has been 
made publicly available in the state), it will be rebuttably presumed 
that the state is not regulating pole attachments.
    (b) Upon receipt of such certification, the Commission shall give 
public notice. In addition, the Commission shall compile and publish 
from time to time, a listing of states which have provided 
certification.
    (c) Upon receipt of such certification, the Commission shall forward 
any pending case thereby affected to the state regulatory authority, 
shall so notify the parties involved and shall give public notice 
thereof.
    (d) Certification shall be by order of the state regulatory body or 
by a person having lawful delegated authorityunder provisions of state 
law to submit such certification. Said person shall provide in writing a 
statement that he or she has such authority and shall cite the law, 
regulation or other instrument conferring such authority.
    (e) Notwithstanding any such certification, jurisdiction will revert 
to this Commission with respect to any individual matter, unless the 
state takes final action on a complaint regarding such matter:
    (1) Within 180 days after the complaint is filed with the state, or
    (2) Within the applicable periods prescribed for such final action 
in such rules and regulations of the state, if the prescribed period 
does not extend beyond 360 days after the filing of such complaint.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1416  Imputation of rates; modification costs.

    (a) A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications 
services or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing such 
services (and charge any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate company 
engaged in the provision of such services) an equal amount to the pole 
attachment rate for which such company would be liable under this 
section.
    (b) The costs of modifying a facility shall be borne by all parties 
that obtain access to the facility as a result of the modification and 
by all parties that directly benefit from the modification. Each party 
described in the preceding sentence shall share proportionately in the 
cost of the modification. A party with a preexisting attachment to the 
modified facility shall be deemed to directly benefit from a 
modification if, after receiving notification of such modification as 
provided in subpart J of this part, it adds to or modifies its 
attachment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party with a preexisting 
attachment to a pole, conduit, duct or right-of-way shall not be 
required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its 
attachment if such rearrangement or replacement is necessitated solely 
as a result of an additional attachment or the modification of an 
existing attachment sought by another party. If a party makes an 
attachment to the facility after the completion of the modification, 
such party shall share proportionately in the cost of the modification 
if such modification rendered possible the added attachment.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1417  Allocation of Unusable Space Costs.

    (a) With respect to the formula referenced in Sec. 1.1409(e)(2), a 
utility shall apportion the cost of providing unusable space on a pole 
so that such apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing 
unusable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal 
apportionment of such costs among all attaching entities.
    (b) All attaching entities attached to the pole shall be counted for 
purposes of apportioning the cost of unusable space.
    (c) Utilities may use the following rebuttable presumptive averages 
when calculating the number of attaching entities with respect to the 
formula referenced in Sec. 1.1409(e)(2). For non-urbanized service areas 
(under 50,000 population), a presumptive average number of attaching 
entities of three (3). For urbanized service areas (50,000 or higher 
population), a presumptive average number of attaching entities of five 
(5). If any part of the utility's service area within the state has a 
designation of urbanized (50,000 or higher population) by the Bureau of 
Census, United States Department of Commerce, then all of that service 
area shall be designated as urbanized for purposes of determining the 
presumptive average number of attaching entities.
    (d) A utility may establish its own presumptive average number of 
attaching entities for its urbanized and non-urbanized service area as 
follows:
    (1) Each utility shall, upon request, provide all attaching entities 
and all entities seeking access the methodology and information upon 
which the utilities presumptive average number of attachers is based.
    (2) Each utility is required to exercise good faith in establishing 
and updating its presumptive average number of attachers.
    (3) The presumptive average number of attachers may be challenged by 
an attaching entity by submitting information demonstrating why the 
utility's presumptive average is incorrect. The attaching entity should 
also submit what it believes should be the presumptive average and the 
methodology used. Where a complete inspection is impractical, a 
statistically sound survey may be submitted.
    (4) Upon successful challenge of the existing presumptive average 
number of attachers, the resulting data determined shall be used by the 
utility as the presumptive number of attachers within the rate formula.

one (1) foot. The amount of usable space is presumed to be 13.5 feet. 
The amount of unusable space is presumed to be 24 feet. The pole height 
is presumed to be 37.5 feet. These presumptions may be rebutted by

    Authority: Sec. 203(a)(1), Pub. L. 96-481, 94 Stat. 2325 (5 U.S.C. 
504(c)(1)).

    Source: 47 FR 3786, Jan. 27, 1982, unless otherwise noted.

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1.1501  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the EAJA in 
this subpart), provides for the award of attorney's fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the 
Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over 
the Commission, unless the Commission's position in the proceeding was 
substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust, 
or when the demand of the Commission is substantially in excess of the 
decision in the adversary adjudication and is unreasonable when compared 
with such decision, under the facts and circumstances of the case, 
unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise 
acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. The 
rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the 
proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, 
and the proceduresand standards that the Commission will use to make 
them.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502  When the EAJA applies.

    The EAJA applies to any adversary adjudication pending or commenced 
before the Commission on or after August 5, 1985. The provisions of 
Sec. 1.1505(b) apply to any adversary adjudications commenced on or 
after March 29, 1996.

[61 FR 39898, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1503  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The EAJA applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the 
position of the Commission or any other agency of the United States, or 
any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other 
representative who enters an appearance and participates in the 
proceeding. Any proceeding in which this Agency may fix a lawful present 
or future rate is not covered by the EAJA. Proceedings to grant or renew 
licenses are also excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or 
revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise ``adversary 
adjudications''.
    (b) The Commission may designate a proceeding as an adversary 
adjudication for purposes of the EAJA by so stating in an order 
initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The 
Commission's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary 
adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party 
who believes the proceeding is covered by the EAJA; whether the 
proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in 
proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the EAJA and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any awards made will 
include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1504  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the EAJA, the applicant must be a party, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 
551(3), to

[[Page 314]]

the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The applicant 
must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this 
paragraph and in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable association as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 
employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees;
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million 
and not more than 500 employees;
    (6) For purposes of Sec. 1.1505(b), a small entity as defined in 5 
U.S.C. 601.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The number of employees of an applicant include all persons who 
regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
orother interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the Administrative Law Judge determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the EAJA in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
Administrative Law Judge may determine that financial relationships of 
the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1505  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing party may receive an award for fees and expenses 
incurred in connection either with an adversary adjudication, or with a 
significant and discrete substantive portion of an adversary 
adjudication in which the party has prevailed over the position of the 
Commission.
    (1) The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the 
position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the 
action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary 
adjudication is based.
    (2) An award will be reduced or denied if the Commission's position 
was substantially justified in law and fact, if special circumstances 
make an award unjust, or if the prevailing party unduly or unreasonably 
protracted the adversary adjudication.
    (b) If, in an adversary adjudication arising from a Commission 
action to enforce a party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory 
requirement, the demand of the Commission is substantially in excess of 
the decision in the adversary adjudication and is unreasonable when 
compared with that decision, under the facts and circumstances of the 
case, the party shall be awarded the fees and other expenses

[[Page 315]]

related to defending against the excessive demand, unless the party has 
committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or 
special circumstances make an award unjust. The ``demand'' of the 
Commission means the express demand which led to the adversary 
adjudication, but it does not include a recitation by the Commission of 
the maximum statutory penalty in the administrative complaint, or 
elsewhere when accompanied by an express demand for a lesser amount.
    (c) The burden of proof that an award should not be made is on the 
appropriate Bureau (see Sec. 1.21) whose representative shall be called 
``Bureau counsel'' in this subpart K.

[61 FR 39899, July 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1506  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00, or for adversary adjudications commenced on or after 
March 29, 1996, $125.00, per hour. No award to compensate an expert 
witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert 
witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of 
the attorney; agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, 
agent or witness ordinarily charges its clients separately for such 
expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the Administrative Law Judge shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the service 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, tothe extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter

Sec. 1.1507  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special 
circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to 
handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt 
regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher 
than $125.00 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered

this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for 
rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees, in accordance

the petitioner believes this agency should establish and the types of 
proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain 
fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. This agency will 
respond to the petition by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying 
the petition, or taking other appropriate action.

Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosue of the 
information would adversely affect the

[[Page 317]]

applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest.

be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the Administrative 
Law Judge finds that the information should not be withheld from 
disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. 
Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed 
of in accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the 
Freedom of Information Act, Secs. 0.441 through 0.466 of this chapter.

each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the 
rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The Administrative Law Judge may require the 
applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any 
expenses claimed.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1521  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading relating to an 
application shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding 
in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, except as 
provided in Sec. 1.1512(b) for confidential financial information.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1522  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application Bureau counsel 
may file an answer to the application. Unless Bureau counsel requests an 
extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate 
under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within 
the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award request.
    (b) If Bureau counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time

[[Page 318]]

for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions 
may be granted by the Administrative Law Judge upon request by Bureau 
counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of Bureau 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, Bureau counsel shall include 
with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 1.1526.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1523  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 1.1526.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1524  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and Bureau 
counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is 
served or an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not participate further in proceedings on the application 
unless the Administrative Law Judge determines that the public interest 
requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of 
matters raised in the comments.

    The applicant and Bureau counsel may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the 
underlying proceeding has been concluded. If a prevailing party and 
Bureau counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an 
application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the 
proposed settlement. If the Administrative Law Judge approves the 
proposed settlement, it shall be forwarded to the Commission for final 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1526  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis ofthe written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or Bureau counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the Administrative 
Law Judge may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, 
oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to issues other 
than excessive demand or substantial justification, an evidentiary 
hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for 
full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and 
shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position 
of the agency embodied an excessive demand or was substantially 
justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, 
as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees 
and other expenses are sought.
    (b) A request that the Administrative Law Judge order further 
proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the 
information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the 
additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1527  Decision.

regarding the applicant's eligibility and whether the applicant was a 
prevailing party or whether the demand by the agency or agencies in the 
proceeding was substantially in excess of, and was unreasonable when 
compared with, the decision in the adversary adjudication, and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at 
issue, findings on whether the Commission's position substantially 
justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the

[[Page 319]]

proceedings, committed a willful violation of law, or otherwise acted in 
bad faith, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the 
applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision 
shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the 
agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.

[61 FR 39900, July 31, 1996]


<R05>

the initial decision on the application, or the Commission may decide to 
review the decision on its own initiative, in accordance with 
Secs. 1.276 through 1.282 of this chapter. Except as provided in 
Sec. 1.1525, if neither the applicant nor Bureau counsel seeks review 
and the Commission does not take review on its own initiative, the 
initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the 
Commission 50 days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a 
matter within the discretion of the Commission. If review is taken, the 
Commission will issue a final decision on the application or remand the 
application to the Administrative Law Judge for further proceedings.

granting the award, accompanied by a statement that the applicant will 
not seek review of the decision in the United States courts, or a copy 
of the court's order directing payment. The Commission will pay the 
amount awarded to the applicant unless judicial review of the award or 
the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by

    (f) Multichannel Video and Cable Television Services (MVCTS). All 
services authorized or operated in accordance with part 76 of this 
title.
    (g) Receipt date. The date an electronic or paper application is 
received at the appropriate location at the Commission or the lock box 
bank. Major amendments to pending applications as defined in Sec. 78.109 
of this chapter, will result in the assignment of a new receipt date.
    (h) Signed. For manually filed applications only, an original hand-
written signature. For electronically filed applications only, an 
electronic signature. An electronic signature shall consist of the name 
of the applicant transmitted electronically via COALS and entered on the 
filing as a signature.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1704  Station files.

    Applications, notifications, correspondence, electronic filings and 
other material, and copies of authorizations, comprising technical, 
legal, and administrative data relating to each system in the 
Multichannel Video and Cable Television Services (MVCTS) and the Cable 
Television Relay Service (CARS) are maintained by the Commission in 
COALS and the Public Reference Room. These files constitute the official 
records for these stations and supersede any other records, database or 
lists from the Commission or other sources.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1705  Forms; electronic and manual filing.

    (a) Application forms. Operators in the Multichannel Video and Cable 
Television Services (MVCTS) and applicants and licensees the Cable 
Television Relay Service (CARS) shall use the following forms and 
associated schedules:
    (1) FCC Form 320, Basic Signal Leakage Performance Report. FCC Form 
320 is used by MVPDs to report compliance with the basic signal leakage 
performance criteria.
    (2) FCC Form 321, Aeronautical Frequency Notification. FCC Form 321 
is used by MVPDs to notify the Commission prior to operating channels in 
the aeronautical frequency bands.
    (3) FCC Form 322, Cable Community Registration. FCC Form 322 is used 
by cable system operators to commence operation for each community unit.

[[Page 323]]

    (4) FCC Form 324, Operator, Address, and Operational Information 
Changes. FCC Form 324 is used by cable operators to notify the 
Commission of changes in administrative data about the operator and 
operational status changes.
    (5) FCC Form 325, Cable Television System Report. FCC Form 325 is 
used by cable operators to report general information and signal and 
frequency distribution data.
    (6) FCC Form 327, Application for Cable Television Relay Service 
Station License. FCC Form 327 and associated schedules is used to apply 
for initial authorizations, modifications to existing authorizations, 
amendments to pending applications, and renewals of station 
authorizations. FCC Form 327 is also used to apply for Commission 
consent to assignments of existing CARS authorizations and to apply for 
Commission consent to the transfer of control of entities holding CARS 
authorizations.
    (b) Electronic filing. Six months after the Commission announces 
their availability for electronic filing, all applications and other 
filings using FCC Forms 320, 321, 322, 324, 325, and 327 and their 
respective associated schedules must be filed electronically in 
accordance with the electronic filing instructions provided by COALS.
    (1) There will be two ways for parties to electronically file 
applications with the Commission: batch and interactive.
    (i) Batch filing. Batch filing involves data transmission in a 
single action. Batch filers will follow a set Commission format for 
entering data. Batch filers will then send, via file transfer protocol, 
batches of data to the Commission for compiling. COALS will compile such 
filings overnight and respond the next business day with a return or 
dismissal of any defective filings. Thus, batch filers will not receive 
immediate correction from the system as they enter the information.
    (ii) Interactive filing. Interactive filing involves data 
transmission with screen-by-screen prompting from the Commission's COALS 
system. Interactive filers will receive prompts from the system 
identifying data entries outside the acceptable ranges of data for the 
individual fields at the time the data entry is made.
    (2) Attachments to applications must be uploaded along with the 
electronically filed application whenever possible.
    (3) Any associated documents submitted with an application must be 
uploaded as attachments to the application whenever possible. The 
attachment should be uploaded via COALS in Adobe Acrobat Portable 
Document Format (PDF) whenever possible.
    (c) Manual filing. (1) Forms 320, 321, 322, 324, 325, and 327 may be 
filed manually.
    (2) Manual filings must be submitted to the Commission at the 
appropriate address with the appropriate filing fee. The addresses for 
filing and the fee amounts for particular applications are listed in 
subpart G of this part, and in the appropriate fee filing guide for each 
service available from the Commission's Forms Distribution Center by 
calling 1-800-418-FORM (3676). The form may be downloaded from the 
Commission's Web site: http://www.fcc.gov.
    (3) Manual filings requiring fees as set forth at subpart G, of this 
part must be filed in accordance with Sec. 0.401(b) of this chapter.
    (4) Manual filings that do not require fees must be addressed and 
sent to the Media Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th 
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20554.
    (5) FCC forms may be reproduced and the copies used in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 0.409 of this chapter.
    (d) Applications requiring prior coordination. Parties filing 
applications that require frequency coordination shall, prior to filing, 
complete all applicable frequency coordination requirements in 
Sec. 78.36 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1706  Content of filings.

    (a) General. Filings must contain all information requested on the 
applicable form and any additional information required by the rules in 
this title and any rules pertaining to the specific service for which 
the filing is made.
    (b) Antenna locations. Applications for CARS stations and 
aeronautical frequency usage notifications must describe each 
transmitting antenna site or center of the cable system, respectively, 
by its geographical coordinates.

[[Page 324]]

Geographical coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds to the nearest tenth of a second of latitude and longitude. 
Submissions must provide such data using the NAD83 datum.
    (c) Antenna structure registration. Owners of certain antenna 
structures must notify the Federal Aviation Administration and register 
with the Commission as required by Part 17 of this chapter. Applications 
proposing the use of one or more new or existing antenna structures must 
contain the FCC Antenna Registration Number(s) of each structure for 
which registration is required. If registration is not required, the 
applicant must provide information in its application sufficient for the 
Commission to verify this fact.
    (d) Environmental concerns. Each applicant is required to indicate 
at the time its application is filed whether a Commission grant of the 
application may have a significant environmental effect, as defined by 
Sec. 1.1307. If yes, an Environmental Assessment, required by 
Sec. 1.1311, must be filed with the application and environmental review 
by the Commission must be completed prior to construction.
    (e) International coordination. Channel assignments and usage under 
part 78 are subject to the applicable provisions and requirements of 
treaties and other international agreements between the United States 
government and the governments of Canada and Mexico.
    (f) Taxpayer Identification Number (TINs). All filers are required 
to provide their Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINS) (as defined in 
26 U.S.C. 6109) to the Commission, pursuant to the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA). Under the DCIA, the FCC may use an 
applicant or licensee's TIN for purposes of collecting and reporting to 
the Department of the Treasury any delinquent amounts arising out of 
such person's relationship with the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1707  Acceptance of filings.

    Regardless of filing method, all submissions with an insufficient 
fee, grossly deficient or inaccurate information, or those without a 
valid signature will be dismissed immediately. For any submission that 
is found subsequently to have minimally deficient or inaccurate 
information, we will notify the filer of the defect. We will allow 15 
days from the date of this notification for correction or amendment of 
the submission if the amendment is minor. If the applicant files a 
timely corrected application, it will ordinarily be processed as a minor 
amendment in accordance with the Commission's rules. Thus it will have 
no effect on the initial filing date of the application or the 
applicant's filing priority. If, however, the amendment made by the 
applicant is not a simple correction, but constitutes a major amendment 
to the application, it will be governed by the rules and procedures 
applicable to major amendments, that is, it will be treated as a new 
application with a new filing date and new fees must be paid by the 
applicant. Finally, if the applicant fails to submit an amended 
application within the period specified in the notification, the 
application will be subject to dismissal for failure to prosecute.

    The Commission shall make available to employees, applicants, 
participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons information 
regarding the regulations set forth in this part, and their 
applicability to the programs or activities conducted by the Commission.

such manner as the Section 504 Officer finds necessary to apprise such 
persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by 
section 504.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1830  General prohibitions against discrimination.

    (a) No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of 
disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits 
of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the Commission.
    (b) Discriminatory actions prohibited.
    (1) The Commission, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may 
not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, 
on the basis of disability--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity 
to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is 
not equal to that afforded others;
    (iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, 
benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal 
opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to 
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with 
disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary 
to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, 
or services that are as effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
    (vi) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with a disability in the

others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
    (2) The Commission may not deny a qualified individual with a 
disability the opportunity to participate in any program or activity 
even where the Commission is also providing equivalent permissibly 
separate or different programs or activities for persons with 
disabilities.
    (3) The Commission may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration--
    (i) That have the purpose or effect of subjecting qualified 
individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of 
disability; or
    (ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with 
respect to individuals with disabilities.
    (4) The Commission may not, in determining the site or location of a 
facility, make selections--
    (i) That have the purpose or effect of excluding individuals with 
disabilities from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting 
them to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the 
Commission; or
    (ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity

not

[[Page 328]]

use criteria that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to 
discrimination on the basis of disability.
    (6) The Commission may not administer a licensing or certification 
program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with 
disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability, nor may the 
Commission establish requirements for the programs or activities of 
licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with 
disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. However, the 
programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the 
Commission are not, themselves, covered by this part.
    (7) The Commission shall make reasonable modifications in policies, 
practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid 
discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the Commission can 
demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the 
nature of the program, service, or activity.
    (c) This part does not prohibit the exclusion of persons without 
disabilities from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute 
or Executive order to individuals with disabilities, or the exclusion of 
a specific class of individuals with disabilities from a program limited 
by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of 
individuals with disabilities.
    (d) The Commission shall administer programs and activities in the 
most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified 
individuals with disabilities.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1840  Employment.

    No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of 
disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any 
program or activity conducted by the Commission. The definitions, 
requirements and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973, 29 U.S.C. 791, as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission in 29 CFR parts 1614 and 1630, as well as the procedures set 
forth in the Basic Negotiations Agreement Between the Federal 
Communications Commission and National Treasury Employees Union, as 
amended, and Subchapter III of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 
U.S.C. 7121(d), shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1849  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1850, no qualified 
individual with a disability shall, because the Commission's facilities 
are inaccessible to, or unusable, by individuals with disabilities, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted 
by the Commission.
    (b) Individuals shall request accessibility to the Commission's 
programs and facilities by contacting the Commission's Section 504 
Officer. Such contact may be made in the manner indicated in the FCC 
Section 504 Handbook. The Commission will make every effort to provide 
accommodations requiring the assistance of other persons (e.g., American 
Sign Language interpreters, communication access realtime translation 
(CART) providers, transcribers, captioners, and readers) if the request 
is made to the Commission's Section 504 Officer a minimum of five 
business days in advance of the program. If such requests are made fewer 
than five business days prior to an event, the Commission will make 
every effort to secure accommodation services, although it may be less 
likely that the Commission will be able to secure such services.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1850  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the 
Commission shall operate each program or activity so that the program or 
activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the Commission to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;
    (2) Require the Commission to take any action that it can 
demonstrate

[[Page 329]]

would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity, or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where Commission personnel believe that the proposed 
action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result 
in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Commission has the 
burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1.1850(a) would result in 
such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in 
such alteration or burdens must be made by the Managing Director, in 
consultation with the Section 504 Officer, after considering all 
Commission resources available for use in the funding and operation of 
the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written 
statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action 
would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission shall 
take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or 
such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with 
disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The Commission may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as the redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, or 
any other methods that result in making its programs or activities 
readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The 
Commission is not required to make structural changes in existing 
facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance 
with this section. The Commission, in making alterations to existing 
buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled 
by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-
4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available 
methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Commission 
shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities 
to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated 
setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The Commission shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within sixty (60) days of the 
effective date of this subpart, except that where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three (3) 
years of the effective date of this part.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
Commission shall develop, within six (6) months of the effective date of 
this subpart, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to 
complete such changes. The Commission shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or 
organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate 
in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both 
oral and written). A copy of the transitional plan shall be made 
available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the Commission's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with disabilities;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one (1) year, identify steps that will be taken 
during each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1851  Building accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Commission shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities. The definitions, requirements and 
standards of the Architectural Barriers Act, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, as 
established

[[Page 330]]

in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1870  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
disability in programs or activities conducted by the Commission.
    (b) The Commission shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1614 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29

[[Page 332]]

    (b) Claims arising out of acquisition contracts subject to the 
Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) shall be determined, collected, 
compromised, terminated, or settled in accordance with those 
regulations. (See 48 CFR part 32). If not otherwise provided for in the 
FAR system, contract claims that have been the subject of a contracting 
officer's final decision in accordance with section 6(a) of the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605(a)), may be determined, collected, 
compromised, terminated or settled under the provisions of this 
regulation, except that no additional review of the debt shall be 
granted beyond that provided by the contracting officer in accordance 
with the provisions of section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978

referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) as only the DOJ has 
authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection action on such 
claims.
    (d) Tax claims are also excluded from the coverage of this 
regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1903  Use of procedures.

    Procedures authorized by this regulation (including, but not limited 
to, disclosure to a consumer reporting agency, contracting for 
collection services, administrative offset and salary offset) may be 
used singly or in combination, so long as the requirements of applicable 
law and regulation are satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1904  Conformance to law and regulations.

    The requirements of applicable law (31 U.S.C. 3701-3719, as amended 
by Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749) have been implemented in government 
wide standards:
    (a) The Regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (5 CFR 
part 550) and
    (b) The Federal Claims Collection Standards issued jointly by the 
General Accounting Office and the Department of Justice (4 CFR parts 
101-105).

Not every item in the above described standards has been incorporated or 
referenced in this regulation. To the extent, however, that 
circumstances arise which are not covered by theterms stated in these 
regulations, the Commission will proceed in any actions taken in 
accordance with applicable requirements found in the standards referred 
to in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1905  Other procedures; collection of forfeiture penalties.

    Nothing contained in these regulations is intended to require the 
Commission to duplicate administrative or other proceedings required by 
contract or other laws or regulations, nor do these regulations 
supercede procedures required by other statutes or regulations. In 
particular, the assessment and collection of monetary forfeiture 
penalties imposed by the Commission will be governed initially by the 
procedures prescribed by 47 U.S.C. 503, 504 and 47 CFR 1.80. After 
compliance with those procedures, the Commission may determine that the 
collection of a monetary forfeiture under the collection alternatives 
prescribed by this subpart is appropriate but need not duplicate 
administrative or other proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1906  Informal action.

    Nothing contained in these regulations is intended to preclude 
utilization of informal administrative actions or remedies which may be 
available.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1907  Return of property.

    Nothing contained in this regulation is intended to deter the 
Commission from demanding the return of specific property or from 
demanding, in the alternative, either the return of property or the 
payment of its value.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1908  Omissions not a defense.

    The failure of the Commission to comply with any provision in this 
regulation shall not serve as a defense to the debt.

[[Page 333]]

  Administrative Offset--Consumer Reporting Agencies--Contracting for 
                               Collection


<R05>
Sec. 1.1911  Demand for payment.

    (a) Written demands for payment shall be made promptly upon a debtor 
in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to 
cooperate. A total of three progressively stronger written demands at 
not more than 30-day intervals will normally be made unless a response 
to the first or second demand indicates that a further demand would be 
futile and the debtor's response does not not require rebuttal. In 
determining the timing of demand letters, the Commission will give due 
regard to the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, if it 
becomes necessary to refer the debt to the Department of Justice for 
litigation, such referral can be made within one year of the agency's 
final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt. When 
necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent 
the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring), written 
demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this chapter, 
including immediate referral for litigation.
    (b) The initial demand letter will inform the debtor of:
    (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to 
request review within the agency;
    (2) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs (Secs. 1.1940 and 1.1941 of this subpart) and;
    (3) The date by which payment is to be made, which normally should 
not be more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter 
was mailed or hand-delivered.
    (c) As appropriate to the circumstances, the Commission may include 
either in the initial demand letter or in subsequent letters, matters 
relating to alternative methods of payment, policies with respect to use 
of consumer reporting agencies and collection services, the agency's 
intentions with respect to referral of the debt to the Department of 
Justice for litigation, and, depending on applicable statutory 
authority, the debtor's entitlement to consideration of waiver.
    (d) The Commission will respond promptly to communications from the 
debtor, within 30 days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who 
dispute the debt that they must furnish available evidence to support 
their contentions.
    (e) If, either prior to the initiation of, at any time during, or 
after completion of the demand cycle, the Commissiondetermines to pursue 
administrative offset, then the procedures specified in Secs. 1.1912 and 
1.1913 as applicable, will be followed. The availability of funds for 
offset and the agency's determination to pursue that remedy, release the 
agency from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b) 
and (c) of this section. If the agency has not already sent the first 
demand letter, the agency's written notification of its intent to offset 
must give the debtor the opportunity to make voluntary payment, a 
requirement which will be satisfied by compliance with the notice 
requirements of Secs. 1.1912 and 1.1913 as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1912  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) Collection by administrative offset will be undertaken in 
accordance with these regulations on all claims which are liquidated or 
certain in amount, in every instance in which such collection is 
determined to be feasible and not otherwise prohibited.
    (1) Whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a 
determination to be made by the agency on a case-by-case basis, in the 
exercise of sound discretion. The Commission will consider not only 
whether administrative offset can be accomplished practically, but also 
whether offset is best suited to further and protect all of the 
Government's interest. In appropriate circumstances, the Commission may 
give due consideration to the debtor's financial condition and is not 
required to use offset in every instance in which there is an available 
source of funds. The Commission may also consider whether offset would 
tend to substantially interfere with or defeat the purposes of the 
program authorizing the

[[Page 334]]

payments against which offset is contemplated. For example, under a 
grant program in which payments are made in advance of the grantee's 
performance, offset will normally be inappropriate. This concept 
generally does not apply, however, where payment is in the form of 
reimbursement.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Before the offset is made, a debtor shall be provided with the 
following: Written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, and the 
agency's intention to collect by offset; opportunity to inspect and copy 
agency records pertaining to the debt; opportunity to obtain review 
within the agency of the determination of indebtedness; and opportunity 
to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt.
    (1) The Commission will exercise sound judgment in determining 
whether to accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. The 
determination will weigh the Government's interest in collecting the 
debt against fairness to the debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the 
debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, the Commission will 
normally accept a repayment agreeement in lieu of offset only if the 
debtor is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial 
hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.
    (2) In cases where the procedural requirements specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section have previously been provided to the 
debtor in connection with the same debt under some other statutory or 
regulatory authority, such as pursuant to a notice of audit disallowance 
or pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 503, 504 and 47 CFR 1.80, the agency is not 
required to duplicate those requirements before taking administrative 
offset.
    (3) The Commission may not initiate administrative offset to collect 
a debt under 31 U.S.C. 3716 more than 10 years after the Government's 
right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the 
Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not 
reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the 
Government who were charged with the responsibility to discover and 
collect such debts. When the debt first accrued is to be determined 
according to existing law regarding the accrual of debts, such as under 
28 U.S.C. 2415.
    (4) The Commission is not authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716 to use 
administrative offset with respect to:
    (i) Debts owed by any State or local Government;
    (ii) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security 
Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United 
States; or
    (iii) Any case in which collection of the claim or type of claim by 
administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by 
another statute.
    (5) The Commission may effect administrative offset against a 
payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures 
required by paragraph (b) of this section if:
    (i) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the 
Government's ability to collect the debt, and
    (ii) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of those procedures.

Such prior offset must be promptly followed by the completion of those 
procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed 
to the Government shall be promptly refunded.
    (6) The Commission will obtain credit reports on delinquent accounts 
to identify opportunities for administrative offset of amounts due to a 
delinquent debtor when other collection techniques have been 
unsuccessful.
    (c) Type of hearing or review. (1) For purposes of this section, 
whenever the Commission is required to provide a hearing or review 
within the agency, it shall provide the debtor with a reasonable 
opportunity for an oral hearing when:
    (i) Any applicable statute authorizes or requires the agency to 
consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver 
of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of 
credibility or veracity; or
    (ii) The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the agency 
determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by 
review of

[[Page 335]]

the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt 
turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.

Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is 
not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing, although the 
Commission will carefully document all significant matters discussed at 
the hearing.
    (2) The section does not require an oral hearing with respect to 
debt collection systems in which determinations of indebtedness or 
waiver rarely involve issues of credibility or veracity and the agency 
has determined that review of the written record is ordinarily an 
adequate means to correct prior mistakes. In administering such a 
system, the agency is not required to sift through all of the requests 
received in order to accord oral hearings in those few cases which may 
involve issues of credibility or veracity.
    (3) In those cases where an oral hearing is not required by this 
section, the agency will make its determination on the request for 
waiver or reconsideration based upon a ``paper hearing,'' that is, a 
review of the written record.
    (d) Appropriate use will be made of the cooperative efforts of other 
agencies in affecting collection by administrative offset. Generally, 
the Commission will not refuse to comply with requests from other 
agencies to initiate administrative offset to collect debts owed to the 
United States unless the requesting agency has not complied with the 
applicable provisions of these standards or the offset otherwise 
contrary to law.
    (e) Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor 
against the United States shall be accomplished in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 3728.
    (f) Whenever the creditor agency is not the agency which is 
responsible for making the payment against which administrative offset 
is sought, the latter agency shall not initiate the requested offset 
until it has been provided by the creditor agency with an appropriate 
written certification that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) 
and full compliance with the provisions of this section has taken place.
    (g) When collecting multiple debts by administrative offset, the 
Commission will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance 
with the best interest of the United States, as determined by the facts 
and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to 
applicable statutes of limitation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1913  Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

    (a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Commission may request 
that moneys which are due and payable to adebtor from the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable 
amounts in order to collect in one full payment, or a minimal number of 
payments, debts owned to the United States by the debtor. Such requests 
shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel 
Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by 
the Director of that Office.
    (b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the Commission shall include written certification 
that:
    (1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount 
of the debt;
    (2) The Commission has complied with the applicable statutes, 
regulations and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and
    (3) The Commission has complied with the requirements of Sec. 1.1912 
of this subpart, including any required hearing or review.
    (c) Once the Commission decides to request administrative offset 
under paragraph (a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as 
practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that 
the Office of Personnel Management may identify and ``flag'' the 
debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or 
becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy 
any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the 
applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a 
claim for payments from the Fund, if at least a year has elapsed since 
the offset request was originally made, the debtor

[[Page 336]]

should be permitted to offer a satisfactory payment plan in lieu of 
offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances would 
render the offset unjust.
    (d) If the Commission collects part or all of the debt by other 
means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, it shall act promptly to modify or terminate its 
request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) This section does not require or authorize the Office of 
Personnel Management to review the merits of the Commission's 
determination with respect to the amount and validity of the debt, its 
determination as to waiver under an applicable statute, or its 
determination to provide or not provide an oral hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1914  Collection in installments.

    (a) Whenever feasible, and except as otherwise provided by law, 
debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs as required by this subpart should be collected in 
full in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected 
by administrative offset or by another method, including voluntary 
payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the 
indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular 
installments. The Commission will obtain financial statements from 
debtors who represent that they are unable to pay the debt in one lump 
sum. If the Commission agrees to accept payment in regular installments, 
it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor 
which specifies all of the terms of the agreement and which contains a 
provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The 
size and frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonable 
relation to the size of the debtor and debtor's ability to pay. If 
possible, the installment payments should be of sufficient size and 
frequency to liquidate the Government's claim in not more than 3 years. 
Installment payments of less than $50 per month will be accepted only if 
justifiable on the grounds of financial hardship or for some other 
reasonable cause.
    (b) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a 
voluntary installment is to be applied among those debts, that 
designation must be followed. If the debtor does not designate the 
application of the payment, the Commission will apply payments to 
various debts in accordance with the best interests of the United 
States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular 
case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1915  Exploration of compromise.

    The Commission may attempt to effect compromise, preferably during 
the course of personal interviews, in accordance with the standards set 
forth in Part 103 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 
103).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1916  Suspending or terminating collection action.

    The suspension or termination of collection action shall be made in 
accordance with the standards set forth in Part 104 of the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 104).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1917  Referrals to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office.

    Referrals to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting 
Office shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth in Part 
105 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 105).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1918  Use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) The term individual means a natural person, and the term 
consumer reporting agency has the meaning provided in the Federal Claims 
Collection Act, as amended, at 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3) or the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act, at 15 U.S.C. 168a(f).
    (b) The Commission may disclose to a consumer reporting agency, from 
a system of records, information that an individual is responsible for a 
claim if--
    (1) Notice required by section 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) indicates that 
information in the system may be disclosed to a consumer reporting 
agency;

[[Page 337]]

    (2) The claim has been reviewed and it is decided that the claim is 
valid and overdue;
    (3) The Commission has notified the individual in writing--
    (i) That payment of the claim is overdue;
    (ii) That, within not less than 60 days after sending the notice, 
the Commission intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency that 
the individual is responsible for that claim;
    (iii) Of the specific information to be disclosed to the consumer 
reporting agency; and
    (iv) Of the rights the individual has to a complete explanation of 
the claim, to dispute information in the records of the agency about the 
claim, and to adminstrative appeal or review of the claim; and
    (4) The individual has not--
    (i) Repaid or agreed to repay the claim under a written repayment 
plan that the individual has signed and the agency has agreed to; or
    (ii) Filed for review of the claim under paragraph (g) of this 
section;
    (c) The Commission shall--
    (1) Disclose promptly, to each consumer reporting agency to which 
the original disclosure was made, a substantial change in the condition 
or amount of the claim;
    (2) Verify or correct promptly information about the claim, on 
request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of any or all 
information so disclosed; and
    (3) Obtain satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting 
agency that they are complying with all laws of the United States 
relating to providing consumer credit information.
    (d) The Commission shall ensure that information disclosed to the 
consumer reporting agency is limited to--
    (1) Information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and
    (3) The agency or program under which the claim arose.
    (e) All accounts in excess of $100 that have been delinquent more 
than 31 days will normally be referred to a consumer reporting agency.
    (f) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency, 
the Commission shall take reasonable action to locate an individual for 
whom the head of the agency does not have a current address to send the 
notice.
    (g) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency, 
the Commission shall provide, on request of an individual alleged by the 
agency to be responsible for the claim, for a review of the obligation 
of the individual, including an opportunity for reconsideration of the 
initial decision on the claim.
    (h) Under the same provisions as described above, the Commission may 
disclose to a credit reporting agency, information relating to a debtor 
other than a natural person. Such commercial debt accounts are not 
covered by the Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1919  Contracting for collection services.

    (a) The Commission has authority to contract for collection services 
to recover delinquent debts, provided that the following conditions are 
satisfied:
    (1) The authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, suspend or 
terminate collection action, and refer the matter for litigation is 
retained by the agency;
    (2) The contractor shall be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as 
amended, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable 
Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection 
practices, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 
1692;
    (3) The contractor must be required to account strictly for all 
amounts collected;
    (4) The contractor must agree that uncollectible accounts shall be 
returned with appropriate documentation to enable the Commission to 
determine whether to pursue collection through litigation or to 
terminate collection efforts; and
    (5) The contractor must agree to provide any data contained in its 
files relating to paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of Sec. 105.2 of the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 105) upon

[[Page 338]]

returning an account to the Commission for subsequent referral to the 
Department of Justice for litigation.
    (b) Funding of collection service contracts. (1) The Commission may 
fund a collection service contract on a fixed-fee basis, that is, 
payment of a fixed fee determined without regard to the amount actually 
collected under the contract. Payment of the fee under this type of 
contract must be charged to available agency appropriations.
    (2) The Commission may also fund a collection service contract on a 
contingent-fee basis, that is, by including a provision in the contract 
permitting the contractor to deduct its fee from amounts collected under 
the contract. The fee should be based on a percentage of the amount 
collected, consistent with prevailing commercial practice.
    (3) The Commission may enter into a contract under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section only if and to the extent provided in advance 
appropriation acts or other legislation, except that this requirement 
does not apply to the use of a revolving fund authorized by statute.
    (4) Except as authorized under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or 
unless the receipt qualifies as a refund to the appropriation, or unless 
otherwise specifically provided by law, the Commission must deposit all 
amounts recovered under collection service contracts (or by agency 
employees on behalf of the agency) in the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3302.
    (c) The Commission will consider the use of collection agencies at 
any time after the account is 61 days past due. In any case where an 
account is six months or more past due, the Commission may turn it over 
to a collection agency unless referred for litigation or unless 
arrangements have been made for a workout procedure or the Commission 
has exercised its authority to write off the debt pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1916.
    (d) The Commission will generally not use a collection agency to 
collect a delinquent debt owed by a currently employed or retired 
Federal employee, if collection by salary or annuity offset is 
available.

                              Salary Offset


<R05>
Sec. 1.1925  Purpose.

    This section provides the standards to be followed by FCC in 
implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 to recover a debt from the pay account of an 
FCC employee, and establishes procedural guidelines to recover debts 
when the employee's creditor and paying agencies are not the same.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1926  Scope.

    (a) Coverage. This section applies to agencies and employees as 
defined by Sec. 1.1901.
    (b) Applicability. This section and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in 
recovering certaindebts by offset, except where the employee consents to 
the recovery, from the current pay account of that employee. Because it 
is an administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary 
offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and these regulations 
should be consistent with the provisions of the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101-105).
    (1) Excluded debts or claims. The procedures contained in this 
section do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or the tariff laws of the United 
States, or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is 
explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g. travel 
advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 
4108).
    (2) Waiver requests and claims to the General Accounting Office. 
This section does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of a 
salary overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 
716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by 
submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in 
accordance with procedures prescribed by the General Accounting Office. 
Similarly, in the case of other types of debts, it does not preclude an 
employee from requesting waiver, if waiver is available under any 
statutory provision pertaining to the particular debt being collected.

[[Page 339]]

    (c) Time Limit. Under 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3) offset may not be initiated 
more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt 
first accrued, unless an exception applies as stated in 
Sec. 102.3(b)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1927  Notification.

    (a) Salary offset deductions shall not be made unless the Managing 
Director of the Commission, or such other official as may be named in 
the future by the Managing Director of the Commission, provides the 
employee at least 30 days before any deduction written notice stating at 
a minimum:
    (1) The agency's determination that a debt is owed, including the 
origin, nature, and amount of the debt;
    (2) The agency's intention to collect the debt by means of deduction 
from the employee's current disposable pay account;
    (3) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of 
the intended deductions;
    (4) An explanation of the agency's policy concerning interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs (Secs. 1.1940 and 1.1941 of this 
regulation), a statement that such assessments must be made unless 
excused in accordance with the FCCS;
    (5) The employee's right to inspect and copy Government records 
relating to the debt or, if the employee or his or her representative 
cannot personally inspect the records, to request and receive a copy of 
such records.
    (6) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms 
agreeable to the agency) to establish a schedule for the voluntary 
repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish 
a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement 
must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Managing 
Director (or designee) of the Commission and documented in agency files 
(4 CFR 102.2(e)).
    (7) The employee's right to a hearing conducted by an official 
arranged by the agency (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, a 
hearing official not under the control of the head of the agency) if a 
petition is filed as prescribed by this subpart.
    (8) The method and time period for petitioning for a hearing;
    (9) That the timely filing of a petition for hearing will stay the 
commencement of collection proceedings;
    (10) That the final decision in the hearing (if one is requested) 
will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 
days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the 
employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the 
proceedings;
    (11) That any knowingly false, misleading, or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:
    (i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under Chapter 75 of Title 5, 
United States Code, part 752 of title 5, Codeof Federal Regulations, or 
any other applicable statutes or regulations.
    (ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act sections 3729-3731 of 
Title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory 
authority; or
    (iii) Criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 of 
Title 18, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory 
authority.
    (12) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under 
statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection 
is being made; and
    (13) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions 
to the contrary, that amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are 
later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly 
refunded to the employee.
    (b) Notifications under this section shall be hand delivered with a 
record made of the date of delivery, or shall be mailed by certified 
mail return receipt requested.
    (c) No notification, hearing, written responses or final decisions 
under this regulation are required by the Commission for any adjustment 
to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage, or change in 
coverage, under a Federal benefit program requiring periodic deductions 
from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay 
periods or less.

[[Page 340]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1928  Hearing.

    (a) Petition for Hearing. (1) A hearing may be requested by filing a 
written petition with the Managing Director of the Commission, or such 
other official as may be named by the Managing Director of the 
Commission, stating why the employee believes the determination of the 
agency concerning the existence or the amount of the debt is in error.
    (2) The employee's petition must be signed by the employee and fully 
identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence 
and witnesses, if any, which the employee believes support his or her 
position.
    (3) The petition must be filed no later than fifteen (15) calendar 
days from the date that the notification was hand delivered or the date 
of delivery by certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (4) If a petition is received after the fifteenth (15) calendar day 
deadline referred to above, the Commission will nevertheless accept the 
petition if the employee can show that the delay was due to 
circumstances beyond his or her control, or because of failure to 
receive notice of the time limit (unless otherwise aware of it).
    (5) If a petition is not filed within the time limit specified in 
paragraph (3) above, and is not accepted pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, the employee's right to hearing will be considered waived, 
and salary offset will be implemented by the Commission.
    (b) Type of Hearing. (1) The form and content of the hearing will be 
determined by the hearing official who shall be a person outside the 
control or authority of the Commission except that nothing herein shall 
be construed to prohibit the appointment of an administrative law judge 
by the Commission. In determining the type of hearing, the hearing 
officer will consider the nature and complexity of the transaction 
giving rise to the debt. The hearing may be conducted as an informal 
conference or interview, in which the agency and employee will be given 
a full opportunity to present their respective positions, or as a more 
formal proceeding involving the presentation of evidence, arguments and 
written submissions.
    (2) The employee may represent himself or herself, or may be 
represented by an attorney.
    (3) The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of the 
hearing.
    (4) The decision of the hearing officer shall be in writing, and 
shall state:
    (i) The facts purported to evidence the nature and origin of the 
alleged debt;
    (ii) The hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions, in 
the light of the hearing, as to--
    (A) The employee's and/or agency's grounds,
    (B) The amount and validity of the alleged debt, and,
    (C) The repayment schedule, if applicable.
    (5) The decision of the hearing official shall constitute the final 
administrative decision of the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1929  Deduction from pay.

    (a) Deduction by salary offset, from an employee's current 
disposable pay, shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Ordinarily, debts to the United States should be collected in 
full, in one lump sum. This will be done when funds are available for 
payment in one lump sum, or, if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 
percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, 
collection will normally be made in installments.
    (2) The installments shall not exceed 15 percent of the disposable 
pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in 
writing to the deduction of a greater amount.
    (3) Deduction will generally commence with the next full pay 
interval (ordinarily the next biweekly pay period) following the date: 
of the employee's written consent to salary offset, the waiver of 
hearing, or the decision issued by the hearing officer.
    (4) Installment deductions must be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment except as provided in 
Sec. 1.1930.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1930  Liquidation from final check or recovery from other payment.

    (a) If the employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment 
or period of

[[Page 341]]

active duty ends before collection of the debt is completed, offset of 
the entire remaining balance of the debt may be made from a final 
payment of any nature, including, but not limited, to, final salary 
payment or lump-sum leave due the employee as the date of separation, to 
such extent as is necessary to liquidate the debt.
    (b) If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from a final payment, 
offset may be made from later payments of any kind due from the United 
States, including, but not limited to, the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund, pursuant to Sec. 1.1913 of this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1931  Non-waiver of rights by payments.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be construed as a waiver 
of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any 
other provision of contract or law, unless statutory or contractual 
provisions provide to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1932  Refunds.

    (a) Refunds shall promptly be made when--
    (1) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing to the United 
States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
    (2) The employee's paying agency is directed by an administrative or 
judicial order to refund amounts deducted from his or her current pay.
    (b) Refunds do not bear interest unless required or permitted by law 
or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1933  Interest, penalties and administrative costs.

    The assessment of interest, penalties and administrative costs shall 
be in accordance with Secs. 1.1940 and 1.1941 of this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1934  Recovery when paying agency is not creditor agency.

    (a) Responsibilities of creditor agency. Upon completion of the 
procedures established under 5 U.S.C. 5514, the creditor agency must do 
the following:
    (1) The creditor agency must certify, in writing, that the employee 
owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which 
payment(s) is due, the date of the Government's right to collect the 
debt first accrued, and that the creditor agency's regulations 
implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by OPM.
    (2) If the collection must be made in installments, the creditor 
agency also must advise the paying agency of the number of installments 
to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencement 
date of the first installment (if a date other than the next officially 
established pay period is required).
    (3) Unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in 
writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required 
procedures, and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the 
paying agency, thecreditor agency also must advise the paying agency of 
the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) the 
action(s) was taken.
    (4) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the creditor 
agency must submit a debt claim containing the information specified in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section and an installment 
agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable 
to the employee's paying agency.
    (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor 
agency must submit its claim to the employee's paying agency for 
collection pursuant to Sec. 1.1930. The paying agency must certify the 
total amount of its collection and provide copies to the creditor agency 
and the employee as stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the 
paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from 
the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar 
payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible 
for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the 
amount) and that there has been full compliance with the provisions of 
this section. However, the

[[Page 342]]

creditor agency must submit a properly certified claim to the agency 
responsible for making such payments before collection can be made.
    (6) If the employee is already separated and all payments from his 
or her former paying agency have been paid, the creditor agency may 
request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the 
employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 
831.1801 et seq.), or other similar funds, be administratively offset to 
collect the debt. (31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR 102.4)
    (b) Responsibilities of paying agency-- (1) Complete claim. When the 
paying agency receives a properly certified debt claim from a creditor 
agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin prospectively at the 
next officials established pay interval. The employee must receive 
written notice that the paying agency has received a certified debt 
claim from the creditor agency (including the amount) and written notice 
of the date deductions from salary will commence and of the amount of 
such deductions.
    (2) Incomplete claim. When the paying agency receives an incomplete 
debt claim from a creditor agency, the paying agency must return the 
debt claim with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this 
subpart must be provided, and a properly certified debt claim received, 
before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay 
account.
    (3) Review. The paying agency is not required or authorized to 
review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to 
the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
    (c) Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another. (1) 
If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the 
employee's paying agency, the employee transfers to a position served by 
a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the 
paying agency from which the employee separates must certify the total 
amount of the collection made on the debt. One copy of the certification 
must be furnished to the employee, another to the creditor agency along 
with notice of employee's transfer. However, the creditor agency must 
submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before 
collection can be resumed.
    (2) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the 
creditor agency need not repeat the due process procedures described by 
5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. However, the 
creditor agency is responsible for reviewing the debt upon receiving the 
former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure 
the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1935  Obtaining the services of a hearing official.

    (a) When the debtor does not work for the creditor agency and the 
creditor agency cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before 
an administrative law judge or before a hearing official furnished 
pursuant to another lawful arrangement, the creditor agency may contact 
an agent of the paying agency designated in appendixA of 5 CFR part 581 
for a hearing official, and the paying agency must then cooperate as 
provided by 4 CFR 102.1 and provide a hearing official.
    (b) When the debtor works for the creditor agency, the creditor 
agency may contact any agent (of another agency) designated in appendix 
A of 5 CFR part 581 to arrange for a hearing official. Agencies must 
then cooperate as required by 4 CFR 102.1 and provide a hearing 
official.

      Interest, Penalties, Administrative Costs and Other Sanctions


<R05>
Sec. 1.1940  Assessment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, or 
Sec. 1.1941, the Commission shall assess interest, penalties and 
administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 3717. Before assessing these charges, the Commission will mail or 
hand-deliver a written notice to the debtor explaining the agency's 
requirements concerning these charges.
    (b) Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt 
and the interest requirements is first mailed or hand-delivered to the 
debtor,

[[Page 343]]

using the most current address that is available to the agency. If the 
Commission should use an ``advance billing'' procedure--that is, if it 
mails a bill before a debt is actually owed--it can include the required 
interest notification in the advance billing, but interest may not start 
to accrue before the debt is actually owed.
    (c) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current 
value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury Tax and 
loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the 
Treasury in the Federal Register and the Treasury Financial Manual 
Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. The 
Commission may assess a higher rate of interest if it reasonably 
determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of 
the United States. The rate of interest, as initially assessed, shall 
remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness except that where a 
debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a 
new agreement, the Commission may set a new interest rate which reflects 
the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement 
is executed. Interest will not be assessed on accrued interest, 
penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. However, if 
the debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges which 
accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement shall be 
added to the principal to be paid under a new repayment schedule.
    (d) The Commission shall assess against a debtor charges to cover 
administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt--that is, 
the additional costs incured in processing and handling the debt because 
it became delinquent. Calculation of administrative costs shall be based 
upon actual costs incurred or upon costs analyses establishing an 
average of actual additional costs incurred by the agency in processing 
and handling claims against other debtors in similar stages of 
delinquency. Administrative costs may include costs incurred in 
obtaining a credit report or in using a private debt collector, to the 
extent they are attributable to the delinquency.
    (e) The Commission shall assess a penalty charge, not to exceed 6 
percent a year, on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more 
than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st day of 
delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became 
delinquent.
    (f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts 
received by the agency shall be applied first to outstanding penalty and 
administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to 
the outstanding principal.
    (g) The Commission will waive the collection of interest on the debt 
or any portion of the debt which is paid within 30 days after the date 
on which interest began to accrue. It may extend this 30-day period, on 
a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines that such action is 
appropriate. Also, the Commission may waive, in whole or inpart, the 
collection of interest, penalties, and/or administrative costs assessed 
under this section under the criteria specified in part 103 of the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 103) relating to the 
compromise of claims (without regard to the amount of the debt), or if 
it determines that collection of these charges would be against equity 
and good conscience, or not in the best interest of the United States. 
Waiver under the first sentence of this paragraph (g) is mandatory. 
Under the second and third sentences, it may be exercised under 
appropriate circumstances. Examples of appropriate circumstances 
include:
    (1) Waiver of interest pending the agency's disposition of a request 
for reconsideration, administrative review, or waiver of the underlying 
debt under a permissive statute, and
    (2) Waiver of interest where the Commission has accepted an 
installment plan under Sec. 1.1914, and there is no indication of fault 
or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor.
    (h) Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and 
related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which 
collection action must be suspended under

[[Page 344]]

Sec. 104.2(c)(1) of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 
104).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1941  Exemptions.

    (a) The provisions concerning interest and penalty on claims 
contained in 31 U.S.C. 3717 do not apply:
    (1) To debts owed by any State or local government;
    (2) To debts arising under contracts which were executed prior to, 
and were in effect on (i.e., were not completed as of), October 25, 
1982;
    (3) To debts where an applicable statute, regulation required by 
statute, loan agreement, or contract either prohibits such charges or 
explicitly fixes the charges that apply to the debts arising under the 
Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff 
laws of the United States.
    (b) However, the Commission is authorized to assess interest and 
related charges on debts which are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the 
extent authorized under the common law or other applicable statutory 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1942  Other sanctions.

    The remedies and sanctions available to the Commission in this 
subpart are not exclusive. The Commission may impose other sanctions, 
where permitted by law, for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated 
failure of a debtor to pay such a claim. In such cases, the Commission 
will provide notice, as required by law, to the debtor prior to 
imposition of any such sanction.

              Cooperation With the Internal Revenue Service


<R05>
Sec. 1.1950  Reporting discharged debts to the Internal Revenue Service.

    When the Commission discharges a debt for less than the full value 
of the indebtedness, it will report the outstanding balance discharged, 
not including interest, to the Internal Revenue Service, using IRS Form 
1099-G or any other form prescribed by the Service, when:
    (a) The principal amount of the debt not in dispute is $600 or more; 
and
    (b) The obligation has not been discharged in a bankruptcy 
proceeding; and
    (c) The obligation is no longer collectible either because the time 
limit in the applicable statute for enforcing collection expired during 
the tax year, or because during the year a formal compromise agreement 
was reached in which the debtor was legally discharged of all or a 
portion of the obligation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1951  Offset against tax refunds.

    The Commission will take action to effect administrative offset 
against tax refunds due to debtors under 26 U.S.C. 6402, in accordance 
with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and Treasury Department 
regulations.

           General Provisions Concerning Interagency Requests


<R05>
Sec. 1.1952  Interagency requests.

    (a) Requests to the Commission by other Federal agencies for 
administrative or salary offset shall be in writing and forwarded to the 
Financial Operations Center, FCC, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20554.
    (b) Requests by the Commission to other Federal agencies holding 
funds payable to the debtor will be in writing and forwarded, certified 
return receipt, as specified by that agency in its regulations. If the 
agency's rules governing this matter are not readily available or 
identifiable, the request will be submitted to that agency's office of 
legal counsel with a request that it be processed in accordance with 
their internal procedures.
    (c) Requests to and from the Commission shall be accompanied by a

Sec. 1.2002  Applicants required to submit information.

    (a) In order to be eligible for any new, modified, and/or renewed 
instrument of authorization from the Commission, including but not 
limited to, authorizations issued pursuant to sections 214, 301, 302, 
303(1), 308, 310(d), 318, 319, 325(b), 351, 361(b), 362(b), 381, and 385 
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, by whatever name that 
instrument may be designated, all applicants shall certify that neither 
the applicant nor any party to the application is subject to a denial of 
Federal benefits that includes FCC benefits pursuant to section 5301 of 
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. 21 U.S.C. 862. If a section 5301 
certification has been incorporated into the FCC application form being 
filed, the applicant need not submit a separate certification. If a 
section 5301 certification has not been incorporated into the FCC 
application form being filed, the applicant shall be deemed to have 
certified by signing the application, unless an exhibit is included

explaining why the applicant is unable to certify. If no FCC application 
form is involved, the applicant must attach a certification to its 
written application. If the applicant is unable to so certify, the 
applicant shall be ineligible for the authorization for which it 
applied, and will have 90 days from the filing of the application to 
comply with this rule. If a section 5301 certification has been 
incorporated into the FCC application form, failure to respond to the 
question concerning certification shall result in dismissal of the 
application pursuant to the relevant processing rules.
    (b) A party to the application, as used in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall include:
    (1) If the applicant is an individual, that individual;
    (2) If the applicant is a corporation or unincorporated association, 
all officers, directors, or persons holding 5% or more of the 
outstanding stock or shares (voting and/or non-voting) of the applicant; 
and
    (3) If the applicant is a partnership, all non-limited partners and 
any limited partners holding a 5% or more interest in the partnership.
    (c) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are not

                           General Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 1.2101  Purpose.

exclusive applications for certain initial licenses.

[63 FR 2340, Jan. 15, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1.2102  Eligibility of applications for competitive bidding.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2103  Competitive bidding design options.

    (a) The Commission will choose from one or more of the following 
types of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to 
competitive bidding:
    (1) Simultaneous multiple-round auctions (using remote or on-site 
electronic bidding);
    (2) Sequential multiple round auctions (using either oral ascending 
or remote and/or on-site electronic bidding);
    (3) Sequential or simultaneous single-round auctions (using either 
sealed paper or remote and/or on-site electronic bidding); and
    (4) Combinatorial (package) bidding auctions.
    (b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow 
bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses or 
authorizations, in addition to bids on individual licenses or 
authorizations. The Commission may require that to be declared the high 
bid, a combinatorialbid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a 
specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be used with any type of 
auction. The Commission may also allow bidders to submit contingent bids 
on individual and/or combinations of licenses.
    (c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine 
bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the 
highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This 
technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction.
    (d) The Commission may use real time bidding in all electronic 
auction designs.

[59 FR 44293, Aug. 26, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 13542, Mar. 21, 1997; 
63 FR 2341, Jan. 15, 1998; 68 FR 42995, July 21, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1.2104  Competitive bidding mechanisms.

    (a) Sequencing. The Commission will establish the sequence in which 
multiple licenses will be auctioned.
    (b) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous 
multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the 
Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned 
simultaneously or in combination.
    (c) Reservation Price. The Commission may establish a reservation 
price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to 
auction will not be awarded.
    (d) Minimum Bid Increments, Minimum Opening Bids and Maximum Bid 
Increments. The Commission may, by announcement before or during an 
auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms. 
The Commission also may establish minimum opening bids and maximum bid 
increments on a service-specific basis.
    (e) Stopping Rules. The Commission may establish stopping rules 
before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate the 
auctions within a reasonable time.
    (f) Activity Rules. The Commission may establish activity rules 
which require a minimum amount of bidding activity.
    (g) Withdrawal, Default and Disqualification Payment. As specified 
below, when the Commission conducts an auction pursuant to Sec. 1.2103, 
the Commission will impose payments on bidders who withdraw high bids 
during the course of an auction, or who default on payments due after an 
auction closes or who are disqualified.
    (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder that 
withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction is subject to a 
withdrawal payment equal to the difference between the amount of the 
withdrawn bid and the amount

[[Page 349]]

of the winning bid in the same or subsequent auction(s). In the event 
that a bidding credit applies to any of the bids, the bid withdrawal 
payment is either the difference between the net withdrawn bid and the 
subsequent net winning bid, or the difference between the gross 
withdrawn bid and the subsequent gross winning bid, whichever is less. 
No withdrawal payment will be assessed for a withdrawn bid if either the 
subsequent winning bid or any of the intervening subsequent withdrawn 
bids equals or exceeds that withdrawn bid. The withdrawal payment amount 
is deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the 
withdrawing bidder has deposited with the Commission. In the case of 
multiple bid withdrawals on a single license, the payment for each bid 
withdrawal will be calculated based on the sequence of bid withdrawals 
and the amounts withdrawn in the same or subsequent auction(s). In the 
event that a license for which there have been withdrawn bids is not won 
in the same auction, those bidders for which a final withdrawal payment 
cannot be calculated will be assessed an interim bid withdrawal payment 
equal to 3 percent of the amount of their bid withdrawals. The 3 percent 
interim payment will be applied toward any final bid withdrawal payment 
that will be assessed at the close of the subsequent auction of the 
license.

    Example 1 to paragraph (g)(1): Bidder A withdraws a bid of $100. 
Subsequently, Bidder B places a bid of $90 and withdraws. In that same 
auction, Bidder C wins the license at a bid of $95. Withdrawal payments 
are assessed as follows: Bidder A owes $5 ($100-$95). Bidder B owes 
nothing.
    Example 2 to paragraph (g)(1): Bidder A withdraws a bid of $100. 
Subsequently, Bidder B places a bid of $95 and withdraws. In that same 
auction, Bidder C wins the license at a bid of $90. Withdrawal payments 
are assessed as follows: Bidder A owes $5 ($100-$95). Bidder B owes $5 
($95-$90).
    Example 3 to paragraph (g)(1): Bidder A withdraws a bid of $100. 
Subsequently, in that same auction, Bidder B places a bid of $90 and 
withdraws. In a subsequent auction, Bidder C places a bid of $95 and 
withdraws. Bidder D wins the license in that auction at a bid of $80. 
Withdrawal payments are assessed as follows: At the end of the first 
auction, Bidder A and Bidder B are each assessed an interim withdrawal 
payment equal to 3 percent of their withdrawn bids pending Commission 
assessment of a final withdrawal payment (Bidder A would owe 3% of $100, 
or $3, and Bidder B would owe 3% of $90, or $2.70). At the end of the 
second auction, Bidder A would owe $5 ($100-$95) less the $3 interim 
withdrawal payment for a total of $2. Because Bidder C placed a 
subsequent bid that was higher than Bidder B's $90 bid, Bidder B would 
owe nothing. Bidder C would owe $15 ($95-$80).

    (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. A bidder 
assumes a binding obligation to pay its full bid amount upon acceptance 
of the high bid at the close of an auction. If a high bidder defaults or 
is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting 
bidder will be subject to the payment in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section plus an additional payment equal to 3 percent of the subsequent 
winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting 
bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent payment will be calculated based on 
the defaulting bidder's bid amount. If either bid amount is subject to a 
bidding credit, the 3 percent credit will be calculated using the same 
bid amounts and basis (net or gross bids) as in the calculation of the 
payment in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Thus, for example, if gross 
bids are used to calculate the payment in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, the 3 percent will be applied to the gross amount of the 
subsequent winning bid, or the gross amount of the defaulting bid, 
whichever is less.
    (3) Default or disqualification in combinatorial bidding auctions 
after close of auction. A bidder assumes a binding obligation to pay its 
full bid amount upon acceptance of the high bid at the close of an 
auction. When the Commission conducts a combinatorial bidding auction 
pursuant to Sec. 1.2103 (a)(4), if a high bidder defaults or is 
disqualified after close of a combinatorial bidding auction, the 
defaulting bidder will be subject to a default payment. The default 
payment consists of a deficiency portion and an additional payment. The 
deficiency portion of the default payment shall be calculated as set 
forth in Sec. 1.2104(g)(3)(i). The additional payment shall be 
calculated as set forth in Sec. 1.2104(g)(3)(ii).
    (i) Deficiency payment. The deficiency portion of the default 
payment shall be

[[Page 350]]

calculated as set forth. In the case that any of the relevant bids are 
subject to bidding credits, the default payment will be adjusted in an 
analogous manner to that used in Sec. 1.2104(g)(1).
    (A) Where a defaulting bidder won licenses individually (i.e., not 
as part of a package), and in a subsequent auction the licenses are also 
won individually, the deficiency portion will be calculated on a 
license-by-license basis (i.e., the differences between the amounts 
originally bid and the amounts subsequently bid will not be aggregated 
to determine a net amount owed). If the subsequent winning bid(s) exceed 
the defaulted bid(s), no deficiency portion will be assessed. Even in 
the absence of a deficiency portion, however, an additional 25% payment 
will be due.
    (B) Where a defaulting bidder won licenses in a package(s), and in a 
subsequent auction the licenses are won either in the same package(s), 
or in smaller packages or as individual licenses that correlate to the 
defaulted package(s), the deficiency portion will be determined on a 
package-by-package basis, and the differences between the amount 
originally bid and the amount(s) subsequently bid will not be aggregated 
to determine a net amount owed. Thus, in this situation, the deficiency 
portion will be calculated in an analogous manner to that used in 
Sec. 1.2104(g)(2). However, with regard to each individual package, 
where the licenses are subsequently sold individually or as part of 
smaller packages, the amounts received in the subsequent auction will be 
aggregated in order to determine any deficiency.
    (C) Where a defaulting bidder or bidders won licenses either 
individually or as part of packages, and in a subsequent auction the 
licenses are won as larger packages or different packages (not including 
the situation described in paragraph (b) of this section), the 
deficiency portion will be calculated by subtracting the aggregate 
amount originally bid for the licenses from the aggregate amount bid in 
the subsequent auction for the licenses.
    (D) When in the situation described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, there are multiple defaulting bidders, the default payment 
(both the deficiency portion and the additional amount portion) will be 
allocated to the defaulting bidders in proportion to the amount they 
originally bid.

    Example: Bidder 1 defaults on Package ABC for $200, and Bidder 2 
defaults on Package DE for $400, and in a subsequent auction the 
licenses are won in Package AB for $150 and Package CDE for $350, Bidder 
1 would be liable for \1/3\ of the default payment and Bidder 2 would be 
responsible for \2/3\. The total default payment would be equal to the 
difference between the total of the original bids ($600) and the total 
of the subsequent amounts bid ($500) plus an additional amount of 25 
percent of the total of the subsequent amounts bid. The total default 
payment therefore would equal $100 ($600-$500) plus 25 percent of $500 
($125), for a total default payment of $225.

    (ii) Additional payment. If a high bidder defaults or is 
disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder 
will be subject to the payment in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section 
plus an additional payment equal to 25 percent of the subsequent winning 
bid(s) or the defaulting bid(s), whichever is less. In the case that 
either the subsequent winning bid(s) or the defaulting bid(s) is subject 
to bidding credits, the additional payment will be calculated in an 
analogous manner to that used in Sec. 1.2104(g)(2). In calculating the 
additional payment to determine whether the defaulted bid(s) or the 
subsequent winning bid(s) is the lesser amount, the defaulted and 
subsequent bid(s) will be compared according to the rules set forth in 
paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(A) through (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section for 
calculation of the deficiency portion of the default payment.
    (h) The Commission will generally release information concerning the 
identities of bidders before each auction but may choose, on an auction-
by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of the bidders associated 
with bidder identification numbers.
    (i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the 
event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, evidence of security 
breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any 
other reason that affects the fair and efficient conduct of the 
competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole 
discretion, to resume the competitive

[[Page 351]]

bidding starting from the beginning ofthe current or some previous round 
or cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.

of perjury, that the applicant is qualified as a designated entity under 
Sec. 1.2110.
    (v) Certification that the applicant is legally, technically, 
financially and otherwise qualified pursuant to section 308(b) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission will accept 
applications certifying that a request for waiver or other relief from 
the requirements of section 310 is pending;
    (vi) Certification that the applicant is in compliance with the 
foreign ownership provisions of section 310 of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended;
    (vii) Certification that the applicant is and will, during the 
pendency of its application(s), remain in compliance with any service-
specific qualifications applicable to the licenses on which the 
applicant intends to bid including, but not limited to, financial 
qualifications. The Commission may require certification in certain 
services that the applicant will, following grant of a license, come 
into compliance with certain service-specific rules, including, but not 
limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;
    (viii) An exhibit, certified as truthful under penalty of perjury, 
identifying all parties with whom the applicant has entered into 
partnerships, joint ventures, consortia or other agreements, 
arrangements or understandings of any kind relating to the licenses 
being auctioned, including any such agreements relating to the post-
auction market structure.
    (ix) Certification under penalty of perjury that it has not entered 
and will not enter into any explicit or implicit agreements, 
arrangements or understandings of any kind with any parties other than 
those identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii) regarding the amount 
of their bids, bidding strategies or the particular licenses on which 
they will or will not bid.
    (x) Certification that the applicant is not in default on any 
Commission licenses and that it is not delinquent on any non-tax debt 
owed to any Federal agency.

[[Page 352]]

    (xi) An attached statement made under penalty of perjury indicating 
whether or not the applicant has ever been in default on any Commission 
license or has ever been delinquent on any non-tax debt owed to any 
Federal agency.

    Note to paragraph (a):
    The Commission may also request applicants to submit additional 
information for informational purposes to aid in its preparation of 
required reports to Congress.

    (b) Modification and Dismissal of Short-Form Application (FCC Form 
175). (1) Any short-form application (FCC Form 175) that does not 
contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this section is 
unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected subsequent to the 
applicable filing deadline. The application will be dismissed with 
prejudice and the upfront payment, if paid, will be returned.
    (2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to 
cure defects specified herein (except for failure to sign the 
application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected 
application. During the resubmission period for curing defects, a short-
form application may be amended or modified to cure defects identified 
by the Commission or to make minor amendments or modifications. After 
the resubmission period has ended, a short-form application may be 
amended or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the 
application. Major amendments cannot be made to a short-form application 
after the initial filing deadline. Major amendments include changes in 
ownership of the applicant that would constitute an assignment or 
transfer of control, changes in an applicant's size which would affect 
eligibility for designated entity provisions, and changes in the license 
service areas identified on the short-form application on which the 
applicant intends to bid. Minor amendments include, but are not limited 
to, the correction of typographical errors and other minor defects not 
identified as major. An application will be considered to be newly filed 
if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after 
applicable filing deadlines.
    (3) Applicants who fail to correct defects in their applications in 
a timely manner as specified by public notice will have their 
applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission.
    (c) Prohibition of collusion. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs 
(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section, after the short-form 
application filing deadline, all applicants for licenses in any of the 
same geographic license areas are prohibited from cooperating or 
collaborating with respect to, discussing with each other, or disclosing 
to each other in any manner the substance of their own, or each other's, 
or any other competing applicants' bids or bidding strategies, or 
discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, until after the down 
payment deadline, unless such applicants are members of a bidding 
consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's 
short-form application pursuant to Sec. 1.2105(a)(2)(viii).
    (2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect 
formation of consortia or changes in ownership at any time before or 
during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in 
control of the applicant, and provided that the parties forming 
consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for 
licenses in any of the same geographic license areas. Such changes will 
not be considered major modifications of the application.
    (3) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make 
agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided the parties to the 
agreement have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic 
license areas.
    (4) After the filing of short-form applications, a holder of a non-
controlling attributable interest in an entity submitting a short-form 
application may acquire an ownership interest in, form a consortium 
with, or enter into a joint bidding arrangement with, other applicants 
for licenses in the same geographic license area, provided that:
    (i) The attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission 
that it has not communicated and will not communicate with any party 
concerning the bids or bidding strategies of more than one of the 
applicants in which it

[[Page 353]]

holds an attributable interest, or with which it has a consortium or 
joint bidding arrangement, and which have applied for licenses in the 
same geographic license area(s); and
    (ii) The arrangements do not result in any change in control of an 
applicant; or
    (iii) When an applicant has withdrawn from the auction, is no longer 
placing bids and has no further eligibility, a holder of a non-
controlling, attributable interest in such an applicant may obtain an 
ownership interest in or enter into a consortium with another applicant 
for a license in the same geographic service area, provided that the 
attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission that it did not 
communicate with the new applicant prior to the date that the original 
applicant withdrew from the auction.
    (5) Applicants must modify their short-form applications to reflect 
any changes in ownership or in membership of consortia or joint bidding 
arrangements.
    (6) Any applicant that makes or receives a communication of bids or 
bidding strategies prohibited under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall report such communication in writing to the Commission 
immediately, and in no case later than five business days after the 
communication occurs. Such reports shall be filed with the Office of the 
Secretary, and a copy shall be sent to the Chief of the Auctions and 
Industry Analysis Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.
    (7) For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) The term applicant shall include all controlling interests in 
the entity submitting a short-form application to participate in an 
auction (FCC Form 175), as well as all holders of partnership and other 
ownership interests and any stock interest amounting to 10 percent or 
more of the entity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of 
the entity submitting a short-form application, and all officers and 
directors of that entity; and
    (ii) The term bids or bidding strategies shall include capital calls 
or requests for additional funds in support of bids or bidding 
strategies.

    Example: Company A is an applicant in area 1. Company B and Company 
C each own 10 percent of Company A. Company D is an applicant in area 1, 
area 2, and area 3. Company C is an applicant in area 3. Without 
violating the Commission's Rules, Company B can enter into a consortium 
arrangement with Company D or acquire an ownership interest in Company D 
if Company B certifies either (1) that it has communicated with and will 
communicate neither with Company A or anyone else concerning Company A's 
bids or bidding strategy, nor with Company C or anyone else concerning 
Company C's bids or bidding strategy, or (2) that it has not 
communicated with and will not communicate with Company D or anyone else 
concerning Company D's bids or bidding strategy.

Sec. 1.2106  Submission of upfront payments.

    (a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to 
competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment. In that event, the 
amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will 
be set forth in a Public Notice. Any auction applicant that has 
previously been in default on any Commission license or has previously 
been delinquent on any non-tax debt owed to any Federal agency must 
submit an upfront payment equal to 50 percent more than that set for 
each particular license. No interest will be paid on upfront payments.
    (b) Upfront payments must be made by wire transfer in U.S. dollars 
from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal 
Communications Commission.
    (c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's 
Rules, or if insufficient funds are tendered to constitute a valid 
upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to 
correct its submission to bring it up to the minimum valid upfront 
payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least 
the minimum upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its 
application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made will 
be returned.
    (d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any 
down

[[Page 354]]

payment required for licenses on which the bidder is the high bidder. 
Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of a 
winning bidder, the Commission may refund the excess amount after 
determining that no bid withdrawal penalties are owed by that bidder.
    (e) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d), in the event 
a penalty is assessed pursuant to Sec. 1.2104 for bid withdrawal or 
default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the 
Commission will be used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or default penalty 
before being applied toward any additional payment obligations that the 
high bidder may have.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2107  Submission of down payment and filing of long-form applications.

    (a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify 
the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified by public notice, within ten (10) 
business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a 
particular license(s), a high bidder must submit to the Commission's 
lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are 
necessary to bring its total deposits (not including upfront payments 
applied to satisfy bid withdrawal or default payments) up to twenty (20) 
percent of its high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions 
conducted under Sec. 1.2103, however, bidders may be required to submit 
their down payments with their bids.) Unless otherwise specified by 
public notice, this down payment must be made by wire transfer in U.S. 
dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the 
Federal Communications Commission. Down payments will be held by the 
Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the license and has 
paid the remaining balance due on the license or authorization, in which 
case it will not be returned, or until the winning bidder is found 
unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which case it will be 
returned, less applicable payments. No interest on any down payment will 
be paid to the bidders.
    (c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a 
timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after being notified 
that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-
form application'') pursuant to the rules governing the service in which 
the applicant is the high bidder. Notwithstanding any other provision in 
title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, high 
bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with their 
long-form applications. Specific procedures for filing applications will 
be set out by Public Notice. Ownership disclosure requirements are set 
forth in Sec. 1.2112. Beginning January 1, 1999, all long-form 
applications must be filed electronically. An applicant that fails to 
submit the required long-form application under this paragraph and fails 
to establish good cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed 
to have defaulted and will be subject to the payments set forth in 
Sec. 1.2104.
    (d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must 
provide a detailed explanation of the terms and conditions and parties 
involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other 
agreement or arrangement it had entered into relating to the competitive 
bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements 
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form 
applications pursuant to Sec. 1.2105.
    (e) A winning bidder that seeks a bidding credit to serve a 
qualifying tribal land, as defined in Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(i), within a 
particular market must indicate on the long-form application (FCC Form 
601) that it intends to serve a qualifying tribal land within that 
market.
    (f) An applicant must also submit FCC Form 602 (see Sec. 1.919 of 
this chapter) with its long form application (FCC Form 601).

Sec. 1.2108  Procedures for filing petitions to deny against long-form applications.

    (a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act 
or the commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific procedures 
for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the 
Commission's Rules, the procedures in this section shall apply to the 
filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning 
bidders.
    (b) Within a period specified by Public Notice and after the 
Commission by Public Notice announces that long-form applications have 
been accepted for filing, petitions to deny such applications may be 
filed. The period for filing petitions to deny shall be no more than ten 
(10) days. The appropriate licensing Bureau, within its discretion, may, 
in exigent circumstances, reduce this period of time to no less than 
five (5) days. Any such petitions must contain allegations of fact 
supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge 
thereof.
    (c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and 
the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations of fact or 
denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons 
with personal knowledge thereof. The time for filing such oppositions 
shall be at least five (5) days from the filing date for petitions to 
deny, and the time for filing replies shall be at least five (5) days 
from the filing date for oppositions. The Commission may grant a license 
based on any long-form application that has been accepted for filing. 
The Commission shall in no case grant licenses earlier than seven (7) 
days following issuance of a public notice announcing long-form 
applications have been accepted for filing.
    (d) If the Commission determines that:
    (1) An applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and 
material issue of fact concerning that determination, it will grant the 
application.
    (2) An applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial 
issue of fact concerning that determination, the Commission need not 
hold a evidentiary hearing and will deny the application.
    (3) Substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it 
will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit all or part of the 
evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other 
than administrative law judges to preside at the taking of written 
evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2109  License grant, denial, default, and disqualification.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified by public notice, auction winners are 
required to pay the balance of their winning bids in a lump sum within 
ten (10) business days following the release of a public notice 
establishing the payment deadline. If a winning bidder fails to pay the 
balance of its winning bids in a lump sum by the applicable deadline as 
specified by the Commission, it will be allowed to make payment within 
ten (10) business days after the payment deadline, provided that it also 
pays a late fee equal to five percent of the amount due. When a winning 
bidder fails to pay the balance of its winning bid by the late payment 
deadline, it is considered to be in default on its license(s) and 
subject to the applicable default payments. Licenses will be awarded 
upon the full and timely payment of winning bids and any applicable late 
fees.
    (b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has 
declared competitive bidding closed or fails to remit the required down 
payment within ten (10) business days after the Commission has declared 
competitive bidding closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, 
its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the default 
payment specified in Secs. 1.2104(g)(2) or 1.2104(g)(3), whichever is 
applicable. In such event, the Commission, at its discretion, may either 
re-auction the license(s) to existing or new applicants or offer it to 
the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. If 
the license(s) is offered to the other highest bidders (in descending 
order), the down payment

[[Page 356]]

obligations set forth in Sec. 1.2107(b) will apply. However, in 
combinatorial bidding auctions, the Commission will only re-auction the 
license(s) to existing or new applicants. The Commission will not offer 
the package or licenses to the next highest bidder.
    (c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, 
fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely manner, or 
defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the 
required down payment, will be deemed to have defaulted, its application 
will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the payment set forth in 
Secs. 1.2104(g)(2) or 1.2104(g)(3), whichever is applicable. In such 
event, the Commission may either re-auction the license(s) to existing 
or new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in 
descending order) at their final bids. However, in combinatorial bidding 
auctions, the Commission will only re-auction the license(s) to existing 
or new applicants. The Commission will not offer the package or licenses 
to the next highest bidder.
    (d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the 
Commission's rules in connection with their participation in the 
competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other 
applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of their upfront payment, down 
payment or full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in 
future auctions.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2110  Designated entities.

    (a) Designated entities are small businesses, businesses owned by 
members of minority groups and/or women, and rural telephone companies.
    (b) Eligibility for small business and entrepreneur provisions.(1) 
Size attribution. (i) The gross revenues of the applicant (or licensee), 
its affiliates, its controlling interests, and the affiliates of the 
applicant's controlling interests shall be attributed to the applicant 
and considered on a cumulative basis and aggregated for purposes of 
determining whether the applicant (or licensee) is eligible for status 
as a small business, very small business, or entrepreneur, as those 
terms are defined in the service-specific rules. An applicant seeking 
status as a small business, very small business, or entrepreneur, as 
those terms are defined in the service-specific rules, must disclose on 
its short- and long-form applications, separately and in the aggregate, 
the gross revenues of the applicant (or licensee), its affiliates, its 
controlling interests, and the affiliates of the applicant's controlling 
interests for each of the previous three years.
    (ii) If applicable, pursuant to Sec. 24.709 of this chapter, the 
total assets of the applicant (or licensee), its affiliates, its 
controlling interests and affiliates of the applicant's controlling 
interests shall be attributed to the applicant and considered on a 
cumulative basis and aggregated for purposes of determining whether the 
applicant (or licensee) is eligible for status as an entrepreneur. An 
applicant seeking status as an entrepreneur must disclose on its short- 
and long-form applications, separately and in the aggregate, the gross 
revenues of the applicant (or licensee), its affiliates, its controlling 
interests and affiliates of the applicant's controlling interests for 
each of the previous two years.
    (2) Aggregation of affiliate interests. Persons or entities that 
hold interests in an applicant (or licensee) that are affiliates of each 
other or have an identity of interests identified in 
Sec. 1.2110(c)(5)(iii) will be treated as though they were one person or 
entity and their ownership interests aggregated for purposes of 
determining an applicant's (or licensee's) compliance with the 
requirements of this section.

    Example 1 to paragraph (b)(2): ABC Corp. is owned by individuals, A, 
B and C, each having an equal one-third voting interest in ABC Corp. A 
and B together, with two-thirds of the stock have the power to control 
ABC Corp. and have an identity of interest. If A&B invest in DE Corp., a 
broadband PCS applicant for block C, A and B's separate interests in DE 
Corp. must be aggregated because A and B are to be treated as one person 
or entity.
    Example 2 to paragraph (b)(2): ABC Corp. has subsidiary BC Corp., of 
which it holds a controlling 51 percent of the stock. If ABC Corp. and 
BC Corp., both invest in DE Corp., their separate interests in DE Corp. 
must be aggregated because ABC Corp. and BC Corp. are affiliates of each 
other.


[[Page 357]]


    (3) Exceptions. (i) Consortium. Where an applicant (or licensee) is 
a consortium of small businesses, very small businesses, or 
entrepreneurs, as those terms are defined in the service-specific rules, 
the gross revenues of each consortium member shall not be aggregated. 
Each consortium member must constitute a separate and distinct legal 
entity to qualify.
    (ii) Applicants without identifiable controlling interests. Where an 
applicant (or licensee) cannot identify controlling interests under the 
standards set forth in this section, the gross revenues of all interest 
holders in the applicant, and their affiliates, will be attributable.
    (iii) Rural telephone cooperatives. (A) An applicant will be exempt 
from Sec. 1.2110(c)(2)(ii)(F) for the purpose of attribution in 
Sec. 1.2110(b)(1), if the applicant or a controlling interest in the 
applicant, as the case may be, meets all of the following conditions:
    (1) the applicant (or the controlling interest) is organized as a 
cooperative pursuant to state law;
    (2) the applicant (or the controlling interest) is a ``rural 
telephone company'' as defined by the Communications Act; and
    (3) the applicant (or the controlling interest) is eligible for tax-
exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code. The applicant will not be 
exempt from Sec. 1.2110(c)(2)(ii)(F) for the purpose of attribution in 
Sec. 1.2110(b)(1) if the gross revenues or other financial and 
management resources of the affiliates of the applicant's officers and 
directors (or the controlling interest's officers and directors) are 
available to the applicant.
    (B) However, if the applicant is not an eligible rural telephone 
cooperative under paragraph (a) of this section, and the applicant has a 
controlling interest other than the applicant's officers and directors 
or an eligible rural telephone cooperative's officers and directors, 
paragraph (a) of this section applies with respect to the applicant's 
officers and directors and such controlling interest's officers and 
directors only when such controlling interest is either:
    (1) An eligible rural telephone cooperative under paragraph (a) of 
this section or
    (2) controlled by an eligible rural telephone cooperative under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Definitions--(1) Small businesses. The Commission will establish 
the definition of a small business on a service-specific basis, taking 
into consideration the characteristics and capital requirements of the 
particular service.
    (2) Controlling interests. (i) For purposes of this section, 
controlling interest includes individuals or entities with either de 
jure or de facto control of the applicant. De jure control is evidenced 
by holdings of greater than 50 percent of the voting stock of a 
corporation, or in the case of a partnership, general partnership 
interests. De facto control is determined on a case-by-case basis. An 
entity must disclose its equity interest and demonstrate at least the 
following indicia of control to establish that it retains de facto 
control of the applicant:
    (A) The entity constitutes or appoints more than 50 percent of the 
board of directors or management committee;
    (B) The entity has authority to appoint, promote, demote, and fire 
senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the 
licensee; and
    (C) The entity plays an integral role in management decisions.
    (ii) Calculation of certain interests.
    (A) Fully diluted requirement. (1) Except as set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, ownership interests shall be 
calculated on a fully diluted basis; all agreements such as warrants, 
stock options and convertible debentures will generally be treated as if 
the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised.
    (2) Rights of first refusal and put options shall not be calculated 
on a fully diluted basis for purposes of determining de jure control; 
however, rights of first refusal and put options shall be calculated on 
a fully diluted basis if such ownership interests, in combination with 
other terms to an agreement, deprive an otherwise qualified applicant or 
licensee of de facto control.

    Note to Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A):
    Mutually exclusive contingent ownership interests,

[[Page 358]]

i.e., one or more ownership interests that, by their terms, are mutually 
exclusive of one or more other ownership interests, shall be calculated 
as having been fully exercised only in the possible combinations in 
which they can be exercised by their holder(s). A contingent ownership 
interest is mutually exclusive of another only if contractual language 
specifies that both interests cannot be held simultaneously as present 
ownership interests.

    (B) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock shall be 
attributed as specified.
    (C) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person 
who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person who has 
the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right 
to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the 
trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business relationship 
to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests held in trust.
    (D) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity.
    (E) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (F) Officers and directors of the applicant shall be considered to 
have a controlling interest in the applicant. The officers and directors 
of an entity that controls a licensee or applicant shall be considered 
to have a controlling interest in the licensee or applicant. The 
personal net worth, including personal income of the officers and 
directors of an applicant, is not attributed to the applicant. To the 
extent that the officers and directors of an applicant are affiliates of 
other entities, the gross revenues of the other entities are attributed 
to the applicant.
    (G) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (H) Any person who manages the operations of an applicant or 
licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have 
a controlling interest in such applicant or licensee if such person, or 
its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in 
practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence:
    (1) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (2) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (3) The prices charged for such services.
    (I) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangement with an applicant or licensee, or its affiliate, shall be 
considered to have a controlling interest, if such applicant or 
licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence:
    (1) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (2) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (3) The prices charged for such services.
    (3) Businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women. 
Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific services, a 
business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in 
which minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens control the 
applicant, have at least greater than 50 percent equity ownership and, 
in the case of a corporate applicant, have a greater than 50 percent 
voting interest. For applicants that are partnerships, every general 
partner must be either a minority and/or woman (or minorities and/or 
women) who are U.S. citizens and who individually or together own at 
least 50 percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 
percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women who are U.S. 
citizens. The interests of minorities

[[Page 359]]

and women are to be calculated on a fully diluted basis; agreements such 
as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have 
a present effect on the power to control an entity and shall be treated 
as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. However, 
upon a demonstration that options or conversion rights held by non-
controlling principals will not deprive the minority and female 
principals of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair 
their rights to control the designated entity, a designated entity may 
seek a waiver of the requirement that the equity of the minority and 
female principals must be calculated on a fully-diluted basis. The term 
minority includes individuals of Black or African American, Hispanic or 
Latino, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or 
Pacific Islander extraction.
    (4) Rural telephone companies. A rural telephone company is any 
local exchange carrier operating entity to the extent that such entity--
    (i) Provides common carrier service to any local exchange carrier 
study area that does not include either:
    (A) Any incorporated place of 10,000 inhabitants or more, or any 
part thereof, based on the most recently available population statistics 
of the Bureau of the Census, or
    (B) Any territory, incorporated or unincorporated, included in an 
urbanized area, as defined by the Bureau of the Census as of August 10, 
1993;
    (ii) Provides telephone exchange service, including exchange access, 
to fewer than 50,000 access lines;
    (iii) Provides telephone exchange service to any local exchange 
carrier study area with fewer than 100,000 access lines; or
    (iv) Has less than 15 percent of its access lines in communities of 
more than 50,000 on the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act 
of 1996.
    (5) Affiliate. (i) An individual or entity is an affiliate of an 
applicant or of a person holding an attributable interest in an 
applicant if such individual or entity--
    (A) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the 
applicant, or
    (B) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or
    (C) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or parties 
that also controls or has the power to control the applicant, or
    (D) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
    (ii) Nature of control in determining affiliation.
    (A) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties 
who directly or indirectly control or have the power to control it. 
Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it 
is exercised so long as the power to control exists.

    Example. An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of 
another concern would have negative power to control such concern since 
such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the 
bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder with less than 50 
percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken by the other 
stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation exists when the applicant 
has the power to control a concern while at the same time another 
person, or persons, are in control of the concern at the will of the 
party or parties with the power to control.

    (B) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of 
director, officer or key employee positions; contractual or other 
business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key 
employee is an employee who, because of his/her position in the concern, 
has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations 
or management of the concern.
    (C) Control can arise through management positions where a concern's 
voting stock is so widely distributed that no effective control can be 
established.

    Example. In a corporation where the officers and directors own 
various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's 
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give 
him or her control or the power to control and the remaining 60 percent 
is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock 
interest greater than 10 percent, management has the power to control. 
If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons 
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be 
deemed an affiliate of the applicant.


[[Page 360]]


    (iii) Identity of interest between and among persons.Affiliation can 
arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of interest, 
such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. 
In determining if the applicant controls or has the power to control a 
concern, persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though 
they were one person.

    Example. Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable 
interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder has 
enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have 
the power to control Corporation Y. The two shareholders with these 
common investments (or identity in interest) are treated as though they 
are one person and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the 
applicant.

    (A) Spousal affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control 
or have the power to control interests owned or controlled by either of 
them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a 
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. In calculating 
their net worth, investors who are legally separated must include their 
share of interests in property held jointly with a spouse.
    (B) Kinship affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed 
to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or 
controlled by other immediate family members. In this context 
``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-
in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother 
or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half brother or sister. This 
presumption may be rebutted by showing that the family members are 
estranged, the family ties are remote, or the family members are not 
closely involved with each other in business matters.

    Example. A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-
in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application. Because A 
and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in 
Corporation Y is attributable to B, and thus to the applicant, unless B 
rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

    (iv) Affiliation through stock ownership. (A) An applicant is 
presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she 
owns or controls or has the power to control 50 percent or more of its 
voting stock.
    (B) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control 
a concern even though he or she owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block 
of stock he or she owns, controls or has the power to control is large 
as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
    (C) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, such 
minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the 
aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other 
stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons 
individually controls or has the power to control the concern; however, 
such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power 
to control, in fact, does not exist.
    (v) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge. Except as set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are 
generally considered to have a present effect on the power to control 
the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, 
debentures, and agreements are generally treated as though the rights 
held thereunder had been exercised. However, an affiliate cannot use 
such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over 
another concern before it actually does so.

    Example 1 to paragraph (c)(5)(v).  If company B holds an option to 
purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable 
interest in a PCS application, the situation is treated as though 
company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling 
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken 
into account in determining the size of the applicant.

[[Page 361]]

    Example 2. If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 
outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an 
attributable interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, 
SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo, BigCo 
will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, 
until SmallCo actually exercises its option to purchase such shares. In 
order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which 
requires such options to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the 
option is not considered to have present effect in this case.
    Example 3. If company A has entered into an agreement to merge with 
company B in the future, the situation is treated as though the merger 
has taken place.

    Note to Paragraph (c)(5)(v):
    Mutually exclusive contingent ownership interests, i.e., one or more 
ownership interests that, by their terms, are mutually exclusive of one 
or more other ownership interests, shall be calculated as having been 
fully exercised only in the possible combinations in which they can be 
exercised by their holder(s). A contingent ownership interest is 
mutually exclusive of another only if contractual language specifies 
that both interests cannot be held simultaneously as present ownership 
interests.

    (vi) Affiliation under voting trusts. (A) Stock interests held in 
trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the 
power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell 
such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at 
will or to replace the trustee at will.
    (B) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (C) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, 
is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of voting stock 
for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern 
in order that such concern or another concern may meet the Commission's 
size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this 
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the 
appropriate jurisdiction.
    (vii) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally 
arises where officers, directors, or key employees serve as the majority 
or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or 
the management of another entity.
    (viii) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally 
arises where one concern shares office space and/or employees and/or 
other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns 
are in the same or related industry or field of operations, or where 
such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing 
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other 
concern.
    (ix) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation 
generally arises where one concern is dependent upon another concern for 
contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or 
potential control, of the other concern.
    (x) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements. (A) A joint 
venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns 
and/or individuals, with interests in any degree or proportion, formed 
by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, 
specific business venture for joint profit for which purpose they 
combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but not on 
a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The 
determination whether an entity is a joint venture is based upon the 
facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business 
operation may be designated by the parties involved. An agreement to 
share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the 
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the 
business operation is a joint venture.
    (B) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated 
with each other. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to define 
a small business consortium, for purposes of determining status as a 
designated entity, as a joint venture under attribution standards 
provided in this section.
    (xi) Exclusion from affiliation coverage. For purposes of this 
section, Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations 
organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 
1601 et seq.), or entities owned

[[Page 362]]

and controlled by such tribes or corporations, are not considered 
affiliates of an applicant (or licensee) that is owned and controlled by 
such tribes, corporations or entities, and that otherwise complies with 
the requirements of this section, except that gross revenues derived 
from gaming activities conducted by affiliate entities pursuant to the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) will be counted in 
determining such applicant's (or licensee's) compliance with the 
financial requirements of this section, unless such applicant 
establishes that it will not receive a substantial unfair competitive 
advantage because significant legal constraints restrict the applicant's 
ability to access such gross revenues.
    (6) Consortium. A consortium of small businesses, very small 
businesses, or entrepreneurs is a conglomerate organization composed of 
two or more entities, each of which individually satisfies the 
definition of a small business, very small business, or entrepreneur, as 
those terms are defined in the service-specific rules. Each individual 
member must constitute a separate and distinct legal entity to qualify.
    (d) The Commission may set aside specific licenses for which only 
eligible designated entities, as specified by the Commission, may bid.
    (e) The Commission may permit partitioning of service areas in 
particular services for eligible designated entities.
    (f) Bidding credits. (1) The Commission may award bidding credits 
(i.e., payment discounts) to eligible designated entities. Competitive 
bidding rules applicable to individual services will specify the 
designated entities eligible for bidding credits, the licenses for which 
bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other 
procedures.
    (2) Size of bidding credits. A winning bidder that qualifies as a 
small business or a consortium of small businesses may use the following 
bidding credits corresponding to their respective average gross revenues 
for the preceding 3 years:
    (i) Businesses with average gross revenues for the preceding years, 
3 years not exceeding $3 million are eligible for bidding credits of 35 
percent;
    (ii) Businesses with average gross revenues for the preceding years, 
3 years not exceeding $15 million are eligible for bidding credits of 25 
percent; and
    (iii) Businesses with average gross revenues for the preceding 
years, 3 years not exceeding $40 million are eligible for bidding 
credits of 15 percent.
    (3) Bidding credit for serving qualifying tribal land. A winning 
bidder for a market will be eligible to receive a bidding credit for 
serving a qualifying tribal land within that market, provided that it 
complies with Sec. 1.2107(e). The following definition, terms, and 
conditions shall apply for the purposes of this section and 
Sec. 1.2107(e):
    (i) Qualifying tribal land means any federally recognized Indian 
tribe's reservation, Pueblo, or Colony, including former reservations in 
Oklahoma, Alaska Native regions established pursuant to the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), and Indian allotments, that 
has a wireline telephone subscription rate equal to or less than seventy 
(70) percent based on the most recently available U.S. Census Data.
    (ii) Certification. (A) Within 180 days after the filing deadline 
for long-form applications, the winning bidder must amend its long-form 
application and attach a certification from the tribal government 
stating the following:
    (1) The tribal government authorizes the winning bidder to site 
facilities and provide service on its tribal land;
    (2) The tribal area to be served by the winning bidder constitutes 
qualifying tribal land; and
    (3) The tribal government has not and will not enter into an 
exclusive contract with the applicant precluding entry by other 
carriers, and will not unreasonably discriminate among wireless carriers 
seeking to provide service on the qualifying tribal land.
    (B) In addition, within 180 days after the filing deadline for long-
form applications, the winning bidder must amend its long-form 
application and file a certification that it will comply with the 
construction requirements set

[[Page 363]]

forth in paragraph (f)(3)(vi) of this section and consult with the 
tribal government regarding the siting of facilities and deployment of 
service on the tribal land.
    (C) If the winning bidder fails to submit the required 
certifications within the 180-day period, the bidding credit will not be 
awarded, and the winning bidder must pay the balance on the original 
gross bid amount.
    (iii) Bidding credit formula. Subject to the applicable bidding 
credit limit set forth in Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iv), the bidding credit 
shall equal three hundred thousand (300,000) dollars for the first two 
hundred (200) square miles (518 square kilometers) of qualifying tribal 
land, and fifteen hundred (1500) dollars for each additional square mile 
(2.590 square kilometers) of qualifying tribal land above two hundred 
(200) square miles (518 square kilometers).
    (iv) Bidding credit limit. If the high bid is equal to or less than 
one million (1,000,000) dollars, the maximum bidding credit calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iii) shall not exceed fifty (50) percent 
of the high bid. If the high bid is greater than one million (1,000,000) 
dollars, but equal to or less than two million (2,000,000) dollars, the 
maximum bidding credit calculated pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iii) 
shall not exceed five hundred thousand (500,000) dollars. If the high 
bid is greater than two million (2,000,000) dollars, the maximum bidding 
credit calculated pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(f)(3)(iii) shall not exceed 
twenty-five (25) percent of the high bid.
    (v) Application of credit. The bidding credit amount, if approved by 
the Commission, will be subtracted from the final net bid amount. The 
bidding credit will not affect calculation of the down payment.
    (vi) Post-construction certification. Within fifteen (15) days of 
the third anniversary of the initial grant of its license, a recipient 
of a bidding credit under this section shall file a certification that 
the recipient has constructed and is operating a system capable of 
serving seventy-five (75) percent of the population of the qualifying 
tribal land for which the credit was awarded. The recipient must provide 
the total population of the tribal area covered by its license as well 
as the number of persons that it is serving in the tribal area.
    (vii) Performance penalties. If a recipient of a bidding credit 
under this section fails to provide the post-construction certification 
required by paragraph (f)(3)(vi) of this section, then it shall repay 
the bidding credit amount in its entirety, plus interest. The interest 
will be based on the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations 
applicable on the date the license is granted. Such payment shall be 
made within thirty (30) days of the third anniversary of the initial 
grant of its license. Failure to repay the bidding credit amount and 
interest within the required time period will result in automatic 
termination of the license without specific Commission action.
    (g) Installment payments. The Commission may permit small businesses 
(including small businesses owned by women, minorities, or rural 
telephone companies that qualify as small businesses) and other entities 
determined to be eligible on a service-specific basis, which are high 
bidders for licenses specified by the Commission, to pay the full amount 
of their high bids in installments over the term of their licenses 
pursuant to the following:
    (1) Unless otherwise specified by public notice, each eligible 
applicant paying for its license(s) on an installment basis must deposit 
by wire transfer in the manner specified in Sec. 1.2107(b) sufficient 
additional funds as are necessary to bring its total deposits to ten 
(10) percent of its winning bid(s) within ten (10) days after the 
Commission has declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. 
Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay 
a default payment pursuant to Sec. 1.2104(g)(2).
    (2) Within ten (10) days of the conditional grant of the license 
application of a winning bidder eligible for installment payments, the 
licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby 
commencing the eligible licensee's installment payment plan. If a 
winning bidder eligible for installment payments fails to submit this 
additional ten (10) percent of its high bid by the applicable deadline 
as specified by the Commission, it will be allowed to make payment 
within ten (10) business

[[Page 364]]

days after the payment deadline, provided that it also pays a late fee 
equal to five percent of the amount due. When a winning bidder eligible 
for installment payments fails to submit this additional ten (10) 
percent of its winning bid, plus the late fee, by the late payment 
deadline, it is considered to be in default on its license(s) and 
subject to the applicable default payments. Licenses will be awarded 
upon the full and timely payment of second down payments and any 
applicable late fees.
    (3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each 
eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment plan and that 
it must execute a promissory note and security agreement as a condition 
of the installment payment plan. Unless other terms are specified in the 
rules of particular services, such plans will:
    (i) Impose interest based on the rate of U.S. Treasury obligations 
(with maturities closest to the duration of the license term) at the 
time of licensing;
    (ii) Allow installment payments for the full license term;
    (iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two years; and
    (iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining term of the 
license.
    (4) A license granted to an eligible entity that elects installment 
payments shall be conditioned upon the full and timely performance of 
the licensee's payment obligations under the installment plan.
    (i) Any licensee that fails to submit its quarterly payment on an 
installment payment obligation (the ``Required Installment Payment'') 
may submit such payment on or before the last day of the next quarter 
(the ``first additional quarter'') without being considered delinquent. 
Any licensee making its Required Installment Payment during this period 
(the ``first additional quarter grace period'') will be assessed a late 
payment fee equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of the past due 
Required Installment Payment. The late payment fee applies to the total 
Required Installment Payment regardless of whether the licensee 
submitted a portion of its Required Installment Payment in a timely 
manner.
    (ii) If any licensee fails to make the Required Installment Payment 
on or before the last day of the first additional quarter set forth in 
paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, the licensee may submit its 
Required Installment Payment on or before the last day of the next 
quarter (the ``second additional quarter''), except that no such 
additional time will be provided for the July 31, 1998 suspension 
interest and installment payments from C or F block licensees that are 
not made within 90 days of the payment resumption date for those 
licensees, as explained in Amendment of the Commission's Rules Regarding 
Installment Payment Financing for Personal Communications Services (PCS) 
Licensees, Order on Reconsideration of the Second Report and Order, WT 
Docket No. 97-82, 13 FCC Rcd 8345 (1998). Any licensee making the 
Required Installment Payment during the second additional quarter (the 
``second additional quarter grace period'') will be assessed a late 
payment fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the past due 
Required Installment Payment. Licensees shall not be required to submit 
any form of request in order to take advantage of the first and second 
additional quarter grace periods.
    (iii) All licensees that avail themselves of these grace periods 
must pay the associated late payment fee(s) and the Required Installment 
Payment prior to the conclusion of the applicable additional quarter 
grace period(s). Payments made at the close of any grace period(s) will 
first be applied to satisfy any lender advances as required under each 
licensee's ``Note and Security Agreement,'' with the remainder of such 
payments applied in the following order: late payment fees, interest 
charges, installment payments for the most back-due quarterly 
installment payment.
    (iv) If an eligible entity obligated to make installment payments 
fails to pay the total Required Installment Payment, interest and any 
late payment fees associated with the Required Installment Payment 
within two quarters (6 months) of the Required Installment Payment due 
date, it shall be in default, its license shall automatically cancel, 
and it will be subject to debt

[[Page 365]]

collection procedures. A licensee in the PCS C or F blocks shall be in 
default, its license shall automatically cancel, and it will be subject 
to debt collection procedures, if the payment due on the payment 
resumption date, referenced in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section, is 
more than ninety (90) days delinquent.
    (h) The Commission may establish different upfront payment 
requirements for categories of designated entities in competitive 
bidding rules of particular auctionable services.
    (i) The Commission may offer designated entities a combination of 
the available preferences or additional preferences.
    (j) Designated entities must describe on their long-form 
applications how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility for 
designated entity status, and must list and summarize on their long-form 
applications all agreements that affect designated entity status such as 
partnership agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements 
and other agreements, including oral agreements, establishing, as 
applicable, de facto or de jure control of the entity. Such information 
must be maintained at the licensees' facilities or by their designated 
agents for the term of the license in order to enable the Commission to 
audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.
    (k) The Commission may, on a service-specific basis, permit 
consortia, each member of which individually meets the eligibility 
requirements, to qualify for any designated entity provisions.
    (l) The Commission may, on a service-specific basis, permit 
publicly-traded companies that are owned by members of minority groups 
or women to qualify for any designated entity provisions.
    (m) Audits. (1) Applicants and licensees claiming eligibility shall 
be subject to audits by the Commission, using in-house and contract 
resources. Selection for audit may be random, on information, or on the 
basis of other factors.
    (2) Consent to such audits is part of the certification included in 
the short-form application (FCC Form 175). Such consent shall include 
consent to the audit of the applicant's or licensee's books, documents 
and other material (including accounting procedures and practices) 
regardless of form or type, sufficient to confirm that such applicant's 
or licensee's representations are, and remain, accurate. Such consent 
shall include inspection at all reasonable times of the facilities, or 
parts thereof, engaged in providing and transacting business, or keeping 
records regarding FCC-licensed service and shall also include consent to 
the interview of principals, employees, customers and suppliers of the 
applicant or licensee.
    (n) Gross revenues. Gross revenues shall mean all income received by 
an entity, whether earned or passive, before any deductions are made for 
costs of doing business (e.g., cost of goods sold), as evidenced by 
audited financial statements for the relevant number of most recently 
completed calendar years or, if audited financial statements were not 
prepared on a calendar-year basis, for the most recently completed 
fiscal years preceding the filing of the applicant's short-form (FCC 
Form 175). If an entity was not in existence for all or part of the 
relevant period, gross revenues shall be evidenced by the audited 
financial statements of the entity's predecessor-in-interest or, if 
there is no identifiable predecessor-in-interest, unaudited financial 
statements certified by the applicant as accurate. When an applicant 
does not otherwise use audited financial statements, its gross revenues 
may be certified by its chief financial officer or its equivalent and 
must be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles.
    (o) Total assets. Total assets shall mean the book value (except 
where generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require market 
valuation) of all property owned by an entity, whether real or personal, 
tangible or intangible, as evidenced by the most recently audited 
financial statements

[[Page 366]]

Sec. 1.2111  Assignment or transfer of control: unjust enrichment.

    (a) Reporting requirement. An applicant seeking approval for a 
transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the 
Commission's Rules) of a license within three years of receiving a new 
license through a competitive bidding procedure must, together with its 
application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the 
Commission's statement indicating that its license was obtained through 
competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission 
the associated contracts for sale, option agreements, management 
agreements, or other documents disclosing the local consideration that 
the applicant would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of 
its license (see Sec. 1.948 of this chapter). This information should 
include not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, 
contingent, in-kind, or other consideration (e.g., management or 
consulting contracts either with or without an option to purchase; below 
market financing).
    (b) Unjust enrichment payment: set-aside. As specified in this 
paragraph an applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or 
assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a 
license acquired by the transferor or assignor pursuant to a set-aside 
for eligible designated entities under Sec. 1.2110(c), or who proposes 
to take any other action relating to ownership or control that will 
result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek 
Commission approval and may be required to make an unjust enrichment 
payment (Payment) to the Commission by cashier's check or wire transfer 
before consent will be granted. The Payment will be based upon a 
schedule that will take account of the term of the license, any 
applicable construction benchmarks, and the estimated value of the set-
aside benefit, which will be calculated as the difference between the 
amount paid by the designated entity for the license and the value of 
comparable non-set-aside license in the free market at the time of the 
auction. The Commission will establish the amount of the Payment and the 
burden will be on the applicants to disprove this amount. No payment 
will be required if:
    (1) The license is transferred or assigned more than five years 
after its initial issuance, unless otherwise specified; or
    (2) The proposed transferee or assignee is an eligible designated 
entity under Sec. 1.2110(c) or the service-specific

[[Page 367]]

competitive bidding rules of the particular service, and so certifies.
    (c) Unjust enrichment payment: installment financing. (1) If a 
licensee that utilizes installment financing under this section seeks to 
assign or transfer control of its license to an entity not meeting the 
eligibility standards for installment payments, the licensee must make 
full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest 
accrued through the date of assignment or transfer as a condition of 
approval.
    (2) If a licensee that utilizes installment financing under this 
section seeks to make any change in ownership structure that would 
result in the licensee losing eligibility for installment payments, the 
licensee shall first seek Commission approval and must make full payment 
of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest accrued 
through the date of such change as a condition of approval. A licensee's 
(or other attributable entity's) increased gross revenues or increased 
total assets due to nonattributable equity investments, debt financing, 
revenue from operations or other investments, business development or 
expanded service shall not be considered to result in the licensee 
losing eligibility for installment payments.
    (3) If a licensee seeks to make any change in ownership that would 
result in the licensee qualifying for a less favorable installment plan 
under this section, the licensee shall seek Commission approval and must 
adjust its payment plan to reflect its new eligibility status. A 
licensee may not switch its payment plan to a more favorable plan.
    (d) Unjust enrichment payment: bidding credits. (1) A licensee that 
utilizes a bidding credit, and that during the initial term seeks to 
assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that does not meet 
the eligibility criteria for a bidding credit, will be required to 
reimburse the U.S. Government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus 
interest based on the rate for ten year U.S. Treasury obligations 
applicable on the date the license was granted, as a condition of 
Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. If, within the 
initial term of the license, a licensee that utilizes a bidding credit 
seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that is 
eligible for a lower bidding credit, the difference between the bidding 
credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which 
the acquiring party would qualify, plus interest based on the rate for 
ten year U.S. treasury obligations applicable on the date the license is 
granted, must be paid to the U.S. Government as a condition of 
Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. If, within the 
initial term of the license, a licensee that utilizes a bidding credit 
seeks to make any ownership change that would result in the licensee 
losing eligibility for a bidding credit (or qualifying for a lower 
bidding credit), the amount of the bidding credit (or the difference 
between the bidding credit originally obtained and the bidding credit 
for which the restructured licensee would qualify), plus interest based 
on the rate for ten year U.S. treasury obligations applicable on the 
date the license is granted, must be paid to the U.S. Government as a 
condition of Commission approval of the assignment or transfer.
    (2) Payment schedule. (i) The amount of payments made pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be reduced over time as follows:
    (A) A transfer in the first two years of the license term will 
result in a forfeiture of 100 percent of the value of the bidding credit 
(or in the case of very small businesses transferring to small 
businesses, 100 percent of the difference between the bidding credit 
received by the former and the bidding credit for which the latter is 
eligible);
    (B) A transfer in year 3 of the license term will result in a 
forfeiture of 75 percent of the value of the bidding credit;
    (C) A transfer in year 4 of the license term will result in a 
forfeiture of 50 percent of the value of the bidding credit;
    (D) A transfer in year 5 of the license term will result in a 
forfeiture of 25 percent of the value of the bidding credit; and
    (E) for a transfer in year 6 or thereafter, there will be no 
payment.
    (ii) These payments will have to be paid to the United States 
Treasury as a

[[Page 368]]

condition of approval of the assignment, transfer, or ownership change.
    (e) Unjust enrichment: partitioning and disaggregation--(1) 
Installment payments. Licensees making installment payments, that 
partition their licenses or disaggregate their spectrum to entities not 
meeting the eligibility standards for installment payments, will be 
subject to the provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in 
this section.
    (2) Bidding credits. Licensees that received a bidding credit that 
partition their licenses or disaggregate their spectrum to entities not 
meeting the eligibility standards for such a bidding credit, will be 
subject to the provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in 
this section.
    (3) Apportioning unjust enrichment payments. Unjust enrichment 
payments for partitioned license areas shall be calculated based upon 
the ratio of the population of the partitioned license area to the 
overall population of the license area and by utilizing the most recent 
census data. Unjust enrichment payments for disaggregated spectrum shall 
be calculated based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum 
disaggregated to the amount of spectrum held by the licensee.

Sec. 1.2113  Construction prior to grant of application.

    Subject to the provisions of this section, applicants for licenses 
awarded by competitive bidding may construct facilities to provide 
service prior to grant of their applications, but must not operate such 
facilities until the FCC grants an authorization. If the conditions 
stated in this section are not met, applicants must not begin to 
construct facilities for licenses subject to competitive bidding.
    (a) When applicants may begin construction. An applicant may begin 
construction of a facility upon release of the Public Notice listing the 
post-auction long-form application for that facility as acceptable for 
filing.
    (b) Notification to stop. If the FCC for any reason determines that 
construction should not be started or should be stopped while an 
application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally (followed 
by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not begin 
construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction 
immediately.
    (c) Assumption of risk. Applicants that begin construction pursuant 
to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own 
risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses 
resulting from:

                                Bequests

    Source: 59 FR 38128, July 27, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3000  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Telecommunications 
Authorization Act of 1992 which amended the Communications Act by 
creating section 4(g)(3), 47 U.S.C. 154(g)(3). The provisions of this 
subpart shall apply to gifts, donations and bequests made to the 
Commission itself. Travel reimbursement for attendance at, or 
participation in, government-sponsored meetings or events required to 
carry out the Commission's statutory or regulatory functions may also be 
accepted under this subpart. The acceptance of gifts by Commission 
employees, most notably gifts of food, drink and entertainment, is 
governed by the government-wide standards of employee conduct 
established at 5 CFR part 2635. Travel, subsistence and related expenses 
for non-government-sponsored meetings or events will continue to be 
accepted pursuant to the Government Employees Training Act, 41 U.S.C. 
4111 or 31 U.S.C. 1353, and its General Services Administration's 
implementing regulations, 41 CFR 304-1.8, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3001  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart:
    (a) The term agency means the Federal Communications Commission.
    (b) The term gift means any unconditional gift, donation or bequest 
of real, personal and other property (including voluntary and 
uncompensated services as authorized under 5 U.S.C. 3109).
    (c) The terms agency ethics official, designated agency ethics 
official, employee, market value, person, and prohibited source, have 
the same meaning as found in 5 CFR 2635.102, 2635.203.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3002  Structural rules and prohibitions.

    (a) General prohibitions. An employee shall not:
    (1) Directly or indirectly, solicit or coerce the offering of a 
gift, donation or bequest to the Commission from a regulated entity or 
other prohibited source; or
    (2) Accept gifts of cash pursuant to this subpart.
    (b) Referral of offers to designated agency ethics official. Any 
person who seeks to offer any gift to the Commission under the 
provisions of this subpart shall make such offer to the Commission's 
designated agency ethics official. In addition, any Commission employee 
who is contacted by a potential donor or the representative thereof for

[[Page 371]]

the purpose of discussing the possibility of making a gift, donation or 
bequest to the Commission shall immediately refer such person or persons 
to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. The designated 
agency ethics official shall, in consultation with other agency ethics 
officials, make a determination concerning whether acceptance of such 
offers would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. Agency ethics officials may also advise potential 
donors and their representatives of the types of equipment, property or 
services that may be of use to the Commission and the procedures for 
effectuating gifts set forth in this subpart. The Commission may, in its 
discretion, afford public notice before accepting any gift under 
authority of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3003  Mandatory factors for evaluating conflicts of interest.

    No gift shall be accepted under this subpart unless a determination 
is made that its acceptance would not create a conflict of interest or 
the appearance of a conflict of interest. In making conflict of interest 
determinations, designated agency ethics officials shall consider the 
following factors:
    (a) Whether the benefits of the intended gift will accrue to an 
individual employee and, if so--
    (1) Whether the employee is responsible for matters affecting the 
potential donor that are currently before the agency; and
    (2) The significance of the employee's role in any such matters;
    (b) The nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the 
Commission affecting the intended donor;
    (c) The timing of the intended gift;
    (d) The market value of the intended gift;
    (e) The frequency of other gifts made by the same donor; and
    (f) The reason underlying the intended gift given in a written 
statement from the proposed donor.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3004  Public disclosure and reporting requirements.

    (a) Public disclosure of gifts accepted from prohibited sources. The 
Commission's Security Operations Office, Office of the Managing 
Director, shall maintain a written record of gifts accepted from 
prohibited sources by the Commission pursuant to section 4(g)(3) 
authority, which will include:
    (1) The identity of the prohibited source;
    (2) A description of the gift;
    (3) The market value of the gift;
    (4) Documentation concerning the prohibited source's reason for the 
gift as required in Sec. 1.3003(f);
    (5) A signed statement of verification from the prohibited source 
that the gift is unconditional and is not contingent on any promise or 
expectation that the Commission's receipt of the gift will benefit the 
proposed donor in any regulatory matter; and
    (6) The date the gift is accepted by the Commission.
    (b) Reporting Requirements for all gifts. The Commission shall file 
a semi-annual report to Congress listing the gift, donor and value of 
all gifts accepted from any donor under this subpart.

  Subpart S--Preemption of Restrictions That ``Impair'' the Ability to
 
    Receive Television Broadcast Signals, Direct Broadcast Satellite 
 
  Services, or Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services or the 
 
 Ability To Receive or Transmit Fixed Wireless Communications Signals

    Source: 66 FR 2333, Jan. 11, 2001, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.4000  Restrictions impairing reception of television broadcast signals, direct broadcast satellite services or multichannel multipoint distribution 
          services.

    (a)(1) Any restriction, including but not limited to any state or 
local law or regulation, including zoning, land-use, or building 
regulations, or any private covenant, contract provision, lease 
provision, homeowners' association rule or similar restriction, on 
property within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user where 
the user has a direct or indirect ownership or leasehold interest in the 
property that impairs the installation, maintenance, or use of:
    (i) An antenna that is:

[[Page 372]]

    (A) Used to receive direct broadcast satellite service, including 
direct-to-home satellite service, or to receive or transmit fixed 
wireless signals via satellite, and
    (B) One meter or less in diameter or is located in Alaska;
    (ii) An antenna that is:
    (A) Used to receive video programming services via multipoint 
distribution services, including multichannel multipoint distribution 
services, instructional television fixed services, and local multipoint 
distribution services, or to receive or transmit fixed wireless signals 
other than via satellite, and
    (B) That is one meter or less in diameter or diagonal measurement;
    (iii) An antenna that is used to receive television broadcast 
signals; or
    (iv) A mast supporting an antenna described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), 
(a)(1)(ii), or (a)(1)(iii) of this section; is prohibited to the extent 
it so impairs, subject to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this section, ``fixed wireless signals'' means 
any commercial non-broadcast communications signals transmitted via 
wireless technology to and/or from a fixed customer location. Fixed 
wireless signals do not include, among other things, AM radio, FM radio, 
amateur (``HAM'') radio, Citizen's Band (CB) radio, and Digital Audio 
Radio Service (DARS) signals.
    (3) For purposes of this section, a law, regulation, or restriction 
impairs installation, maintenance, or use of an antenna if it:
    (i) Unreasonably delays or prevents installation, maintenance, or 
use;
    (ii) Unreasonably increases the cost of installation, maintenance, 
or use; or
    (iii) Precludes reception or transmission of an acceptable quality 
signal.
    (4) Any fee or cost imposed on a user by a rule, law, regulation or 
restriction must be reasonable in light of the cost of the equipment or 
services and the rule, law, regulation or restriction's treatment of 
comparable devices. No civil, criminal, administrative, or other legal 
action of any kind shall be taken to enforce any restriction or 
regulation prohibited by this section except pursuant to paragraph (d) 
or (e) of this section. In addition, except with respect to restrictions 
pertaining to safety and historic preservation as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section, if a proceeding is initiated pursuant to paragraph 
(d) or (e) of this section, the entity seeking to enforce the antenna 
restrictions in question must suspend all enforcement efforts pending 
completion of review. No attorney's fees shall be collected or assessed 
and no fine or other penalties shall accrue against an antenna user 
while a proceeding is pending to determine the validity of any 
restriction. If a ruling is issued adverse to a user, the user shall be 
granted at least a 21-day grace period in which to comply with the 
adverse ruling; and neither a fine nor a penalty may be collected from 
the user if the user complies with the adverse ruling during this grace 
period, unless the proponent of the restriction demonstrates, in the 
same proceeding which resulted in the adverse ruling, that the user's 
claim in the proceeding was frivolous.
    (b) Any restriction otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this 
section is permitted if:
    (1) It is necessary to accomplish a clearly defined, legitimate 
safety objective that is either stated in the text, preamble, or 
legislative history of the restriction or described as applying to that 
restriction in a document that is readily available to antenna users, 
and would be applied to the extent practicable in a non-discriminatory 
manner to other appurtenances, devices, or fixtures that are comparable 
in size and weight and pose a similar or greater safety risk as these 
antennas and to which local regulation would normally apply; or
    (2) It is necessary to preserve a prehistoric or historic district, 
site, building, structure or object included in, or eligible for 
inclusion on, the National Register of Historic Places, as set forth in 
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 
470, and imposes no greater restrictions on antennas covered by this 
rule than are imposed on the installation, maintenance, or use of other 
modern appurtenances, devices, or fixtures that are comparable in size, 
weight, and appearance to these antennas; and

[[Page 373]]

    (3) It is no more burdensome to affected antenna users than is 
necessary to achieve the objectives described in paragraphs (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (c) In the case of an antenna that is used to transmit fixed 
wireless signals, the provisions of this section shall apply only if a 
label is affixed to the antenna that:
    (1) Provides adequate notice regarding potential radiofrequency 
safety hazards, e.g., information regarding the safe minimum separation 
distance required between users and transceiver antennas; and

for a waiver of this section under Sec. 1.3 of this chapter. Waiver 
requests must comply with the procedures in paragraphs (f) and (h) of 
this section and will be put on public notice. The Commission may grant 
a waiver upon a showing by the applicant of local concerns of a highly 
specialized or unusual nature. No petition for waiver shall be 
considered unless it specifies the restriction at issue. Waivers granted 
in accordance with this section shall not apply to restrictions amended 
or enacted after the waiver is granted. Any responsive pleadings must be 
served on all parties and filed within 30 days after release of a public 
notice that such petition has been filed. Any replies must be filed 
within 15 days thereafter.
    (e) Parties may petition the Commission for a declaratory ruling 
under Sec. 1.2 of this chapter, or a court of competent jurisdiction, to 
determine whether a particular restriction is permissible or prohibited 
under this section. Petitions to the Commission must comply with the 
procedures in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section and will be put on 
public notice. Any responsive pleadings in a Commission proceeding must 
be served on all parties and filed within 30 days after release of a 
public notice that such petition has been filed. Any replies in a 
Commission proceeding must be served on all parties and filed within 15 
days thereafter.
    (f) Copies of petitions for declaratory rulings and waivers must be 
served on interested parties, including parties against whom the 
petitioner seeks to enforce the restriction or parties whose 
restrictions the petitioner seeks to prohibit. A certificate of service 
stating on whom the petition was served must be filed with the petition. 
In addition, in a Commission proceeding brought by an association or a 
local government, constructive notice of the proceeding must be given to 
members of the association or to the citizens under the local 
government's jurisdiction. In a court proceeding brought by an 
association, an association must give constructive notice of the 
proceeding to its members. Where constructive notice is required, the 
petitioner or plaintiff must file with the Commission or the court 
overseeing the proceeding a copy of the constructive notice with a 
statement explaining where the notice was placed and why such placement 
was reasonable.
    (g) In any proceeding regarding the scope or interpretation of any 
provision of this section, the burden of demonstrating that a particular 
governmental or nongovernmental restriction complies with this section 
and does not impair the installation, maintenance, or use of devices 
used for over-the-air reception of video programming services or devices 
used to receive or transmit fixed wireless signals shall be on the party 
that seeks to impose or maintain the restriction.
    (h) All allegations of fact contained in petitions and related 
pleadings before the Commission must be supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with actual knowledge thereof. An original and two 
copies of all petitions and pleadings should be addressed to the 
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW, 
Washington, DC 20554. Copies of the petitions and related pleadings will

<R05>
Sec. 1.6003  Service requirements.

    (a) General. Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 325(e), for purposes of any 
proceeding under this subsection, any satellite carrier that retransmits 
the signal of any broadcast station shall be deemed to designate the 
Secretary of the Commission as its agent for service of process.
    (b) Specific. (1) A television broadcast station shall serve a 
satellite carrier with a complaint concerning an alleged violation of 47 
U.S.C. 325(b)(1) by filing the original and two copies of the complaint 
on the Secretary of the Commission and serving a copy of the complaint 
by means of two commonly used overnight delivery services, each 
addressed to the chief executive officer of the satellite carrier at its 
principal place of business and each marked ``URGENT LITIGATION MATTER'' 
on the outer packaging. Service shall be deemed complete one business 
day after a copy of the complaint is provided to the delivery services 
for overnight delivery. On receipt of a complaint filed by a television 
broadcast station under this subsection, the Secretary of the Commission 
shall send the original complaint by United States mail, postage 
prepaid, receipt requested, addressed to the chief executive officer of 
the satellite carrier at its principal place of business.
    (2) Satellite carriers shall provide the name, address, and 
telephone number (including area code) of their chief executive officers 
to the Secretary of the Commission, no later than April 15, 2000. 
Satellite carriers shall update this information, as necessary, in the 
event that the identity or the address of their respective chief 
executive officers changes. These updates shall be made by United States 
mail within seven (7) days of such changes. Complaints sent to the last 
known address shall be deemed served if the satellite carrier fails to 
notify the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with this 
provision.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6004  Answers.

    Within five (5) business days after the date of service, without 
regard to Sec. 1.4 of this part, the satellite carrier shall file its 
answer with the Commission, and shall contemporaneously serve the answer 
upon counsel designated in the complaint, at the address listed for such 
counsel in the complaint. Service of the answer shall be made by use of 
one commonly used overnight delivery service and by the United States 
mail.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6005  Exclusive defenses.

    (a) The defenses listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this 
section, are the only defenses available to a satellite carrier against 
which a complaint under this section is filed.
    (1) The satellite carrier did not retransmit the television 
broadcast station's signal to any person in the ``local market'' of the 
television broadcast station, as that term is defined in 17 U.S.C. 
122(j) (Designated Market Area as determined by Nielsen Media Research 
and county containing the station's community of license), during the 
time period specified in the complaint;
    (2) The television broadcast station had, in a writing signed by an 
officer of the television broadcast station, expressly authorized the 
retransmission of the station by the satellite carrier to each person in 
the ``local market'' of the television broadcast station, as that term 
is defined in 17 U.S.C. 122(j), to which the satellite carrier made such 
retransmissions for the entire time period during which it is alleged 
that a violation of 47 U.S.C. 325 (b)(1) has occurred;
    (3) The retransmission was made after January 1, 2002, and the 
television broadcast station had elected to assert the right to carriage 
under 47 U.S.C. 338 as against the satellite carrier for the relevant 
period; or
    (4) The television broadcast station whose signal is being 
retransmitted is a noncommercial television broadcast station.
    (b) [Reserved]

[[Page 377]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.6006  Counting of violations.

    Each day of retransmission without consent of a particular 
television broadcast station to one or more persons in the local market 
of the station shall be considered a separate violation of 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 1.6007  Burden of proof.

    With respect to each alleged violation, the burden of proof shall be 
on a television broadcast station to establish that the satellite 
carrier retransmitted the station to at least one person in the local 
market of the station on the day in question. The burden of proof shall 
be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the 
defense under Sec. 1.6005(a)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 1.6008  Determinations.

    (a) In General. Within forty five (45) days after the filing of a 
complaint, the Commission shall issue a final determination in any 
proceeding brought under this subsection. The Commission's final 
determination shall specify the number of violations committed by the 
satellite carrier. The Commission shall hear witnesses only if it 
clearly appears, based on the written filings by the parties, that there 
is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the 
preceding sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on the 
written filings by the parties.
    (b) Discovery. The Commission may direct the parties to exchange 
pertinent documents, and if necessary, to take prehearing depositions, 
on such schedule as the Commission may approve, but only if the 
Commission first determines that such discovery is necessary to resolve 
a genuine dispute about material facts, consistent with the obligation 
to make a final determination within forty five (45) days. In this 
connection, the Commission may utilize the discovery or other 
evidentiary procedures set forth in Secs. 1.311 through 1.364 of the 
Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6009  Relief.

    If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has 
retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one person in 
the local market of such station and has failed to meet its burden of 
proving one of the defenses under Sec. 1.6005 (a)(2) through (a)(4) with 
respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall:
    (a) Make a finding that the satellite carrier violated 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1) with respect to that station; and
    (b) Issue an order, within forty-five (45) days after the filing of 
the complaint, containing--
    (1) A cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier 
immediately to stop making any further retransmissions of the television 
broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station 
until such time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier 
is in compliance with 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to such station;
    (2) If the satellite carrier is found to have violated 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1) with respect to more than two television broadcast stations, a 
cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier to stop making 
any further retransmission of any television broadcast station to any 
person within the local market of the stations identified in the cease-
and-desist order, until such time as the Commission, after giving notice 
to the station, determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance 
with 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to such stations; and
    (3) An award to the complainant of that complainant's costs and 
reasonable attorney's fees. Such award shall be made only after the 
complainant submits appropriate documentation in support of its request.
    (c) Any cease-and-desist order issued hereunder shall include a 
statement of findings and the grounds therefor, shall specify the 
effective date of the order, and shall be served by the Commission upon 
the satellite carrier to which such order is directed.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6010  Reporting of remedial measures.

    Any satellite carrier found to have violated Section 47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(1) shall, upon receipt of the cease-and-desist order, immediately 
take all necessary steps to comply with the statute. Within two (2) days 
of receipt of

[[Page 378]]

the cease-and-desist order, the satellite carrier shall notify the 
Secretary of the Commission of steps taken to comply with the statute by 
written submission. The submission certified by the satellite carrier's 
chief executive officer shall also contain a copy of the pertinent 
cease-and-desist order, and shall be delivered to the Secretary of the 
Commission by means of one commonly used overnight delivery service, in 
addition to a copy delivered by United States mail.

  Appendix A to Part 1--A Plan of Cooperative Procedure in Matters and 
 Cases Under the Provisions of Section 410 of the Communications Act of 
                                  1934

    (Approved by the Federal Communications Commission October 25, 1938, 
and approved by the National Association of Railroad and Utilities 
Commissioners on November 17, 1938.)

   preliminary statement concerning the purpose and effect of the plan

    Section 410 of the Communications Act of 1934 authorizes cooperation 
between the Federal Communications Commission, hereinafter called the 
Federal Commission, and the State commissions of the several States, in 
the administration of said Act. Subsection (a) authorizes the reference 
of any matter arising in the administration of said Act to a board to be 
composed of a member or members from each of the States in which the 
wire, or radio communication affected by or involved in the proceeding 
takes place, or is proposed. Subsection (b) authorizes conferences by 
the Federal Commission with State commissions regarding the relationship 
between rate structures, accounts,charges, practices, classifications, 
and regulations of carriers subject to the jurisdiction of such State 
commissions and of said Federal Commission and joint hearings with State 
commissions in connection with any matter with respect to which the 
Federal Commission is authorized to act.
    Obviously, it is impossible to determine in advance what matters 
should be the subject of a conference, what matters should be referred 
to a board, and what matters should be heard at a joint hearing of State 
commissions and the Federal Commission. It is understood, therefore, 
that the Federal Commission or any State commission will freely

[[Page 381]]

suggest cooperation with respect to any proceedings or matter affecting 
any carrier subject to the jurisdiction of said Federal Commission and 
of a State commission, and concerning which it is believed that 
cooperation will be in the public interest.
    To enable this to be done, whenever a proceeding shall be instituted 
before any commission, Federal or State, in which another commission is 
believed to be interested, notice should be promptly given each such 
interested commission by the commission before which the proceeding has 
been instituted. Inasmuch, however, as failure to give notice as 
contemplated by the provisions of this plan will sometimes occur purely 
through inadvertence, any such failure should not operate to deter any 
commission from suggesting that any such proceeding be made the subject 
matter of cooperative action, if cooperation therein is deemed 
desirable.
    It is understood that each commission whether or not represented in 
the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, must 
determine its own course of action with respect to any proceeding in the 
light of the law under which, at any given time, it is called upon to 
act, and must be guided by its own views of public policy; and that no 
action taken by such Association can in any respect prejudice such 
freedom of action. The approval by the Association of this plan of 
cooperative procedure, which was jointly prepared by the Association's 
standing Committee on Cooperation between Federal and State commissions 
and said Federal Commission, is accordingly recommendatory only; but 
such plan is designed to be, and it is believed that it will be, a 
helpful step in the promotion of cooperative relations between the State 
commissions and said Federal Commission.

                   notice of institution of proceeding

    Whenever there shall be instituted before the Federal Commission any 
proceeding involving the rates of any telephone or telegraph carrier, 
the State commissions of the States affected thereby will be notified 
immediately thereof by the Federal Commission, and each notice given a 
State commission will advise such commission that, if it deems the 
proceeding one which should be considered under the cooperative 
provisions of the Act, it should either directly or through the National 
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, notify the Federal 
Commission as to the nature of its interest in said matter and request a 
conference, the creation of a joint board, or a joint hearing as may be 
desired, indicating its preference and the reasons therefor. Upon 
receipt of such request the Federal Commission will consider the same 
and may confer with the commission making the request and with other 
interested commission, or with representatives of the National 
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, in such manner as 
may be most suitable; and if cooperation shall appear to be practicable 
and desirable, shall so advise each interested State commission, 
directly, when such cooperation will be by joint conference or by 
reference to a joint board appointed under said sec. 410 (a), and, as 
hereinafter provided, when such cooperation will be by a joint hearing 
under said sec. 410(b).
    Each State commission should in like manner notify the Federal 
Commission of any proceeding instituted before it involving the toll 
telephone rates or the telegraph rates of any carrier subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Commission.

                  procedure governing joint conferences

    The Federal Commission, in accordance with the indicated procedure, 
will confer with any State commission regarding any matter relating to 
the regulation of public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of either 
commission. The commission desiring a conference upon any such matter 
should notify the other without delay, and thereupon the Federal 
Commission will promptly arrange for a conference in which all 
interested State commissions will be invited to be present.

             procedure governing matters referred to a board

    Whenever the Federal Commission, either upon its own motion or upon 
the suggestion of a State commission, or at the request of any 
interested party, shall determine that it is desirable to refer a matter 
arising in the administration of the Communications Act of 1934 to a 
board to be composed of a member or members from the State or States 
affected or to be affected by such matter, the procedure shall be as 
follows:
    The Federal Commission will send a request to each interested State 
commission to nominate a specified number of members to serve on such 
board.
    The representation of each State concerned shall be equal, unless 
one or more of the States affected chooses to waive such right of equal 
representation. When themember or members of any board have been 
nominated and appointed, in accordance with the provisions of the 
Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Commission will make an order 
referring the particular matter to such board, and such order shall fix 
the time and place of hearing, define the force and effect the action of 
the board shall have, and the manner in which its proceedings shall be 
conducted. The rules of practice and procedure, as from time to time 
adopted or prescribed by the Federal Commission, shall govern such 
board, as far as applicable.

[[Page 382]]

                   procedure governing joint hearings

    Whenever the Federal Commission, either upon its own motion or upon 
suggestions made by or on behalf of any interested State commission or 
commissions, shall determine that a joint hearing under said sec. 410(b) 
is desirable in connection with any matter pending before said Federal 
Commission, the procedure shall be as follows:
    (a) The Federal Commission will notify the general solicitor of the 
National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners that said 
Association, or, if not more than eight States are within the territory 
affected by the proceeding, the State commissions interested, are 
invited to name Cooperating Commissioners to sit with the Federal 
Commission for the hearing and consideration of said proceeding.
    (b) Upon receipt of any notice from said Federal Commission inviting 
cooperation, if not more than eight States are involved, the general 
solicitor shall at once advise the State commissions of said States, 
they being represented in the membership of the association, of the 
receipt of such notice, and shall request each such commission to give 
advice to him in writing, before a date to be indicated by him in his 
communication requesting such advice (1) whether such commission will 
cooperate in said proceeding, (2) if it will, by what commissioner it 
will be represented therein.
    (c) Upon the basis of replies received, the general solicitor shall 
advise the Federal Commission what States, if any, are desirous of 
making the proceeding cooperative and by what commissioners they will be 
represented, and he shall give like advice to each State commission 
interested therein.
    (d) If more than eight States are interested in the proceeding, 
because within territory for which rates will be under consideration 
therein, the general solicitor shall advise the president of the 
association that the association is invited to name a cooperating 
committee of State commissioners representing the States interested in 
said proceeding.
    The president of the association shall thereupon advise the general 
solicitor in writing (1) whether the invitation is accepted on behalf of 
the association, and (2) the names of commissioners selected to sit as a 
cooperating committee. The president of the association shall have the 
authority to accept or to decline said invitation for the association, 
and to determine the number of commissioners who shall be named on the 
cooperating committee, provided that his action shall be concurred in by 
the chairman of the association's executive committee. In the event of 
any failure of the president of the association and chairman of its 
executive committee to agree, the second vice president of the 
association (or the chairman of its committee on cooperation between 
State and Federal commissions, if there shall be no second vice 
president) shall be consulted, and the majority opinion of the three 
shall prevail. Consultations and expressions of opinion may be by mail 
or telegraph.
    (e) If any proceeding, involving more than eight States, is pending 
before the Federal Commission, in which cooperation has not been invited 
by that Commission, which the association's president and the first and 
second vice presidents, or any two of them, consider should be made a 
cooperating proceeding, they may instruct the general solicitor to 
suggest to the Federal Commission that the proceeding be made a 
cooperative proceeding; and any State commission considering that said 
proceeding should be made cooperative may request the president of the 
association or the chairman of its executive committee to make such 
suggestion after consideration with the executive officers above named. 
If said Federal Commission shall assent to the suggestion, made as 
aforesaid, the president of the association shall have the same 
authority to proceed, and shall proceed in the appointment of a 
cooperating committee, as is provided in other cases involving more than 
eight States, wherein the Federal Commission has invited cooperation, 
and the invitation has been accepted.
    (f) Whenever any case is pending before the Federal Commission 
involving eight States or less, which a commission of any of said States 
considers should be made cooperative, such commission, either directly 
or through the general solicitor of the association, may suggest to the 
Federal Commission that the proceeding be made cooperative. If said 
Federal Commission accedes to such suggestion, it will notify the 
general solicitor of the association to that effect and thereupon the 
general solicitor shall proceed as is provided in such case when the 
invitation has been made by the Federal Commission without State 
commission suggestion.

        appointment of cooperating commissioners by the president

    In the appointment of any cooperating committee, the president of 
the associationshall make appointments only from commissions of the 
States interested in the particular proceeding in which the committee is 
to serve. He shall exercise his best judgment to select cooperating 
commissioners who are especially qualified to serve upon cooperating 
committees by reason of their ability and fitness; and in no case shall 
he appoint a commissioner upon a cooperating committee until he shall 
have been advised by such commissioner that it will be practicable for 
him to attend the hearings in the proceeding in which the committee is 
to serve, including the arguments therein, and

[[Page 383]]

the cooperative conferences, which may be held following the submission 
of the proceeding, to an extent that will reasonably enable him to be 
informed upon the issues in the proceeding and to form a reasonable 
judgment in the matters to be determined.

                          tenure of cooperators

    (a) No State commissioner shall sit in a cooperative proceeding 
under this plan except a commissioner who has been selected by his 
commission to represent it in a proceeding involving eight States or 
less, or has been selected by the president of the association to sit in 
a case involving more than eight States, in the manner hereinbefore 
provided.
    (b) A commissioner who has been selected, as hereinbefore provided, 
to serve as a member of a cooperating committee in any proceeding, shall 
without further appointment, and without regard to the duration of time 
involved, continue to serve in said proceeding until the final 
disposition thereof, including hearings and conferences after any order 
or reopening, provided that he shall continue to be a State 
commissioner.
    (c) No member of a cooperating committee shall have any right or 
authority to designate another commissioner to serve in his place at any 
hearing or conference in any proceeding in which he has been appointed 
to serve.
    (d) Should a vacancy occur upon any cooperating committee, in a 
proceeding involving more than eight States, by reason of the death of 
any cooperating commissioner, or of his ceasing to be a State 
commissioner, or of other inability to serve, it shall be the duty of 
the president of the association to fill the vacancy by appointment, if, 
after communication with the chairman of the cooperating committee, it 
be deemed necessary to fill such vacancy.
    (e) In the event of any such vacancy occurring upon a cooperating 
committee involving not more than eight States, the vacancy shall be 
filled by the commission from which the vacancy occurs.

cooperating committee to determine respecting any report of statement of 
                              its attitude

    (a) Whenever a cooperating committee shall have concluded its work, 
or shall deem such course advisable, the committee shall consider 
whether it is necessary and desirable to make a report to the interested 
State commissions, and, if it shall determine to make a report, it shall 
cause the same to be distributed through the secretary of the 
association, or through the general solicitor to all interested 
commissions.
    (b) If a report of the Federal Commission will accompany any order 
to be made in said proceeding, the Federal Commission will state therein 
the concurrence or nonconcurrence of said cooperating committee in the 
decision or order of said Federal Commission.

       construction hereof in certain respects expressly provided

    It is understood and provided that no State or States shall be 
deprived of the right of participation and cooperation as hereinbefore 
provided because of nonmembership in the association. With respect to 
any such State or States, all negotiations herein specified to be 
carried on between the Federal Commission and any officer of such 
association shall be conducted by the Federal Commission directly with 
the chairman of the commission of such State or States.

Sec. 2.102  Assignment of frequencies.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the assignment of 
frequencies and bands of frequencies to all stations and classes of 
stations and the licensing and authorizing of the use of all such 
frequencies between 9 kHz and 400 GHz, and the actual use of such 
frequencies for radiocommunication or for any other purpose, including 
the transfer of energy by radio, shall be in accordance with the Table 
of Frequency Allocations in Sec. 2.106.
    (b) On the condition that harmful interference will not be caused to 
services operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations 
the following exceptions to paragraph (a) of this section may be 
authorized:
    (1) In individual cases the Commission may, without rule making 
proceedings, authorize on a temporary basis only, the use of frequencies 
not in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations for projects 
of short duration or emergencies where the Commission finds that 
important or exceptional circumstances require such utilization. Such 
authorizations are not intended to develop a service to be operated on 
frequencies other than those allocated such service.
    (2) A station for the development of techniques or equipment to be 
employed by services set forth in column 5 of the Table of Frequency 
Allocations may be authorized the use of frequencies allocated to those 
services or classes of stations.
    (3) Experimental stations pursuant to part 5, may be authorized the 
use of any frequency or frequency band not exclusively allocated to the 
passive services (including the Radio Astronomy Service).
    (4) In the event a band is reallocated so as to delete its 
availability for use by a particular service, the Commission may provide 
for the further interim use of the band by stations in that service for 
a temporary, specific period of time.
    (c) Non-Government stations may be authorized to use Government 
frequencies in the bands above 25 MHz if the Commission finds, after 
consultations with the appropriate Government agency or agencies, that 
such use is necessary for coordination of Government and non-Government 
activities: Provided, however, that:
    (1) Non-Government operation on Government frequencies shall conform 
with the conditions agreed upon by the Commission and the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) (the more 
important of which are contained in paragraphs (c) (2), (3), and (4) of 
this section);
    (2) Such operations shall be in accordance with NTIA rules governing 
the service to which the frequencies involved are allocated;
    (3) Such operations shall not cause harmful interference to 
Government stations and, should harmful interference result, that the 
interfering non-Government operation shall immediately terminate; and
    (4) Non-Government operation has been certified as necessary by the 
Government agency involved and this certification has been furnished, in 
writing, to the non-Government licensee with which communication is 
required.
    (d) Aircraft stations may communicate with stations of the maritime 
mobile service. They shall then conform to those provisions of the 
international Radio Regulations which relate to the maritime mobile 
service. For this purpose aircraft stations should use the frequencies 
allocated to the maritime mobile service. However, having regard to 
interference which may be caused by aircraft stations at high altitudes, 
maritime mobile frequencies in the bands above 30 MHz shall not be used 
by aircraft stations in any specific area without the prior agreement of 
all administrations of the area in which interference is likely to be 
caused. In particular, aircraft stations operating in Region 1 should 
not use frequencies in the bands above 30

[[Page 398]]

MHz allocated to the maritime mobile service by virtue of any agreement 
between administrations in that Region.
    (e) Non-Government services operating on frequencies in the band 25-
50 MHz must recognize that it is shared with various services of other 
countries; that harmful interference may be caused by skywave signals 
received from distant stations of all services of the United States and 
other countries radiating power on frequencies in this band; and that no 
protection from such harmful interference generally can be expected. 
Persons desiring to avoid such harmful interference should consider 
operation on available frequencies higher in the radio spectrum not 
generally subject to this type of difficulty.
    (f) The stations of a service shall use frequencies so separated 
from the limits of a band allocated to that service as not to cause 
harmful interference to allocated services in immediately adjoining 
frequency bands.
    (g) In the bands above 25 MHz which are allocated to the non-
Government land mobile service, fixed stations may be authorized on the 
following conditions:
    (1) That such stations are authorized in the service shown in Column 
5 of the Table of Frequency Allocations in the band in question;
    (2) That harmful interference will not be caused to services 
operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations.
    (h) Special provisions regarding the use of spectrum allocated to 
the fixed and land mobile services below 25 MHz by non-Government 
stations.
    (1) Only in the following circumstances will authority be extended 
to stations in the fixed service to operate on frequencies below 25 MHz.
    (i) With respect to aeronautical fixed stations, only when a showing 
can be made that more suitable facilities are not available.
    (ii) With respect to fixed stations, except aeronautical fixed 
stations, only to:
    (A) Provide communication circuits in emergency and/or disaster 
situations, where safety of life and property are concerned;
    (B) Provide standby and/or backup facilities to satellite and cable 
circuits used for international public correspondence;
    (C) Provide standby and/or backup communications circuits to regular 
domestic communication circuits which have been disrupted by disasters 
and/or emergencies;
    (D) Provide communication circuits wholly within the State of Alaska 
and the United States insular areas in the Pacific; and
    (E) Provide communication circuits to support operations which are 
highly important to the national interest and where other means of 
telecommunication are unavailable.
    (2) Only in the following circumstances will authority be extended 
to stations in the land mobile service to operate below 25 MHz.
    (i) Provide communication circuits in emergency and/or disaster 
situations, where safety of life and property are concerned;
    (ii) Provide standby and/or backup communications circuits to 
regular domestic communication circuits which have been disrupted by 
disasters and/or emergencies;
    (iii) Provide communication circuits wholly within the State of 
Alaska andthe United States insular areas in the Pacific; and
    (iv) Provide communication circuits to support operations which are 
highly important to the national interest and where other means of 
telecommunication are unavailable.
    (3) Except in the State of Alaska and the United States Pacific 
insular areas, the Commission does not intend to seek international 
protection for assignments made pursuant to paragraphs (h) (1)(ii) and 
(2) of this section; this results in the following constraints upon the 
circuits/assignments.
    (i) The Commission will not accept responsibility for protection of 
the circuits from harmful interference caused by foreign operations.
    (ii) In the event that a complaint of harmful interference resulting 
from operation of these circuits is received from a foreign source, the 
offending circuit(s) must cease operation on the particular frequency 
concerned.

[[Page 399]]

    (iii) In order to accommodate the situations described in paragraphs 
(h)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, equipments shall be capable of 
transmitting and receiving on any frequency in the bands assigned to the 
particular operation and capable of immediate change among the 
frequencies.


<R05>
Sec. 2.103  Government use of non-Government frequencies.

    (a) Government stations may be authorized to use non-Government 
frequencies in the bands above 25 MHz (except the 764-776 MHz and 794-
806 MHz public safety bands) if the Commission finds that such use is 
necessary for coordination of Government and non-Government activities: 
Provided, however, that:
    (1) Government operation on non-Government frequencies shall conform 
with the conditions agreed upon by the Commission and the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (the more important of

section);
    (2) Such operations shall be in accordance with Commission rules 
governing the service to which the frequencies involved are allocated;
    (3) Such operations shall not cause harmful interference to non-
Government stations and, should harmful interference result, that the 
interfering Government operation shall immediately terminate; and
    (4) Government operation has been certified as necessary by the non-
Government licensees involved and this certification has been furnished, 
in writing, to the Government agency with which communication is 
required.
    (b) Government stations may be authorized to use channels in the 
764-776 MHz, 794-806 MHz and 4940-4990 MHz public safety bands with non-
Government entities if the Commission finds such use necessary; where:
    (1) The stations are used for interoperability or part of a 
Government/non-Government shared or joint-use system;
    (2) The Government entity obtains the approval of the non-Government 
(State/local government) licensee(s) or applicant(s) involved;
    (3) Government operation is in accordance with the Commission's 
Rules governing operation of this band and conforms with any conditions 
agreed upon by the Commission and the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration; and
    (4) Interoperability, shared or joint-use systems are the subject of 
a mutual agreement between the Government and non-Government entities. 
This section does not preclude other arrangements or agreements as

western boundary of Region 1, on the east by the meridian 40[deg] East 
of Greenwich and on the south by the parallel 30[deg] North so as to 
include the northern part of Saudi Arabia and that part of those 
countries bordering the Mediterranean within these limits. In addition, 
Iraq, Jordan and that part of the territory of Syria, Turkey and Ukraine 
lying outside the above limits are included in the European Broadcasting 
Area.
    (3) The ``European Maritime Area'' is bounded to the north by a line

    (A) The area contained between the meridians 40[deg] East and 
80[deg] East of Greenwich and the parallels 30[deg] North and 40[deg] 
North; and
    (B) That part of Libya north of parallel 30[deg] North.
    (iii) In Region 2, the Tropical Zone may be extended to parallel 
33[deg] North, subject to special agreements between the countries 
concerned in that Region.

[[Page 401]]

    (5) A sub-Region is an area consisting of two or more countries in 
the same Region.
    (d) Categories of services and allocations. (1) Primary and 
secondary services. Where, in a box of the International Table in 
Sec. 2.106, a band is indicated as allocated to more than one service, 
either on a worldwide or Regional basis, such services are listed in the 
following order:
    (i) Services the names of which are printed in ``capitals'' 
(example: FIXED); these are called ``primary'' services; and
    (ii) Services the names of which are printed in ``normal 
characters'' (example: Mobile); these are called ``secondary'' services 
(see paragraph (d)(3) of this section).
    (2) Additional remarks shall be printed in normal characters 
(example: MOBILE except aeronautical mobile).
    (3) Stations of a secondary service:
    (i) Shall not cause harmful interference to stations of primary 
services to which frequencies are already assigned or to which 
frequencies may be assigned at a later date;
    (ii) Cannot claim protection from harmful interference from stations 
of a primary service to which frequencies are already assigned or may be 
assigned at a later date; and
    (iii) Can claim protection, however, from harmful interference from 
stations of the same or other secondary service(s) to which frequencies 
may be assigned at a later date.
    (4) Where a band is indicated in a footnote of the International 
Table as allocated to a service ``on a secondary basis'' in an area 
smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, this is a secondary 
service (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section).
    (5) Where a band is indicated in a footnote of the International 
Table as allocated to a service ``on a primary basis'', in an area 
smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, this is a primary 
service only in that area or country.
    (e) Additional allocations. (1) Where a band is indicated in a 
footnote of the International Table as ``also allocated'' to a service 
in an area smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, this is an 
``additional'' allocation, i.e. an allocation which is added in this 
area or in this country to the service or services which are indicated 
in the International Table.
    (2) If the footnote does not include any restriction on the service 
or services concerned apart from the restriction to operate only in a 
particular area or country, stations of this service or these services 
shall have equality of right to operate with stations of the other 
primary service or services indicated in the International Table.
    (3) If restrictions are imposed on an additional allocation in 
addition to the restriction to operate only in a particular area or 
country, this is indicated in the footnote of the International Table.
    (f) Alternative allocations. (1) Where a band is indicated in a 
footnote of the International Table as ``allocated'' to one or more 
services in an area smaller than a Region, or in a particular country, 
this is an ``alternative'' allocation, i.e. an allocation which 
replaces, in this area or in this country, the allocation indicated in 
the Table.
    (2) If the footnote does not include any restriction on stations of 
the service or services concerned, apart from the restriction to operate 
only in a particular area or country, these stations of such a service 
or services shall have an equality of right to operate with stations of 
the primary service or services, indicated in the International Table, 
to which the band is allocated in other areas or countries.
    (3) If restrictions are imposed on stations of a service to which an 
alternative allocation is made, in addition to the restriction to 
operate only in a particular country or area, this is indicated in the 
footnote.
    (g) Miscellaneous provisions. (1) Where it is indicated that a 
service may operate in a specific frequency band subject to not causing 
harmful interference, this means also that this service cannot claim 
protection from harmful interference caused by other services to which 
the band is allocated under Chapter SII of the international Radio 
Regulations.
    (2) Except if otherwise specified in a footnote, the term ``fixed 
service'', where appearing in the International

[[Page 402]]

Table, does not include systems using ionospheric scatter propagation.
    (h) Description of the International Table of Frequency Allocations. 
(1) The heading of the International Table includes three columns, each 
of which corresponds to one of the Regions (see paragraph (b) of this 
section). Where an allocation occupies the whole of the width of the 
Table or only one or two of the three columns, this is a worldwide 
allocation or a Regional allocation, respectively.
    (2) The frequency band referred to in each allocation is indicated 
in the left-hand top corner of the part of the Table concerned.
    (3) Within each of the categories specified in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, services are listed in alphabetical order according to the 
French language. The order of listing does not indicate relative 
priority within each category.
    (4) In the case where there is a parenthetical addition to an 
allocation in the International Table, that service allocation is 
restricted to the type of operation so indicated.
    (5) The footnote references which appear in the International Table 
below the allocated service or services apply to the whole of the 
allocation concerned.
    (6) The footnote references which appear to the right of the name of 
a service are applicable only to that particular service.
    (7) In certain cases, the names of countries appearing in the 
footnotes have been simplified in order to shorten the text.

Sec. 2.105  United States Table of Frequency Allocations.

    (a) The United States Table of Frequency Allocations (United States 
Table) is subdivided into the Federal Government Table of Frequency 
Allocations (Federal Government Table, column 4 of Sec. 2.106) and the 
Non-Federal Government Table of Frequency Allocations (Non-Federal 
Government Table, column 5 of Sec. 2.106). The United States Table is 
based on the Region 2 Table because the relevant area of jurisdiction is 
located primarily in Region 2 \1\ (i.e., the 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, the Caribbean insular areas \2\ and some of the Pacific 
insular areas).\3\ \4\ The Federal Government Table is administered by 
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) 
\5\, whereas the Non-Federal Government Table is administered by the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Sec. 2.104(a)(1) for definition of Region 2.
    \2\ The Caribbean insular areas are: The Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico; the unincorporated territory of the United States Virgin Islands; 
and Navassa Island.
    \3\ The Pacific insular areas located in Region 2 are: Johnston 
Atoll and Midway Atoll.
    \4\ The operation of stations in the Pacific insular areas located 
in Region 3 are generally governed by the International plan for Region 
3 (i.e., column 3 of Sec. 2.106). The Pacific insular areas located in 
Region 3 are: the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; the 
unincorporated territory of American Samoa; the unincorporated territory 
of Guam; and Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Kingman Reef, 
Palmyra Island and Wake Island.
    \5\ Section 305(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. 
See Pub. Law 102-538, 106 Stat. 3533 (1992).
    \6\ The Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) In the United States, radio spectrum may be allocated to either 
Federal government or non-Federal government use exclusively, or for 
shared use. In the case of shared use, the type of service(s) permitted 
need not be the same [e.g., Federal government FIXED, non-Federal 
government MOBILE]. The terms used to designate categories of services 
and allocations \7\ in columns 4 and 5 of Sec. 2.106 correspond to the 
terms employed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the 
international Radio Regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Definitions of the various radio services used are contained in 
Sec. 2.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Category of services. (1) Any segment of the radio spectrum may 
be allocated to the Federal government and/or non-Federal government 
sectors either on an exclusive or shared basis for use by one or more 
radio services. In the case where an allocation has been made to more 
than one service, such services are listed in the following order:
    (i) Services, the names of which are printed in ``capitals'' 
[example: FIXED]; these are called ``primary'' services;
    (ii) Services, the names of which are printed in ``normal 
characters'' [example: Mobile]; these are called ``secondary'' services.
    (2) Stations of a secondary service:
    (i) Shall not cause harmful interference to stations of primary 
services to which frequencies are already assigned or to which 
frequencies may be assigned at a later date;
    (ii) Cannot claim protection from harmful interference from stations 
of a primary service to which frequencies are already assigned or may be 
assigned at a later date; and
    (iii) Can claim protection, however, from harmful interference from 
stations of the same or other secondary service(s) to which frequencies 
may be assigned at a later date.
    (d) Format of the United States Table and the Rule Part Cross 
Reference Column. (1) The frequency band referred to in each allocation, 
column 4 for Federal government and column 5 for non-Federal government, 
is indicated in the left-hand top corner of the column. If there is no 
service or footnote indicated for a band of frequencies in either column 
4 or 5, then the Federal government or the non-Federal government 
sector, respectively, has no access to that band except as provided for 
by Sec. 2.102.
    (2) When the Federal Government and Non-Federal Government Tables 
are exactly the same for a shared band, the line between columns 4 and 5 
is deleted and the allocations are shown once.
    (3) The Federal Government Table, given in column 4, is included for 
informational purposes only.

[[Page 405]]

    (4) In the case where there is a parenthetical addition to an 
allocation in the United States Table [example: FIXED-SATELLITE (space-
to-earth)], that service allocation is restricted to the type of 
operation so indicated.
    (5) The following symbols are used to designate footnotes in the 
United States Table:
    (i) Any footnote consisting of ``S5.'' followed by one or more 
digits, e.g., S5.53, or any footnote not prefixed by a letter, e.g., 
459, denotes an international footnote. Where an international footnote 
is applicable, without modification, to the United States Table, the 
footnote appears in the United States Table (columns 4 and 5) and 
denotes a stipulation affecting both the Federal Government Table and 
the Non-Federal Government Table. If, however, an international footnote 
pertains to a service allocated only for Federal government or non-
Federal government use, the international footnote will be placed only 
in the affected Table. For example, ``AMATEUR S5.142'' shall be shown 
only in the Non-Federal Government Table.
    (ii) Any footnote consisting of the letters US followed by one or 
more digits, e.g., US7, denotes a stipulation affecting both the Federal 
Government Table and the Non-Federal Government Table.
    (iii) Any footnote consisting of the letters NG followed by one or 
more digits, e.g., NG2, denotes a stipulation applicable only to the 
Non-Federal Government Table (column 5).
    (iv) Any footnote consisting of the letter G following by one or 
more digits, e.g., G2, denotes a stipulation applicable only to the 
Federal Government Table (column 4).
    (6) If a frequency or frequency band has been allocated to a 
radiocommunication service in the Non-Federal Government Table, then a 
cross reference may be added for the pertinent FCC Rule part (column 6 
of Sec. 2.106). For example, the 849-851 MHz band is allocated to the 
non-Federal government aeronautical mobile service, rules for the use of 
the 849-851 MHz band have been added to Part 22--Public Mobile Services 
(47 CFR part 22), and a cross reference, Public Mobile (22), has been 
added in Column 6 of the Table. The exact use that can be made of any 
given frequency or frequency band (e.g., channelling plans, allowable 
emissions, etc.) is given in the FCC Rule part(s) so indicated. The FCC 
Rule parts in this column are not allocations and are provided for 
informational purposes only. This column also may contain explanatory 
notes for informational purposes only.

                         International Footnotes

    Note: The International Telecommunication Union has re-numbered 
international footnotes using a new numbering scheme and has 
substantively revised the text of certain of these international 
footnotes. These international footnotes shall be listed immediately 
below this note in I. Until such time

[[Page 496]]

as the Commission has considered the substantively revised international 
footnotes that have previously been adopted domestically, certain of the 
old international footnotes shall apply in the United States. These 
footnotes appear immediately after footnote 5.565 in II.

                         I. New Numbering Scheme

    5.53 Administrations authorizing the use of frequencies below 9 kHz 
shall ensure that no harmful interference is caused thereby to the 
services to which the bands above 9 kHz are allocated.
    5.54 Administrations conducting scientific research using 
frequencies below 9 kHz are urged to advise other administrations that 
may be concerned in order that such research may be afforded all 
practicable protection from harmful interference.
    5.55 Additional allocation: in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, 
Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and 
Turkmenistan, the band 14-17 kHz is also allocated to the 
radionavigation service on a primary basis.
    5.56 The stations of services to which the bands 14-19.95 kHz and 
20.05-70 kHz and in Region 1 also the bands 72-84 kHz and 86-90 kHz are 
allocated may transmit standard frequency and time signals. Such 
stations shall be afforded protection from harmful interference. In 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakstan, Mongolia, 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Slovakia, the Czech Rep., Russian Federation, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Ukraine, the frequencies 25 kHz and 50 kHz 
will be used for this purpose under the same conditions.
    5.57 The use of the bands 14-19.95 kHz, 20.05-70 kHz and 70-90 kHz 
(72-84 kHz and 86-90 kHz in Region 1) by the maritime mobile service is 
limited to coast radiotelegraph stations (A1A and F1B only). 
Exceptionally, the use of class J2B or J7B emissions is authorized 
subject to the necessary bandwidth not exceeding that normally used for 
class A1A or F1B emissions in the band concerned.
    5.58 Additional allocation: in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, 
Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and 
Turkmenistan, the band 67-70 kHz is also allocated to the 
radionavigation service on a primary basis.
    5.59 Different category of service: in Bangladesh and Pakistan, the 
allocation of the bands 70-72 kHz and 84-86 kHz to the fixed and 
maritime mobile services is on a primary basis (see No. 5.33).
    5.60 In the bands 70-90 kHz (70-86 kHz in Region 1) and 110-130 kHz 
(112-130 kHz in Region 1), pulsed radionavigation systems may be used on 
condition that they do not cause harmful interference to other services 
to which these bands are allocated.
    5.61 In Region 2, the establishment and operation of stations in the 
maritime radionavigation service in the bands 70-90 kHz and 110-130 kHz 
shall be subject to agreement obtained under No. 9.21 with 
administrations whose services, operating in accordance with the Table, 
may be affected. However, stations of the fixed, maritime mobile and 
radiolocation services shall not cause harmful interference to stations 
in the maritime radionavigation service established under such 
agreements.
    5.62 Administrations which operate stations in the radionavigation 
service in the band 90-110 kHz are urged to coordinate technical and 
operating characteristics in such a way as to avoid harmful interference 
to the services provided by these stations.
    5.64 Only classes A1A or F1B, A2C, A3C, F1C or F3C emissions are 
authorized for stations of the fixed service in the bands allocated to 
this service between 90 kHz and 160 kHz (148.5 kHz in Region 1) and for 
stations of the maritime mobile service in the bands allocated to this 
service between 110 kHz and 160 kHz (148.5 kHz in Region 1). 
Exceptionally, class J2B or J7B emissions are also authorized in the 
bands between 110 kHz and 160 kHz (148.5 kHz in Region 1) for stations 
of the maritime mobile service.
    5.65 Different category of service: in Bangladesh, the allocation of 
the bands 112-117.6 kHz and 126-129 kHz to the fixed and maritime mobile 
services is on a primary basis (see No. 5.33).
    5.66 Different category of service: in Germany, the allocation of 
the band 115-117.6 kHz to the fixed and maritime mobile services is on a 
primary basis (see No. 5.33) and to the radionavigation service on a 
secondary basis (see No. 5.32).
    5.67 Additional allocation: in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Mongolia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Romania and Turkmenistan, the band 130-148.5 kHz is also 
allocated to the radionavigation service on a secondary basis. Within 
and between these countries this service shall have an equal right to 
operate.
    5.68 Alternative allocation: in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, the 
Congo, Malawi, Dem. Rep. of the Congo, Rwanda and South Africa, the band 
160-200 kHz is allocated to the fixed service on a primary basis.
    5.69 Additional allocation: in Somalia, the band 200-255 kHz is also 
allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation service on a primary 
basis.
    5.70 Alternative allocation: in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, 
the Central African Rep., the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, 
Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Oman, Dem. Rep. of the 
Congo, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Chad, Zambia and 
Zimbabwe, the band 200-283.5 kHz is allocated to the aeronautical 
radionavigation service on a primary basis.

[[Page 497]]

    5.71 Alternative allocation: in Tunisia, the band 255-283.5 kHz is 
allocated to the broadcasting service on a primary basis.
    5.72 Norwegian stations of the fixed service situated in northern 
areas (north of 60[deg] N) subject to auroral disturbances are allowed

applications in the fixed service (see Resolutions 75 (WRC-2000) and 79 
(WRC-2000)). Administrations should take this into account when 
considering regulatory provisions in relation to these bands. Because of 
the potential deployment of high-density applications in the fixed-
satellite service in the bands 39.5-40 GHz and 40.5-42 GHz, 
administrations should further take into account potential constraints 
to high-density applications in the fixed service, as appropriate (see 
Resolution 84 (WRC-2000)).
    5.547A Administrations should take practical measures to minimize 
the potential interference between stations in the fixed service and 
airborne stations in the radionavigation service in the 31.8-33.4 GHz 
band, taking into account the operational needs of the airborne radar 
systems.

primary basis.
    5.551AA In the bands 37.5-40 GHz and 42-42.5 GHz, non-geostationary-
satellite systems in the fixed-satellite service should employ power 
control or other methods of downlink fade compensation of the order of 
10 dB, such that the satellite transmissions are at power levels 
required to meet the desired link performance while reducing the level 
of interference to the fixed service. The use of downlink fade 
compensation methods are under study by the ITU-R (see Resolution 84 
(WRC-2000)).
    5.551F Different category of service: in Japan, the allocation of 
the band 41.5-42.5 GHz to the mobile service is on a primary basis (see

objects undergoing flight tests. The following frequencies are shared 
with flight telemetry mobile stations: 1444.5, 1453.5, 1501.5, 1515.5, 
1524.5 and 1525.5 MHz.
    US80 Government stations may use the frequency 122.9 MHz subject to 
the following conditions:
    (a) All operations by Government stations shall be restricted to the 
purpose for which the frequency is authorized to non-Government 
stations, and shall be in accordance with the appropriate provisions of 
the Commission's Rules and Regulations, Part 87, Aviation Services;
    (b) Use of the frequency is required for coordination of activities 
with Commission licensees operating on this frequency; and
    (c) Government stations will not be authorized for operation at 
fixed locations.
    US81 The band 38.0-38.25 MHz is used by both Government and non-
Government radio astronomy observatories. No new fixed or mobile 
assignments are to be made and Government stations in the band 38.0-
38.25 MHz will be moved to other bands on a case-by-case basis, as 
required, to protect radio astronomy observations from harmful 
interference. As an exception, however, low powered military 
transportable and mobile stations used for tactical and training 
purposes will continue to use the band. To the extent practicable, the 
latter operations will be adjusted to relieve such interference as may 
be caused to radio astronomy observations. In the event of harmful 
interference from such local operations, radio astronomy observatories 
may contact local military commands directly, with a view to effecting 
relief. A list of military commands, areas of coordination, and points 
of contact for purposes of relieving interference may be obtained upon 
request from the Office of the Chief Engineer, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554.
    US82 The assignable frequencies in the bands 4146-4152 kHz, 6224-
6233 kHz, 8294-8300 kHz, 12353-12368 kHz, 16528-16549 kHz, 18825-18846 
kHz, 22159-22180 kHz, and 25100-25121 kHz may be authorized on a shared 
non-priority basis to Federal and non-Federal Government ship and coast 
stations (SSB telephony, with peak envelope power not to exceed 1 kW).
    US87 The frequency 450 MHz, with maximum emission bandwidth of 500 
kHz, may be used by Government and non-Government stations for space 
telecommand at specific locations, subject to such conditions as may be 
applied on a case-by-case basis.
    US90 In the band 2025-2110 MHz, the power flux-density at the 
Earth's surface produced by emissions from a space station in the space 
operation, Earth exploration-satellite, or space research services that 
is transmitting in the space-to-space direction, for all conditions and 
all methods of modulation, shall not exceed the following values in any 
4 kHz sub-band:
    (a) -154 dBW/m\2\ for angles of arrival above the horizontal plane 
([delta]) of 0[deg] to 5[deg],
    (b) -154 + 0.5([delta]-5) dBW/m\2\ for [delta] of 5[deg] to 25[deg], 
and
    (c) -144 dBW/m\2\ for [delta] of 25[deg] to 90[deg].
    US93 In the conterminous United States, the frequency 108.0 MHz may 
be authorized for use by VOR test facilities, the operation of which is 
not essential for the safety of life or property, subject to the 
condition that no interference is caused to the reception of FM 
broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz. In the event 
that such interference does occur, the licensee or other agency 
authorized to operate the facility shall discontinue operation on 108 
MHz and shall not resume operation until the interference has been 
eliminated or the complaint otherwise satisfied. VOR test facilities 
operating on 108 MHz will not be protected against interference caused 
by FM broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz not shall 
the authorization of a VOR test facility on 108 MHz preclude the 
Commission from authorizing additional FM broadcasting stations.
    US99 In the band 1668.4-1670.0 MHz, the meteorological aids service 
(radiosonde) will avoid operations to the maximum extent practicable. 
Whenever it is necessary to operate radiosondes in the band 1668.4-1670 
MHz within the United States, notification of the operations shall be 
sent as far in advance as possible to the Electromagnetic Management 
Unit, National Science Foundation, Washington, D.C. 20550.
    US102 In Alaska only, the frequency 122.1 MHz may also be used for 
air carrier air traffic control purposes at locations where other 
frequencies are not available to air carrier aircraft stations for air 
traffic control.
    US104 The LORAN Radionavigation System has priority in the band 90-
110 kHz in the United States and its insular areas. Radiolocation land 
stations making use of LORAN-type equipment may be authorized to both 
Federal and non-Federal Government licensees on a secondary basis for 
offshore radiolocation activities only at specific locations and subject 
to such technical and operational conditions (e.g., power, emission, 
pulse rate and phase code, hours of operation), including on-the-air 
testing, as may be required on a case-by-case basis to ensure protection 
of the LORAN radionavigation system from harmful interference and to 
ensure mutual compatibility among radiolocation operators. Such 
authorizations to stations in the radiolocation service are further 
subject to showing of need for service which is not currently provided 
and which

[[Page 537]]

the Federal Government is not yet prepared to render by way of the 
radionavigation service.
    US106 The frequency 156.75 MHz is available for assignment to non-
Government and Government stations for environmental communications in 
accordance with an agreed plan.
    US107 The frequency 156.8 MHz is the national distress, safety and 
calling frequency for the maritime mobile VHF radiotelephone service for 
use by Government and non-Government ship and coast stations. Guard 
bands of 156.7625-156.7875 and 156.8125-156.8375 MHz are maintained.
    US108 Within the bands 3300-3500 MHz and 10000-10500 MHz, survey 
operations, using transmitters with a peak power not to exceed five 
watts into the antenna, may be authorized for Government and non-

GHz, 24.05-24.25 GHz and 33.4-36.0 GHz, the non-Government radiolocation 
service shall be secondary to the Government radiolocation service and 
to airborne doppler radars at 8800 MHz, and shall provide protection to 
airport surface detection equipment (ASDE) operating between 15.7-16.2 
GHz.
    US112 The frequency 123.1 MHz is for search and rescue 
communications. This frequency may be assigned for air traffic control 
communications at special aeronautical events on the condition that no 
harmful interference is caused to search and rescue communications 
during any period of search and rescue operations in the licale 
involved.
    US116 In the bands 890-902 MHz and 935-941 MHz, no new assignments 
are to be made to Government radio stations after July 10, 1970 except 
on case-by-case basis, to experimental stations and to additional 
stations of existing networks in Alaska. Government assignments existing 
prior to July 10 1970 to stations in Alaska may be continued. All other 
existing Government assignments shall be on a secondary basis to 
stations in the non-Government land mobile service and shall be subject 
to adjustment or removal from the bands 890-902 MHz, 928-932 MHz and 
935-941 MHz at the request of the FCC.
    US117 In the band 406.1-410 MHz, all new authorizations will be 
limited to a maximum 7 watts per kHz of necessary bandwidth; existing 
authorizations as of November 30, 1970 exceeding this power are 
permitted to continue in use.
    New authorizations in this band stations, other than mobile 
stations, within the following areas are subject to prior coordination 
by the applicant through the Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit,

surface of the Earth produced by emissions from a Government space 
station in an NGSO constellation of 51 or more satellites, for all 
conditions and for all methods of modulation, shall not exceed the 
following values in any 1 MHz band:
    (1) -115 -X dB(W/m \2\) for [delta] between 0[deg] and 5[deg],
    (2) -115 -X + ((10 + X)/20) ([delta]-5) dB(W/m \2\) for [delta] 
between 5[deg] and 25[deg], and
    (3) -105 dB(W/m \2\) for [delta] between 25[deg] and 90[deg]; where 
X is defined as a function of the number of satellites, n, in an NGSO 
constellation as follows:
    For n [le] 288, X = (5/119) (n-50) dB; and
    For n <ls-thn-eq> 288, X = (1/69) (n+ 402) dB.
    US335 The primary Government and non-Government allocations for the 
various segments of the 220-222 MHz band are divided as follows: (1) the

band segments are also available for temporary fixed geophysical 
telemetry operations on a secondary basis to the fixed and mobile 
services.
    US337 In the band 13.75-13.80 GHz, earth stations in the fixed-
satellite service shall be coordinated on a case-by-case basis through 
the frequency assignment subcommittee in order to minimize harmful 
interference tothe Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System's forward 
space-to-space link (TDRSS forward link-to-LEO).
    US338 In the 2305-2310 MHz band, space-to-Earth operations are 
prohibited. Additionally, in the 2305-2320 MHz band, all Wireless 
Communications Service (WCS) operations within 50 kilometers of 35[deg] 
20[sec] North Latitude and 116[deg] 53[sec] West Longitude shall be 
coordinated through the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee of the 
Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee in order to minimize harmful 
interference to NASA's Goldstone Deep Space facility.
    US339 The bands 2310-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz are also available for 
aeronautical telemetering and associated telecommand operations for 
flight testing of manned or unmanned aircraft, missiles or major 
components thereof on a secondary basis to the Wireless Communications 
Service. The following two frequencies are shared on a co-equal basis by 
Government and non-Government stations for telemetering and associated 
telecommand operations of expendable and re-usable launch vehicles 
whether or not such operations involve flight testing: 2312.5 and 2352.5 
MHz. Other mobile telemetering uses may be provided on a non-
interference basis to the above uses. The broadcasting-satellite (sound) 
service during implementation should also take cognizance of the 
expendable and reusable launch vehicle frequencies 2312.5 and 2352.5 
MHz, to minimize the impact on this mobile service use to the extent 
possible.

are allocated (* indicates radio astronomy use for spectral line 
observations), all practicable steps shall be taken to protect the radio 
astronomy service from harmful interference. Emissions from spaceborne 
or air-borne stations can be particularly serious sources of 
interference to the radio astronomy service (see Nos. 4.5 and 4.6 and 
Article 29 of the ITU Radio Regulations).
    US344 In the band 5091-5250 MHz, non-Government earth stations in 
the fixed-satellite service (Earth-to-space) shall be coordinated 
through the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (see Recommendation ITU-R 
S.1342). In order to better protect the operation of the international 
standard system (microwave landing system) in the band 5000-5091 MHz, 
non-Government tracking and telecommand operations should be conducted 
in the band 5150-5250 MHz.
    US345 In the band 402-405 MHz, the mobile, except mobile 
aeronautical, service is allocated on a secondary basis and is limited 
to, with the exception of military tactical mobile stations, Medical 
Implant Communications Service (MICS) operations. MICS stations are 
authorized by rule on the condition that harmful interference is not 
caused to stations in the meteorological aids, meteorological-satellite, 
and earth exploration-satellite services, and that MICS stations accept 
interference from stations in the meteorological aids, meteorological-
satellite, and earth exploration-satellite services.
    US346 Except as provided by footnote US222, the use of the band 
2025-2110 MHz by the Government space operation service (Earth-to-
space), Earth exploration-satellite service (Earth-to-space), and space 
research service (Earth-to-space) shall not constrain the deployment of 
the Television Broadcast Auxiliary Service, the Cable Television Relay 
Service, or the Local Television Transmission Service. To facilitate 
compatible operations between non-Government terrestrial receiving 
stations at fixed sites and Government earth station transmitters, 
coordination is required. To facilitate compatible operations between 
non-government terrestrial transmitting stations and Government 
spacecraft receivers, the terrestrial transmitters shall not be high-
density systems (see Recommendations ITU-R SA.1154 and ITU-R F.1247).
    US347 In the band 2025-2110 MHz, non-Government Earth-to-space and 
space-to-space transmissions may be authorized in the space research and 
Earth exploration-satellite services subject to such conditions as may 
be applied on a case-by-case basis. Such transmissions shall not cause 
harmful interference to Government and non-Government stations operating 
in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations.
    US348 The band 3650-3700 MHz is also allocated to the Government 
radiolocation service on a primary basis at the following sites: St. 
Inigoes, MD (38[deg] 10[min] N., 76[deg] 23[min] W.); Pascagoula, MS 
(30[deg] 22[min] N., 88[deg] 29[min] W.); and Pensacola, FL (30[deg] 
21[min] 28[min] N., 87[deg] 16[min] 26[min] W.). All fixed and fixed 
satellite operations within 80 kilometers of these sites shall be 
coordinated through the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee of the 
Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee on a case-by-case basis.
    US349 The band 3650-3700 MHz is also allocated to the Government 
radiolocation service on a non-interference basis for use by

ship stations located at least 44 nautical miles in off-shore ocean 
areas on the condition that harmful interference is not caused to non-
Government operations.
    US350 In the bands 608-614 MHz and 1395-1400 MHz the Government and 
non-Government land mobile service is limited to medical telemetry and 
medical telecommand operations. Availability and use of medical

85 dBW. In addition the e.i.r.p., averaged over one second, radiated by 
a station in the radiolocation service shall not exceed 59 dBW. 
Receiving space stations in the fixed-satellite service shall not claim 
protection from radiolocation transmitting stations operating in 
accordance with the United States Table of Frequency Allocations. ITU 
Radio Regulation No. 5.43A does not apply.
    US357 In the band 13.75-14 GHz, geostationary space stations in the 
space research service for which information for advance publication has 
been received by the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau (Bureau) prior to 31 
January 1992 shall operate on an equal basis with stations in the fixed-
satellite service; after that date, new geostationary space stations in 
the space research service will operate on a secondary basis. Until 
those geostationary space stations in the space research service for 
which information for advance publication has been received by the 
Bureau prior to 31 January 1992 cease to operate in this band:
    a. The e.i.r.p. density of emissions from any earth station in the 
fixed-satellite service operating with a space station in geostationary-
satellite orbit shall not exceed 71 dBW in any 6 MHz band from 13.77 to 
13.78 GHz;
    b. The e.i.r.p. density of emissions from any earth station in the 
fixed-satellite service operating with a space station in non-
geostationary-satellite orbit shall not exceed 51 dBW in any 6 MHz band 
from 13.77 to 13.78 GHz.
    Automatic power control may be used to increase the e.i.r.p. density 
in any 6 MHz band in these frequency ranges to compensate for rain 
attenuation, to the extent that the power flux-density at the fixed-
satellite service space station does not exceed the value resulting from 
use by an earth station of an e.i.r.p. of 71 dBW or 51 dBW, as 
appropriate, in any 6 MHz band in clear-sky conditions.
    US359 In the band 15.43-15.63 GHz, use of the fixed-satellite 
service (Earth-to-space) is limited to non-Government feeder links of 
non-geostationary systems in the mobile-satellite service. These non-
Government earth stations shall be coordinated through the Frequency 
Assignment Subcommittee (see Annex 3 of Recommendation ITU-R S.1340).
    US360 In the band 33-36 GHz, the Government fixed-satellite service 
(space-to-Earth) is also allocated on a primary basis. Coordination 
between Government fixed-satellite service systems and non-Government 
systems operating in accordance with the United States Table of 
Frequency Allocations is required.
    US361 In the band 1432-1435 MHz, Government stations in the fixed 
and mobile services may operate indefinitely on a primary basis at the 
23 sites listed in the following table. All other Government stations in 
the fixed and mobile services shall operate in the band 1432-1435 MHz on 
a primary basis until re-accommodated in accordance with the National 
Defense Authorization Act of 1999. The table follows:

    US364 Consistent with US18, stations may be authorized on a primary 
basis in the band 285-325 kHz for the specific purpose of transmitting 
differential global positioning system information.
    US366 On April 1, 2007, the bands 5900-5950 kHz, 7300-7350 kHz, 
9400-9500 kHz, 11600-11650 kHz, 12050-12100 kHz, 13570-13600 kHz, 13800-
13870 kHz, 15600-15800 kHz, 17480-17550 kHz, and 18900-19020 kHz shall 
be allocated exclusively to the broadcasting service. Beginning April 1, 
2007, frequencies in these bands may be used by stations in the fixed 
and mobile services, communicating only within the United States and its 
insular areas, on the condition that harmful interference is not caused 
to the broadcasting service. When using frequencies for fixed and mobile 
services, licensees shall be limited to the minimum power needed to 
achieve communications and shall take account of the seasonal use of 
frequencies by the broadcasting service published in accordance with 
Article 12 of the ITU Radio Regulations.
    US367 On the condition that harmful interference is not caused to 
the broadcasting service, frequencies in the bands 9775-9900 kHz, 11650-
11700 kHz, and 11975-12050 kHz may be used by Federal Government 
stations in the fixed service communicating within the United States and 
its insular areas that are authorized as of [effective date of the 
Report and Order published in the Federal Register]. Each such station 
shall be limited to a total radiated power of 24 dBW.
    US368 The band 1390-1392 MHz is also allocated to the fixed-
satellite service (Earth-to-space) on a primary basis and the band 1430-
1432 MHz is also allocated to the fixed-satellite service (space-to-
Earth) on a primary basis, limited to feeder links for the Non-Voice 
Non-Geostationary Mobile-Satellite Service, and contingent on (1) the 
completion of sharing studies including the measurement of emissions 
from equipment that would be employed in operational systems and 
demonstrations to validate the studies as called for in Resolution 127 
(WRC-2000), (2) the adoption of worldwide feeder link allocations at the 
2003 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-03), and (3) compliance 
with any technical and operational requirements that may be imposed at 
WRC-03 to protect passive services in the 1400-1427 MHz band from 
unwanted emissions associated with such allocations. These allocations 
become effective upon adoption of worldwide allocations at WRC-03. If no 
such allocations are adopted by WRC-03, these allocations shall be 
considered null and void, with no grandfathering of rights. Individual 
assignments shall be coordinated with the Interdepartmental Radio 
Advisory Committee's (IRAC) Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS) 
(see, for example, Recommendations ITU-R RA.769-1 and ITU R SA.1029-1) 
to ensure the protection of passive services in the 1400-1427 MHz band. 
Coordination shall not be completed until the feeder downlink system is 
tested and certified to be in conformance with the technical and 
operational requirements for the protection of passive services in the 
1400-1427 MHz band. Certification and all supporting documentation shall 
be submitted to the Commission and FAS prior to launch.
    US369 Additional allocation: the bands 150-151 GHz, 174.42-175.02 
GHz, 177-177.4 GHz, 178.2-178.6 GHz, 181-181.46 GHz, 186.2-186.6 GHz and 
257.5-258 GHz are also allocated to the radio astronomy service on a 
secondary basis for spectral line observations.
    US370 The band 5000-5150 MHz is to be used for the operation of the 
international standard system (microwave landing system) for precision 
approach and landing. The requirements of this system shall take 
precedence over other uses of this band. For the use of this band, ITU 
Radio Regulation No. 5.444A and Resolution 114 (WRC-95) apply.
    US371 In the bands 134-142 GHz and 190-191.8 GHz, satellite links 
connecting land stations at specified fixed points are also authorized 
when used in conjunction with the mobile-satellite service or the 
radionavigation-satellite service.
    US372 Additional allocation: the bands 140.69-140.98 GHz, 144.68-
144.98 GHz, 145.45-145.75 GHz, 146.82-147.12 GHz, 250-251 GHz and 
262.24-262.76 GHz are also allocated to the radio astronomy service on a 
primary basis.
    US373 In the bands 116-134 GHz, 174.8-182 GHz and 185-190 GHz, 
stations in the aeronautical mobile service may be operated subject to 
not causing harmful interference to the inter-satellite service (see ITU 
Radio Regulation No. 5.43).
    US374 In the band 126-134 GHz, airborne radars in the radiolocation 
service may be operated subject to not causing harmful interference to 
the inter-satellite service (see ITU Radio Regulation No. 5.43).
    US375 The frequency band 275-400 GHz may be used by administrations 
for experimentation with, and development of, various active and passive 
services. In this band a need has been identified for the following 
spectral line measurements for passive services:

--Radio astronomy service: 278-280 GHz and 343-348 GHz;
--Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) and space research 
service (passive): 275-277 GHz, 300-302 GHz, 324-326 GHz, 345-347 GHz, 
363-365 GHz and 379-381 GHz.

    Future research in this largely unexplored spectral region may yield 
additional spectral lines and continuum bands of interest to the passive 
services. Administrations are urged to take all practicable steps to 
protect these passive services from harmful interference until the next 
competent world radiocommunication conference.

[[Page 552]]

    US376 In the bands 95-100 GHz, 134-142 GHz, 190-200 GHz and 252-265 
GHz, stations in the land mobile service may be operated subject to not 
causing harmful interference to the space radiocommunication services to 
which these bands are allocated (see No. 5.43).
    US377 In the band 84-86 GHz, stations in the fixed, mobile and 
broadcasting services shall not cause harmful interference to 
broadcasting-satellite stations operating in accordance with the 
decisions of the appropriate frequency assignment planning conference 
for the broadcasting-satellite service.
    US378 In the band 1710-1755 MHz, Federal government stations in the 
fixed and mobile services shall operate on a primary basis until

MHz, the fixed and mobile services are all allocated on a primary basis 
to the Government non-military agencies.
    G6 Military tactical fixed and mobile operations may be conducted 
nationally on a secondary basis: (1) To the meteorological aids service 
in the band 403-406 MHz; and (2) to the radio astronomy service in the 
band 406.1-410 MHz. Such fixed and mobile operations are subject to 
local coordination to ensure that harmful interference will not be 
caused to the services to which the bands are allocated.
    G8 Low power Government radio control operations are permitted in 
the band 420-450 MHz.
    G11 Government fixed and mobile radio services, including low power

secondary basis.
    G15 Use of the band 2700-2900 MHz by the military fixed and 
shipborne air defense radiolocation installations will be fully 
coordinated with the meteorological aids and aeronautical 
radionavigation services. The military air defense installations will be 
moved from the band 2700-2900 MHz at the earliest practicable date. 
Until such time as military air defense installations can be 
accommodated satisfactorily elsewhere in the spectrum, such operations 
will, insofar as practicable, be adjusted to meet the requirements of 
the aeronautical radionavigation service.
    G19 Use of the band 9000-9200 MHz by military fixed and shipborne 
air defense radiolocation installations will be fully coordinated with 
the aeronautical radionavigation

[[Page 558]]

service, recognizing fully the safety aspects of the latter. Military 
air defense installations will be accommodated ultimately outside this 
band. Until such time as military defense installations can be 
accommodated satisfactorily elsewhere in the spectrum such operations 
will, insofar as practicable, be adjusted to meet the requirements of 
the aeronautical radionavigation services.
    G27 In the bands 255-328.6 MHz, 335.4-399.9 MHz, and 1350-1390 MHz,

to the military services.
    G34 In the band 34.4-34.5 GHz, weather radars on board 
meteorological satellites for cloud detection are authorized to operate 
on the basis of equality with military radiolocation devices. All other 
non-military radiolocation in the band 33.4-36.0 GHz shall be secondary 
to the military services.
    G42 Space command, control, range and range rate systems for earth 
station transmission only (including installations on certain Navy 
ships) may be accommodated on a co-equal basis with the fixed and mobile 
services in the band 1761-1842 MHz. Specific frequencies required to be 
used at any location will be satisfied on a coordinated case-by-case 
basis.
    G56 Government radiolocation in the bands 1215-1300, 2900-3100, 
5350-5650 and 9300-9500 MHz is primarily for the military services; 
however, limited secondary use is permitted by other Government agencies

24.05-24.25 GHz, all Government non-military radiolocation shall be 
secondary to military radiolocation, except in the sub-band 15.7-16.2 
GHz airport surface detection equipment (ASDE) is permitted on a co-
equal basis subject to coordination with the military departments.
    G100 The bands 235-322 MHz and 335.4-399.9 MHz are also allocated on 
a primary basis to the mobile-satellite service, limited to military 
operations.
    G104 In the bands 7450-7550 and 8175-8215 MHz, it is agreed that 
although the military space radio communication systems, which include 
earth stations near the proposed meteorological-satellite installations 
will precede the meteorological-satellite installations, engineering 
adjustments to either the military or the meteorological-satellite 
systems or both will be made as mutually required to assure compatible 
operations of the systems concerned.

a primary basis outside the conterminous United States. Within the 
conterminous United States, assignments in the fixed service are 
permitted, and will be protected for national defense purposes or, if 
they are to be used only in an emergency jeopardizing life, public 
safety, or important property under conditions calling for immediate 
communication where other means of communication do not exist.
    G116 The band 7125-7155 MHz is also allocated for earth-to-space 
transmissions in the Space Operations Service at a limited number of 
sites (not to exceed two), subject to established coordination 
procedures.

    G120 Development of airborne primary radars in the band 2310-2385 
MHz with peak transmitter power in excess of 250 watts for use in the 
United States is not permitted.

[[Page 559]]

    G122 In the bands 2390-2400 MHz, 2402-2417 MHz, and 4940-4990 MHz, 
Government operations may be authorized on a non-interference basis to 
authorized non-Government operations, but shall not hinder the 
implementation of any non-Government operations.
    G123 The bands 2300-2310 and 2400-2402 MHz were identified for 
reallocation, effective August 10, 1995, for exclusive non-Government 
use under Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. 
Effective August 10, 1995, any Government operations in these bands are 
on a non-interference basis to authorized non-Government operations and 
shall not hinder the implementation of any non-Government operations.

Sec. 2.107  Radio astronomy station notification.

    (a) Pursuant to No. 1492 of Article 13 and Section F of Appendix 3 
to the international Radio Regulations (Geneva, 1982), operators of 
radio astronomy stations desiring international recognition of their use 
of specific radio astronomy frequencies or bands of frequencies for 
reception, should file the following information with the Commission for 
inclusion in the Master International Frequency Register:
    (1) The center of the frequency band observed, in kilohertz up to 
28,000 kHz inclusive, in megahertz above 28,000 kHz to 10,500 MHz 
inclusive and in gigahertz above 10,500 MHz.
    (2) The date (actual or foreseen, as appropriate) when reception of 
the frequency band begins.
    (3) The name and location of the station, including geographical 
coordinates in degrees and minutes.
    (4) The width of the frequency band (in kHz) observed by the 
station.
    (5) The antenna type and dimensions, effective area and angular 
coverage in azimuth and elevation.
    (6) The regular hours of reception (in UTC) of the observed 
frequency.
    (7) The overall receiving system noise temperature (in kelvins) 
referred to the output of the receiving antenna.
    (8) The class of observations to be taken. Class A observations are 
those in which the sensitivity of the equipment is not a primary factor. 
Class B observations are those of such a nature that they can be made 
only with advanced low-noise receivers using the best techniques.
    (9) The name and mailing address of the operator.
    (b) The permanent discontinuance of observations, or any change to 
the information above, should also be filed with the Commission.
    (c) Observations being conducted on frequencies or frequency bands 
not allocated to the radio astronomy service should be reported as in 
paragraph (a) of this section for information purposes. Information in 
this category will

[[Page 560]]

not be submitted for entry in the Master International Frequency 
Register and protection from interference will not be afforded such 
operations by stations in other services.

Sec. 2.108  Policy regarding the use of the fixed-satellite allocations in the 3.6-3.7, 4.5-4.8, and 5.85-5.925 GHz bands.

    The use of the fixed-satellite allocations in the United States in 
the above bands will be governed by footnote US245. Use of the fixed-
satellite service allocations in these bands is for the international 
fixed-satellite service, that is, for international inter-continental 
communications. Case-by-case electromagnetic compatibility analysis is 
required with all users of the bands. It is anticipated that one earth 
station on each coast can be successfully coordinated. Specific 
locations of these earth stations depend upon service requirements and 
case-by-case EMC analyses that demonstrate compatible operations.

[49 FR 48697, Dec. 14, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 2.202  Bandwidths.

    (a) Occupied bandwidth. The frequency bandwidth such that, below its 
lower and above its upper frequency limits, the mean powers radiated are 
each equal to 0.5 percent of the total mean power radiated by a given 
emission. In some cases, for example multichannel frequency-division 
systems, the percentage of 0.5 percent may lead to certain difficulties 
in the practical application of the definitions of occupied and 
necessary bandwidth; in such cases a different percentage may prove 
useful.
    (b) Necessary bandwidth. For a given class of emission, the minimum 
value of the occupied bandwidth sufficient to ensure the transmission of 
information at the rate and with the quality required for the system 
employed, under specified conditions. Emissions useful for the good 
functioning of the receiving equipment as, for example, the emission 
corresponding to the carrier of reduced carrier systems, shall be 
included in the necessary bandwidth.
    (1) The necessary bandwidth shall be expressed by three numerals and 
one letter. The letter occupies the position of the decimal point and 
represents the unit of bandwidth. The first character shall be neither 
zero nor K, M or G.
    (2) Necessary bandwidths:

between 0.001 and 999 Hz shall be expressed in Hz (letter H);
between 1.00 and 999 kHz shall be expressed in kHz (letter K);
between 1.00 and 999 MHz shall be expressed in MHz (letter M);
between 1.00 and 999 GHz shall be expressed in GHz (letter G).

    (3) Examples:

0.002 Hz--H002
0.1 Hz--H100
25.3 Hz--25H3
400 Hz--400H
2.4 kHz--2K40
6 kHz--6K00
12.5 kHz--12K5
180.4 kHz--180K
180.5 kHz--181K
180.7 kHz--181K
1.25 MHz--1M25
2 MHz--2M00
10 MHz--10M0
202 MHz--202M
5.65 GHz--5G65

    (c) The necessary bandwidth may be determined by one of the 
following methods:
    (1) Use of the formulas included in the table, in paragraph (g) of 
this section, which also gives examples of necessary bandwidths and 
designation of corresponding emissions;

[[Page 562]]

    (2) For frequency modulated radio systems which have a substantially 
linear relationship between the value of input voltage to the modulator 
and the resulting frequency deviation of the carrier and which carry 
either single sideband suppressed carrier frequency division multiplex 
speech channels or television, computation in accordance with provisions 
of paragraph (f) of this section and formulas and methods indicated in 
the table, in paragraph (g) of this section;
    (3) Computation in accordance with Recommendations of the 
International Radio Consultative Committee (C.C.I.R.);
    (4) Measurement in cases not covered by paragraph (c) (1), (2), or 
(3) of this section.
    (d) The value so determined should be used when the full designation 
of an emission is required. However, the necessary bandwidth so 
determined is not the only characteristic of an emission to be 
considered in evaluating the interference that may be caused by that 
emission.
    (e) In the formulation of the table in paragraph (g) of this 
section, the following terms are employed:

B<INF>n</INF> = Necessary bandwidth in hertz
B = Modulation rate in bauds
N = Maximum possible number of black plus white elements to be 
transmitted per second, in facsimile
M = Maximum modulation frequency in hertz
C = Sub-carrier frequency in hertz
D = Peak frequency deviation, i.e., half the difference between the 
maximum and minimum values of the instantaneous frequency. The 
instantaneous frequency in hertz is the time rate of change in phase in 
radians divided by 2
t = Pulse duration in seconds at half-amplitude
t<INF>r</INF> = Pulse rise time in seconds between 10% and 90% of 
maximum amplitude
K = An overall numerical factor which varies according to the emission 
and which depends upon the allowable signal distortion.
N<INF>c</INF> = Number of baseband telephone channels in radio systems 
employing multichannel multiplexing
P = Continuity pilot sub-carrier frequency (Hz) (continuous signal 
utilized to verify performance of frequency-division multiplex systems).

    (f) Determination of values of D and B<INF>n</INF> for systems 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section:
    (1) Determination of D in systems for multichannel telephony:
    (i) The rms value of the per-channel deviation for the system shall 
be specified. (In the case of systems employing preemphasis or phase 
modulation, this value of per-channel deviation shall be specified at 
the characteristic baseband frequency.)
    (ii) The value of D is then calculated by multiplying the rms value 
of the per-channel deviation by the appropriate factors, as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Number of message circuits                Multiplying factors              Limits of X (P<INF>avg</INF> (dBmO))

                                          approval].

Where X represents the average power in a message circuit in dBmO; N<INF>c</INF> is the number of circuits in the
  multiplexed message load; 3.76 corresponds to a peak load factor of 11.5 dB.

    (2) The necessary bandwidth (B<INF>n</INF>) normally is considered 
to be numerically equal to:
    (i) 2M+2DK, for systems having no continuity pilot subcarrier or 
having a continuity pilot subcarrier whose frequency is not the highest 
modulating the main carrier;
    (ii) 2P+2DK, for systems having a continuity pilot subcarrier whose 
frequency exceeds that of any other signal modulating the main carrier, 
unless

[[Page 563]]

the conditions set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section are met.
    (3) As an exception to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
necessary bandwidth (B<INF>n</INF>) for such systems is numerically 
equal to 2P or 2M+2DK, whichever is greater, provided the following 
conditions are met:
    (i) The modulation index of the main carrier due to the continuity 
pilot subcarrier does not exceed 0.25, and
    (ii) In a radio system of multichannel telephony, the rms frequency 
deviation of the main carrier due to the continuity pilot subcarrier 
does not exceed 70 percent of the rms value of the per-channel 
deviation, or, in a radio system for television, the rms deviation of 
the main carrier due to the pilot does not exceed 3.55 percent of the 
peak deviation of the main carrier.

<R05>
Sec. 2.401  Distress messages.

    Each station licensee shall give absolute priority to 
radiocommunications or signals relating to ships or aircraft in 
distress; shall cease all sending on frequencies which will interfere 
with hearing a radiocommunication or signal of distress and except when 
engaged in answering or aiding the ship or aircraft in distress, shall 
refrain from sending any radiocommunications or signals until there is 
assurance that no interference will be caused with the 
radiocommunications or signals relating thereto; and shall assist the 
ship or aircraft in distress, so far as possible, by complying with its 
instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 2.402  Control of distress traffic.

    The control of distress traffic is the responsibility of the mobile 
station in distress or of the mobile station which, by the application 
of the provisions of Sec. 2.403, has sent the distress call. These 
stations may, however, delegate the control of the distress traffic to 
another station.


<R05>
Sec. 2.403  Retransmission of distress message.

    Any station which becomes aware that a mobile station is in distress 
may transmit the distress message in the following cases:
    (a) When the station in distress is not itself in a position to 
transmit the message.
    (b) In the case of mobile stations, when the master or the person in 
charge of the ship, aircraft, or other vehicles carrying the station 
which intervenes believes that further help is necessary.
    (c) In the case of other stations, when directed to do so by the 
station in control of distress traffic or when it has reason to believe 
that a distress call which it has intercepted has not been received by 
any station in a position to render aid.


<R05>
Sec. 2.404  Resumption of operation after distress.

    No station having been notified to cease operation shall resume 
operation on frequency or frequencies which may cause interference until 
notified by the station issuing the original notice that the station 
involved will not interfere with distress traffic as it is then being 
routed or until the receipt of a general notice that the need for 
handling distress traffic no longer exists.


<R05>
Sec. 2.405  Operation during emergency.

    The licensee of any station (except amateur, standard broadcast, FM 
broadcast, noncommercial educational FM broadcast, or television 
broadcast)

[[Page 570]]

may, during a period of emergency in which normal communication 
facilities are disrupted as a result of hurricane, flood, earthquake, or 
similar disaster, utilize such station for emergency communication 
service in communicating in a manner other than that specified in the 
instrument of authorization: Provided:
    (a) That as soon as possible after the beginning of such emergency 
use, notice be sent to the Commission at Washington, D.C., and to the 
Engineer in Charge of the district in which the station is located, 
stating the nature of the emergency and the use to which the station is 
being put, and
    (b) That the emergency use of the station shall be discontinued as 
soon as substantially normal communication facilities are again 
available, and
    (c) That the Commission at Washington, D.C., and the Engineer in 
Charge shall be notified immediately when such special use of the 
station is terminated: Provided further,
    (d) That in no event shall any station engage in emergency 
transmission on frequencies other than, or with power in excess of, that 
specified in the instrument of authorization or as otherwise expressly 
provided by the Commission, or by law: And provided further,
    (e) That any such emergency communication undertaken under this 
section shall terminate upon order of the Commission.

    Note: Part 73 of this chapter contains provisions governing 
emergency operation of standard, FM, noncommercial educational FM, and 
television broadcast stations. Part 97 of this chapter contains such 
provisions for amateur stations.

power amplifiers or amplifier kits may be constructed for evaluation 
purposes in preparation for the submission of an application for a grant 
of type acceptance.

    Note: For the purposes of this part, an amplifier will be deemed 
incapable of operation below 144 MHz if the amplifier is not capable of 
being easily modified to increase its amplification characteristics 
below 120 MHz, and either:
    (1) The mean output power of the amplifier decreases, as frequency 
decreases from 144 MHz, to a point where 0 decibels or less gain is 
exhibited at 120 MHz and below 120 MHz; or
    (2) The amplifier is not capable of even short periods of operation 
below 120 MHz without sustaining permanent damage to its amplification 
circuitry.

and a radiofrequency device subject to equipment authorization 
requirements are assembled in a common enclosure, the nameplate/label 
shall display the FCC Registration Number in the format specified in 
part 68 and the FCC Identifier in the format specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (3) Applications filed on or after May 1, 1981, and applications 
filed earlier requesting equipment authorization using the single system 
of identification pursuant to section (a)(1) will receive a review of 
the identification portion by the Commission's Laboratory with respect 
to nameplate/label design within 30 days after receipt at the 
Laboratory. Failure by the Laboratory to reject a nameplate design 
proposed in any particular application within this time period will 
constitute de-facto acceptance of the nameplate/label design for that 
particular equipment. Such de facto acceptance will be limited to the 
equipment covered by the particular application and will not be 
considered to establish a precedent for other applications. This review 
deadline applies only to the proposed nameplate/label design, not to the 
remainder of the application.
    (4) For a transceiver, the receiver portion of which is subject to 
verification pursuant to Sec. 15.101 of this chapter, the FCC Identifier 
required for the transmitter portion shall be preceded by the term FCC 
ID.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) In order to validate the grant of equipment authorization, the 
nameplate or label shall be permanently affixed to the equipment and 
shall be readily visible to the purchaser at the time of purchase.
    (1) As used here, permanently affixed means that the required 
nameplate data is etched, engraved, stamped, indelibly printed, or 
otherwise permanently marked on a permanently attached part of the 
equipment enclosure. Alternatively, the required information may be 
permanently marked on

[[Page 579]]

a nameplate of metal, plastic, or other material fastened to the 
equipment enclosure by welding, riveting, etc., or with a permanent 
adhesive. Such a nameplate must be able to last the expected lifetime of 
the equipment in the environment in which the equipment will be operated 
and must not be readily detachable.
    (2) As used here, readily visible means that the nameplate or 
nameplate data must be visible from the outside of the equipment 
enclosure. It is preferable that it be visible at all times during 
normal installation or use, but this is not a prerequisite for grant of 
equipment authorization.
    (e) A software defined radio may be equipped with a means such as a 
user display screen to display the FCC identification number normally 
contained in the nameplate or label. The information must be readily 
accessible, and the user manual must describe how to access the 
electronic display.
    (f) Where it is shown that a permanently affixed nameplate is not 
desirable or is not feasible, an alternative method of positively 
identifying the equipment may be used if approved by the Commission. The 
proposed alternative method of identification and the justification for 
its use must be included with the application for equipment 
authorization.

    Note: As an example, a device intended to be implanted within the 
body of a test animal or person would probably require an alternate 
method of identification.

    (g) The term FCC ID and the coded identification assigned by the 
Commission shall be in a size of type large enough to be readily 
legible, consistent with the dimensions of the equipment and its 
nameplate. However, the type size for the FCC Identifier is not required 
to be larger than eight-point.

Sec. 2.926  FCC identifier.

    (a) A grant of equipment authorization issued by the Commission will 
list the validated FCC Identifier consisting of the grantee code 
assigned by the FCC pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and the 
equipment product code assigned by the grantee pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section. See Sec. 2.925.
    (b) The grantee code assigned pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section is assigned permanently to applicants/grantees and is valid only 
for the party specified as the applicant/grantee in the code 
assignment(s).
    (c) A grantee code will have three characters consisting of Arabic 
numerals, capital letters, or combination thereof. A prospective grantee 
or his authorized representative may submit a written request to the 
Commission for assignment of a grantee code at any time. However, it is 
preferred that grantee codes be requested prior to filing applications 
for equipment authorization. If a grantee code is not requested in 
advance, one will be assigned at the time an application is received by 
the FCC Laboratory and the applicant will be notified to make any 
necessary label revisions in order to comply fully with application 
procedural rules.
    (1) After assignment of a grantee code each grantee will continue to 
use the same grantee code for subsequent equipment authorization 
applications.
    In the event the grantee name is changed or ownership is 
transferred, the circumstances shall be reported to the Commission so 
that a new grantee code can be assigned, if appropriate. See Secs. 2.934 
and 2.935 for additional information.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) The equipment product code assigned by the grantee shall consist 
of a series of Arabic numerals, capital letters or a combination 
thereof, and may include the dash or hyphen (-). Thetotal of Arabic 
numerals, capital letters and dashes or hyphens shall not exceed 14 and 
shall be one which has not been previously used in conjunction with:
    (1) The same grantee code, or
    (2) An application denied pursuant to Sec. 2.919 of this chapter.
    (e) No FCC Identifier may be used on equipment to be marketed unless 
that specific identifier has been validated by a grant of equipment 
authorization issued by the Commission. This shall

[[Page 580]]

not prohibit placement of an FCC identifier on a transceiver which 
includes a verified receiver subject to Sec. 15.101, provided that the 
transmitter portion of such transceiver is covered by a valid grant of 
type acceptance or certification. The FCC Identifier is uniquely 
assigned to the grantee and may not be placed on the equipment without 
authorization by the grantee. See Sec. 2.803 for conditions applicable 
to the display at trade shows of equipment which has not been granted 
equipment authorization where such grant is required prior to marketing. 
Labelling of such equipment may include model or type numbers, but shall 
not include a purported FCC Identifier.

           Conditions Attendant to an Equipment Authorization


<R05>
Sec. 2.927  Limitations on grants.

    (a) A grant of equipment authorization is valid only when the FCC 
Identifier is permanently affixed on the device and remains effective 
until revoked or withdrawn, rescinded, surrendered, or a termination 
date is otherwise established by the Commission.
    (b) A grant of an equipment authorization signifies that the 
Commission has determined that the equipment has been shown to be 
capable of compliance with the applicable technical standards if no 
unauthorized change is made in the equipment and if the equipment is 
properly maintained and operated. The issuance of a grant of equipment 
authorization shall not be construed as a finding by the Commission with 
respect to matters not encompassed by the Commission's rules, especially 
with respect to compliance with 18 U.S.C. 2512.
    (c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use 
or make reference to an equipment authorization in a deceptive or 
misleading manner or convey the impression that such equipment 
authorization reflects more than a Commission determination that the 
device or product has been shown to be capable of compliance with the 
applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.

grantee of an equipment authorization, written notice of such change(s) 
shall be submitted to the Commission within 30 days after the grantee 
starts using the new name and/or address.
    (d) In the case of transactions affecting the grantee, such as a 
transfer of control or sale to another company, mergers, or transfer of 
manufacturing rights, notice must be given to the Commission in writing 
within 60 days after the consummation of the transaction. Depending on 
the circumstances in each case, the Commission may require new 
applications for equipment authorization. In reaching a decision the 
Commission will consider whether the acquiring party can adequately 
ensure and accept responsibility for continued compliance with

[[Page 581]]

the regulations. In general, new applications for each device will not 
be required. A single application for equipment authorization may be 
filed covering all the affected equipment.

procedure, pursuant to Sec. 2.1043.
    (c) Permissive changes may be made in equipment that was authorized 
under the former notification procedure without submittal of information 
to the Commission, unless the equipment is currently subject to 
authorization under the certification procedure. However, the grantee 
shall submit information documenting continued compliance with the 
pertinent requirements upon request.
    (d) All requests for permissive changes submitted to the Commission 
must be accompanied by the anti-drug abuse certification required under 
Sec. 1.2002 of this chapter.
    (e) Manufacturers must take steps to ensure that only software that 
has been approved with a software defined radio can be loaded into such 
a radio. The software must not allow the user to operate the transmitter 
with frequencies, output power, modulation types or other parameters 
outside of those that were approved. Manufacturers may use 
authentication codes or any other means to meet these requirements, and 
must describe the methods in their application for equipment 
authorization.

filed the information required by this section, provided they indicate 
that they wish to perform measurement services for the public on a fee 
basis. However, it should be noted that the Commission does not endorse 
or approve any facility on this list.
    (d) If the equipment is to be authorized under a Declaration of 
Conformity, the party performing the measurements shall be accredited 
for performing such measurements by an authorized accreditation body 
based on the International Organization for Standardization/
International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Guide 25, ``General 
Requirements for the Competence of Calibration and Testing

[[Page 586]]

Laboratories.'' Accreditation bodies must be approved by the FCC's 
Office of Engineering and Technology, as indicated in Sec. 0.241 of this 
chapter, to perform such accreditation based on ISO/IEC 58, 
``Calibration and Testing Laboratory Accreditation Systems--General 
Requirements for Operation and Recognition.'' The frequency for 
revalidation of the test site and the information required to be filed 
or retained by the testing party shall comply with the requirements 
established by the accrediting organization.
    (1) In addition to meeting the above requirements, the 
accreditations of laboratories located outside of the United States or 
its possessions will be acceptable only under one of the following 
conditions:
    (i) If there is a mutual recognition agreement between that country 
and the United States and that laboratory is covered by the agreement;
    (ii) If there is an agreement between accrediting bodies that 
permits similar accreditation of U.S. facilities to perform testing for 
products marketed in that country; or
    (iii) If the country already accepts the accreditation of U.S. 
laboratories.
    (2) Organizations outside of the United States that seek to become 
accreditors may seek agreements with approved United States accrediting 
bodies to mutually recognize the accreditation of laboratories. The 
Commission will review such agreements and will consult with the Office 
of the United States Trade Representative and other Executive Branch 
agencies before accepting them for purposes of the DoC procedure in 
order to ensure that the respective foreign countries accept United 
States accreditations and do not impose additional barriers upon United 
States companies. Accrediting bodies located outside of the United 
States will only be permitted to accredit laboratories within their own 
country for DoC testing.
    (3) To facilitate use of the DoC procedure, the FCC will accept a 
laboratory that submits documentation to OET's Equipment Authorization 
Division stating that it has filed an application for accreditation with 
an approved laboratory accreditation body and provides evidence that it 
meets all aspects of ISO/IEC Guide 25. Such labs will be provisionally 
accepted by the FCC for a period of one year (until August 19, 1997) or 
until the application for accreditation has been acted upon, whichever 
is sooner. A laboratory that is denied accreditation by an approved 
accreditation body will lose its provisional acceptance. However, any 
DoCs that were issued will remain valid.

    The provisions of Sec. 2.901, et seq., shall apply to equipment 
subject to verification.


<R05>
Sec. 2.952  Limitation on verification.

    (a) Verification signifies that the manufacturer or importer has 
determined that the equipment has been shown to be capable of compliance 
with the applicable technical standards if no unauthorized change is 
made in the equipment and if the equipment is properly maintained and 
operated. Compliance with these standards shall not be construed to be a 
finding by the manufacturer or importer with respect to matters not 
encompassed by the Commission's rules.
    (b) Verification of the equipment by the manufacturer or importer is 
effective until a termination date is otherwise established by the 
Commission.
    (c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use 
or make reference to a verification in a deceptive or misleading manner 
or convey the impression that such verification reflects more than a 
determination by the manufacturer or importer that the device or product 
has been shown to be capable of compliance

[[Page 587]]

with the applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 2.953  Responsibility for compliance.

    (a) In verifying compliance, the responsible party, as defined in 
Sec. 2.909 warrants that each unit of equipment marketed under the 
verification procedure will be identical to the unit tested and found 
acceptable with the standards and that the records maintained by the 
responsible party continue to reflect the equipment being produced under 
such verification within the variation that can be expected due to 
quantity production and testing on a statistical basis.
    (b) The importer of equipment subject to verification may upon 
receiving a written statement from the manufacturer that the equipment 
complies with the appropriate technical standards rely on the 
manufacturer or independent testing agency to verify compliance. The 
test records required by Sec. 2.955 however should be in the English 
language and made available to the Commission upon a reasonable request, 
in accordance with Sec. 2.956.
    (c) In the case of transfer of control of equipment, as in the case 
of sale or merger of the grantee, the new manufacturer or importer shall 
bear the responsibility of continued compliance of the equipment.
    (d) Verified equipment shall be reverified if any modification or 
change adversely affects the emanation characteristics of the modified 
equipment. The party designated in Sec. 2.909 bears responsibility for 
continued compliance of subsequently produced equipment.

Sec. 2.960  Designation of Telecommunication Certification Bodies (TCBs).

    (a) The Commission may designate Telecommunication Certification 
Bodies (TCBs) to approve equipment as required under this part. 
Certification of equipment by a TCB shall be based on an application 
with all the information specified in this part. The TCB shall process 
the application to determine whether the product meets the Commission's 
requirements and shall issue a written grant of equipment authorization. 
The grant shall identify the TCB and the source of authority for issuing 
it.
    (b) The Federal Communications Commission shall designate TCBs in 
the United States to approve equipment subject to certification under 
the Commission's rules. TCBs shall be accredited by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under its National 
Voluntary Conformity Assessment Evaluation (NVCASE) program, or other 
recognized programs based on ISO/IEC Guide 65, to comply with the 
Commission's qualification criteria for TCBs. NIST may, in accordance 
with its procedures, allow other appropriately qualified accrediting 
bodies to accredit TCBs and testing laboratories. TCBs shall comply with 
the requirements in Sec. 2.962 of this part.
    (c) In accordance with the terms of an effective bilateral or 
multilateral mutual recognition agreement or arrangement (MRA) to which 
the United States is a party, bodies outside the United States shall be 
permitted to authorize equipment in lieu of the Commission. A body in an 
MRA partner economy may authorize equipment to U.S. requirements only if 
that economy permits bodies in the United States to authorize equipment 
to its requirements. The authority designating these telecommunication 
certification bodies shall meet the following criteria.

[[Page 589]]

    (1) The organization accrediting the prospective telecommunication 
certification body shall be capable of meeting the requirements and 
conditions of ISO/IEC Guide 61.

body shall appoint a team of qualified experts to perform the assessment 
covering all of the elements within the scope of accreditation. For 
assessment of telecommunications equipment, the areas of expertise to be 
used during the assessment shall include, but not be limited to, 
electromagnetic compatibility and telecommunications equipment (wired 
and wireless).

[64 FR 4995, Feb. 2, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 2.962  Requirements for Telecommunication Certification Bodies.

    (a) Telecommunication certification bodies (TCBs) designated by the 
Commission, or designated by another authority pursuant to an effective 
bilateral or multilateral mutual recognition agreement or arrangement to 
which the United States is a party, shall comply with the following 
requirements.
    (b) Certification methodology. (1) The certification system shall be 
based on type testing as identified in sub-clause 1.2(a) of ISO/IEC 
Guide 65.
    (2) Certification shall normally be based on testing no more than 
one unmodified representative sample of each product type for which 
certification is sought. Additional samples may be requested if clearly 
warranted, such as when certain tests are likely to render a sample 
inoperative.
    (c) Criteria for Designation. (1) To be designated as a TCB under 
this section, an entity shall, by means of accreditation, meet all the 
appropriate specifications in ISO/IEC Guide 65 for the scope of 
equipment it will certify. The accreditation shall specify the group of 
equipment to be certified and the applicable regulations for product 
evaluation.
    (2) The TCB shall demonstrate expert knowledge of the regulations 
for each product with respect to which the body seeks designation. Such 
expertise shall include familiarity with all applicable technical 
regulations, administrative provisions or requirements, as well as the 
policies and procedures used in the application thereof.
    (3) The TCB shall have the technical expertise and capability to 
test the equipment it will certify and shall also be accredited in 
accordance with ISO/IEC Guide 25 to demonstrate it is competent to 
perform such tests.
    (4) The TCB shall demonstrate an ability to recognize situations 
where interpretations of the regulations or test procedures may be 
necessary. The appropriate key certification and laboratory personnel 
shall demonstrate a knowledge of how to obtain current and correct 
technical regulation interpretations. The competence of the 
telecommunication certification body shall be demonstrated by 
assessment. The general competence, efficiency, experience, familiarity 
with technical regulations and products included in those technical 
regulations, as well as compliance with applicable parts of the ISO/IEC 
Guides 25 and 65, shall be taken into consideration.
    (5) A TCB shall participate in any consultative activities, 
identified by the Commission or NIST, to facilitate a common 
understanding and interpretation of applicable regulations.
    (6) The Commission will provide public notice of the specific 
methods that will be used to accredit TCBs, consistent with these 
qualification criteria.
    (d) Sub-contractors. (1) In accordance with the provisions of sub-
clause 4.4 of ISO/IEC Guide 65, the testing of a product, or a portion 
thereof, may be performed by a sub-contractor of a designated TCB, 
provided the laboratory has been assessed by the TCB as competent and in 
compliance with the applicable provisions of ISO/IEC Guide 65 and other 
relevant standards and guides.
    (2) When a subcontractor is used, the TCB shall be responsible for 
the test results and shall maintain appropriate oversight of the 
subcontractor to ensure reliability of the test results. Such oversight 
shall include periodic audits of products that have been tested.
    (e) Designation of TCBs. (1) The Commission will designate as a TCB 
any organization that meets the qualification

[[Page 590]]

criteria and is accredited by NIST or its recognized accreditor.
    (2) The Commission will withdraw the designation of a TCB if the 
TCB's accreditation by NIST or its recognized accreditor is withdrawn, 
if the Commission determines there is just cause for withdrawing the 
designation, or if the TCB requests that it no longer hold the 
designation. The Commission will provide a TCB with 30 days notice of 
its intention to withdraw the designation and provide the TCB with an 
opportunity to respond.
    (3) A list of designated TCBs will be published by the Commission.
    (f) Scope of responsibility. (1) TCBs shall certify equipment in 
accordance with the Commission's rules and policies.
    (2) A TCB shall accept test data from any source, subject to the 
requirements in ISO/IEC Guide 65, and shall not unnecessarily repeat 
tests.
    (3) TCBs may establish and assess fees for processing certification 
applications and other tasks as required by the Commission.
    (4) A TCB may rescind a grant of certification within 30 days of 
grant for administrative errors. After that time, a grant can only be 
revoked by the Commission through the procedures in Sec. 2.939 of this 
part. A TCB shall notify both the applicant and the Commission when a 
grant is rescinded.
    (5) A TCB may not:
    (i) Grant a waiver of the rules, or certify equipment for which the 
Commission rules or requirements do not exist or for which the 
application of the rules or requirements is unclear.
    (ii) Take enforcement actions; or
    (iii) Authorize a transfer of control of a grantee.
    (6) All TCB actions are subject to Commission review.
    (g) Post-certification requirements. (1) A TCB shall supply an 
electronic copy of each approved application form and grant of 
certification to the Commission.
    (2) In accordance with ISO/IEC Guide 65, a TCB is required to 
conduct appropriate post-market surveillance activities. These 
activities shall be based on type testing a few samples of the total 
number of product types which the certification body has certified. 
Other types of surveillance activities of a product that has been 
certified are permitted, provided they are no more onerous than testing 
type. The Commission may at any time request a list of products 
certified by the certification body and may request and receive copies 
of product evaluation reports. The Commission may also request that a 
TCB perform post-market surveillance, under Commission guidelines, of a 
specific product it has certified.
    (3) If during post market surveillance of a certified product, a 
certification body determines that a product fails to comply with the 
applicable technical regulations, the certification body shall 
immediately notify the grantee and the Commission. A follow-up report 
shall also be provided within thirty days of the action taken by the 
grantee to correct the situation.
    (4) Where concerns arise, the TCB shall provide a copy of the 
application file to the Commission within 30 calendar days of a request 
for the file made by the Commission to the TCB and the manufacturer. 
Where appropriate, the file should be accompanied by a request for 
confidentiality for any material that may qualify for confidential 
treatment under the Commission's Rules. If the application file is not 
provided within 30 calendar days, a statement shall be provided to the 
Commission as to why it cannot be provided.
    (h) In case of a dispute with respect to designation or recognition 
of a TCB and the testing or certification of products by a TCB, the 
Commission will be the final arbiter. Manufacturers and designated TCBs 
will be afforded at least 30 days to comment before a decision is 
reached. In the case of a TCB designated or recognized, or a product 
certified pursuant to an effective bilateral or multilateral mutual 
recognition agreement or arrangement (MRA) to which the United States is 
a party, the Commission may limit or withdraw its recognition of a TCB 
designated by an MRA party and revoke the certification of products 
using testing or certification provided by such a TCB. The Commission 
shall consult with the Office of the United States Trade Representative 
(USTR), as necessary, concerning any disputes arising under an

[[Page 591]]

MRA for compliance with the Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988 
(Section 1371-1382 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of

Sec. 2.1043  Changes in certificated equipment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, changes 
to the basic frequency determining and stabilizing circuitry (including 
clock or data rates), frequency multiplication stages, basic modulator 
circuit or maximum power or field strength ratings shall not be 
performed without application for and authorization of a new grant of 
certification. Variations in electrical or mechanical construction, 
other than these indicated items, are permitted provided the variations 
either do not affect the characteristics required to be reported to the 
Commission or the variations are made in compliance with the other 
provisions of this section. Changes to the software installed in a 
transmitter that do not affect the radio frequency emissions do not 
require a filing with the Commission and may be made by parties other 
than the holder of the grant of certification.
    (b) Three classes of permissive changes may be made in certificated 
equipment without requiring a new application for and grant of 
certification. None of the classes of changes shall result in a change 
in identification.
    (1) A Class I permissive change includes those modifications in the 
equipment which do not degrade the characteristics reported by the 
manufacturer and accepted by the Commission when certification is 
granted. No filing with the Commission is required for a Class I 
permissive change.
    (2) A Class II permissive change includes those modifications which 
degrade the performance characteristics as reported to the Commission at 
the time of the initial certification. Such degraded performance must 
still meet the minimum requirements of the applicable rules. When a 
Class II permissive change is made by the grantee, the grantee shall 
supply the Commission with complete information and the results of tests 
of the characteristics affected by such change. The modified equipment 
shall not be marketed under the existing grant of certification prior to 
acknowledgement by the Commission that the change is acceptable.
    (3) A Class III permissive change includes modifications to the 
software of a software defined radio transmitter that change the 
frequency, modulation type, output power or maximum field strength 
outside the parameters previously approved. When a Class III permissive 
change is made, the grantee shall supply the Commission with a 
description of the changes and test results showing that the equipment 
complies with the applicable rules with the new software loaded, 
including compliance with the applicable RF exposure requirements. The 
modified software shall not be loaded into equipment, and the equipment 
shall not be marketed with the modified software under the existing 
grant of certification, prior to acknowledgement by the Commission that 
the change is acceptable. A copy

[[Page 594]]

of the software shall be submitted to the Commission upon request. Class 
III changes are permitted only for equipment in which no Class II 
changes have been made from the originally approved device.
    Note to paragraph (b)(3):
    Any software change that degrades spurious and out-of-band emissions 
previously reported to the Commission at the time of initial 
certification would be considered a change in frequency or modulation 
and would require a Class III permissive change or new equipment 
authorization application.
    (4) Class I and Class II permissive changes may only be made by the 
holder of the grant of certification, except as specified below.
    (c) A grantee desiring to make a change other than a permissive 
change shall file an application on FCC Form 731 accompanied by the 
required fees. The grantee shall attach a description of the change(s) 
to be made and a statement indicating whether the change(s) will be made 
in all units (including previous production) or will be made only in 
those units produced after the change is authorized.
    (d) A modification which results in a change in the identification 
of a device with or without change in circuitry requires a new 
application for, and grant of certification. If the changes affect the 
characteristics required to be reported, a complete application shall be 
filed. If the characteristics required to be reported are not changed 
the abbreviated procedure of Sec. 2.933 may be used.
    (e) Equipment that has been certificated or formerly type accepted 
for use in the Amateur Radio Service pursuant to the requirements of 
part 97 of this chapter may be modified without regard to the conditions 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, provided the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) Any person performing such modifications on equipment used under 
part 97 of this chapter must possess a valid amateur radio operator 
license of the class required for the use of the equipment being 
modified.
    (2) Modifications made pursuant to this paragraph are limited to 
equipment used at licensed amateur radio stations.
    (3) Modifications specified or performed by equipment manufacturers 
or suppliers must be in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) Modifications specified or performed by licensees in the Amateur 
Radio Service on equipment other than that at specific licensed amateur 
radio stations must be in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (5) The station licensee shall be responsible for ensuring that 
modified equipment used at his station will comply with the applicable 
technical standards in part 97 of this chapter.
    (f) For equipment other than that operating under parts 15 or 18, 
when a Class II permissive change is made by other than the grantee of 
certification, the information and data specified in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section shall be supplied by the person making the change. The 
modified equipment shall not be operated under an authorization of the 
Commission prior to acknowledgement by the Commission that the change is 
acceptable.
    (g) The interconnection of a certificated or formerly type accepted 
AM broadcast stereophonic exciter-generator with a certificated or 
formerly type accepted AM broadcast transmitter in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions and upon completion of measurements showing 
that the modified transmitter meets the emission limitation requirements 
of Sec. 73.44 is defined as a Class I permissive change for compliance 
with this section.
    (h) The interconnection of a multiplexing exciter with a 
certificated or formerly type accepted AM broadcast transmitter in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions without electrical or 
mechanical modification of the transmitter circuits and completion of 
equipment performance measurements showing the transmitter meets the 
minimum performance requirements applicable thereto is defined as a 
Class I permissive change for compliance with this section.
    (i) The addition of TV broadcast subcarrier generators to a 
certificated or formerly type accepted TV broadcast transmitter or the 
addition of FM broadcast subcarrier generators to a

[[Page 595]]

type accepted FM broadcast transmitter, provided the transmitter exciter 
is designed for subcarrier operation without mechanical or electrical 
alterations to the exciter or other transmitter circuits.
    (j) The addition of TV broadcast stereophonic generators to a 
certificated or formerly type accepted TV broadcast transmitter or the 
addition of FM broadcast stereophonic generators to a certificated or 
formerly type accepted FM broadcast transmitter, provided the 
transmitter exciter is designed for stereophonic sound operation without 
mechanical or electrical alterations to the exciter or other transmitter 
circuits.
    (k) The addition of subscription TV encoding equipment for which the 
FCC has granted advance approval under the provisions of Sec. 2.1400 in 
subpart M and Sec. 73.644(c) of part 73 to a certificated or formerly 
type accepted transmitter is considered a Class I permissive change.
    (l) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, broadcast 
licensees or permittees are permitted to modify certificated or formerly 
type accepted equipment pursuant to Sec. 73.1690 of the FCC's rules.

building) measurements will be accepted of the equipment as installed. 
Such measurements must be accompanied by a description of the site where 
the measurements were made showing the location of any possible source 
of reflections which might distort the field strength measurements. 
Information submitted shall include the relative radiated power of each 
spurious emission with reference to the rated power output of the 
transmitter, assuming all emissions are radiated from halfwave dipole 
antennas.

specified temperature range and at intervals of not more than 10[deg] 
centigrade through the range. A period of time sufficient to stabilize 
all of the components of the oscillator circuit at each temperature 
level shall be allowed prior to frequency measurement. The short term 
transient effects on the frequency of the transmitter due to keying 
(except for broadcast transmitters) and any heating element cycling 
normally occurring at each ambient temperature level also shall be 
shown. Only the portion or portions of the transmitter containing the 
frequency determining and stabilizing circuitry need be subjected to the 
temperature variation test.
    (c) In addition to all other requirements of this section, the 
following information is required for equipment incorporating heater 
type crystal oscillators to be used in mobile stations, for which type 
acceptance is first requested after March 25, 1974, except for battery 
powered, hand carried, portable equipment having less than 3 watts mean 
output power.
    (1) Measurement data showing variation in transmitter output 
frequency from a cold start and the elapsed time necessary for the 
frequency to stabilize within the applicable tolerance. Testsshall be 
made after temperature stabilization at each of the ambient temperature 
levels; the lower temperature limit, 0[deg] centigrade and +30[deg] 
centigrade with no primary power applied.
    (2) Beginning at each temperature level specified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the frequency shall be measured within one 
minute after application of primary power to the transmitter and at 
intervals of no more than one minute thereafter until ten minutes have 
elapsed or until sufficient measurements are obtained to indicate 
clearly that the frequency has stabilized within the applicable 
tolerance, whichever time period is greater. During each test, the 
ambient temperature shall not be allowed to rise more than 10[deg] 
centigrade above the respective beginning ambient temperature level.
    (3) The elapsed time necessary for the frequency to stabilize within 
the applicable tolerance from each beginning ambient temperature level 
as determined from the tests specified in this paragraph shall be 
specified in the instruction book for the transmitter furnished to the 
user.
    (4) When it is impracticable to subject the complete transmitter to 
this test because of its physical dimensions or power rating, only its 
frequency determining and stabilizing portions need be tested.
    (d) The frequency stability shall be measured with variation of 
primary supply voltage as follows:
    (1) Vary primary supply voltage from 85 to 115 percent of the 
nominal value for other than hand carried battery equipment.
    (2) For hand carried, battery powered equipment, reduce primary 
supply voltage to the battery operating end point which shall be 
specified by the manufacturer.
    (3) The supply voltage shall be measured at the input to the cable 
normally provided with the equipment, or at the power supply terminals 
if cables are not normally provided. Effects on frequency of transmitter 
keying (except for broadcast transmitters) and any heating element 
cycling at the nominal supply voltage and at each extreme also shall be 
shown.
    (e) When deemed necessary, the Commission may require tests of 
frequency stability under conditions in addition to those specifically 
set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. (For 
example measurements showing the effect of proximity to large metal 
objects, or of various types of antennas, may be required for portable 
equipment.)

                    Radiofrequency Radiation Exposure


<R05>
Sec. 2.1091  Radiofrequency radiation exposure evaluation: mobile devices.

    (a) Requirements of this section are a consequence of Commission 
responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate 
the environmental significance of its actions. See subpart I of part 1 
of this chapter, in particular Sec. 1.1307(b).
    (b) For purposes of this section, a mobile device is defined as a 
transmitting device designed to be used in other than fixed locations 
and to generally be used in such a way that a separation distance of at 
least 20 centimeters is normally maintained between the transmitter's 
radiating structure(s) and the body of the user or nearby persons. In 
this context, the term ``fixed location'' means that the device is 
physically secured at one location and is not able to be easily moved to 
another location. Transmitting devices designed to be used by consumers 
or workers that can be easily re-located, such as wireless devices 
associated with a personal computer, are considered to be mobile devices 
if they meet the 20 centimeter separation requirement.
    (c) Mobile devices that operate in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service, the Personal Communications Services, the Satellite 
Communications Services, the General Wireless Communications Service, 
the Wireless Communications Service, the Maritime Services, the 4.9 GHz 
Band Service and the Specialized Mobile Radio Service authorized under 
subpart H of part 22 of this chapter, part 24 of this chapter, part 25 
of this chapter, part 26 of this chapter, part 27 of this chapter, part 
80 of this chapter (ship earth stations devices only) and part 90 of 
this chapter are subject to routine environmental evaluation for RF 
exposure prior to equipment authorization or use if they operate at 
frequencies of 1.5 GHz or below and their effective radiated

[[Page 606]]

power (ERP) is 1.5 watts or more, or if they operate at frequencies 
above 1.5 GHz and their ERP is 3 watts or more. Unlicensed personal 
communications service devices, unlicensed millimeter wave devices and 
unlicensed NII devices authorized under Sec. 15.253, Sec. 15.255, and 
subparts D and E of part 15 of this chapter are also subject to routine 
environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment 
authorization or use if their ERP is 3 watts or more or if they meet the 
definition of a portable device as specified in Sec. 2.1093 (b) 
requiring evaluation under the provisions of that section. All other 
mobile and unlicensed transmitting devices are categorically excluded 
from routine environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment 
authorization or use, except as specified in Secs. 1.1307(c) and 
1.1307(d) of this chapter. Applications for equipment authorization of 
mobile and unlicensed transmitting devices subject to routine 
environmental evaluation must contain a statement confirming compliance 
with the limits specified in paragraph (d) of this section as part of 
their application. Technical information showing the basis for this 
statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (d) The limits to be used for evaluation are specified in 
Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter. All unlicensed personal communications 
service (PCS) devices and unlicensed NII devices shall be subject to the 
limits for general population/uncontrolled exposure.
    (1) For purposes of analyzing mobile transmitting devices under the 
occupational/controlled criteria specified in Sec. 1.1310 of this 
chapter, time-averaging provisions of the guidelines may be used in 
conjunction with typical maximum duty factors to determine maximum 
likely exposure levels.
    (2) Time-averaging provisions may not be used in determining typical 
exposure levels for devices intended for use by consumers in general 
population/uncontrolled environments as defined in Sec. 1.1310 of this 
chapter. However, ``source-based'' time-averaging based on an inherent 
property or duty-cycle of a device is allowed. An example of this is the 
determination of exposure from a device that uses digital technology 
such as a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) scheme for transmission 
of a signal. In general, maximum average power levels must be used to 
determine compliance.
    (3) If appropriate, compliance with exposure guidelines for devices 
in this section can be accomplished by the useof warning labels and by 
providing users with information concerning minimum separation distances 
from transmitting structures and proper installation of antennas.
    (4) In some cases, e.g., modular or desktop transmitters, the 
potential conditions of use of a device may not allow easy 
classification of that device as either mobile or portable (also see 
Sec. 2.1093). In such cases, applicants are responsible for determining 
minimum distances for compliance for the intended use and installation 
of the device based on evaluation of either specific absorption rate 
(SAR), field strength or power density, whichever is most appropriate.

E, Sec. 15.253 and Sec. 15.255 of part 15 of this chapter are subject to 
routine environmental evaluation for RF exposure prior to equipment 
authorization or use. All other portable transmitting devices are 
categorically excluded from routine environmental evaluation for RF 
exposure prior to equipment authorization or use, except as specified in 
Secs. 1.1307(c) and 1.1307(d) of this chapter. Applications for 
equipment authorization of portable transmitting devices subject to 
routine environmental evaluation must contain a statement confirming 
compliance with the limits specified in paragraph (d) of this section as 
part of their application. Technical information showing the basis for 
this statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (d) The limits to be used for evaluation are based generally on 
criteria published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
for localized specific absorption rate (``SAR'') in Section 4.2 of 
``IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to 
Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz,'' ANSI/IEEE 
C95.1-1992, Copyright 1992 by the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers, Inc., New York, New York 10017. These criteria 
for SAR evaluation are similar to those recommended by the National 
Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in ``Biological 
Effects and Exposure Criteria for Radiofrequency Electromagnetic 
Fields,'' NCRP Report No. 86, Section 17.4.5. Copyright NCRP, 1986, 
Bethesda, Maryland 20814. SAR is a measure of the rate of energy 
absorption due to exposure to an RF transmitting source. SAR values have 
been related to threshold levels for potential biological hazards. The 
criteria to be used are specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section and shall apply for portable devices transmitting in the 
frequency range from 100 kHz to 6 GHz. Portable devices that transmit at 
frequencies above 6 GHz are to be evaluated in terms of the MPE limits 
specified in Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter. Measurements and calculations 
to demonstrate compliance with MPE field strength or power density 
limits for devices operating above 6 GHz should be made at a minimum 
distance of 5 cm from the radiating source.
    (1) Limits for Occupational/Controlled exposure: 0.4 W/kg as 
averaged over the whole-body and spatial peak SAR not exceeding 8 W/kg 
as averaged over any 1 gram of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in the 
shape of a cube). Exceptions are the hands, wrists, feet and ankles 
where the spatial peak SAR shall not exceed 20 W/kg, as averaged over an 
10 grams of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in the shape of a cube). 
Occupational/Controlled limits apply when persons are exposed as a 
consequence of their employment provided these persons are fully aware 
of and exercise control over their exposure. Awareness of exposure can 
be accomplished by use of warning labels or by specific training or 
education through appropriate means, such as an RF safety program in a 
work environment.
    (2) Limits for General Population/Uncontrolled exposure: 0.08 W/kg 
as averaged over the whole-body and spatial peak SAR not exceeding 1.6 
W/kg as averaged over any 1 gram of tissue (defined as a tissue volume 
in the shape of a cube). Exceptions are the hands, wrists, feet and 
ankles where the spatial peak SAR shall not exceed 4 W/kg, as averaged 
over any 10 grams of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in the shape of 
a cube). General Population/Uncontrolled limits apply when the general 
public may be exposed, or when persons that are exposed as a consequence 
of their employment may not be fully aware of the potential for exposure 
or do not exercise control over their exposure. Warning labels placed on 
consumer devices such as cellular telephones will not be sufficient 
reason to allow these devices to be evaluated subject to limits for 
occupational/controlled exposure in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) Compliance with SAR limits can be demonstrated by either 
laboratory measurement techniques or by computational modeling. 
Methodologies and references for SAR evaluation are

described in numerous technical publications including ``IEEE 
RecommendedPractice for the Measurement of Potentially Hazardous 
Electromagnetic Fields--RF and Microwave,'' IEEE C95.3-1991.
    (4) For purposes of analyzing portable transmitting devices under 
the occupational/controlled criteria, the time-averaging provisions of 
the MPE guidelines identified in Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter can be used 
in conjunction with typical maximum duty factors to determine maximum 
likely exposure levels.
    (5) Time-averaging provisions of the MPE guidelines identified in 
Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter may not be used in determining typical 
exposure levels for portable devices intended for use by consumers, such 
as hand-held cellular telephones, that are considered to operate in 
general population/uncontrolled environments as defined above. However, 
``source-based'' time-averaging based on an inherent property or duty-
cycle of a device is allowed. An example of this would be the 
determination of exposure from a device that uses digital technology 
such as a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) scheme for transmission 
of a signal. In general, maximum average power levels must be used to 
determine compliance.

Sec. 2.1201  Purpose.

    (a) In order to carry out its responsibilities under the 
Communications Act and the various treaties and international 
regulations, and in order to promote efficient use of the radio 
spectrum, the Commission has developed technical standards for radio 
frequencyequipment. The technical standards applicable to individual 
types of equipment are found in that part of the rules governing the 
service wherein the equipment is to be operated. In addition to the 
technical standards, the rules governing the service may require that 
such equipment receive an equipment authorization from the Commission as 
a prerequisite for marketing and importing this equipment into the 
U.S.A. The marketing rules, Sec. 2.801 et seq., were adopted pursuant to 
the authority in section 302 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended (47 U.S.C. 302).
    (b) The rules in this section set out the conditions under which 
radio frequency devices as defined in Sec. 2.801 that are capable of 
causing harmful interference to radio communications may be imported 
into the U.S.A.
    (c) Nothing in this section prevents importers from shipping goods 
into foreign trade zones or Customs bonded warehouses, such as is the 
prescribed procedure under Sec. 2.1204(a)(5). Radio frequency devices 
capable of causing harmful interference, however, cannot be withdrawn 
from these areas except in accordance with the provisions of this 
section.

Subpart N--FCC Procedure for Testing Class A, B and S Emergency Position 
                    Indicating Radiobeacons (EPIRBs)

    Source: 56 FR 11683, Mar. 20, 1991, unless otherwise noted.

[[Page 612]]

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 2.1501  Introduction.

    The procedure described herein sets forth uniform methods for 
testing Class A, B and S Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacons 
(EPIRBs) for compliance with the applicable portions of the FCC Rules 
and Regulations. Other methods and test results may be used provided 
they are fully documented and deemed by the Commission to yield results 
equivalent to the procedures set forth in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1503  Test environment.

    (a) Measurement sites. Radiated emission tests for peak effective 
radiated power (PERP), spurious emissions and power in the test mode are 
to be performed on an open field test site as shown in Figure 1. The 
site is to be located on level ground with an obstruction-free, 60 m by 
52 m, elliptical area. The site is to be equipped with an antenna mast 
capable of adjustment from 1 to 4 m. The center of a metal ground plane 
at least one wavelength in diameter at 121.5 MHz (2.47 m) is to be 
located 30 m from the receiving antenna. The ground plane is to have 
provisions for mounting removable quarter-wave verticle elements to 
produce a monopole antenna at both 121.5 and 243 MHz with the VSWR of 
less than 1.5.

    Note: It is desirable that the level of radiated ambient EME at the 
test site be at least 6 dB below the FCC limits applicable to the EPIRB. 
It is, of course, not always possible to meet this condition. If the 
ambient field strength at some frequencies within the specified 
measurement ranges is too high, it is recommended that one or more of 
the following corrective steps be employed:
    (1) Perform measurements in critical frequency bands during hours 
when broadcast and other radio stations are off-the-air and ambients 
from industrial equipment are lower.
    (2) Insofar as is possible, orient the axis of an open area test 
site to discriminate against strong ambient signals.
    (3) Vary the bandwidth of the measuring instrument to separate 
ambient EME from emissions from the EPIRB.

    (b) Temperature. Except as otherwise noted, the ambient temperature 
during testing is to be within the range of 4 to 35 [deg]C (40 to 95 
[deg]F).


<R05>
Sec. 2.1505  Test instrumentation and equipment.

    (a) Receiver (field intensity meter). A calibrated field intensity 
meter (FIM) with a frequency range of 30 to 1000 MHz is required for 
measuring radiated emission levels. This instrument should be capable of 
making peak measurements with a bandwidth of 100 kHz.
    (b) Spectrum analyzer. Spectral measurements are to be made with a 
spectrum analyzer with a minimum resolution bandwidth no greater than 10 
Hz. The video filter, if used, should have a bandwidth wide enough so as 
to not affect peak readings. A linear video output is desirable for 
performing measurements of modulation characteristics.
    (c) Storage oscilloscope. Measurements of modulation characteristics 
are to be made using a calibrated storage oscilloscope. This instrument 
is to be DC coupled and capable of manually triggered single sweeps.
    (d) Frequency counter. A frequency counter with an accuracy of at 
least 5 parts per million is required for measuring the carrier 
frequency.
    (e) Signal generator. A calibrated signal generator with an output 
of at least 75 mW at 121.5 and 243 MHz is required for generating a 
reference signal for site calibration.
    (f) Antenna. Radiated emissions are to be measured with calibrated, 
tuned, half-wave dipole antennas covering the frequency range of 30 to 
1000 MHz.
    (g) Temperature chamber. Tests which call for subjecting the EPIRB 
to temperature levels other than the ambient temperature are to be 
performed in a temperature test chamber which can be adjusted to stable 
temperatures from -20 to +55 [deg]C. This chamber is to be of sufficient 
size to accommodate the EPIRB under test.
    (h) Vibration table. A vibration table capable of vibrating the 
EPIRB with a sinusoidal motion is required. The table must be capable of 
varying the frequency of vibration either linearly or logarithmically 
over a range of 4 to 33 Hz with maximum peak amplitudes of up to 2.5 mm.
    (i) Salt fog chamber. A chamber capable of producing salt fog at a 
temperature of 35 [deg]C for 48 hours is required.

[[Page 613]]

This chamber is to be of sufficient size to accommodate the EPIRB under 
test.
    (j) Drop test facility. A facility which will permit dropping an 
EPIRB from a height of 20 m into water is required. The water must be 
deep enough so that the EPIRB will not touch bottom when dropped.

              Environmental and Operational Test Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 2.1507  Test frequencies.

    Testing of an EPIRB for compliance outside a shielded room on a 
distress frequency is prohibited, since this may interfere with 
emergency communications. Therefore, all compliance testing outside a 
shielded room should be conducted on one of the pairs of alternate 
frequencies specified below:

121.600/243.200 MHz
121.650/243.300 MHz
121.700/243.400 MHz
121.750/243.500 MHz
121.800/243.600 MHz
121.850/243.700 MHz
121.900/243.800 MHz


The above frequencies are to be used for limited testing of EPIRBs for 
compliance with FCC Rules, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The testing shall not cause harmful interference to authorized 
communications on these frequencies.
    (b) The testing shall be coordinated with the nearest FCC district 
office.

For simplicity, 121.5 MHz and 243 MHz will be used throughout this test 
procedure to indicate the alternate test frequency.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1509  Environmental and duration tests.

    The environmental and operational tests in Sec. 2.1509 (a) through 
(e) are to be conducted on a single test unit in the order given below. 
This sequence of tests also includes the electrical tests in 
Secs. 2.1511, 2.1513 and 2.1515 of this part. The test unit is not to be 
adjusted, noris the battery to be replaced during these tests, and a log 
of battery on-time should be maintained. The above tests are to be 
performed on the same test unit. The tests in Sec. 2.1509 (f) through 
(i) may be run in any sequence or may be performed on separate test 
units.
    (a) Vibration test.

    Step (1) Secure the EPIRB to the vibration table. The EPIRB is not 
to be operated and should not activate while being vibrated.
    Step (2) Subject the EPIRB to sinusoidal motion parallel to one of 
the three major orthogonal axes under the following conditions:

 
         A. Frequency (Hz)                   Peak amplitude (mm)
 
                      4-10                                    2.5
                     10-15                                    0.8
                     15-25                                    0.4
                     25-33                                    0.2
 

    B. The frequency is to be changed either linearly or logarithmically 
with time between 4 Hz and 33 Hz such that a complete cycle (4 Hz to 33 
Hz to 4 Hz) takes approximately 5 minutes.
    C. The EPIRB is to be vibrated for at least 30 minutes or six 
complete cycles.
    Step (3) Remount the EPIRB, if necessary, and repeat step 2 for each 
of the other two major orthogonal axes.
    Step (4) Upon completion of the test, perform an exterior mechanical 
inspection and verify operation by turning the unit on and observing the 
RF power indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a 
receiver. Record test results.

    (b) Thermal shock tests. These tests are to be performed on EPIRBs 
which are required or intended to float.
    (1) Low temperature thermal shock test.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in a temperature chamber for at least 3 
hours at -20 [deg]C or colder. The EPIRB is not to be operated while 
being cooled.
    Step (2) Immediately place the EPIRB in water that has been 
maintained at +10 [deg]C or warmer.
    Step (3) After 15 minutes, perform as exterior mechanical inspection 
and verify operation by turning the unit on and observing the RF power 
indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a receiver. 
Record test results.

    (2) High temperature thermal shock test.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in a temperature chamber for at least 3 
hours at +55 degrees C or warmer. The EPIRB is not to be operated while 
being heated.
    Step (2) Immediately float the EPIRB in water that is maintained at 
+25 degrees C or colder.
    Step (3) After 15 minutes, perform an exterior mechanical inspection 
and verify operation by turning the unit on and observing the RF power 
indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a receiver. 
Record test results.

    (c) Salt fog test.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in a salt fog chamber for a period of at 
least 2 hours at a temperature of 35 [deg]C (<SUP>[plusmn]</SUP>2 
[deg]C) before exposing it to salt fog. The EPIRB is to be turned off 
during this test.
    Step (2) With the chamber temperature maintained at 35 [deg]C, 
introduce salt fog at the saturation point for 48 hours. The salt fog is 
to be prepared from a 5% (<SUP>[plusmn]</SUP>1%) salt (sodium chloride 
solution. For detailed guidance on the preparation of the solution and 
the apparatus for generating salt fog, refer to MIL-STD-810D (19 July 
1983), method 509.2.
    Step (3) Upon completion of the salt fog exposure, the EPIRB is to 
be airdried at room temperature for 12 hours and operation verified by 
turning the unit on and observing the RF power indicator on the unit or 
monitoring the transmission with a receiver. Record observations.

    (d) Drop test. This test is to be performed on EPIRB which are 
required or intended to float.

    Step (1) Turn the EPIRB on, log the time and drop it three times 
into water from a height of 20 meters. The water is to be deep enough so 
that the EPIRB does not touch bottom when dropped. Each drop should be 
initiated from a different orientation as follows: antenna vertical up; 
antenna vertical down; antenna horizontal.
    Step (2) Upon completion of the drop test, an exterior mechanical 
inspection is to be performed and operation verified by observing the RF 
power indicator on the unit or monitoring the transmission with a 
receiver. Record observations. Turn the test unit off and log the total 
on-time.

    (e) Forty-eight hour operational test. This test includes the 
battery life test and all the electrical tests given in Secs. 2.1511, 
2.1513 and 2.1515 of this part, at various temperatures. The tests are 
to be performed on the same EPIRB in the sequence specified herein. Be 
sure to record the on-time of the unit during each test. No more than 8 
hours of total on-time is permitted before commencing step 4. When 
operating the EPIRB in the environmental chamber, a non-radiating load 
may be substituted for the antenna provided it iselectrically equivalent 
to the standard antenna and does not reduce the battery current drain.

    Step (1) Perform the radiated emissions test in Sec. 2.1511 of this 
part.
    Step (2) Perform the modulation characteristic tests in Sec. 2.1513 
of this part.
    Step (3) Perform the spectral tests in Sec. 2.1515 of this part.
    Step (4) With the EPIRB off, place unit in an environmental chamber 
at a temperature of -20 [deg]C for at least 2 hours.
    Step (5) With the EPIRB in the chamber, repeat the carrier frequency 
test in Sec. 2.1515(d) of this part. (Leave the EPIRB turned on.)
    Step (6) Near the end of 48 hours of total on-time for the EPIRB, 
repeat the carrier frequency test in Sec. 2.1515(d) of this part.
    Step (7) At the end of 48 hours of total on-time, remove EPIRB from 
the chamber and immediately repeat the PERP test for the fundamental 
emissions in Sec. 2.1511(c) of this part. The unit should be maintained 
at -20 [deg]C to the extent possible for this test.

    (f) Float free and activation test. This test is required only for 
Class A EPIRBs.

    Step (1) The EPIRB is to be installed in the automatic release 
mechanism and the assembly is to be mounted on a fixture simulating a 
deck or bulkhead as per manufacturer' installation instructions.
    Step (2) Submerge the fixture in water in its normal mounted 
orientation. The EPIRB must float free before reaching a depth of 4 
meters and should automatically activate. Activation is to be verified 
by observing the RF power indicator on the unit or monitoring the 
transmission with a receiver.
If the EPIRB is equipped with an automatically deployable antenna, the 
antenna must properly deploy during each immersion. Record observations.

    (g) Stability and buoyancy test. This test is to be performed on 
EPIRBs which are required or intended to float. This test is to be 
conducted in fresh water.

    Step (1) With the antenna deployed in its normal operating position, 
submerge the EPIRB in a horizontal position just below the surface of 
the water.
    Step (2) Release the EPIRB and observe the amount of time required 
for it to come to an upright position. It must reach its upright 
position within one second from each position.
The EPIRB must have a reserve buoyancy of at least 5% of its gross 
weight. It must also float upright in calm water with the base of the 
antenna a minimum of 5 cm above the water. Record the time required for 
the test unit to right itself.

    (h) Temperature/frequency test. The frequency stability shall be 
measured over an ambient temperature from -20[deg] to +55 [deg]C at 
intervals of not more than 10 [deg]C. A period of time sufficient to 
stabilize all of the components of

[[Page 615]]

the oscillator circuit at each temperture level shall be allowed prior 
to frequency measurement.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB in the environmental test chamber.
    Step (2) Adjust the temperature in the chamber to +20 [deg]C and 
allow sufficient time for the oscillator to stabilize at that 
temperature.
    Step (3) Measure the carrier frequency in accordance with the 
procedure in Sec. 2.1515(d) of this part. Record the carrier frequency 
in Hertz. The carrier frequency at +20 [deg]C is the reference for 
determining the frequency tolerance.
    Step (4) Increase the temperature in the chamber to +55 [deg]C and 
allow sufficient time for the oscillator to stabilize at that 
temperature. Measure the carrier frequency using the procedure in 
Sec. 2.1515(d) of this part.
    Step (5) Reduce the temperature in the chamber in 10 [deg]C maximum 
increments until -20 [deg]C is reached. At each new temperature, allow 
sufficient time for the oscillator to stabilize at that temperature. 
Measure the temperature and frequency in each case and plot the 
frequency vs temperature from -20[deg] to +55 [deg]C.

    (i) Leakage and immersion test.

    Step (1) Completely submerge the EPIRB in water for 48 hours. The 
EPIRB is to be turned off during this test.
    Step (2) Remove the EPIRB from the water and wipe dry.
    Step (3) Verify operation by briefly turning the EPIRB on and 
observing the RF power indicator on the unit or monitoring the 
transmission with a receiver.
    Step (4) Open the EPIRB for examination. There is to be no water 
inside the unit. Record observations.

Sec. 2.1511  Measurements of radiated emissions.

    The Commission's Rules require that the peak efficetive radiated 
power (PERP) of a Class A, B or S EPIRB not be less than 75 mW under 
certain specified conditions. The PERP of an EPIRB transmitter is 
determined by comparing its level to a reference PERP generated by a 
standard quarter-wave monopole antenna located on a onewavelength 
minimum diameter metal ground plane. The Rules also require that all 
spurious and harmonic emissions be attenuated by a specified amount with 
respect to the reference PERP. In addition, there is a limit on the PERP 
of radiated emissions with the switch in the test mode. These 
measurements are to be made in accordance with the following procedure.
    (a) General set-up instructions. Measurements of radiated 
electromagnetic emissions (EME) are to be performed on the 30 meter open 
field test site described in Sec. 2.1503(a) of this part and on one of 
the pair of frequencies listed in Sec. 2.1507 of this part. A receiver, 
tuned dipole antennas and a calibrated signal generator as described in 
Sec. 2.1505 of this part are required. The EPIRB should be powered by 
its own internal battery with its standard antenna attached and 
deployed.
    (b) Set-up for radiated EME tests.

    Step (1) Place a 121.5 MHz quarter-wave vertical antenna element at 
the center of the ground plane and connect the output of the calibrated 
signal generator to the antenna.
    Step (2) Mount the tuned dipole antenna on the antenna mast, tune 
the elements to 121.5 MHz and connect the antenna to the receiver.
    Step (3) After an appropriate warm up, turn the receiver to the 
frequency of the test unit, set the detector to peak mode and the 
bandwidth to 100 kHz.

    (Note: It is sometimes helpful to monitor the receiver audio output 
with a speaker. The EPIRB signal may be identified by its distinctive 
modulation.)

    (c) Radiated EME tests.

           Fundamental emissions-peak effective radiated power

    Step (1) Turn on the signal generator and adjust the output to 75 mW 
at 121.5 MHz.
    Step (2) Vary the antenna height from one to four meters in both 
vertical and horizontal polarization. Record the highest receiver 
reading in dBm as the reference level.
    Step (3) Disconnect the signal generator and replace the quarter-
wave vertical element on the ground plane with the EPIRB under test. The 
EPIRB is to be positioned directly on the surface of and in the center 
of the metal ground plane.
    Step (4) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (5) Vary the receive antenna height from one to four meters in 
both vertical and horizontal polarization. Record the highest receiver 
reading in dBm and the instrument settings, antenna height and direction 
for maximum radiation, antenna polarization and conversion factors, if 
any, associated with that reading.
    Step (6) Repeat Step 5 with the EPIRB switch in the test position. 
Return the switch to the normal operation position.
    Step (7) Rotate the EPIRB 30 degrees and repeat Steps 5 and 6. 
Repeat this step for all

[[Page 616]]

successive 30 degrees segments of a full, 360 degree rotation of the 
EPIRB.
    Step (8) Repeat Sec. 2.1511(b) and Steps 1 through 7 for 243 MHz.
    Step (9) Compute the peak effective radiated power for the maximum 
level of each measured emission using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.001

where:

dBm<INF>meas</INF> is the measured receiver reading in dBm, and
dBm<INF>ref</INF> is the reference receiver reading found in step 2 of 
Sec. 2.1511(c).
    Step (10) Record the PERP in mW. The FCC limit for minimum power in 
the normal operation mode (i.e., with the EPIRB switch in the normal 
operating position) is 75 mW. The FCC limit for maximum power in the 
test mode is 0.0001 mW.

                           Spurious emissions

    Step (11) Reset the signal generator to operate at 121.5 MHz.
    Step (12) For each spurious and harmonic emission to be measured, 
retune the receive antenna to the appropriate frequency and repeat Steps 
5 and 7.
    Step (13) Determine the FCC limit on power for spurious emissions on 
the frequency of each measured emission as follows:
    The rules require that spurious emissions be attenuated at least 30 
decibels below the transmit power level. Therefore, the maximum received 
power limit for a spurious emission can be calculated from the formula:

dBm<INF>spur</INF> = dBm<INF>meas</INF>+AF<INF>121.5</INF>-
AF<INF>spurfreq</INF>-30

where:

dBm<INF>meas</INF> = measured receiver reading (Section 2.1511(c), step 
5).
AF<INF>121.5</INF> = tuned dipole antenna factor at 121.5 MHz.
AF<INF>spurfreq</INF> = tuned dipole antenna factor at spurious freq.
    Step (14) Record in dB below the fundamental emissions the level of 
all spurious and harmonic emissions within 10 dB of the FCC limits.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1513  Measurements of modulation characteristics.

    (a) Set-up. Test of modulation characteristics are to be performed 
in an RF shielded room.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB directly on a metal ground plane, such as 
the shielded room floor.
    Step (2) Place a suitable receiving antenna at a convenient distance 
from the EPIRB and connect it to the input of the spectrum analyzer or 
receiver to observe the radiated signal from the EPIRB.
    Step (3) Set the spectrum analyzer or receiver controls as follows:
I.F. bandwidth: 300 kHz minimum
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Amplitude scale: Linear
Frequency: 121.5 MHz
Scan width: 0 Hz
    Step (4) Connect the detected output of the spectrum analyzer or 
receiver to the input of the storage oscilloscope.
    Step (5) Set the oscilloscope controls as necessary to allow the 
demodulated waveform to be viewed. The input signal is to be DC coupled.

    (b) Measurement of Audio Frequencies.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (2) Trigger the oscilloscope and store at least one complete 
cycle of the audio waveform.
    Step (3) Measure the period (T) of the waveform. The period is the 
time difference between the half voltage points at the beginning and end 
of one complete cycle of the waveform. See Figure 2.
    Step (4) Calculate the frequency (F), where:

F=1/T.

    Step (5) Repeat Steps 2 through 4 until the highest and lowest audio 
frequencies are found.

    Note: The lowest and highest frequencies may occur several cycles 
before or after the transition from low to high frequency.)

    Step (6) Determine the audio frequency range (F<INF>range</INF>), 
where:

F<INF>range</INF>=F<INF>high</INF>-F<INF>low</INF>

    Step (7) Record instrument settings and the lowest and highest audio 
frequencies. Record the audio frequency range in Hertz.
    Step (8) Repeat Steps 1-7, above, for 243 MHz.

    (c) Modulation factor.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (2) Trigger the oscilloscope and store at least one complete 
cycle of the audio waveform. The input signal is to be DC coupled or 
erroneous results will be obtained.
    Step (3) Measure the maximum voltage (V<INF>max</INF>), and the 
minimum voltage (V<INF>min</INF>) for the cycle. The modulation factor 
(M) is calculated from the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.002

    See Figure 2.
    Step (4) Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the lowest modulation factor is 
found.

[[Page 617]]

    Step (5) Record instrument settings and the lowest modulation 
factor, expressed as a ratio between 0 and 1.
    Step (6) Repeat the above measurements for 243 MHz.

    (d) Modulation duty cycle.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (2) Trigger the oscilloscope and store at least one complete 
cycle of the audio waveform.
    Step (3) Measure the period (T) of the waveform. The period is the 
time difference between the half voltage points at the beginning and end 
of one cycle of the waveform. See Figure 2.
    Step (4) Measure the pulse width (t<INF>p</INF>) of the waveform. 
The pulse width is the time difference between the half voltage points 
on the rising and falling portions of the waveform. See Figure 2.
    Step (5) Calculate the duty cycle (D) as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.003
    
    Step (6) Repeat Steps 2 through 5 a sufficient number of times to 
determine the highest and lowest duty cycles.
    Step (7) Record instrument settings and the highest and lowest duty 
cycles in percent.
    Step (8) Repeat Steps 1-7 for 243 MHz.

    (e) Sweep repetition rate.

    Step (1) Connect a speaker to the detected output of the spectrum 
analyzer or receiver so the audio frequencies are audible. 
Alternatively, an FM radio tuned to 108 MHz placed in the vicinity of 
the EPIRB may be used.
    Step (2) Activate the EPIRB.
    Step (3) Time the number of audio sweeps (N) for a one minute 
interval.
    Step (4) Calculate the audio sweep rate (R) using R=N/60.
    Step (5) Record instrument settings and the sweep repetition rate in 
Hertz.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1515  Spectral measurements.

    (a) Set-up. Spectral measurements are to be performed in a shielded 
room.

    Step (1) Place the EPIRB directly on a metal ground plane, such as 
the shielded room floor. The EPIRB should be powered by its own internal 
battery with its standard antenna attached and deployed.
    Step (2) Place a suitable receiving antenna at a convenient distance 
from the EPIRB and connect it to the input of the spectrum analyzer to 
observe the radiated signal from the EPIRB. A signal generator and 
frequency counter capable of operating at 121.5 and 243 MHz are also 
required for these tests.

    (b) Occupied bandwidth test.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB and observe the fundamental frequency on 
a spectrum analyzer. Adjust location of receiving antenna and spectrum 
analyzer controls to obtain a suitable signal level (i.e., a level which 
will not overload the spectrum analyzer, but is far enough above the 
noise floor to allow determination of whether or not the sidebands are 
attenuated by at least the amount required in the rules).
    Step (2) Set spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 10 kHz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 100 ms./div.
Amplitude scale: 10 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 Hz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (3) Record the signal level in dbm.
    Step (4) Calculate the mean power reference level by adding 10 
log<INF>10</INF> (D), where D is the modulation duty cycle determined in 
section 2.1513(d) of this part, to the recorded signal level.
    Step (5) Set spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 100 Hz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 10 sec./div.
Amplitude scale: 10 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 kHz/div.

    Step (6) Check the modulation sidebands for compliance with the 
required attenuation below the mean power reference level specified in 
Sec. 80.211 of the rules.
    Step (7) Record how the test was performed, instrument settings and 
the occupied bandwidth in kHz and the 3 dB bandwidth of the carrier in 
Hz. (See Sec. 2.1517 of this part).
    Step (8) Repeat Steps 1 through 7 for the signal at 243 MHz.

    (c) Signal enhancement test. The setup specified in Sec. 2.1515(a) 
is to be used in this method of measuring signal enhancement. Other 
methods may be used if shown to give results equivalent to or more 
accurate than this method.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB and locate the carrier frequency at 
121.5 MHz on the spectrum analyzer. Adjust location of receiving antenna 
and spectrum analyzer controls to obtain a suitable signal level (i.e., 
a level which will not overload the analyzer, but is far enough above 
the noise floor to allow sidebands at least 40 dB below the carrier to 
be viewed).
    Step (2) Set the spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 10 kHz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 100 ms./div.

[[Page 618]]

Amplitude scale: 5 dB/div.
Scan width: 10 kHz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (3) Record the amplitude in dBm.
    Step (4) Calculate the total power output by adding 10 log(D), where 
D is the modulation duty cycle determined in Sec. 2.1513(d) of this 
part, to the recorded signal level.
    Step (5) Set the spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 60 Hz or less
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 10 sec./div.
Amplitude scale: 5 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 Hz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (6) Measure and record the carrier power dBm as displayed on 
the spectrum analyzer.
    Step (7) Calculate the ratio of carrier power to total power from 
Steps 4 and 6 using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03JN91.004

dB<INF>C</INF> = carrier power in step 6
dB<INF>T</INF> = total power in step 4

    Step (8) Record instrument settings, sample calculation and the 
percent of power within [plusmn]30 Hz at 121.5 MHz or [plusmn]60 Hz at 
243 MHz of the carrier frequency.
    Step (9) Repeat the above measurement Steps 1 through 8 for 243 MHz. 
For the higher frequency, the I.F. bandwidth in step 5 must be 120 Hz or 
less.

    (d) Carrier frequency test. The setup specified in Sec. 2.1515(a) is 
to be used in measuring the carrier frequency.

    Step (1) Activate the EPIRB and locate the 121.5 MHz signal on the 
spectrum analyzer. Adjust location of receiving antenna and spectrum 
analyzer controls to obtain a suitable signal level.
    Step (2) Set the spectrum analyzer controls as follows:

I.F. bandwidth: 100 Hz
Video filter: OFF or as wide as possible
Scan time: 10 sec./div.
Amplitude scale: 10 dB/div.
Scan width: 20 Hz/div.
Center frequency: 121.5 MHz

    Step (3) Combine the output of the signal generator with the EPIRB 
signal at the input to the spectrum analyzer.
    Step (4) Adjust amplitude and frequency of signal generator output 
to determine center of carrier frequency component.
    Step (5) Measure signal generator frequency with frequency counter 
with accuracy of 5 PPM or better and record as carrier frequency.
    Step (6) If applicable, change the type of modulation of the EPIRB 
and record the shift in carrier frequency as observed on the spectrum 
analyzer display.
    Step (7) Repeat the above measurement Steps 1 through 6 for 243 MHz.

    (d) Administration. Any governmental department or service 
responsible for discharging the obligations undertaken in the Convention 
of the International Telecommunication Union and the Radio Regulations. 
For purposes of these rules, ``Administration'' refers to a foreign 
government or the U.S. Government, and more specifically, to the Federal 
Communications Commission.
    (e) Authorization. Approval by the Federal Communications Commission 
to operate as an accounting authority. Synonymous with 
``certification''.
    (f) CCITT. The internationally recognized French acronym for the 
International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee, one of the 
former sub-entities of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 
The CCITT (ITU-T)\1\ is responsible for developing international

international telecommunications services and facilities, including 
matters related to international charging and accounting principles and 
the settlement of international telecommunications accounts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ At the ITU Additional Plenipotentiary Conference in Geneva 
(December, 1992), the structure, working methods and construct of the 
basic ITU treaty instrument were modified. The result is that the names 
of the sub-entities of the ITU have changed (e.g., the CCITT has become 
the Telecommunication Standardization Sector--ITU-T and Recognized 
Private Operating Agency has become Recognized Operating Agency-ROA). 
The changes were placed into provisional effect on March 1, 1993 with 
the formal entry into force of these changes being July 1, 1994. We will 
refer to the new nomenclatures within these rules, wherever practicable.

                               Eligibility


<R05>
Sec. 3.10  Basic qualifications.

    (a) Applicants must meet the requirements and conditions contained 
in these rules in order to be certified as an accounting authority. No 
individual or other entity, including accounting authorities approved by 
other administrations, may act as a United Statesaccounting authority 
and settle accounts of U.S. licensed vessels in the

[[Page 625]]

maritime mobile or maritime mobile-satellite services without a 
certification from the Federal Communications Commission. Accounting 
authorities with interim certification as of the effective date of this 
rule must submit to the application process discussed in Sec. 3.20. They 
will be ``grandfathered'', i.e, granted permanent certification provided 
they demonstrate their eligibility and present a proper application.
    (b) U.S. citizenship is not required of individuals in order to 
receive certification from the Commission to be an accounting authority. 
Likewise, joint ventures need not be organized under the laws of the 
United States in order to be eligible to perform settlements for U.S. 
licensed vessels. See, however, Sec. 3.11.
    (c) Prior experience in maritime accounting, general commercial 
accounting, international shipping or any other related endeavor will be 
taken into consideration by the Commission in certifying accounting 
authorities. The lack of such expertise, however, will not automatically 
disqualify an individual, partnership, corporation or other entity from 
becoming an accounting authority.
    (d) Applicants must provide formal financial statements or 
documentation proving all assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
    (e) Applicants must offer their services to any member of the public 
making a reasonable request therefor, without undue discrimination 
against any customer or class of customer, and fees charged for 
providing such services shall be reasonable and non-discriminatory. This 
requirement will be waived for applicants who settle their own accounts 
only and are eligible to be ``grandfathered'' during the initial 
application period. However, should the need for additional accounting 
authorities be proven, these accounting authorities will be required to 
offer their services to the public or relinquish their certification.

[61 FR 20165, May 6, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 40776, July 28, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 3.11  Location of settlement operation.

    (a) Within the United States. A certified accounting authority 
maintaining all settlement operations, as well as associated 
documentation, within the United States will be assigned an AAIC with a 
``US'' prefix.
    (b) Outside the United States. A certified accounting authority 
maintaining settlement operations outside the United States will be 
assigned the same AAIC as that originally assigned to such entity by the 
administration of the country of origin. However, in no case will an 
entity be certified as an accounting authority for settlement of U.S. 
licensed vessel accounts unless the entity is requesting to conduct a 
settlement operation in the United States or has already been issued an 
AAIC by another administration.

                         Application Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 3.20  Application form.

    Written application must be made to the Federal Communications 
Commission on FCC Form 44, ``Application For Certification As An 
Accounting Authority'' in order to be considered for certification as an 
accounting authority. No other application form may be used. No 
consideration will be given to applicants not submitting applications in 
accordance with these rules or in accordance with any other instructions 
the Commission may issue. FCC Form 44 may be obtained from the 
Commission by writing to the address shown in Sec. 3.61.


<R05>
Sec. 3.21  Order of consideration.

    (a) Accounting Authority applications will be processed on a first-
come, first-served basis. When applications are received on the same 
day, the application with the earliest mailing date, as evidenced by the 
postmark, will be processed first. Interim accounting authorities 
seeking permanent certifications through the ``grandfathering'' process 
will not compete with other applicants during the first 60 days 
following the effective date of these rules which is allowed for 
submission of their applications. After the ``grandfathering'' process 
is completed, all other applicants will be processed as in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (b) At any given time, there will be no more than 25 certified 
accounting

[[Page 626]]

authorities with a minimum of 15 ``US'' AAICs reserved for use by 
accounting authorities conducting settlement operations within the 
United States. TheCommission will retain all valid applications received 
after the maximum number of accounting authorities have been approved 
and will inform such applicants that should an AAIC become available for 
reassignment in the future, the Commission will conditionally certify as 
an accounting authority the oldest of the qualified pending applicants, 
as determined by the order of receipt. Final certification would be 
conditional upon filing of an amended application (if necessary). The 
Commission will inform the applicant of his/her conditional selection in 
writing to confirm the applicant's continued interest in becoming an 
accounting authority.


<R05>
Sec. 3.22  Number of accounting authority identification codes per applicant.

    (a) No entity will be entitled to or assigned more than one AAIC.
    (b) AAICs may not be reassigned, sold, bartered or transferred and 
do not convey upon sale or absorption of a company or firm without the 
express written approval of the Commission. Only the FCC may certify 
accounting authorities and assign U.S. AAICs for entities settling 
accounts of U.S. licensed vessels in the maritime mobile and maritime 
mobile-satellite services.
    (c) Accounting authorities who are ``grandfathered'' during the 
initial application period may retain their interim AAIC.


<R05>
Sec. 3.23  Legal applicant.

    The application shall be signed by the individual, partner or 
primary officer of a corporation who is legally able to obligate the 
entity for which he or she is a representative.


<R05>
Sec. 3.24  Evidence of financial responsibility.

    All applicants must provide evidence of sound financial status. To 
the extent that the applicant is a business, formal financial statements 
will be required. Other applicants may submit documentation proving all 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses which supports their ability to 
meet their personal obligations. Applicants must provide any additional 
information deemed necessary by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3.25  Number of copies.

    One original and one copy of FCC Form 44, ``Application For 
Certification As An Accounting Authority'' will be required. Only 
applications mailed to the Commission on official, Commission approved 
application forms will be considered. Applications should be mailed at 
least 90 days prior to planned commencement of settlement activities to 
allow time for the Commission to review the application and to allow for 
the informal public comment period.


<R05>
Sec. 3.26  Where application is to be mailed.

    All applications shall be mailed to the Accounting Authority 
Certification Officer in Washington, D.C. The designated address will be 
provided on the FCC Form 44, ``Application for Certification As An 
Accounting Authority''.


<R05>
Sec. 3.27  Amended application.

    Changes in circumstances that cause information previously supplied 
to the FCC to be incorrect or incomplete and that could affect the 
approval process, require the submission of an amended application. The 
amended application should be mailed to the Commission immediately 
following such change. See also Secs. 3.24 and 3.51.


<R05>
Sec. 3.28  Denial of privilege.

    (a) The Commission, in its sole discretion, may refuse to grant an 
application to become an accounting authority for any of the following 
reasons:
    (1) Failure to provide evidence of acceptable financial 
responsibility;
    (2) If the applicant, in the opinion of the FCC reviewing official, 
does not possess the qualifications necessary to the proper functioning 
of an accounting authority;
    (3) Application is not personally signed by the proper official(s);
    (4) Applicant does not provide evidence that accounting operations 
will take place in the United States or its territories and the 
applicant does not

[[Page 627]]

already possess an AAIC issued by another administration;
    (5) Application is incomplete, the applicant fails to provide 
additional information requested by the Commission or the applicant 
indicates that it cannot meet a particular provision; or
    (6) When the Commission determines that the grant of an 
authorization is contrary to the public interest.
    (b) These rules provide sufficient latitude to address defects in 
applications. Entities seeking review should follow procedures set forth 
in Sec. 1.106 or Sec. 1.115 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 3.29  Notifications.

    (a) The Commission will publish the name of an applicant in a Public 
Notice before granting certification and will invite informal public 
comment on the qualifications of the applicant from any interested 
parties. Comments received will be taken into consideration by the 
Commission in making its determination as to whether to approve an 
applicant as an accounting authority. Thirty days will be allowed for 
submission of comments.
    (b) The Commission will notify each applicant in writing as to 
whether the applicant has been approved as an accounting authority. If 
the application is not approved, the Commission will provide a brief 
statement of the grounds for denial.
    (c) The names and addresses of all newly certified accounting 
authorities will be published in a Public Notice issued by the 
Commission. Additionally, the Commission will notify the ITU within 30 
days of any changes to its approved list of accounting authorities.

relevant rules and guidance issued from time to time by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3.41  Amount of time allowed before initial settlements.

    An accounting authority must begin settling accounts no later than 
six months from the date of certification. Failure to commence 
settlement operations is cause for suspension or cancellation of an 
accounting authority certification.


<R05>
Sec. 3.42  Location of processing facility.

    Settlement of maritime mobile and maritime mobile-satellite service 
accounts must be performed within the United States by all accounting

<R05>
Sec. 3.43  Applicable rules and regulations.

    Accounting authority operations must be conducted in accordance with 
applicable FCC rules and regulations, the International 
Telecommunication Regulations (ITR), and other international rules, 
regulations, agreements, and, where appropriate, ITU-T Recommendations. 
In particular, the following must be adhered to or taken into account in 
the case of ITU-T.
    (a) The latest basic treaty instrument(s) of the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU);
    (b) Binding agreements contained in the Final Acts of World 
Administrative Radio Conferences and/or World International 
Telecommunication Conferences;
    (c) ITU Radio Regulations;
    (d) ITU International Telecommunication Regulations (ITR);
    (e) ITU-T Recommendations (particularly D.90 and D.195); and
    (f) FCC Rules and Regulations (47 CFR part 3).


<R05>
Sec. 3.44  Time to achieve settlements.

    All maritime telecommunications accounts should be timely paid in 
accordance with applicable ITU Regulations, Article 66 and International 
Telecommunication Regulations (Melbourne, 1988). Accounting authorities 
are deemed to be responsible for remitting, in a timely manner, all 
valid amounts due to foreign administrations or their agents.

[[Page 628]]


<R05>
Sec. 3.45  Amount of charges.

    Accounting Authorities may charge any reasonable fee for their 
settlement services. Settlements themselves, however, must adhere to the 
standards setforth in these rules and must be in accordance with the 
International Telecommunication Regulations (ITR) taking into account 
the applicable ITU-T Recommendations and other guidance issued by the 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 3.46  Use of gold francs.

    An accounting authority must accept accounts presented to it from 
foreign administrations in gold francs. These gold francs must be 
converted on the date of receipt of the bill to the applicable Special 
Drawing Right (SDR) rate (as published by the International Monetary 
Fund) on that date utilizing the linking coefficient of 3.061 gold 
francs = 1 SDR. An equivalent amount in U.S. dollars must be paid to the 
foreign administration. Upon written concurrence by the FCC, an 
accounting authority may make separate agreements, in writing, with 
foreign administrations or their agents for alternative settlement 
methods, in accordance with ITU-T Recommendation D.195.


<R05>
Sec. 3.47  Use of SDRs.

    An accounting authority must accept accounts presented to it from 
foreign administrations in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). These SDRs 
must be converted to dollars on the date of receipt by the accounting 
authority and an equivalent amount in US dollars must be paid to the 
foreign administration. The conversion rate will be the applicable rate 
published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the date of 
receipt of the account from the foreign administration. Upon written 
concurrence by the FCC, any accounting authority may make separate 
agreements, in writing, with foreign administrations or their agents for 
alternative settlement methods, provided account is taken of ITU-T 
Recommendation D.195.


<R05>
Sec. 3.48  Cooperation with the Commission.

    Accounting authorities must cooperate fully with the FCC in all 
respects concerning international maritime settlements issues, including 
the resolution of questions of fact or other issues arising as a result 
of settlement operations.


<R05>
Sec. 3.49  Agreement to be audited.

    Accounting authorities accept their certifications on condition that 
they are subject to audit of their settlement activities by the 
Commission or its representative. Additionally, the Commission reserves 
the right to verify any statement(s) made or any materials submitted to 
the Commission under these rules. Verification may involve discussions 
with ship owners or others as well as the requirement to submit 
additional information to the Commission. Failure to respond 
satisfactorily to any audit findings is grounds for forfeiture or 
suspension or cancellation of authority to act as an accounting 
authority for U.S. vessels.


<R05>
Sec. 3.50  Retention of settlement records.

    Accounting authorities must maintain, for the purpose of compliance 
with these rules, all settlement records for a period of at least seven 
years following settlement of an account with a foreign administration 
or agent.


<R05>
Sec. 3.51  Cessation of operations.

    The FCC must be notified immediately should an accounting authority 
plan to relinquish its certification or cease to perform settlements as 
authorized. Additionally, the Commission must be advised in advance of 
any proposed transfer of control of an accounting authority's firm or 
organization, by any means, to another entity.
    (a) When an accounting authority is transferred, merged or sold, the 
new entity must apply for certification in its own right if it is 
interested in becoming an accounting authority. Provided the new 
applicant is eligible and completes the application process 
satisfactorily, the AAIC will be transferred to the new applicant. In 
the case of a merger of two accounting authorities, the merged entity 
must decide which AAIC to retain.
    (b) Section 3.21(a) will be waived for these applicants.

[[Page 629]]

    (c) The applicant must comply with application process including 
public comment.
    (d) The applicant must certify acceptance of all accounts and must 
furnish a list of the accounts to the Commission at the time of 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 3.52  Complaint/inquiry resolution procedures.

    (a) Accounting authorities must maintain procedures for resolving 
complaints and/or inquiries from its contractual customers (vessels for 
which it performs settlements), the FCC, the ITU, and foreign 
administrations or their agents. These procedures must be available to 
the Commission upon request.
    (b) If a foreign administration requests assistance in collection of 
accounts from ships licensed by the FCC, the appropriate accounting 
authority will provide all information requested by the Commission in a 
timely manner to enable the Commission to determine the cause of the 
complaint and to resolve the issue. If accounts are in dispute, the 
Commission will determine the amount due the foreign administration, 
accounting authority or ROA, and may direct the accounting authority to 
pay the accounts to the foreign administration. If the accounting 
authority does not pay the disputed accounts within a reasonable 
timeframe, the Commission may take action to levy a forfeiture, cancel 
the AAIC privilege and/or to revoke any operating authority or licenses 
held by that accounting authority. (See also Sec. 3.72).


<R05>
Sec. 3.53  FCC notification of refusal to provide telecommunications service to U.S. registered vessel(s).

    An accounting authority must inform the FCC immediately should it 
receive notice from any source that a foreign administration or facility

from any U.S. registered vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 3.54  Notification of change in address.

    The Commission must be notified in writing within 15 days of any 
change in address of an accounting authority. Such written notification 
should be sent to the address shown in Sec. 3.61.

September following submission of an accounting authority's Initial 
Inventory of Vessels (See paragraph (a) of this section.) and each semi-
annual period thereafter, each accounting authority is required to 
submit to the FCC a report on additions, modifications or deletions to 
its list of vessels for which it is performing or intending to perform 
settlements, whether or not settlements actually have taken place. The 
list should contain only U.S. registered vessels. The report shall be 
typewritten or computer generated and be in the following general 
format:

The preceding report must be received by the Commission no later than 15

[[Page 630]]

days following the end of the period (March or September) for which the 
report pertains. Modifications refer to changes to call sign or ship 
name of vessels for which the accounting authority settles accounts and 
for whichbasic information has previously been provided to the 
Commission. Reports are to be submitted even if there have been no 
additions, modifications or deletions to vessel inventories since the 
previous report. If there are no changes to an inventory, this should be 
indicated on the report.
    (c) End of Year Inventory. By February 1st of each year, each 
accounting authority must submit an end-of-year inventory report listing 
vessels for which the accounting authority performed settlements as of 
the previous December 31st. The list should contain only U.S. registered 
vessels. The report must be typewritten or computer generated and 
prepared in the same general format as that shown in paragraph (a) of 
this section except it should be annotated to indicate it is the End of 
Year inventory.
    (d) Annual Statistical Report of Settlement Operations. By February 
1st of each year, each accounting authority settling accounts for U.S. 
registered vessels must submit to the FCC an Annual Statistical Report, 
FCC Form 45, which details the number and dollar amount of settlements, 
by foreign administration, during the preceding twelve months. 
Information contained in this report provides statistical data that will 
enable the Commission to monitor operations to ensure adherence to these 
rules and to appropriate international settlement procedures. FCC Form 
45 can be obtained by writing to the address in 3.61 of these rules.

of this section, the Commission will give notice of its intent to take 
the specified action and the grounds therefor, and afford a 30-day 
period for a response in writing; provided that, where the public 
interest so requires, the Commission may temporarily suspend a 
certification pending completion of these procedures. Responses must be

Sec. 3.75  Licensee's failure to make timely payment.

    Failure to remit proper and timely payment to the Commission or to 
an accounting authority may result in one or more of the following 
actions against the licensee:
    (a) Forfeiture or other authorized sanction.
    (b) The refusal by foreign countries to accept or refer public 
correspondence communications to or from the vessel or vessels owned, 
operated or licensed by the person or entity failing to make payment. 
This action may be taken at the request of the Commission or 
independently by the foreign country or coast station involved.
    (c) Further action to recover amounts owed utilizing any or all 
legally available debt collection procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 3.76  Licensee's liability for payment.

    The U.S. ship station licensee bears ultimate responsibility for 
final payment of its accounts. This responsibility cannot be superseded 
by the contractual agreement between the ship station licensee and the 
accounting authority. In the event that an accounting authority does not 
remit proper and timely payments on behalf of the ship station licensee:
    (a) The ship station licensee will make arrangements for another 
accounting authority to perform future settlements, and
    (b) The ship station licensee will settle any outstanding accounts 
due to foreign entities.
    (c) The Commission will, upon request, take all possible steps, 
within the limits of applicable national law, to ensure settlement of 
the accounts of the ship station licensee. As circumstances warrant, 
this may include issuing warnings to ship station licensees when it 
becomes apparent that an accounting authority is failing to settle 
accounts. See also Secs. 3.70 through 3.74.

shall be signed, authenticated, and submitted in the same manner and 
with the same number of copies as required for the original application. 
All subsequent correspondence or other material that the applicant 
desires to have incorporated as a part of an application already filed 
shall be submitted in the form of an amendment to the application.
    (b) Failure to prosecute an application, or failure to respond to 
official correspondence or request for additional information, will be 
cause for dismissal. Such dismissal will be without prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 5.69  Partial grants.

    In cases in which the Commission grants an application in part, or 
with any privileges, terms, or conditions other than those requested, or 
subject to any interference that may result to a station if designated 
application or applications are subsequently granted, the action of the 
Commission shall be considered as a grant of such application unless the 
applicant shall, within 30 days from the date on which such grant is 
made or from its effective date if a later date is specified, file with 
the Commission a written request rejecting the grant as made. Upon 
receipt of such request, the Commission will coordinate with the 
applicant in an attempt to resolve problems arising from the grant.

of that duration. A license may be renewed upon an adequate showing of 
need.
    (b) A license will not be granted for a period longer than that 
which is required for completion of the experimental project. If such 
period is estimated to be less than 2 years, or between 2-5 years, a 
statement to that effect by the applicant may facilitate grant of the 
application. See also Sec. 5.69 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.73  Experimental report.

    (a) Unless specifically stated as a condition of the authorization, 
licensees are not required to file a report on the results of the 
experimental program carried on under this subpart.
    (b) The Commission may, as a condition of authorization, request the 
licensee to forward periodic reports in order to evaluate the progress 
of the experimental program.
    (c) An applicant may request that the Commission withhold from the 
public certain reports and associated material and the Commission will 
do so unless the public interest requires otherwise. These requests 
should follow the procedures for submission set forth in Sec. 0.459 of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 5.75  Number of licenses required.

    An application for a station embracing widely divergent and 
unrelated experimentations will normally require a separate license for 
each experiment. However, if the experiments are related or conducted by 
the same manufacturer, an applicant may apply for a blanket license 
encompassing the entire experimental program. If a blanket license is 
granted, licensees will be required to notify the Commission of the 
specific details of each individual experiment, including location, 
number of base and mobile units, power, emission designator, and any 
other pertinent technical information not specified by the blanket 
license.

[[Page 638]]


<R05>
Sec. 5.77  Change in equipment and emission characteristics.

    (a) A change may be made in a licensed transmitter without specific 
authorization from the Commission provided that the change does not 
result in operations inconsistent with any term of the outstanding 
authorization for the station involved.
    (b) Discrete changes in emission characteristics may be made without 
specific authorization from the Commission provided that the Commission 
is given written notification demonstrating that such changes will not 
exceed the maximum emissions envelope established in the existing 
authorization. Changes made pursuant to such notification that become a 
permanent part of the licensee's experimental program must be listed in 
the licensee's next application for renewal.
    (c) Prior authorization from the Commission is required before the 
following antenna changes may be made at a station at a fixed location:
    (1) Any change that will either increase the height of a structure 
supporting the radiating portion of the antenna or decrease the height 
of a lighted antenna structure.
    (2) Any change in the location of an antenna when such relocation 
involves a change in the geographic coordinates of latitude or longitude 
by as much as one second, or when such relocation involves a change in 
street address.


<R05>
Sec. 5.79  Transfer and assignment of station authorization.

    A station authorization, the frequencies authorized to be used by 
the grantee of such authorization, and the rights therein granted by 
such authorization shall not be transferred, assigned, or in any manner 
either voluntarily or involuntarily disposed of, unless the Commission 
shall, after securing full information, decide that such a transfer is 
in the public interest and give its consent in writing. Requests for 
authority to transfer or assign a station authorization shall be 
submitted on the forms prescribed by Sec. 5.59 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.81  Discontinuance of station operation.

    In case of permanent discontinuance of operation of a fixed or land 
station in the Experimental Radio Service, or in case of permanent 
discontinuance of operation of all transmitter units listed in the 
license for a mobile station in the Experimental Radio Service, the 
licensee shall forward the station license to the Commission's Office of 
Engineering and Technology for cancellation.


<R05>
Sec. 5.83  Cancellation provisions.

    The applicant for a station in the Experimental Radio Services 
accepts the license with the express understanding: (a) that the 
authority to use the frequency or frequencies assigned is granted upon 
an experimental basis only and does not confer any right to conduct an 
activity of a continuing nature; and
    (b) that said grant is subject to change or cancellation by the 
Commission at any time without hearing if in its discretion the need for 
such action arises. However, a petition for reconsideration or 
application for review may be filed to such Commission action.


<R05>
Sec. 5.85  Frequencies and policy governing their assignment.

    (a) Stations operating in the Experimental Radio Service may be 
authorized to use any government or non-government frequency designated 
in the Table of Frequency Allocations set forth in part 2 of this 
chapter, provided that the need for the frequency requested is fully 
justified by the applicant.
    (b) Each frequency or band of frequencies available for assignment 
to stations in the Experimental Radio Service is available on a shared 
basis only, and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any one 
applicant, and such use may also be restricted to one or more specified 
geographical areas. Not more than one frequency in a band of frequencies 
will normally be assigned for the use of a single applicant

[[Page 639]]

unless a showing is made demonstrating that need for the assignment of 
additional frequencies is essential to the proposed program of 
experimentation.
    (c) Frequency assignments will be made only on the condition that 
harmful interference will not be caused to any station operating in 
accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocation of part 2 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Use of Public Safety Frequencies. Applicants in the Experimental 
Radio Service must avoid use of public safety frequencies except when a 
compelling showing can be made that use of such frequencies is in the 
public interest. Public safety frequencies are identified in subpart B 
(Public Safety Radio Services) and subpart C (Special Emergency Radio 
Service) of part 90 of this Chapter. In addition, subpart S of part 90 
of this chapter contains rules for the assignment of frequencies that 
may be used by Public Safety Radio Services in the 806-824 MHz and 851-
869 MHz bands. If an experimental license to use public safety radio 
frequencies is granted, the authorization will be conditioned to require 
coordination between the experimental licensee and the appropriate 
frequency coordinator and/or all of the public safety licensees in its 
intended area of operation.
    (e) The Commission may, at its discretion, condition any 
experimental license or STA on the requirement that before commencing 
operation, the new licensee coordinate its proposed facility with other 
licensees that may receive interference as a result of the new 
licensee's operations.
    (f) Protection of FCC monitoring stations. (1) Applicants are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need 
to protect FCC monitoring stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of such stations are listed in Sec. 0.121(b) of 
this chapter. Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that 
will produce on any frequency a direct wave fundamental field strength 
of greater than 10 mV/m in the authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 
dBW/m <SUP>2</SUP> power flux density assuming a free space 
characteristic impedance of 120[pi] ohms) at the referenced coordinates, 
may be examined to determine the extent of possible interference. 
Depending on the theoretical field strength value or other ambient radio 
field signal levels at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting 
the monitoring station may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field strength 
exceeds 10 mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m <SUP>2</SUP>) at the reference coordinates, 
or if there is any question whether field strength levels might exceed 
the threshold value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any 
protection necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may 
communicate with the Technology Division, Compliance and Information 
Bureau, telephone (202) 418-1210, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC 20554.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data that indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iii) Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station.
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of this Chapter and also meets the criteria outlined in 
paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place.

[[Page 640]]

However, applicants are advised that such consultation can avoid 
objections from the Commission.

Sec. 11.1  Purpose.

    This part contains rules and regulations providing for an Emergency 
Alert System (EAS). The EAS provides the President with the capability 
to provide immediate communications and information to the general 
public at the National, State and Local Area levels during periods of 
national emergency. The rules in this part describe the required 
technical standards and operational procedures of the EAS for AM, FM and 
TV broadcast stations, cable systems and other participating entities. 
The EAS may be used to provide the heads of State and local government, 
or their designated representatives, with a means of emergency 
communication with the public in their State or Local Area.

                    Subpart B--Equipment Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 11.31  EAS protocol.

    (a) The EAS uses a four part message for an emergency activation of 
the EAS. The four parts are: Preamble and EAS Header Codes; audio 
Attention Signal; message; and, Preamble and EAS End Of Message (EOM) 
Codes.
    (1) The Preamble and EAS Codes must use Audio Frequency Shift Keying 
at a rate of 520.83 bits per second to transmit the codes. Mark 
frequency is 2083.3 Hz and space frequency is 1562.5 Hz. Mark and space 
time must be 1.92 milliseconds. Characters are ASCII seven bit 
characters as defined in ANSI X3.4-1977 ending with an eighth null bit 
(either 0 or 1) to constitute a full eight-bit byte.
    (2) The Attention Signal must be made up of the fundamental 
frequencies of 853 and 960 Hz. The two tones must be transmitted 
simultaneously. The Attention Signal must be transmitted after the EAS 
header codes.
    (3) The message may be audio, video or text.
    (b) The ASCII dash and plus symbols are required and may not be used 
for any other purpose. FM or TV call signs must use a slash ASCII 
character number 47 (/) in lieu of a dash.
    (c) The EAS protocol, including any codes, must not be amended, 
extended or abridged without FCC authorization. The EAS protocol and 
message format

[[Page 660]]

are specified in the following representation.

Examples are provided in FCC Public Notices.

[PREAMBLE]ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-(one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-(one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-(at least a one

(transmission of audio, video or text messages)
(at least a one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]NNNN(one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]NNNN(one second pause)
[PREAMBLE]NNNN(at least one second pause)

    [PREAMBLE] This is a consecutive string of bits (sixteen bytes of AB 
hexadecimal [8 bit byte 10101011]) sent to clear the system, set AGC and 
set asynchronous decoder clocking cycles. The preamble must be 
transmitted before each header and End Of Message code.
    ZCZC--This is the identifier, sent as ASCII characters ZCZC to 
indicate the start of ASCII code.
    ORG--This is the Originator code and indicates who originally 
initiated the activation of the EAS. These codes are specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    EEE--This is the Event code and indicates the nature of the EAS 
activation. The codes are specified in paragraph (e) of this section. 
The Event codes must be compatible with the codes used by the NWS 
Weather Radio Specific Area Message Encoder (WRSAME).
    PSSCCC--This the Location code and indicates the geographic area 
affected by the EAS alert. There may be 31 Location codes in an EAS 
alert. The Location code uses the Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) numbers as described by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
in National Institute of Standards and Technology publication FIPS PUB 
6-4. Each state is assigned an SS number as specified in paragraph (f) 
of this section. Each county and some cities are assigned a CCC number. 
A CCC number of 000 refers to an entire State or Territory. P defines 
county subdivisions as follows: 0 = all or an unspecified portion of a 
county, 1 = Northwest, 2 = North, 3 = Northeast, 4 = West, 5 = Central, 
6 = East, 7 = Southwest, 8 = South, 9 = Southeast. Other numbers may be 
designated later for special applications. The use of county 
subdivisions will probably be rare and generally for oddly shaped or 
unusually large counties. Any subdivisions must be defined and agreed to 
by the local officials prior to use.
    +TTTT--This indicates the valid time period of a message in 15 
minute segments up to one hour and then in 30 minute segments beyond one 
hour; i.e., +0015, +0030, +0045, +0100, +0430 and +0600.
    JJJHHMM--This is the day in Julian Calendar days (JJJ) of the year 
and the time in hours and minutes (HHMM) when the message was initially 
released by the originator using 24 hour Universal Coordinated Time 
(UTC).
    LLLLLLLL--This is the identification of the broadcast station, cable 
system, MDS/MMDS/ITFS station, NWS office, etc., transmitting or 
retransmitting the message. These codes will be automatically affixed to 
all outgoing messages by the EAS encoder.
    NNNN--This is the End of Message (EOM) code sent as a string of four 
ASCII N characters.

    (d) The only originator codes are:

    (a) An EAS Decoder must at a minimum be capable of decoding the EAS 
protocol described in Sec. 11.31, provide the EAS monitoring functions 
described in Sec. 11.52, and the following minimum specifications:
    (1) Inputs. Decoders must have the capability to receive at least 2 
audio inputs from EAS monitoring assignments, and one data input (RS-
232C with standard protocol and 1200 baud rate). The data input may be 
used to monitor other communications modes such as Radio Broadcast Data 
System (RBDS), NWR, satellite, public switched telephone network, or any 
other source that uses the EAS protocol.
    (2) Valid codes. There must be a means to determine if valid EAS 
header codes are received and to determine if preselected header codes 
are received.
    (3) Storage. Decoders must provide the means to:
    (i) Record and store, either internally or externally, at least two 
minutes of audio or text messages. A decoder manufactured without an 
internal means to record and store audio or text must be equipped with a 
means (such as an audio or digital jack connection) to couple to an 
external recording and storing device.
    (ii) Store at least ten preselected event and originator header 
codes, in addition to the seven mandatory event/originator codes for 
tests and national activations, and store any preselected location codes 
for comparison with incoming header codes. A non-preselected header code 
that is manually transmitted must be stored for comparison with later 
incoming header codes. The header codes of the last ten received valid 
messages which still have valid time periods must be stored for 
comparison with the incoming valid header codes for later messages. 
These last received header codes will be deleted from storage as their 
valid time periods expire.
    (4) Display and logging. A visual message shall be developed from 
any valid header codes for tests and national activations and any 
preselected header codes received. The message shall include the 
Originator, Event, Location, the valid time period of the message and 
the local time the message was transmitted. The message shall be in the 
primary language of the broadcast station or cable system and be fully 
displayed on the decoder and readable in normal light and darkness. All 
existing and new models of EAS decoders manufactured after August 1, 
2003 must provide a means to permit the selective display and logging of 
EAS messages containing header codes for state and local EAS events. 
Effective May 16, 2002, broadcast stations, cable systems and wireless 
cable systems may upgrade their decoders on an optional basis to include 
a selective display and logging capability for EAS messages containing 
header codes for state and local events. Broadcast stations, cable 
systems and wireless cable systems which replace their decoders after 
February 1, 2004 must install decoders that provide a means to permit 
the selective

[[Page 664]]

display and logging of EAS messages containing header codes for state 
and local EAS events.
    (5) Indicators. EAS decoders must have a distinct and separate aural 
or visible means to indicate when any of the following conditions 
occurs:
    (i) Any valid EAS header codes are received as specified in 
Sec. 11.33(a)(10).
    (ii) Preprogrammed header codes, such as those selected in 
accordance with Sec. 11.52(d)(2) are received.
    (iii) A signal is present at each audio input that is specified in 
Sec. 11.33(a)(1).
    (6) Program Data Retention. The program data must be retained even 
with power removed.
    (7) Outputs. Decoders shall have the following outputs: a data port 
or ports (RS-232C with standard protocol and 1200 baud rate) where 
received valid EAS header codes and received preselected header codes 
are available; one audio port that is capable of monitoring each decoder 
audio input; and, an internal speaker to enable personnel to hear audio 
from each input.
    (8) Decoder Programming. Access to decoder programming shall be 
protected by a lock or other security measures and be configured so that 
authorized personnel can readily select and program the EAS Decoder with 
preselected Originator, Event and Location codes for either manual or 
automatic operation.
    (9) Reset. There shall be a method to automatically or manually 
reset the decoder to the normal monitoring condition. Operators shall be 
able to selecta time interval, not less than two minutes, in which the 
decoder would automatically reset if it received an EAS header code but 
not an end-of-message (EOM) code. Messages received with the EAN Event 
codes shall disable the reset function so that lengthy audio messages 
can be handled. The last message received with valid header codes shall 
be displayed as required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section before the 
decoder is reset.
    (10) Message Validity. An EAS Decoder must provide error detection 
and validation of the header codes of each message to ascertain if the 
message is valid. Header code comparisons may be accomplished through 
the use of a bit-by-bit compare or any other error detection and 
validation protocol. A header code must only be considered valid when 
two of the three headers match exactly. Duplicate messages must not be 
relayed automatically.
    (11) A header code with the EAN Event code specified in 
Sec. 11.31(c) that is received through any of the audio inputs must 
override all other messages.
    (b) Attention Signal. EAS Decoders at broadcast stations shall have 
detection and activation circuitry that will demute a receiver upon 
detection of the two audio tones of 853 Hz and 960 Hz. To prevent false 
responses, decoders designed to use the two tones for broadcast receiver 
demuting shall comply with the following:
    (1) Time Delay. A minimum time delay of 8 but not more than 16 
seconds of tone reception shall be incorporated into the demuting or 
activation process to insure that the tones will be audible for a period 
of at least 4 seconds. After July 1, 1995, the time delay shall be 3-4 
seconds.
    (2) Operation Bandwidth. The decoder circuitry shall not respond to 
tones which vary more than [plusmn]5 Hz from each of the frequencies, 
853 Hz and 960 Hz.
    (3) Reset Ability. The decoder shall have a means to manually or 
automatically reset the associated broadcast receiver to a muted state.
    (c) Decoders shall be capable of operation within the tolerances 
specified in this section as well as those in Sec. 11.32 (b), (c) and 
(d).

Sec. 11.44  EAS message priorities.

    (a) A national activation of the EAS for a Presidential message with 
the

[[Page 667]]

Event code EAN as specified in Sec. 11.31 must take priority over any 
other message and preempt it if it is in progress.
    (b) EAS participants should transmit other EAS messages in the 
following order: first, Local Area Messages; second, State Messages; and 
third, National Information Center (NIC) Messages.
    (c) Key EAS sources (NP, LP, SP and SR) and Participating National 
(PN) sources that remain on the air during a National emergency must 
carry Presidential Messages ``live'' at the time of transmission or 
immediately upon receipt. Activation of the National level EAS must 
preempt State and Local Area EAS operation.
    (d) During a national emergency, the radio and television broadcast 
network program distribution facilities must be reserved exclusively for 
distribution of Presidential Messages. NIC messages received from 
national networks which are not broadcast at the time of original 
transmission must be recorded locally by LP sources for transmission at 
the earliest opportunity consistent with the message priorities in 
paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 11.45  Prohibition of false or deceptive EAS transmissions.

    No person may transmit or cause to transmit the EAS codes or 
Attention Signal, or a recording or simulation thereof, in any 
circumstance other than in an actual National, State or Local Area 
emergency or authorizedtest of the EAS. Broadcast station licensees 
should also refer to Sec. 73.1217 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 11.46  EAS public service announcements.

    Broadcast stations, cable systems and wireless cable systems may use 
Public Service Announcements or obtain commercial sponsors for 
announcements, infomercials, or programs explaining the EAS to the 
public. Such announcements and programs may not be a part of alerts or 
tests, and may not simulate or attempt to copy alert tones or codes.

Sec. 11.47  Optional use of other communications methods and systems.

    (a) Broadcast stations may additionally transmit EAS messages 
through other communications means than the main audio channel. For 
example, on a voluntary basis, FM stations may use subcarriers to 
transmit the EAS codes including 57 kHz using the RBDS standard produced 
by the National Radio Systems Committee (NRSC) and television stations 
may use subsidiary communications services.
    (b) Other technologies and public service providers, such as DBS, 
low earth orbiting satellites, etc., that wish to participate in the EAS 
may contact the FCC's Technical and Public Safety Division, Enforcement 
Bureau, or their State Emergency Communications Committee for 
information and guidance.

<R05>
Sec. 11.51  EAS code and Attention Signal Transmission requirements.

    (a) Broadcast stations must transmit, either automatically or 
manually, national level EAS messages and required tests by sending the 
EAS header codes, Attention Signal, emergency message and End of Message 
(EOM) using the EAS Protocol. The Attention Signal must precede any 
emergency audio message. After January 1, 1998, the shortened Attention 
Signal may only be used as an audio alert signal and the EAS codes will 
become the minimum signalling requirement for National level messages 
and tests.
    (b) When relaying EAS messages, broadcast stations and cable systems 
and wireless cable systems may transmit only the EAS header codes and 
the EOM code without the Attention Signal and emergency message for 
State and local emergencies. Television stations, cable systems and 
wireless cable systems should ensure that pauses in video programming 
before EAS message transmission do not cause television receivers to 
mute EAS audio messages. No Attention Signal is required for EAS 
messages that do not

[[Page 668]]

contain audio programming, such as a Required Weekly Test.
    (c) Effective January 1, 1997, all radio and television stations 
shall transmit EAS messages in the main audio channel.
    (d) By the above date, television stations shall transmit a visual 
message containing the Originator, Event, Location and the valid time 
period of an EAS message. If the message is a video crawl, it shall be 
displayed at the top of the television screen or where it will not 
interfere with other visual messages.
    (e) Class D non-commercial educational FM stations as defined in 
Sec. 73.506 of this chapter, Low Power FM (LPFM) stations as defined in 
Secs. 73.811 and 73.853 of this chapter, and low power TV (LPTV) 
stations as defined in Sec. 74.701(f) of this chapter are not required 
to have equipment capable of generating the EAS codes and Attention 
Signal specified in Sec. 11.31.
    (f) Broadcast station equipment generating the EAS codes and the 
Attention Signal shall modulate a broadcast station transmitter so that 
the signal broadcast to other broadcast stations and cable systems and 
wireless cable systems alerts them that the EAS is being activated or 
tested at the National, State or Local Area level. The minimum level of 
modulation for EAS codes, measured at peak modulation levels using the 
internal calibration output required in Sec. 11.32(a)(4), shall modulate 
the transmitter at the maximum possible level, but in no case less than 
50% of full channel modulation limits. Measured at peak modulation 
levels, each of the Attention Signal tones shall be calibrated 
separately to modulate the transmitter at no less than 40%. These two 
calibrated modulation levels shall have values that are within 1 dB of 
each other.
    (g) Effective October 1, 2002, cable systems with fewer than 5,000 
subscribers per headend and wireless cable systems with fewer than 5,000 
subscribers shall transmit EAS audio messages in the same order 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section on at least one channel. The 
Attention Signal may be produced from a storage device. Additionally, 
cable systems and wireless cable systems must:
    (1) Install, operate, and maintain equipment capable of generating 
the EAS codes. The modulation levels for the EAS codes and Attention 
Signal shall comply with the aural signal requirements in Sec. 76.605 of 
this chapter,
    (2) Provide a video interruption and an audio alert message on all 
channels. The audio alert message must state which channel is carrying 
the EAS video and audio message,
    (3) Cable systems and wireless cable systems shall transmit a visual 
EAS message on at least one channel. The message shall contain the 
Originator, Event, Location, and the valid time period of the EAS 
message. If the visual message is a video crawl, it shall be displayed 
at the top of the subscriber's television screen or where it will not 
interfere with other visual messages.
    (4) Cable systems and wireless cable systems may elect not to 
interrupt EAS messages from broadcast stations based upon a written 
agreement between all concerned. Further, cable systems and wireless 
cable systems may elect not to interrupt the programming of a broadcast 
station carrying news or weather related emergency information with 
state and local EAS messages based on a written agreement between all 
parties.
    (h) Effective December 31, 1998, cable systems with 10,000 or more 
subscribers; and, effective October 1, 2002, cable systems serving 5,000 
or more, but less than 10,000 subscribers per headend and wireless cable 
systems with 5,000 or more subscribers; shall transmit EAS audio 
messages in the same order specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 
The Attention Signal may be produced from a storage device. 
Additionally, after the dates indicated, these cable systems and 
wireless cable systems must:
    (1) Install, operate, and maintain equipment capable of generating 
the EAS codes. The modulation levels for the EAS codes and Attention 
Signal for cable systems shall comply with the aural signal requirements 
in Sec. 76.605 of this chapter. This will provide sufficient signal 
levels to operate cable subscriber television and radio receivers 
equipped with EAS decoders and to audibly alert subscribers. Wireless 
cable systems shall also provide sufficient

[[Page 669]]

signal levels to operate subscriber television and radio receivers 
equipped with EAS decoders and to audibly alert subscribers.
    (2) The cable systems and wireless cable systems in this paragraph 
(h) shall transmit the EAS audio message required in paragraph (a) of 
this section on all downstream channels.
    (3) The cable systems and wireless cable systems in this paragraph 
(h) shall transmit the EAS visual message on all downstream channels. 
The visual message shall contain the Originator, Event, Location and the 
valid time period of the EAS message. These are elements of the EAS 
header code and are described in Sec. 11.31. If the visual message is a 
video crawl, it shall be displayed at the top of the subscriber's 
television screen or where it will not interfere with other visual 
messages.
    (4) Cable systems and wireless cable systems may elect not to 
interrupt EAS messages from broadcast stations based upon a written 
agreement between all concerned. Further, cable systems and wireless 
cable systems may elect not to interrupt the programming of a broadcast 
station carrying news or weather related emergency information with 
state and local EAS messages based on a written agreement between all 
parties.
    (i) If manual interrupt is used as authorized in paragraph (k) of 
this section, EAS Encoders must be located so that broadcast station, 
cable system or wireless cable system staff, at normal duty locations, 
can initiate the EAS code and Attention Signal transmission.
    (j) Broadcast stations, and cable systems and wireless cable systems 
that are co-owned and co-located with a combined studio or control 
facility, (such as an AM and FM licensed to the same entity and at the 
same location or a cable headend serving more than one system) may 
provide the EAS transmitting requirements contained in this section for 
the combined stations or cable systems or wireless cable systems with 
one EAS Encoder. The requirements of Sec. 11.32 must be met by the 
combined facility.
    (k) Broadcast stations and cable systems and wireless cable systems 
are required to transmit all received EAS messages in which the header 
code contains the Event codes for Emergency Action Notification (EAN), 
Emergency Action Termination (EAT), and Required Monthly Test (RMT), and 
when the accompanying location codes include their State or State/
county. These EAS messages shall be retransmitted unchanged except for 
the LLLLLLLL-code which identifies the broadcast station, cable system, 
wireless cable system, or other entity retransmitting the message. See 
Sec. 11.31(c). If an EAS source originates an EAS message with the Event 
codes in this paragraph, it must include the location codes for the 
State and counties in its service area. When transmitting the required 
weekly test, broadcast stations and cable systems and wireless cable 
systems shall use the event code RWT. The location codes are the state 
and county for the broadcast station city of license or cable system or 
wireless cable system community or city. Other location codes may be 
included upon approval of broadcast station, cable system or wireless 
cable system management. EAS messages may be transmitted automatically 
or manually.
    (1) Automatic interrupt of programming and transmission of EAS 
messages are required when facilities are unattended. Automatic 
transmissions must include a permanent record that contains at a minimum 
the following information: Originator, Event, Location and valid time 
period of the message. The decoder performs the functions necessary to 
determine which EAS messages are automatically transmitted by the 
encoder.
    (2) Manual interrupt of programming and transmission of EAS messages 
may be used. EAS messages with the EAN Event code must be transmitted 
immediately and Monthly EAS test messages within 60 minutes. All actions 
must be logged and include the minimum information required for EAS 
video messages.
    (l) Broadcast stations and cable systems and wireless cable systems 
may employ a minimum delay feature, not to exceed 15 minutes, for 
automatic interruption of EAS codes. However, this may not be used for 
the EAN event

[[Page 670]]

which must be transmitted immediately. The delay time for an RMT message 
may not exceed 60 minutes.
    (m) Either manual or automatic operation of EAS equipment may be 
used at broadcast stations and cable systems and wireless cable systems 
that use remote control. If manual operation is used, an EAS decoder 
must be located at the remote control location and it must directly 
monitor the signals of the two assigned EAS sources. If direct 
monitoring of the assigned EAS sources is not possible at the remote 
location, automatic operation is required. If automatic operation is 
used, the remote control location may be used to override the 
transmission of an EAS alert. Broadcast stations and cable systems and 
wireless cable systems may change back and forth between automatic and 
manual operation.

handicap which would clearly prevent the performance of all or any part 
of the duties of a radio operator, under the license for which

therein to installation, service, and maintenance duties.
    (iii) In any case where an applicant who normally would receive or 
has received a commercial radio operator license bearing the endorsement 
prescribed by paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, indicates a desire to 
operate a station falling within the prohibited terms of the 
endorsement, the applicant may request in writing that such endorsement 
not be placed upon, or be removed from his or her license, and may 
submit written comments or statements from other parties in support 
thereof.
    (iv) An applicant who shows that he has performed satisfactorily the 
duties of a radio operator at a station required to be provided for 
safety purposes during a period when he or she was afflicted by 
uncorrected physical handicaps of the same kind and to the same degree 
as the physical handicaps shown by his or her current application shall 
not be deemed to be within the provisions of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this 
section.
    (d) A Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit-Limited Use issued 
by the FCC to an aircraft pilot who is not legally eligible for 
employment in the United States is valid only for operating radio

telephone network and the other a mobile handset unit that communicates 
directly with the base station. Transmissions from the mobile unit are 
received by the base station and then placed on the public switched 
telephone network. Information received from the switched telephone 
network is transmitted by the base station to the mobile unit.

    Note: The Domestic Public Cellular Radio Telecommunications Service 
is considered to be part of the switched telephone network. In addition, 
intercom and paging operations are permitted provided these are not 
intended to be the primary modes of operation.

    (k) Digital device. (Previously defined as a computing device). An 
unintentional radiator (device or system) that generates and uses timing 
signals or pulses at a rate in excess of 9,000 pulses (cycles) per

    (a) Persons operating intentional or unintentional radiators shall 
not be deemed to have any vested or recognizable right to continued use 
of any given frequency by virtue of prior registration or certification 
of equipment, or, for power line carrier systems, on the basis of prior 
notification of use pursuant to Sec. 90.63(g) of this chapter.
    (b) Operation of an intentional, unintentional, or incidental 
radiator is subject to the conditions that no harmful interference is 
caused and that interference must be accepted that may be caused by the 
operation of an authorized radio station, by another intentional or 
unintentional radiator, by industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) 
equipment, or by an incidental radiator.
    (c) The operator of a radio frequency device shall be required to 
cease operating the device upon notification by a Commission 
representative that the device is causing harmful interference. 
Operation shall not resume until the condition causing the harmful 
interference has been corrected.
    (d) Intentional radiators that produce Class B emissions (damped 
wave) are prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 15.7  Special temporary authority.

    (a) The Commission will, in exceptional situations, consider an 
individual application for a special temporary authorization to operate 
an incidental, intentional or unintentional radiation device not 
conforming to the provisions of this part, where it can be shown that 
the proposed operation would be in the public interest, that it is for a 
unique type of station or for a type of operation which is incapable of 
being established as a regular service, and that the proposed operation 
can

[[Page 690]]

not feasibly be conducted under this part.
    (b) No authorization is required in order to perform testing of 
equipment for determining compliance with these regulations. Except as 
provided in subpart I of part 2 of this chapter, this provision does not 
permit the providing of equipment to potential users in order to 
determine customer acceptance of the product or marketing strategy, nor 
does this provision permit any type of operation other than a 
determination of compliance with the regulations. During this testing, 
the provisions of Secs. 15.5 and 15.205 apply.


<R05>
Sec. 15.9  Prohibition against eavesdropping.

    Except for the operations of law enforcement officers conducted 
under lawful authority, no person shall use, either directly or 
indirectly, a device operated pursuant to the provisions of this part 
for the purpose of overhearing or recording the private conversations of 
others unless such use is authorized by all of the parties engaging in 
the conversation.


<R05>
Sec. 15.11  Cross reference.

    The provisions of subparts A, H, I, J and K of part 2 apply to 
intentional and unintentional radiators, in addition to the provisions 
of this part. Also, a cable system terminal device and a cable input 
selector switch shall be subject to the relevant provisions of part 76

Sec. 15.15  General technical requirements.

    (a) An intentional or unintentional radiator shall be constructed in 
accordance with good engineering design and manufacturing practice. 
Emanations from the device shall be suppressed as much as practicable, 
but in no case shall the emanations exceed the levels specified in these 
rules.
    (b) An intentional or unintentional radiator must be constructed 
such that the adjustments of any control that is readily accessible by 
or intended to be accessible to the user will not cause operation of the 
device in violation of the regulations.
    (c) Parties responsible for equipment compliance should note that 
the limits specified in this part will not prevent harmful interference 
under all circumstances. Since the operators of part 15 devices are 
required to cease operation should harmful interference occur to 
authorized users of the radiofrequency spectrum, the parties responsible 
for equipment compliance are encouraged to employ the minimum field 
strength necessary for communications, to provide greater attenuation of 
unwanted emissions than required by these regulations, and to advise the 
user as to how to resolve harmful interference problems (for example, 
see Sec. 15.105(b)).


<R05>
Sec. 15.17  Susceptibility to interference.

    (a) Parties responsible for equipment compliance are advised to 
consider the proximity and the high power of non-Government licensed 
radio stations, such as broadcast, amateur, land mobile, and non-
geostationary mobile satellite feeder link earth stations, and of U.S. 
Government radio stations, which could include high-powered radar 
systems, when choosing operating frequencies during the design of their 
equipment so as to reduce the susceptibility for receiving harmful 
interference. Information on non-Government use of the spectrum can be 
obtained by consulting the Table of Frequency Allocations in Sec. 2.106 
of this chapter.
    (b) Information on U.S. Government operations can be obtained by 
contacting: Director, Spectrum Plans and Policy, National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration, Department of 
Commerce, Room 4096, Washington, DC 20230.

the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) 
and 1 CFR part 51. The Commission encourages the use of this procedure 
for testing digital devices, intentional radiators, and other 
unintentional radiators as soon as practical. Copies of ANSI C63.4-1992 
may be obtained from: IEEE Standards Department, 455 Hoes Lane, P.O. Box 
1331, Piscataway, NJ 08855-1331, telephone 1-800-678-4333. Copies of

    (ii) Federal Communications Commission Laboratory, 7435 Oakland 
Mills Road, Columbia, MD 21046, or
    (iii) Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., 
suite 700, Washington, DC.

    Note: Digital devices tested to show compliance with the provisions 
of Secs. 15.107(e) and 15.109(g) must be tested following the ANSI C63.4 
procedure described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

    (b) All parties making compliance measurements on equipment subject 
to the requirements of this part are urged to use these measurement 
procedures. Any party using other procedures should ensure that such 
other procedures can be relied on to produce measurement results 
compatible with the FCC measurement procedures. The description of the 
measurement procedure used in testing the equipment for compliance and a 
list of the test equipment actually employed shall be made part of an 
application for certification or included with the data required to be 
retained by the party responsible for devices authorized pursuant to a 
Declaration of Conformity or devices subject to verification.
    (c) For swept frequency equipment, measurements shall be made with 
the frequency sweep stopped at those frequencies chosen for the 
measurements to be reported.
    (d) Field strength measurements shall be made, to the extent 
possible, on an open field site. Test sites other than open field sites 
may be employed if they are properly calibrated so that the measurement 
results correspond to what would be obtained from an open field site. In 
the case of equipment for which measurements can be performed only at 
the installation site, such as perimeter protection systems, carrier

[[Page 697]]

current systems, and systems employing a ``leaky'' coaxial cable as an 
antenna, measurements for verification or for obtaining a grant of 
equipment authorizaton shall be performed at a minimum of three 
installations that can be demonstrated to be representative of typical 
installation sites.
    (e) For intentional radiators, measurements of the variation of the 
input power or the radiated signal level of the fundamental frequency 
component of the emission, as appropriate, shall be performed with the 
supply voltage varied between 85% and 115% of the nominal rated supply 
voltage. For battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be 
performed using a new battery.
    (f) To the extent practicable, the device under test shall be 
measured at the distance specified in the appropriate rule section. The 
distance specified corresponds to the horizontal distance between the 
measurement antenna and the closest point of the equipment under test, 
support equipment or interconnecting cables as determined by the 
boundary defined by an imaginary straight line periphery describing a 
simple geometric configuration enclosing the system containing the 
equipment under test. The equipment under test, support equipment and 
any interconnecting cables shall be included within this boundary.
    (1) At frequencies at or above 30 MHz, measurements may be performed 
at a distance other than what is specified provided: measurements are 
not made in the near field except where it can be shown that near field 
measurements are appropriate due to the characteristics of the device; 
and it can be demonstrated that the signal levels needed to be measured 
at the distance employed can be detected by the measurement equipment. 
Measurements shall not be performed at a distance greater than 30 meters 
unless it can be further demonstrated that measurements at a distance of 
30 meters or less are impractical. When performing measurements at a 
distance other than that specified, the results shall be extrapolated to 
the specified distance using an extrapolation factor of 20 dB/decade 
(inverse linear-distance for field strength measurements; inverse-
linear-distance-squared for power density measurements).
    (2) At frequencies below 30 MHz, measurements may be performed at a 
distance closer than that specified in the regulations; however, an 
attempt should be made to avoid making measurements in the near field. 
Pending the development of an appropriate measurement procedure for 
measurements performed below 30 MHz, when performing measurements at a 
closer distance than specified, the results shallbe extrapolated to the 
specified distance by either making measurements at a minimum of two 
distances on at least one radial to determine the proper extrapolation 
factor or by using the square of an inverse linear distance 
extrapolation factor (40 dB/decade).
    (3) The applicant for a grant of certification shall specify the 
extrapolation method used in the application filed with the Commission. 
For equipment subject to Declaration of Conformity or verification, this 
information shall be retained with the measurement data.
    (4) When measurement distances of 30 meters or less are specified in 
the regulations, the Commission will test the equipment at the distance 
specified unless measurement at that distance results in measurements 
being performed in the near field. When measurement distances of greater 
than 30 meters are specified in the regulations, the Commission will 
test the equipment at a closer distance, usually 30 meters, 
extrapolating the measured field strength to the specified distance 
using the methods shown in this section.
    (5) Measurements shall be performed at a sufficient number of 
radials around the equipment under test to determine the radial at which 
the field strength values of the radiated emissions are maximized. The 
maximum field strength at the frequency being measured shall be reported 
in an application for certification.
    (g) Equipment under test shall be adjusted, using those controls 
that are readily accessible to or are intended to be accessible to the 
consumer, in such a manner as to maximize the level of the emissions. 
For those devices to which wire leads may be attached by the consumer, 
tests shall be performed

[[Page 698]]

with wire leads attached. The wire leads shall be of the length to be 
used with the equipment if that length is known. Otherwise, wire leads 
one meter in length shall be attached to the equipment. Longer wire 
leads may be employed if necessary to interconnect to associated 
peripherals.
    (h) For a composite system that incorporates devices contained 
either in a single enclosure or in separate enclosures connected by wire 
or cable, testing for compliance with the standards in this part shall 
be performed with all of the devices in the system functioning. If an 
intentional radiator incorporates more than one antenna or other 
radiating source and these radiating sources are designed to emit at the 
same time, measurements of conducted and radiated emissions shall be 
performed with all radiating sources that are to be employed emitting. A 
device which incorporates a carrier current system shall be tested as if 
the carrier current system were incorporated in a separate device; that 
is, the device shall be tested for compliance with whatever rules would 
apply to the device were the carrier current system not incorporated, 
and the carrier current system shall be tested for compliance with the 
rules applicable to carrier current systems.
    (i) If the device under test provides for the connection of external 
accessories, including external electrical input signals, the device 
shall be tested with the accessories attached. The device under test 
shall be fully exercised with these external accessories. The emission 
tests shall be performed with the device and accessories configured in a 
manner that tends to produce maximized emissions within the range of 
variations that can be expected under normal operating conditions. In 
the case of multiple accessory external ports, an external accessory 
shall be connected to one of each type of port. Only one test using 
peripherals or external accessories that are representative of the 
devices that will be employed with the equipment under test is required. 
All possible equipment combinations do not need to be tested. The 
accessories or peripherals connected to the device being tested shall be 
unmodified, commercially available equipment.
    (j) If the equipment under test consists of a central control unit 
and an external or internal accessory(ies) (peripheral) and the party 
verifying the equipment or applying for a grant of equipment 
authorization manufactures or assembles the central control unit and at 
least one of the accessory devices that can be used with that control 
unit, testing of the control unit and/or the accessory(ies) must be 
performed using the devices manufactured or assembled by that party, in 
additionto any other needed devices which the party does not manufacture 
or assemble. If the party verifying the equipment or applying for a 
grant of equipment authorization does not manufacture or assemble the 
central control unit and at least one of the accessory devices that can 
be used with that control unit or the party can demonstrate that the 
central control unit or accessory(ies) normally would be marketed or 
used with equipment from a different entity, testing of the central 
control unit and/or the accessory(ies) must be performed using the 
specific combination of equipment which is intended to be marketed or 
used together. Only one test using peripherals or accessories that are 
representatve of the devices that will be employed with the equipment 
under test is required. All possible equipment combinations are not 
required to be tested. The accessories or peripherals connected to the 
device being tested shall be unmodified, commercially available 
equipment.
    (k) A composite system is a system that incorporates different 
devices contained either in a single enclosure or in separate enclosures 
connected by wire or cable. If the individual devices in a composite 
system are subject to different technical standards, each such device 
must comply with its specific standards. In no event may the measured 
emissions of the composite system exceed the highest level permitted for 
an individual component. For digital devices which consist of a 
combination of Class A and Class B devices, the total combination of 
which results in a

[[Page 699]]

Class A digital device, it is only necessary to demonstrate that the 
equipment combination complies with the limits for a Class A device. 
This equipment combination may not be employed for obtaining a grant of 
equipment authorization or verifying a Class B digital device. However, 
if the digital device combination consists of a Class B central control 
unit, e.g., a personal computer, and a Class A internal peripheral(s), 
it must be demonstrated that the Class B central control unit continues 
to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device with the Class A 
internal peripheral(s) installed but not active.
    (l) Measurements of radio frequency emissions conducted to the 
public utility power lines shall be performed using a 50 ohm/50 uH line-
impedance stabilization network (LISN).

    Note: Receivers tested under the transition provisions contained in 
Sec. 15.37 may be tested with a 50 ohm/5 [mu]H LISN.

    (m) Measurements on intentional radiators or receivers, other than 
TV broadcast receivers, shall be performed and, if required, reported 
for each band in which the device can be operated with the device 
operating at the number of frequencies in each band specified in the 
following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Frequency range over which device    Number of    Location in the range
              operates               frequencies       of operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 MHz or less......................           1   Middle.
1 to 10 MHz........................           2   1 near top and 1 near
                                                   bottom.
More than 10 MHz...................           3   1 near top, 1 near
                                                   middle and 1 near
                                                   bottom.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (n) Measurements on TV broadcast receivers shall be performed with 
the receiver tuned to each VHF frequency and also shall include the 
following oscillator frequencies: 520, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 
850, 900 and 931 MHz. If measurements cannot be made on one or more of 
the latter UHF frequencies because of the presence of signals from 
licensed radio stations or for other reasons to be detailed in the 
measurement report, measurements shall be made with the receiver 
oscillator at a nearby frequency. If the receiver is not capable of 
receiving channels above 806 MHz, the measurements employing the 
oscillator frequencies 900 and 931 MHz may be omitted.
    (o) The amplitude of spurious emissions from intentional radiators 
and emissions from unintentional radiators which are attenuated more 
than 20 dB below the permissible value need not be reported unless 
specifically required elsewhere in this part.
    (p) In those cases where the provisions in this section conflict 
with the measurement procedures in paragraph (a) of this section and the 
procedures were implemented after June 23, 1989,the provisions contained 
in the measurement procedures shall take precedence.

    (a) CPU boards shall be tested as follows:
    (1) Testing for radiated emissions shall be performed with the CPU 
board installed in a typical enclosure but with the enclosure's cover 
removed so that the internal circuitry is exposed at the top and on at 
least two sides. Additional components, including a power supply, 
peripheral devices, and subassemblies, shall be added, as needed, to 
result in a complete personal computer system. If the oscillator and the 
microprocessor circuits are contained on separate circuit boards, both 
boards, typical of the combination that would normally be employed, must 
be used in the test. Testing shall be in accordance with the procedures 
specified in Sec. 15.31.
    (i) Under these test conditions, the system under test shall not 
exceed the radiated emission limits specified in Sec. 15.109 by more 
than 6 dB. Emissions greater than 6 dB that can be identified and 
documented to originate from a

[[Page 700]]

component(s) other than the CPU board being tested, may be dismissed.
    (ii) Unless the test in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
demonstrates compliance with the limits in Sec. 15.109, a second test 
shall be performed using the same configuration described above but with 
the cover installed on the enclosure. Testing shall be in accordance 
with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31. Under these test 
conditions, the system under test shall not exceed the radiated emission 
limits specified in Sec. 15.109.
    (2) In lieu of the procedure in (a)(1) of this section, CPU boards 
may be tested to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Sec. 15.109 
using a specified enclosure with the cover installed. Testing for 
radiated emissions shall be performed with the CPU board installed in a 
typical system configuration. Additional components, including a power 
supply, peripheral devices, and subassemblies, shall be added, as 
needed, to result in a complete personal computer system. If the 
oscillator and the microprocessor circuits are contained on separate 
circuit boards, both boards, typical of the combination that would 
normally be employed, must be used in the test. Testing shall be in 
accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31. Under this 
procedure, CPU boards that comply with the limits in Sec. 15.109 must be 
marketed together with the specific enclosure used for the test.
    (3) The test demonstrating compliance with the AC power line 
conducted limits specified in Sec. 15.107 shall be performed in 
accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 15.31 using a 
enclosure, peripherals, power supply and subassemblies that are typical 
of the type with which the CPU board under test would normally be 
employed.
    (b) The power supply shall be tested installed in an enclosure that 
is typical of the type within which it would normally be installed. 
Additional components, including peripheral devices, a CPU board, and 
subassemblies, shall be added, as needed, to result in a complete 
personal computer system. Testing shall be in accordance with the 
procedures specified in Sec. 15.31 and must demonstrate compliance with 
all of the standards contained in this part.

    (a) For an intentional radiator, the spectrum shall be investigated 
from the lowest radio frequency signal generated in the device, without 
going below 9 kHz, up to at least the frequency shown in this paragraph:
    (1) If the intentional radiator operates below 10 GHz: to the tenth 
harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 40 GHz, whichever is 
lower.
    (2) If the intentional radiator operates at or above 10 GHz and 
below 30 GHz: to the fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency 
or to 100 GHz, whichever is lower.
    (3) If the intentional radiator operates at or above 30 GHz: to the 
fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 200 GHz, 
whichever is lower, unless specified otherwise elsewhere in the rules.
    (4) If the intentional radiator contains a digital device, 
regardless of whether this digital device controls the functions of the 
intentional radiator or the digital device is used for additional 
control or function purposes other than to enable the operation of the 
intentional radiator, the frequency range shall be investigated up to 
the range specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section 
or the range applicable to the digital device, as shown in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, whichever is the higher frequency range of 
investigation.
    (b) For unintentional radiators:
    (1) Except as otherwise indicated in paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of 
this section, for an unintentional radiator, including a digital device, 
the spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest radio frequency 
signal generated or used in the device, without going below the lowest 
frequency for which a radiated emission limit is specified, up to the

                                             whichever is lower.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) A unintentional radiator, excluding a digital device, in which 
the highest frequency generated in the device, the highest frequency 
used in the device and the highest frequency on which the device 
operates or tunes are less than 30 MHz and which, in accordance with 
Sec. 15.109, is required to comply with standards on the level of 
radiated emissions within the frequency range 9 kHz to 30 MHz, such as a 
CB receiver or a device designed to conduct its radio frequency 
emissions via connecting wires or cables, e.g., a carrier current system 
not intended to radiate, shall be investigated from the lowest radio 
frequency generated or used in the device, without going below 9 kHz (25 
MHz for CB receivers), up to the frequency shown in the following table. 
If the unintentional radiator contains a digital device, the upper 
frequency to be investigated shall be that shown in the table below or 
in the table in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as based on both the 
highest frequency generated and the highest frequency used in the 
digital device, whichever range is higher.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Upper

1.705-10...................................................          400
10-30......................................................          500
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Except for a CB receiver, a receiver employing superheterodyne 
techniques shall be investigated from 30 MHz up to at least the second 
harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the 
device. If such receiver is controlled by a digital device, the 
frequency range shall be investigated up to the higher of the second 
harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the 
device or the upper frequency of the measurement range specified for the 
digital device in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) The above specified frequency ranges of measurements apply to 
the measurement of radiated emissions and, in the case of receivers, the 
measurement to demonstrate compliance with the antenna conduction limits 
specified in Sec. 15.111. The frequency range of measurements for AC 
power line conducted limits is specified in Secs. 15.107 and 15.207 and 
applies to all equipment subject to those regulations. In some cases, 
depending on the frequency(ies) generated and used by the equipment, 
only signals conducted onto the AC power lines are required to be 
measured.
    (d) Particular attention should be paid to harmonics and 
subharmonics of the fundamental frequency as well asto those frequencies 
removed from the fundamental by multiples of the oscillator frequency. 
Radiation at the frequencies of multiplier states should also be 
checked.

Sec. 15.35  Measurement detector functions and bandwidths.

    The conducted and radiated emission limits shown in this part are 
based on the following, unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this 
part:
    (a) On any frequency or frequencies below or equal to 1000 MHz, the 
limits shown are based on measuring equipment employing a CISPR quasi-
peak detector function and related measurement bandwidths, unless 
otherwise specified. The specifications for the measuring instrument 
using the CISPR quasi-peak detector can be found in Publication 16 of 
the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) of the 
International Electrotechnical Commission. As an alternative to CISPR 
quasi-peak measurements, the responsible party, at its option, may 
demonstrate compliance with the emission limits using measuring 
equipment employing a peak detector function, properly adjusted for such 
factors as pulse desensitization,

[[Page 702]]

as long as the same bandwidths as indicated for CISPR quasi-peak 
measurements are employed.

    Note: For pulse modulated devices with a pulse-repetition frequency 
of 20 Hz or less and for which CISPR quasi-peak measurements are 
specified, compliance with the regulations shall be demonstrated using 
measuring equipment employing a peak detector function, properly 
adjusted for such factors as pulse desensitization, using the same 
measurement bandwidths that are indicated for CISPR quasi-peak 
measurements.

    (b) Unless otherwise stated, on any frequency or frequencies above 
1000 MHz the radiated limits shown are based upon the use of measurement 
instrumentation employing an average detector function. When average 
radiated emission measurements are specified in this part, including 
emission measurements below 1000 MHz, there also is a limit on the radio 
frequency emissions, as measured using instrumentation with a peak 
detector function, corresponding to 20 dB above the maximum permitted 
average limit for the frequency being investigated unless a different 
peak emission limit is otherwise specified in the rules, e.g., see 
Secs. 15.255, 15.509 and 15.511. Unless otherwise specified, 
measurements above 1000 MHz shall be performed using a minimum 
resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz. Measurements of AC power line conducted 
emissions are performed using a CISPR quasi-peak detector, even for 
devices for which average radiated emission measurements are specified.
    (c) Unless otherwise specified, e.g. Sec. 15.255(b), when the 
radiated emission limits are expressed in terms of the average value of 
the emission, and pulsed operation is employed, the measurement field 
strength shall be determined by averaging over one complete pulse train, 
including blanking intervals, as long as the pulse train does not exceed 
0.1 seconds. As an alternative (provided the transmitter operates for 
longer than 0.1 seconds) or in cases where the pulse train exceeds 0.1 
seconds, the measured field strength shall be determined from the 
average absolute voltage during a 0.1 second interval during which the 
field strength is at its maximum value. The exact method of calculating 
the average field strength shall be submitted with any application for 
certification or shall be retained in the measurement data file for 
equipment subject to notification or verification.

Sec. 15.103  Exempted devices.

    The following devices are subject only to the general conditions of 
operation in Secs. 15.5 and 15.29 and are exempt from the specific 
technical standards and other requirements contained in this part. The 
operator of the exempted device shall be required to stop operating the 
device upon a finding by the Commission or its representative that the 
device is causing harmful interference. Operation shall not resume until 
the condition causing the harmful interference has been corrected. 
Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that the manufacturer 
of an exempted device endeavor to have the device meet the specific 
technical standards in this part.
    (a) A digital device utilized exclusively in any transportation 
vehicle including motor vehicles and aircraft.
    (b) A digital device used exclusively as an electronic control or 
power system utilized by a public utility or in an industrial plant. The 
term public utility includes equipment only to the extent that it is in 
a dedicated building or large room owned or leased by the utility and 
does not extend to equipment installed in a subscriber's facility.
    (c) A digital device used exclusively as industrial, commercial, or 
medical test equipment.
    (d) A digital device utilized exclusively in an appliance, e.g., 
microwaveoven, dishwasher, clothes dryer, air conditioner (central or 
window), etc.
    (e) Specialized medical digital devices (generally used at the 
direction of or under the supervision of a licensed health care 
practitioner) whether used in a patient's home or a health care 
facility. Non-specialized medical devices, i.e., devices marketed 
through retail channels for use by the general public, are not exempted. 
This exemption also does not apply to digital devices used for record 
keeping or any purpose not directly connected with medical treatment.
    (f) Digital devices that have a power consumption not exceeding 6 
nW.
    (g) Joystick controllers or similar devices, such as a mouse, used 
with digital devices but which contain only non-digital circuitry or a

integrated circuit for analog to digital conversion) are viewed as 
passive add-on devices, not themselves directly subject to the technical 
standards or the equipment authorization requirements.
    (h) Digital devices in which both the highest frequency generated 
and the highest frequency used are less than 1.705 MHz and which do not 
operate from the AC power lines or contain provisions for operation 
while connected to the AC power lines. Digital devices that include, or 
make provision for the use of, battery eliminators, AC adaptors or 
battery chargers which permit operation while charging or that connect 
to the AC power lines indirectly, obtaining their power through another 
device which is connected to the AC power lines, do not fall under this 
exemption.
    (i) Responsible parties should note that equipment containing more 
than one device is not exempt from the technical standards in this part 
unless all of the devices in the equipment meet the criteria for 
exemption. If only one of the included devices qualifies for exemption, 
the remainder of the equipment must comply with any applicable 
regulations. If a device performs more than one function and all of 
those functions do not meet the criteria for exemption, the device does 
not qualify for inclusion under the exemptions.

    (1) The test procedure and other requirements specified in this part 
shall continue to apply to digital devices.
    (2) If, in accordance with Sec. 15.33 of this part, measurements 
must be performed above 1000 MHz, compliance above 1000 MHz shall be 
demonstrated with the emission limit in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, as appropriate. Measurements above 1000 MHz may be performed at 
the distance specified in the CISPR 22 publications for measurements 
below 1000 MHz provided the limits in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section are extrapolated to the new measurement distance using an 
inverse linear distance extrapolation factor (20 dB/decade), e.g., the 
radiated limit above 1000 MHz for a Class B digital device is 150 uV/m, 
as measured at a distance of 10 meters.
    (3) The measurement distances shown in CISPR Pub. 22, including 
measurements made in accordance with this paragraph above 1000 MHz, are 
considered, for the purpose of Sec. 15.31(f)(4) of this part, to be the 
measurement distances specified in this part.

by a resistance equal to the rated output impedance. The emanations of a 
TV interface device incorporating an intentional radiator shall not 
exceed the limits in Sec. 15.109 or subpart C of this part, whichever is 
higher for each frequency. Where it is possible to determine which 
portion of the device is contributing a particular radio frequency 
emission, the emissions from the TV interface device portion shall 
comply with the emission limits in Sec. 15.109, and the emissions from 
the intentional radiator shall comply with subpart C of this part.
    (b) Output signal limits:
    (1) At any RF output terminal, the maximum measured RMS voltage, in 
microvolts, corresponding to the peak envelope power of the modulated 
signal during maximum amplitude peaks across a resistance (R in ohms) 
matching the rated output impedance of the TV interface device, shall 
not exceed the following:
    (i) For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device used

signal and 155 times the square root of (R) for the audio signal.
    (ii) For all other TV interface devices, 346.4 times the square root 
of (R) for the video signal and 77.5 times the square root of (R) for 
the audio signal.
    (2) At any RF output terminal, the maximum measured RMS voltage, in 
microvolts, corresponding to the peak envelope power of the modulated 
signal during maximum amplitude peaks across a resistance (R in ohms) 
matching the rated output impedance of the TV interface device, of any 
emission appearing on frequencies removed by more than 4.6 MHz below or 
7.4 MHz above the video carrier frequency on which the TV interface 
device is operated shall not exceed the following:
    (i) For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device used 
with a master antenna, 692.8 times the square root of (R).
    (ii) For all other TV interface devices, 10.95 times the square root 
of (R).
    (3) The term master antenna used in this section refers to TV 
interface devices employed for central distribution of television or 
other video signals within a building. Such TV interface devices must be 
designed to:
    (i) Distribute multiple television signals at the same time;
    (ii) Distribute such signals by cable to outlets or TV receivers in 
multiple rooms in the building in which the TV interface devices are 
installed; and,
    (iii) Distribute all over-the-air or cable signals.


[[Page 711]]


    Note: Cable-ready video cassette recorders continue to be subject to 
the provisions for general TV interface devices.

    (c) A TV interface device shall be equipped with a transfer switch 
for connecting the antenna terminals of a receiver selectively either to 
the receiving antenna or to the radio frequency output of the TV 
interface device, subject to the following:
    (1) When measured in any of its set positions, transfer switches 
shall comply with the following requirements:
    (i) For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device 
equipped for use with a cable system or a master antenna, as defined in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the isolation between the antenna and 
cable input terminals shall be at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at 
least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 
806 MHz. The 80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard 
applies at 550 MHz. In the case of a transfer switch requiring a power 
source, the required isolation shall be maintained in the event the 
device is not connected to a power source or power is interrupted. The 
provisions of this paragraph regarding frequencies in the range 550 MHz 
to 806 MHz are applicable as of June 30, 1997.
    (ii) For all other TV interface devices, the maximum voltage, 
corresponding to the peak envelope power of the modulated video signal

receiving antenna input terminals when terminated with a resistance (R 
in ohms) matching the rated impedance of the antenna input of the 
switch, shall not exceed 0.346 times the square root of (R).
    (iii) Measurement to determine compliance with the transfer switch 
limits shall be made using a connecting cable, where required, between 
the TV interface device and the transfer switch of the type and length:
    (A) Provided with the TV interface device,
    (B) Recommended in the instruction manual, or
    (C) Normally employed by the consumer.
    (2) A TV interface device shall be designed and constructed, to the 
extent practicable, so as to preclude the possibility that the consumer 
may inadvertently attach the output of the device to the receiving 
antenna, if any, without first going through the transfer switch.
    (3) A transfer switch is not required for a TV interface device 
that, when connected, results in the user no longer having any need to 
receive standard over-the-air broadcast signals via a separate antenna. 
A transfer switch is not required to be marketed with a cable system 
terminal device unless that device provides for the connection of an 
external antenna. A transfer switch is not required for a device that is 
intended to be used as an accessory to an authorized TV interface 
device.
    (4) An actual transfer switch is not required for a TV interface 
device, including a cable system terminal device, that has an antenna 
input terminal(s); provided, the circuitry following the antenna input 
terminal(s) has sufficient bandwidth to allow the reception of all TV 
broadcast channels authorized under part 73 of this chapter and: For a 
cable system terminal device that can alternate between the reception of 
cable television service and an antenna, compliance with the isolation 
requirement specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section can be 
demonstrated; and, for all other TV interface devices, the maximum 
voltage appearing at the antenna terminal(s) does not exceed the limit 
in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (5) If a transfer switch is not required, the following label shall 
be used in addition to the label shown in Sec. 15.19(a):

    This device is intended to be attached to a receiver that is not 
used to receive over-the-air broadcast signals. Connection of this 
device in any other fashion may cause harmful interference to radio 
communications and is in violation of the FCC Rules, part 15.

    (d) A TV interface device, including a cable system terminal device, 
shall incorporate circuitry to automatically prevent emanations from the 
devicefrom exceeding the technical specifications in this part. These 
circuits shall be adequate to accomplish their functions when the TV 
interface device is presented, if applicable, with video input signal 
levels in the range of

[[Page 712]]

one to five volts; this requirement is not applicable to a TV interface 
device that uses a built-in signal source and has no provisions for the 
connection of an external signal source. For devices that contain 
provisions for an external signal source but do not contain provisions 
for the input of an external baseband signal, e.g., some cable system 
terminal devices, compliance with the provisions of this paragraph shall 
be demonstrated with a radio frequency input signal of 0 to 25 dBmV.
    (e) For cable system terminal devices and TV interface devices used 
with a master antenna, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
the holder of the grant of authorization shall specify in the 
instruction manual or pamphlet, if a manual is not provided, the types 
of wires or coaxial cables necessary to ensure that the unit complies 
with the requirements of this part. The holder of the grant of 
authorization must comply with the provisions of Sec. 15.27. For all 
other TV interface devices, the wires or coaxial cables used to couple 
the output signals to the TV receiver shall be provided by the 
responsible party.
    (f) A TV interface device which is submitted to the Commission as a 
composite device in a single enclosure containing a RF modulator, video 
source and other component devices shall be submitted on a single 
application (FCC Form 731) and shall be authorized as a single device.
    (g) An external device or accessory that is intended to be attached 
to a TV interface device shall comply with the technical and 
administrative requirements set out in the rules under which it 
operates. For example, a personal computer must be certificated to show 
compliance with the regulations for digital devices.
    (h) Stand-alone switches used to alternate between cable service and 
an antenna shall provide isolation between the antenna and cable input 
terminals that is at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB 
from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz.The 
80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard applies at 550 
MHz. In the case of stand-alone switches requiring a power source, the 
required isolation shall be maintained in the event the device is not 
connected to a power source or power is interrupted. The provisions of 
this paragraph are applicable as of June 30, 1997.
    (i) Switches and other devices intended to be used to by-pass the 
processing circuitry of a cable system terminal device, whether internal 
to such a terminal device or a stand-alone unit, shall not attenuate the 
input signal more than 6 dB from 54 MHz to 550 MHz, or more than 8 dB 
from 550 MHz to 804 MHz. The 6 dB standard applies at 550 MHz. The 
provisions of this paragraph are applicable June 30, 1997.

Sec. 15.117  TV broadcast receivers.

    (a) All TV broadcast receivers shipped in interstate commerce or 
imported into the United States, for sale or resale to the public, shall 
comply with the provisions of this section, except that paragraphs (f) 
and (g) of this section shall not apply to the features of such sets 
that provide for reception of digital television signals. The reference 
in this section to TV broadcast receivers also includes devices, such as 
TV interface devices and set-top devices that are intended to provide 
audio-video signals to a video monitor, that incorporate the tuner 
portion of a TV broadcast receiver and that are equipped with an antenna 
or antenna terminals that can be used for off-the-air reception of TV 
broadcast signals, as authorized under part 73 of this chapter.
    (b) TV broadcast receivers shall be capable of adequately receiving 
all channels allocated by the Commission to the television broadcast 
service.
    (c) On a given receiver, use of the UHF and VHF tuning systems shall 
provide approximately the same degree of tuning accuracy with 
approximately the same expenditure of time and effort: Provided, 
however, That this requirement will be considered to be met if the need 
for routine fine tuning is eliminated on UHF channels.

[[Page 713]]

    (1) Basic tuning mechanism. If a TV broadcast receiver is equipped 
to provide for repeated access to VHF television channels at discrete 
tuning positions, that receiver shall be equipped to provide for 
repeated access to a minimum of six UHF television channels at discrete 
tuning positions. Unless a discrete tuning position is provided for each 
channel allocated to UHF television, each position shall be readily 
adjustable to a particular UHF channel by the user without the use of 
tools. If 12 or fewer discrete tuning positions are provided, each 
position shall be adjustable to receive any channel allocated to UHF 
television.

    Note: The combination of detented rotary switch and pushbutton 
controls is acceptable, provided UHF channels, after their initial 
selection, can be accurately tuned with an expenditure of time and 
effort approximately the same as that used in accurately tuning VHF 
channels. A UHF tuning system comprising five pushbuttons and a separate 
manual tuning knob is considered to provide repeated access to six 
channels at discrete tuning positions. A one-knob (VHF/UHF) tuning 
system providing repeated access to 11 or more discrete tuning positions 
is also acceptable, provided each of the tuning positions is readily 
adjustable, without the use of tools, to receive any UHF channel.

    (2) Tuning controls and channel readout. UHF tuning controls and 
channel readout on a given receiver shall be comparable in size, 
location, accessibility and legibility to VHF controls and readout on 
that receiver.

    Note: Differences between UHF and VHF channel readout that follow 
directly from the larger number of UHF television channels available are 
acceptable if it is clear that a good faith effort to comply with the 
provisions of this section has been made.

    (d) If equipment and controls that tend to simplify, expedite or 
perfect the reception of television signals (e.g., AFC, visual aids, 
remote control, or signal seeking capability referred to generally as 
tuning aids) are incorporated into the VHF portion of a TV broadcast 
receiver, tuning aids of the same type and comparable capability and 
quality shall be provided for the UHF portion of that receiver.
    (e) If a television receiver has an antenna affixed to the VHF 
antenna terminals, it must have an antenna designed for and capable of 
receiving all UHF television channels affixed to the UHF antenna 
terminals. If a VHF antenna is provided with but not affixed to a 
receiver, a UHF antenna shall be provided with the receiver.
    (f) The picture sensitivity of a TV broadcast receiver averaged for 
all channels between 14 and 69 inclusive shall not be more than 8dB 
larger than the peak picture sensitivity of that receiver averaged for 
all channels between 2 and 13 inclusive.
    (g) The noise figure for any television channel 14 to 69 inclusive 
shall not exceed 14 dB. A TV receiver model is considered to comply with 
this noise figure if the maximum noise figure for channels 14-69 
inclusive of 97.5% of all receivers within that model does not exceed 14 
dB.
    (1) The responsible party shall measure the noise figure of a number 
of UHF channels of the test sample to give reasonable assurance that the 
UHF noise figure for each channel complies with the above limit.
    (2) The responsible party shall insert in his files a statement 
explaining the basis on which it will rely to ensure that at least 97.5% 
of all production units of the test sample that are manufactured have a 
noise figure of no greater than 14 dB.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) In the case of a TV tuner built-in as part of a video tape 
recorder that uses a power splitter between the antenna terminals of the 
video tape recorder and the input terminals of the TV tuner or a TV 
broadcast receiver that uses a power splitter between the antenna 
terminals of two or more UHF tuners contained within that receiver, 4 dB 
may be subtracted from the noise figure measured at the antenna 
terminals of the video tape recorder or TV broadcast receiver for 
determining compliance of the UHF tuner(s) with the 14 dB noise figure 
limit.
    (h) Digital television reception capability. TV broadcast receivers 
are required only to provide useable picture and sound commensurate with 
their video and audio capabilities when receiving digital television 
signals.
    (i) Digital television reception capability implementation schedule. 
(1) Responsible parties, as defined in Sec. 2.909 of this chapter, are 
required to equip new TV

[[Page 714]]

broadcast receivers that are shipped in interstate commerce or imported 
from any foreign country into the United States and for which they are 
responsible to comply with the provisions of this section in accordance 
with the following schedule:

--Receivers with screen sizes 36[min] and above--50% of all of a 
    responsible party's units must include DTV tuners effective July 1, 
    2004; 100% of such units must include DTV tuners effective July 1, 
    2005
--Receivers with screen sizes 25[min] to 36[min]--50% of all of a 
    responsible party's units must include DTV tuners effective July 1, 
    2005; 100% of such units must include DTV tuners effective July 1, 
    2006
--Receivers with screen sizes 13[min] to 24[min]--100% of all such units 
    must include DTV tuners effective July 1, 2007
--Other devices (videocassette recorders (VCRs), digital video disk and 
    digital versatile disk (DVD) players/recorders, etc.) that receive 
    television signals--100% of all such units must include DTV tuners 
    effective July 1, 2007.

    (2) For purposes of this implementation schedule, screen sizes are 
to be measured diagonally across the picture viewing area. The 
requirement for equipping new TV broadcast receivers with DTV reception 
capability does not apply to units with integrated tuners/displays that 
have screen sizes measuring less than 7.8 inches vertically, i.e., the 
vertical measurement of a screen in the 4:3 aspect ratio that measures 
13[min] diagonally across the picture viewing area.
    (3) Responsible parties may include combinations of DTV monitors and 
set-top DTV tuners in meeting the required percentages of units with a 
DTV tuner if such combinations are marketed together with a single 
price.
    (j) For a TV broadcast receiver equipped with a cable input selector 
switch, the selector switch shall provide, in any of its set positions, 
isolation between the antenna and cable input terminals of at least 80 
dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at 
least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz. The 80 dB standard applies at 216 
MHz and the 60dB standard applies at 550 MHz. In the case of a selector 
switch requiring a power source, the required isolation shall be 
maintained in the event the device is not connected to a power source or 
power is interrupted. An actual switch that can alternate between 
reception of cable television service and an antenna is not required for 
a TV broadcast receiver, provided compliance with the isolation 
requirement specified in this paragraph can be demonstrated and the 
circuitry following the antenna input terminal(s) has sufficient band-
width to allow the reception of all TV broadcast channels authorized 
under this chapter. The provisions of this paragraph regarding 
frequencies in the range 550 MHz to 806 MHz are applicable as of June 
30, 1997.

requirements shall be determined by performing measurements at the 
unfiltered IF output port. Where appropriate, the Commission will 
consider allowing alternative measurement methods.
    (1) Adjacent channel interference. In the presence of a lower 
adjacent channel CW signal that is 1.5 MHz below the desired visual 
carrier in frequency and 10 dB below the desired visual carrier in 
amplitude, spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated 
at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired signal. The 
desired input signal shall be an NTSC visual carrier modulated with a 10 
IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier which is 10 dB 
below the visual carrier should be unmodulated. Measurements are to be 
performed for input signal levels of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV, with the 
receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the 
band 54 MHz to 804 MHz.
    (2) Image channel interference. Image channel interference within 
the IF passband shall be attenuated below the visual carrier of the 
desired channel by at least 60 dB from 54 MHz to 714 MHz and 50 dB from 
714 MHz to 804 MHz. The 60 dB standard applies at 714 MHz. In testing 
for compliance with this standard, the desired input signal is to be an 
NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat 
field with color burst and the aural carrier is unmodulated and 10 dB 
below the visual carrier. The undesired test signal shall be a CW signal 
equal in amplitude to the desired visual carrier and located 90 MHz 
above the visual carrier frequency of the desired channel. Measurements 
shall be performed for input signals of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV, with the 
receiver tuned to at least ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels 
covering the band 54 MHz to 804 MHz.
    (3) Direct pickup interference. The direct pickup (DPU) of a co-
channel interfering ambient field by a cable ready device shall not 
exceed the following criteria. The ratio of the desiredto undesired 
signal levels at the IF passband on each channel shall be at least 45 
dB. The average ratio over the six channels shall be at least 50 dB. The 
desired input signal shall be an NTSC signal having a visual carrier 
level of 0 dBmV. The visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat 
field with color burst, visual to aural carrier ratio of 10 dB, aural 
carrier unmodulated. The equipment under test (EUT) shall be placed on a 
rotatable table that is one meter in height. Any excess length of the 
power cord and other connecting leads shall be coiled on the floor under 
the table. The EUT shall be immersed in a horizontally polarized uniform 
CW field of 100 mV/m at a frequency 2.55 MHz above the visual carrier of 
the EUT tuned channel. Measurements shall be made with the EUT tuned to 
six EIA IS-132 channels, two each in the low VHF, high VHF and UHF 
broadcast bands. On each channel, the levels at the IF passband due to 
the desired and interfering signals are to be measured.
    (4) Tuner overload. Spurious signals within the IF passband shall be 
attenuated at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired 
channel using a comb-like spectrum input with each visual carrier signal 
individually set at +15 dBmV from 54 to 550 MHz. The desired input 
signal is to be an NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated 
with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier is 
unmodulated and 10 dB below the visual carrier. Measurements shall be 
made with the receiver tuned to at least seven evenly spaced EIA IS-132 
channels covering the band 54 MHz to 550 MHz. In addition, spurious 
signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 51 dB below 
the visual carrier of the desired channel using a comb spectrum input 
with each signal individually set at +15 dBmV from 550 to 804 MHz. 
Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least three 
evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 550 MHz to 804 MHz.

[[Page 716]]

    (5) Cable input conducted emissions. (i) Conducted spurious 
emissions that appear at the cable input to the device must meet the 
following criteria. The input shall be an NTSC video carrier modulated 
with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst at a level of 0 dBmV and with 
a visual to aural ratio of 10 dB. The aural carrier shall be 
unmodulated. The peak level of the spurious signals will be measured 
using a spectrum analyzer connected by a directional coupler to the 
cable input of the equipment under test. Spurious signal levels must not 
exceed the limits in the following table:

From 54 MHz up to and including 300 MHz-26 dBmV
From 300 MHz up to and including 450 MHz-20 dBmV
From 450 MHz up to and including 804 MHz-15 dBmV

    (ii) The average of the measurements on multiple channels from 450 
MHz up to and including 804 MHz shall be no greater than -20 dBmV. 
Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least four EIA 
IS-132 channels in each of the above bands. The test channels are to be 
evenly distributed across each of the bands. Measurements for conducted 
emissions caused by sources internal to the device are to be made in a 
shielded room. Measurements for conducted emissions caused by external 
signal sources shall be made in an ambient RF field whose field strength 
is 100 mV/m, following the same test conditions as described in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (d) The field strength of radiated emissions from cable ready 
consumer electronics equipment shall not exceed the limits in 
Sec. 15.109(a) when measured in accordance with the applicable 
procedures specified in Secs. 15.31 and 15.35 for unintentional 
radiators, with the following modifications. During testing the NTSC 
input signal level is to be +15 dBmV, with a visual to aural ratio of 10 
dB. The visual carrier is to be modulated by a 10 IRE flat field with 
color burst; the aural carrier is to be unmodulated. Measurements are to 
be taken on six EIA IS-132 channels evenly spaced across the required RF 
input range of the equipment under test.

    Note: The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section 
are applicable as of June 30, 1997.

Sec. 15.119  Closed caption decoder requirements for analog television receivers.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1993, all TV broadcast receivers with picture 
screens 33 cm (13 in) or larger in diameter shipped in interstate 
commerce, manufactured, assembled, or imported from any foreign country 
into the United States shall comply with the provisions of this section.

    Note: This paragraph places no restriction on the shipping or sale 
of television receivers that were manufactured before July 1, 1993.

    (b) Transmission format. Closed-caption information is transmitted 
on line 21 of field 1 of the vertical blanking interval of television 
signals, in accordance with Sec. 73.682(a)(22) of this chapter.
    (c) Operating modes. The television receiver will employ customer-
selectable modes of operation for TV and Caption. A third mode of 
operation, Text, may be included on an optional basis. The Caption and 
Text Modes may contain data in either of two operating channels, 
referred to in this document as C1 and C2. The television receiver must 
decode both C1 and C2 captioning, and must display the captioning for 
whichever channel the user selects. The TV Mode of operation allows the 
video to be viewed in its original form. The Caption and Text Modes 
define one or more areas (called ``boxes'') on the screen within which 
caption or text characters are displayed.

    Note: For more information regarding Text mode, see ``Television 
Captioning for the Deaf: Signal and Display Specifications'', 
Engineering Report No. E-7709-C, Public Broadcasting Service, dated May 
1980, and ``TeleCaption II Decoder Module Performance Specification'', 
National Captioning Institute, Inc., dated November 1985. These 
documents are available, respectively, from the Public Broadcasting 
Service, 1320 Braddock Place, Alexandria, VA 22314 and from the National 
Captioning Institute, Inc., 5203 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041.


[[Page 717]]


    (d) Screen format. The display area for captioning and text shall 
fall approximately within the safe caption area as defined in paragraph 
(n)(12) of this section. This display area will be further divided into 
15 character rows of equal height and 32 columns of equal width, to 
provide accurate placement of text on the screen. Vertically, the 
display area begins on line 43 and is 195 lines high, ending on line 237 
on an interlaced display. All captioning and text shall fall within 
these established columns and rows. The characters must be displayed 
clearly separated from the video over which they are placed. In 
addition, the user must have the capability to select a black background 
over which the captioned letters are displaced.
    (1) Caption mode. In the Caption Mode, text can appear on up to 4 
rows simultaneously anywhere on the screen within the defined display 
area. In addition, a solid space equal to one column width may be placed 
before the first character and after the last character of each row to 
enhance legibility. The caption area will be transparent anywhere that 
either:
    (i) No standard space character or other character has been 
addressed and no accompanying solid space is needed; or,
    (ii) An accompanying solid space is used and a ``transparent space'' 
special character has been addressed which does not immediately precede 
or follow a displayed character.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Presentation format. In analyzing the presentation of 
characters, it is convenient to think in terms of a non-visible cursor 
which marks the screen position at which the next event in a given mode 
and data channel will occur. The receiver remembers the cursor position 
for each mode even when data are received for a different address in an 
alternate mode or data channel.
    (1) Screen addressing. Two kinds of control codes are used to move 
the cursor to specific screen locations. In Caption Mode, these 
addressing codes will affect both row and column positioning. In Text 
Mode, the codes affect only column positioning. In both modes, the 
addressing codes are optional. Default positions are defined for each 
mode and style when no addressing code is provided.
    (i) The first type of addressing code is the Preamble Address Code 
(PAC). It assigns a row number and one of eight ``indent'' figures. Each 
successive indent moves the cursor four columns to the right (starting 
from the left margin). Thus, an indent of 0 places thecursor at Column 
1, an indent of 4 sets it at Column 5, etc. The PAC indent is non-
destructive to displayable characters. It will not affect the display to 
the left of the new cursor position on the indicated row. Note that 
Preamble Address Codes also set initial attributes for the displayable 
characters which follow. See paragraph (h) of this section and the 
Preamble Address Code table.
    (ii) The second type of addressing code is the Tab Offset, which is 
one of three Miscellaneous Control Codes. Tab Offset will move the 
cursor one, two, or three columns to the right. The character cells 
skipped over will be unaffected; displayable characters in these cells, 
if any, will remain intact while empty cells will remain empty, in the 
same manner that a PAC indent is non-destructive.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) Caption Mode. There are three styles of presenting text in 
Caption Mode: roll-up, pop-on, and paint-on. Character display varies 
significantly with the style used, but certain rules of character 
erasure are common to all styles. A character can be erased by 
addressing another character to the same screen location or by 
backspacing over the character from a subsequent location on the same 
row. The entire displayed memory will be erased instantly by receipt of 
an Erase Displayed Memory command. Both displayed memory and non-
displayed memory will be entirely erased simultaneously by either: The 
user switching receiver channels or data channels (C1/C2) or fields (F1/
F2) in decoders so equipped; the loss of valid data (see paragraph (j) 
of this section); or selecting non-captioning receiver functions which 
use the display memory of the decoder. Receipt of an End of Caption 
command will cause a displayed caption to become non-displayed (and vice 
versa) without being

[[Page 718]]

erased from memory. Changing the receiver to a non-captioning mode which 
does not require use of the decoder's display memory will leave that 
memory intact, and the decoder will continue to process data as if the 
caption display were selected.
    (1) Roll-up. Roll-up style captioning is initiated by receipt of one 
of three Miscellaneous Control Codes that determine the maximum number 
of rows displayed simultaneously, either 2, 3 or 4 contiguous rows. 
These are the three Roll-Up Caption commands.
    (i) The bottom row of the display is known as the ``base row''. The 
cursor always remains on the base row. Rows of text roll upwards into 
the contiguous rows immediately above the base row to create a 
``window'' 2 to 4 rows high.
    (ii) The Roll-Up command, in normal practice, will be followed (not 
necessarily immediately) by a Preamble Address Code indicating the base 
row and the horizontal indent position. If no Preamble Address Code is 
received, the base row will default to Row 15 or, if a roll-up caption 
is currently displayed, to the same base row last received, and the 
cursor will be placed at Column 1. If the Preamble Address Code received 
contains a different base row than that of a currently displayed 
caption, the entire window will move intact (and without erasing) to the 
new base row immediately.
    (iii) Each time a Carriage Return is received, the text in the top 
row of the window is erased from memory and from the display or scrolled 
off the top of the window. The remaining rows of text are each rolled up 
into the next highest row in the window, leaving the base row blank and 
ready to accept new text. This roll-up must appear smooth to the user, 
and must take no more than 0.433 second to complete. The cursor is 
automatically placed at Column 1 (pending receipt of a Preamble Address 
Code).
    (iv) Increasing or decreasing the number of roll-up rows instantly 
changes the size of the active display window, appropriately turning on 
or off the display of the top one or two rows. A row which is turned off 
should also be erased from memory.
    (v) Characters are always displayed immediately when received by the 
receiver. Once the cursor reaches the 32nd column position on any row, 
all subsequent characters received prior to a Carriage Return, Preamble 
Address Code, or Backspace will be displayed in that column replacing 
any previous character occupying that address.
    (vi) The cursor moves automatically one column to the right after 
eachcharacter or Mid-Row Code received. A Backspace will move the cursor 
one column to the left, erasing the character or Mid-Row Code occupying 
that location. (A Backspace received when the cursor is in Column 1 will 
be ignored.)
    (vii) The Delete to End of Row command will erase from memory any 
characters or control codes starting at the current cursor location and 
in all columns to its right on the same row. If no displayable 
characters remain on the row after the Delete to End of Row is acted 
upon, the solid space (if any) for that row should also be erased to 
conform with the following provisions.
    (viii) If a solid space is used for legibility, it should appear 
when the first displayable character (not a transparent space) or Mid-
Row Code is received on a row, not when the Preamble Address Code, if 
any, is given. A row on which there are no displayable characters or 
Mid-Row Codes will not display a solid space, even when rolled up 
between two rows which do display a solid space.
    (ix) If the reception of data for a row is interrupted by data for 
the alternate data channel or for Text Mode, the display of caption text 
will resume from the same cursor position if a Roll-Up Caption command 
is received and no Preamble Address Code is given which would move the 
cursor.
    (x) A roll-up caption remains displayed until one of the standard 
caption erasure techniques is applied. Receipt of a Resume Caption 
Loading command (for pop-on style) or a Resume Direct Captioning command 
(for paint-on style) will not affect a roll-up display. Receipt of a 
Roll-Up Caption command will cause any pop-on or paint-on caption to be 
erased from displayed memory and non-displayed memory.

[[Page 719]]

    (2) Pop-on. Pop-on style captioning is initiated by receipt of a 
Resume Caption Loading command. Subsequent data are loaded into a non-
displayed memory and held there until an End of Caption command is 
received, at which point the non-displayed memory becomes the displayed 
memory and vice versa. (This process is often referred to as ``flipping 
memories'' and does not automatically erase memory.) An End of Caption 
command forces the receiver into pop-on style if no Resume Caption 
Loading command has been received which would do so. The display will be 
capable of 4 full rows, not necessarily contiguous, simultaneous 
anywhere on the screen.
    (i) Preamble Address Codes can be used to move the cursor around the 
screen in random order to place captions on Rows 1 to 15. Carriage 
Returns have no effect on cursor location during caption loading.
    (ii) The cursor moves automatically one column to the right after 
each character or Mid-Row Code received. Receipt of a Backspace will 
move the cursor one column to the left, erasing the character or Mid-Row 
Code occupying that location. (A Backspace received when the cursor is 
in Column 1 will be ignored.) Once the cursor reaches the 32nd column 
position on any row, all subsequent characters received prior to a 
Backspace, an End of Caption, or a Preamble Address Code, will replace 
any previous character at that location.
    (iii) The Delete to End of Row command will erase from memory any 
characters or control codes starting at the current cursor location and 
in all columns to its right on the same row. If no displayable 
characters remain on a row after the Delete to End of Row is acted upon, 
the solid space (if any) for that element should also be erased.
    (iv) If data reception is interrupted during caption loading by data 
for the alternate caption channel or for Text Mode, caption loading will 
resume at the same cursor position if a Resume Caption Loading command 
is received and no Preamble Address Code is given that would move the 
cursor.
    (v) Characters remain in non-displayed memory until an End of 
Caption command flips memories. The caption will be erased without being 
displayed upon receipt of an Erase Non-Displayed Memory command, a Roll-
Up Caption command, or if the user switches receiver channels, data 
channels or fields, or upon the loss of valid data (see paragraph (j) of 
this section).
    (vi) A pop-on caption, once displayed, remains displayed until one 
of the standard caption erasure techniques isapplied or until a Roll-Up 
Caption command is received. Characters within a displayed pop-on 
caption will be replaced by receipt of the Resume Direct Captioning 
command and paint-on style techniques (see below).
    (3) Paint-on. Paint-on style captioning is initiated by receipt of a 
Resume Direct Captioning command. Subsequent data are addressed 
immediately to displayed memory without need for an End of Caption 
command.
    (i) Preamble Address Codes can be used to move the cursor around the 
screen in random order to display captions on Rows 1 to 15. Carriage 
Returns have no affect on cursor location during direct captioning. The 
cursor moves automatically one column to the right after each character 
or Mid-Row Code is received. Receipt of a Backspace will move the cursor 
one column to the left, erasing the character or Mid-Row Code occupying 
that location. (A Backspace received when the cursor is in Column 1 will 
be ignored.) Once the cursor reaches the 32nd column position on any 
row, all subsequent characters received prior to a Preamble Address Code 
or Backspace will be displayed in that column replacing any previous 
character occupying that location.
    (ii) The Delete to End of Row command will erase from memory any 
characters or control codes starting at the current cursor location and 
in all columns to its right on the same row. If no displayable 
characters remain on the row after the Delete to End of Row is acted 
upon, the solid space (if any) for that element should also be erased.
    (iii) If the reception of data is interrupted during the direct 
captioning by data for the alternate caption channel or for Text Mode, 
the display of caption text will resume at the same cursor position if a 
Resume Direct Captioning command is received and no

[[Page 720]]

Preamble Address Code is given which would move the cursor.
    (iv) Characters remain displayed until one of the standard caption 
erasure techniques is applied or until a Roll-Up Caption command is 
received. An End of Caption command leaves a paint-on caption fully 
intact in non-displayed memory. In other words, a paint-on style caption 
behaves precisely like a pop-on style caption which has been displayed.
    (g) Character format. Characters are to be displayed on the screen 
within a character ``cell'' which is the height and width of a single 
row and column. The following codes define the displayable character 
set. Television receivers manufactured prior to January 1, 1996 and 
having a character resolution of 5 x 7 dots, or less, may display the 
allowable alternate characters in the character table. A statement must 
be in a prominent location on the box or other package in which the 
receiver is to be marketed, and information must be in the owner's 
manual, indicating the receiver displays closed captioning in upper case 
only.

    (h) Character Attributes--(1) Transmission of Attributes. A 
character may be transmitted with any or all of four attributes: Color, 
italics, underline, and flash. All of these attributes are set by 
control codes included in the received data. An attribute will remain in 
effect until changed by another control code or until the end of the row 
is reached. Each row begins with a control code which sets the color and 
underline attributes. (White non-underlined is the default display 
attribute if no Preamble Address Code is received before the first 
character on an empty row.) Attributes are not affected by transparent 
spaces within a row.
    (i) All Mid-Row Codes and the Flash On command are spacing 
attributes which appear in the display just as if a standard space (20h) 
had been received. Preamble Address Codes are non-spacing and will not 
alter any attributes when used to position the cursor in the midst of a 
row of characters.
    (ii) The color attribute has the highest priority and can only be 
changed by the Mid-Row Code of another color. Italics has the next 
highest priority. If characters with both color and italics are desired, 
the italics Mid-Row Code must follow the color assignment. Any color 
Mid-Row Code will turn off italics. If the least significant bit of a 
Preamble Address Code or of a color or italics Mid-Row Code is a 1 
(high), underlining is turned on. If that bit is a 0 (low), underlining 
is off.
    (iii) The flash attribute is transmitted as a Miscellaneous Control 
Code. The Flash On command will not alter the status of the color, 
italics, or underline attributes. However, any coloror italics Mid-Row 
Code will turn off flash.
    (iv) Thus, for example, if a red, italicized, underlined, flashing 
character is desired, the attributes must be received in the following 
order: a red Mid-Row or Preamble Address Code, an italics Mid-Row Code 
with underline bit, and the Flash On command. The character will then be 
preceded by three spaces (two if red was assigned via a Preamble Address 
Code).
    (2) Display of attributes. The underline attribute will be displayed 
by drawing a line beneath the character in the same color as the 
character. The flash attribute will be displayed by causing the 
character to blink from the display at least once per second. The italic 
attribute must be capable of being displayed by either a special italic 
font, or by the modification of the standard font by slanting. The user 
may be given the option to select other methods of italic display as 
well. The support of the color attributes is optional. If the color 
attributes are supported, they will be displayed in the color they have 
been assigned. If color attributes are not supported, the display may be 
in color, but all color changes will be ignored.
    (i) Control codes. There are three different types of control codes 
used to identify the format, location, attributes, and display of 
characters: Preamble Address Codes, Mid-Row Codes, and Miscellaneous 
Control Codes.
    (1) Each control code consists of a pair of bytes which are always 
transmitted together in a single field of line 21 and which are normally 
transmitted twice in succession to help insure correct reception of the 
control instructions. The first of the control code bytes is a non-
printing character in the range 10h to 1Fh. The second byte is always a 
printing character in the range 20h to 7Fh. Any such control code pair 
received which has not been assigned a

[[Page 722]]

function is ignored. If the non-printing character in the pair is in the 
range 00h to 0Fh, that character alone will be ignored and the second 
character will be treated normally.
    (2) If the second byte of a control code pair does not contain odd 
parity (see paragraph (j) of this section), then the pair is ignored. 
The redundant transmission of the pair will be the instruction upon 
which the receiver acts.
    (3) If the first byte of the first transmission of a control code 
pair fails the parity check, then that byte is inserted into the 
currently active memory as a solid block character (7Fh) followed by 
whatever the second byte is. Again, the redundant transmission of the 
pair will be the controlling instruction.
    (4) If the first transmission of a control code pair passes parity, 
it is acted upon within one video frame. If the next frame contains a 
perfect repeat of the same pair, the redundant code is ignored. If, 
however, the next frame contains a different but also valid control code 
pair, this pair, too, will be acted upon (and the receiver will expect a 
repeat of this second pair in the next frame). If the first byte of the 
expected redundant control code pair fails the parity check and the 
second byte is identical to the second byte in the immediately preceding 
pair, then the expected redundant code is ignored. If there are printing 
characters in place of the redundant code, they will be processed 
normally.
    (5) There is provision for decoding a second data channel. The 
second data channel is encoded with the same control codes and 
procedures already described. The first byte of every control code pair 
indicates the data channel (C1/C2) to which the command applies. Control 
codes which do not match the data channel selected by the user, and all 
subsequent data related to that control code, are ignored by the 
receiver.

    (j) Data rejection. The receiver should provide an effective 
procedure to verify data. A receiver will reject data if the data is 
invalid, or if the data is directed to the data channel or field not 
selected by the user. Invalid data is any data that fails to pass a 
check for odd parity, or which, having passed the parity check, is 
assigned no function.
    (1) If a print character fails to pass a check for parity, a solid 
block (7Fh) should be displayed in place of the failed character. In 
addition, valid data can be corrupted in many ways and may not be 
suitable for display. For example, repeated fields, skipped fields and 
altered field sequences are all possible from consumer video equipment 
and might present meaningless captions.
    (2) The receiver will ignore data rejected due to being directed to 
a deselected field or channel. However, this will not cause the display 
to be disabled.
    (k) Automatic display enable/disable. The receiver shall provide an 
automatic enable/disable capability to prevent the display of invalid or 
incomplete data, when the user selects the Caption Mode. The display 
should automatically become enable after the receiver verifies the data 
as described in paragraph (j) of this section. The display will be 
automatically disabled when there is a sustained detection of invalid 
data. The display will be re-enabled when the data verification process 
has been satisfied once again.
    (l) Compatibility with Cable Security Systems. Certain cable 
television security techniques, such as signal encryption and copy 
protection, can alter the television signal so that some methods of 
finding line 21 will not work. In particular, counting of lines or 
timing from the start of the vertical blanking interval may cause 
problems. Caption decoding circuitry must function properly when 
receiving signals from cable security systems that were designed and 
marketed prior to April 5, 1991. Further information concerning such 
systems is available from the National Cable Television Association, 
Inc., Washington, DC, and from the Electronic Industries Association, 
Washington, DC.
    (m) Labelling and consumer information requirements. The box or 
other package in which the individual television receiver is to be 
marketed shall carry a statement in a prominent location, visible to the 
buyer before purchase, which reads as follows:

    This television receiver provides display of television closed 
captioning in accordance with Sec. 15.119 of the FCC rules.


Receivers that do not support color attributes or text mode, as well as 
receivers that display only upper-case characters pursuant to paragraph 
(g) of this section, must include with the statement, and in the owner's 
manual, language indicating that those features are not supported.
    (n) Glossary of terms. The following terms are used to describe 
caption decoder specifications:
    (1) Base row: The bottom row of a roll-up display. The cursor always 
remains on the base row. Rows of text roll upwards into the contiguous 
rows immediately above the base row.
    (2) Box: The area surrounding the active character display. In Text 
Mode, the box is the entire screen area defined for display, whether or 
not displayable characters appear. In Caption Mode, the box is 
dynamically redefined by each caption and each element of displayable 
characters within a caption. The box (or boxes, in the case of a 
multiple-element caption) includes all the cells of the displayed 
characters, the non-transparent spaces between them, and one cell at the 
beginning and end of each row within a caption element in those decoders 
that use a solid space to improve legibility.
    (3) Caption window: The invisible rectangle which defines the top 
and bottom limits of a roll-up caption. The window can be 2 to 4 rows 
high. The lowest row of the window is called the base row.
    (4) Cell: The discrete screen area in which each displayable 
character or space may appear. A cell is one row high and one column 
wide.
    (5) Column: One of 32 vertical divisions of the screen, each of 
equal width, extending approximately across the full width of the safe 
caption area as defined in paragraph (n)(12) of this section. Two 
additional columns, oneat

[[Page 725]]

the left of the screen and one at the right, may be defined for the 
appearance of a box in those decoders which use a solid space to improve 
legibility, but no displayable characters may appear in those additional 
columns. For reference, columns may be numbered 0 to 33, with columns 1 
to 32 reserved for displayable characters.
    (6) Displayable character: Any letter, number or symbol which is 
defined for on-screen display, plus the 20h space.
    (7) Display disable: To turn off the display of captions or text 
(and accompanying background) at the receiver, rather than through codes 
transmitted on line 21 which unconditionally erase the display. The 
receiver may disable the display because the user selects an alternate 
mode, e.g., TV Mode, or because no valid line 21 data is present.
    (8) Display enable: To allow the display of captions or text when 
they are transmitted on line 21 and received as valid data. For display 
to be enabled, the user must have selected Caption Mode or Text Mode, 
and valid data for the selected mode must be present on line 21.
    (9) Element: In a pop-on or paint-on style caption, each contiguous 
area of cells containing displayable characters and non-transparent 
spaces between those characters. A single caption may have multiple 
elements. An element is not necessarily a perfect rectangle, but may 
include rows of differing widths.
    (10) Erase Display: In Caption Mode, to clear the screen of all 
characters (and accompanying background) in response to codes 
transmitted on line 21. (The caption service provider can accomplish the 
erasure either by sending an Erase Displayed Memory command or by 
sending an Erase Non-Displayed Memory command followed by an End of 
Caption command, effectively making a blank caption ``appear''.) Display 
can also be erased by the receiver when the caption memory erasure 
conditions are met, such as the user changing TV channels.
    (11) Row: One of 15 horizontal divisions of the screen, extending 
across the full height of the safe caption area as defined in paragraph 
(n)(12) of this section.
    (12) Safe caption area: The area of the television picture within 
which captioning and text shall be displayed to ensure visibility of the 
information on the majority of home television receivers. The safe 
caption area is specified as shown in the following figure:

[[Page 726]]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (13) Special characters: Displayable characters (except for 
``transparent space'') which require a two-byte sequence of one non-
printing and one printing character. The non-printing byte varies 
depending on the data channel. Regular characters require unique one-
byte codes which are the same in either data channel.
    (14) Text: When written with an upper-case ``T'', refers to the Text 
Mode. When written with a lower-case ``t'', refers to any combination of 
displayable characters.
    (15) Transparent space: Transmitted as a special character, it is a 
one-column-wide space behind which program video is always visible 
(except when a transparent space immediately precedes or follows a 
displayable character and solid box is needed to make that character 
legible).

Sec. 15.120  Program blocking technology requirements for television receivers.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1999, manufacturers of television broadcast 
receivers as defined in section 15.3(w) of this chapter, including 
personal computer systems meeting that definition, must ensure that one-
half of their product models with picture screens 33 cm (13 in) or 
larger in diameter shipped in interstate commerce or manufactured in the 
United States comply with the

[[Page 727]]

provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.

    Note: This paragraph places no restrictions on the shipping or sale 
of television receivers that were manufactured before July 1999.

    (b) Effective January 1, 2000, all TV broadcast receivers as defined 
in section 15.3(w) of this chapter, including personal computer systems 
meeting that definition, with picture screens 33 cm (13 in) or larger in 
diameter shipped in interstate commerce or manufactured in the United 
States shall comply with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) 
of this section.
    (c) Transmission format. (1) Analog television program rating 
information shall be transmitted on line 21 of field 2 of the vertical 
blanking interval of television signals, in accordance with 
Sec. 73.682(a)(22) of this chapter.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Operation. (1) Analog television receivers will receive program 
ratings transmitted pursuant to industry standard EIA-744 ``Transport of 
Content Advisory Information Using Extended Data Service (XDS)'', 
October 1997, Electronics Industries Association and EIA-608 
``Recommended Practice for Line 21 Data Service'', September 1994, 
Electronics Industries Association. This incorporation by reference was 
approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Blocking of programming shall occur 
when a program rating is received that meets the pre-determined user 
requirements. Copies of EIA-744 and EIA-608 may be obtained from: Global 
Engineering Documents, 15 Inverness Way East, Englewood, Co 80112-5704. 
Copies of EIA-744 and EIA-608 may be inspected during normal business 
hours at the following locations: Federal Communications Commission, 
2000 M Street, NW, Technical Information Center (Suite 230), Washington, 
DC, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW, 
suite 700 Washington, DC.
    (2) Digital television receivers shall react in a similar manner as 
analog televisions when programmed to block specific rating categories.
    (e) All television receivers as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall block programming as follows:
    (1) Channel Blocking. Channel Blocking should occur as soon as a 
program rating packet with the appropriate Content Advisory or MPAA 
rating level is received. Program blocking is described as a receiver 
performing all of the following:

    [sbull] Muting the program audio.
    [sbull] Rendering the video black or otherwise indecipherable.
    [sbull] Eliminating program-related captions.

    (2) Default State. The default state of a receiver (i.e., as 
provided to the consumer) should not block unrated programs. However, it 
is permissible to include features that allow the user to reprogram the 
receiver to block programs that are not rated.
    (3) Picture-In-Picture (PIP). If a receiver has the ability to 
decode program-related rating information for the Picture-In-Picture 
(PIP) video signal, then it should block the PIP channel in the same 
manner as the main channel. If the receiver does not have the ability to 
decode PIP program-related rating information, then it should block or 
otherwise disable the PIP if the viewer has enabled program blocking.
    (4) Selection of Ratings. Each television receiver, in accordance 
with user input, shall block programming based on the age based ratings, 
the content based ratings, or a combination of the two.
    (i) If the user chooses to block programming according to its age 
based rating level, the receiver must have the ability to automatically 
block programs with a more restrictive age based rating. For example, if 
all shows with an age-based rating of TV-PG have been selected for 
blocking, the user should be able to automatically block programs with 
the more restrictive ratings of TV-14 and TV-MA.
    (ii) If the user chooses to block programming according to a 
combination of age based and content based ratings the receiver must 
have the ability to automatically block programming with a more 
restrictive age rating but a similar content rating. For example, if all 
shows rated TV-PG-V have been selected for blocking, the user should be 
able to block automatically shows with the more restrictive ratings of 
TV-14-V and TV-MA-V.

[[Page 728]]

    (iii) The user should have the capability of overriding the 
automatic blocking described in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (4)(ii) of this 
section.

Sec. 15.121  Scanning receivers and frequency converters used with scanning receivers.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, scanning 
receivers and frequency converters designed or marketed for use with 
scanning receivers, shall:
    (1) Be incapable of operating (tuning), or readily being altered by 
the user to operate, within the frequency bands allocated to the 
Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of this chapter (cellular 
telephone bands). Scanning receivers capable of ``readily being altered 
by the user'' include, but are not limited to, those for which the 
ability to receive transmissions in the cellular telephone bands can be 
added by clipping the leads of, or installing, a simple component such 
as a diode, resistor or jumper wire; replacing a plug-in semiconductor 
chip; or programming a semiconductor chip using special access codes or 
an external device, such as a personal computer. Scanning receivers, and 
frequency converters designed for use with scanning receivers, also 
shall be incapable of converting digital cellular communication 
transmissions to analog voice audio.
    (2) Be designed so that the tuning, control and filtering circuitry 
is inaccessible. The design must be such that any attempts to modify the 
equipment to receive transmissions from the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service likely will render the receiver inoperable.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, scanning 
receivers shall reject any signals from the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower based upon a 12 dB SINAD 
measurement, which is considered the threshold where a signal can be 
clearly discerned from any interference that may be present.
    (c) Scanning receivers and frequency converters designed or marketed 
for use with scanning receivers, are not subject to the requirements of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section provided that they are 
manufactured exclusively for, and marketed exclusively to, entities 
described in 18 U.S.C. 2512(2), or are marketed exclusively as test 
equipment pursuant to Sec. 15.3(dd).
    (d) Modification of a scanning receiver to receive transmissions 
from Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands will be considered 
to constitute manufacture of such equipment. This includes any 
individual, individuals, entity or organization that modifies one or 
more scanners. Any modification to a scanning receiver to receive 
transmissions from the Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands 
voids the certification of the scanning receiver, regardless of the date 
of manufacture of the original unit. In addition, the provisions of 
Sec. 15.23 shall not be interpreted as permitting modification of a 
scanning receiver to receiver Cellular Radiotelephone Service 
transmissions.
    (e) Scanning receivers and frequency converters designed for use 
with scanning receivers shall not be assembled from kits or marketed in 
kit form unless they comply with the requirements in paragraph (a) 
through (c) of this section.
    (f) Scanning receivers shall have a label permanently affixed to the 
product, and this label shall be readily visible to the purchaser at the 
time of purchase. The label shall read as follows:WARNING: MODIFICATION 
OF THIS DEVICE TO RECEIVE CELLULARRADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE SIGNALS IS 
PROHIBITED UNDER FCCRULES AND FEDERAL LAW.
    (1) ``Permanently affixed'' means that the label is etched, 
engraved, stamped, silkscreened, indelible printed or otherwise 
permanently marked on a permanently attached part of the equipment or on 
a nameplate of metal, plastic or other material fastened to the 
equipment by welding, riveting, or permanent adhesive. The label shall 
be designed to last the expected lifetime of the equipment in the 
environment in which the equipment may be operated and must not be 
readily detachable. The label shall not be a stick-on, paper label.
    (2) When the device is so small that it is not practicable to place 
the warning

[[Page 729]]

label on it, the information required by this paragraph shall be placed 
in a prominent location in the instruction manual or pamphlet supplied 
to the user and shall also be placed on the container in which the 
device is marketed. However, the FCC identifier must be displayed on the 
device.

Sec. 15.122  Closed caption decoder requirements for digital television receivers and converter boxes.

    (a)(1) Effective July 1, 2002, all digital television receivers with 
picture screens in the 4:3 aspect ratio with picture screens measuring 
13 inches or larger diagonally, all digital television receivers with 
picture screens in the 16:9 aspect ratio measuring 7.8 inches or larger 
vertically and all separately sold DTV tuners shipped in interstate 
commerce or manufactured in the United States shall comply with the 
provisions of this section.
    Note to paragraph (a)(1):
    This paragraph places no restrictions on the shipping or sale of 
digital television receivers that were manufactured before July 1, 2002.
    (2) Effective July 1, 2002, DTV converter boxes that allow digitally 
transmitted television signals to be displayed on analog receivers shall 
pass available analog caption information to the attached receiver in a 
form recognizable by that receiver's built-in caption decoder circuitry.
    Note to paragraph (a)(2):
    This paragraph places no restrictions on the shipping or sale of DTV 
converter boxes that were manufactured before July 1, 2002.
    (b) Digital television receivers and tuners must be capable of 
decoding closed captioning information that is delivered pursuant to the 
industry standard EIA-708-B, ``Digital Television (DTV) Closed 
Captioning,'' Electronic Industries Alliance (December, 1999). This 
incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal 
Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Digital 
television manufacturers may wish to view EIA-708-B in its entirety. 
Copies of EIA-708-B may be obtained from: Global Engineering Documents, 
15 Inverness Way East, Englewood, CO 80112-5704, http://
www.global.ihs.com/. Copies of EIA-708-B may be inspected during regular 
business hours at the following locations: Federal Communications 
Commission, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20554, or the Office of 
the Federal Register, 800 N. Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, 
DC.
    (c) Services. (1) Decoders must be capable of decoding and 
processing data for the six standard services, Caption Service 
<greek-i>1 through Caption Service <greek-i>6.
    (2) Decoders that rely on Program and System Information Protocol 
data to implement closed captioning functions must be capable of 
decoding and processing the Caption Service Directory data. Such 
decoders must be capable of decoding all Caption Channel Block Headers 
consisting of Standard Service Headers, Extended Service Block Headers, 
and Null Block headers. However, decoding of the data is required only 
for Standard Service Blocks (Service IDs <-6), and then only if the 
characters for the corresponding language are supported. The decoders 
must be able to display the directory for services 1 through 6.
    (d) Code space organization. (1) Decoders must support Code Space 
C0, G0, C1, and G1 in their entirety.

[[Page 730]]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\H = 32 x (the width of the screen in relation to a 4:3 display). For example, the 16:9 format is \1/3\ wider
  than a 4:3 display; thus, H = 32 * \4/3\ = 42.667, or 42.

    (1) This means that the minimum grid resolution for a 4:3 aspect 
ratio instrument is 15 vertical positions x 32 horizontal positions. 
This minimum grid resolution for 16:9 ratio instrument is 15 vertical 
positions x 42 horizontal positions. These minimum grid sizes are to 
cover the entire safe-title area of the corresponding screen.
    (2) The minimum coordinates equate to a \1/5\ reduction in the 
maximum horizontal and vertical grid resolution coordinates.Caption 
providers are to use the maximum coordinate system values when 
specifying anchor point positions. Decoders using the minimum resolution 
are to divide the provided horizontal and vertical screen coordinates by 
5 to derive the equivalent minimum coordinates.
    (3) Any caption targeted for both 4:3 and 16:9 instruments is 
limited to 32 contiguous characters per row. If a caption is received by 
a 4:3 instrument that is targeted for a 16:9 display only, or requires a 
window width greater than 32 characters, then the caption may be 
completely disregarded by the decoder. 16:9 instruments should be able 
to process and display captions intended for 4:3 displays, providing all 
other minimum recommendations are met.
    (4) If the resulting size of any window is larger than the safe 
title area for the corresponding display's aspect ratio, then this 
window will be completely disregarded.
    (f) Caption windows. (1) Decoders need to display no more than 4 
rows of captions on the screen at any given time, regardless of the 
number of windows displayed. This implies that no more than 4 windows 
can be displayed at any given time (with each having only one caption 
row). However, decoders should maintain storage to support a minimum 
total of 8 rows of captions. This storage is needed for the worst-case 
support of a displayed window with 4 rows of captioning and a non-
displayed window which is buffering the incoming rows for the next 4-row 
caption. As implied above, the maximum number of windows that may be 
displayed at any one time by a minimum decoder implementation is 4. If 
more than 4 windows are defined in the caption stream, the decoder may 
disregard the youngest and lowest priority window definition(s). Caption 
providers must be aware of this limitation, and either restrict the 
total number of windows used or accept that some windows will not be 
displayed.

[[Page 732]]

    (2) Decoders do not need to support overlapped windows. If a window 
overlaps another window, the overlapped window need not be displayed by 
the decoder.
    (3) At a minimum, decoders will assume that all windows have rows 
and columns ``locked''. This implies that if a decoder implements the 
SMALL pen-size, then word-``un''wrapping, when shrinking captions, need 
not be implemented. Also, if a decoder implements the LARGE pen size, 
then word wrapping (when enlarging captions) need not be implemented.
    (4) Whenever possible, the receiver should render embedded carriage 
returns as line breaks, since these carriage returns indicate an 
important aspect of the caption's formatting as determined by the 
service provider.However, it may sometimes be necessary for the receiver 
to ignore embedded line breaks. For example, if a caption is to appear 
in a larger font, and if its window's rows and/or columns are unlocked, 
the rows of text may need to become longer or shorter to fit within the 
allocated space. Such automatic reformatting of a caption is known as 
``word wrap.''If decoders support word-wrapping, it must be implemented 
as follows:
    (i) The receiver should follow standard typographic practice when 
implementing word wrap.Potential breaking points (word-wrapping points) 
are indicated by the space character (20h) and by the hyphen character 
(2Dh).
    (ii) If a row is to be broken at a space, the receiver should remove 
the space from the caption display. If a row is to be broken after a 
hyphen, the hyphen should be retained.
    (iii) If an embedded return is to be removed, it should usually be 
replaced with a space. However, if the character to the left of the 
embedded return is a hyphen, the embedded return should be removed but 
NOT replaced with a space.
    (iv) This specification does not include optional hyphens, nor does 
it provide for any form of automatic hyphenation. No non-breaking hyphen 
is defined. The non-breaking space (A0h in the G1 code set) and the non-
breaking transparent space (21h in the G2 code set) should not be 
considered as potential line breaks.
    (v) If a single word exceeds the length of a row, the word should be 
placed at the start of a new row, broken at the character following the 
last character that fits on the row, and continued with further breaks 
if needed.
    (g) Window text painting. (1) All decoders should implement``left'', 
``right'', and ``center'' caption-text justification. Implementation of 
``full'' justification is optional. If ``full'' justification is not 
implemented, fully justified captions should be treated as though they 
are ``left'' justified.
    (i) For ``left'' justification, decoders should display any portion 
of a received row of text when it is received. For ``center'', 
``right'', and ``full'' justification, decoders may display any portion 
of a received row of text when it is received, or may delay display of a 
received row of text until reception of a row completion indicator. A 
row completion indicator is defined as receipt of a CR, ETX or any other 
command, except SetPenColor, SetPenAttributes, or SetPenLocation where 
the pen relocation is within the same row.
    (ii) Receipt of a character for a displayed row which already 
contains text with ``center'', ``right'' or ``full'' justification will 
cause the row to be cleared prior to the display of the newly received 
character and any subsequent characters. Receipt of a justification 
command which changes the last received justification for a given window 
will cause the window to be cleared.
    (2) At a minimum, decoders must support LEFT--TO--RIGHT printing.
    (3) At a minimum, decoders must support BOTTOM--TO--TOP scrolling. 
For windows sharing the same horizontal scan lines on the display, 
scrolling may be disabled.
    (4) At a minimum, decoders must support the same recommended 
practices for scroll rate as is provided for NTSC closed-captioning.
    (5) At a minimum, decoders must support the same recommended 
practices for smooth scrolling as is provided for NTSC closed-
captioning.

    (6) At a minimum, decoders must implement the ``snap'' window 
display effect. If the window ``fade'' and ``wipe'' effects are not 
implemented, then the decoder will ``snap'' all windows when they are to 
be displayed, and the ``effect speed'' parameter is ignored.
    (h) Window colors and borders. At a minimum, decoders must implement 
borderless windows with solid, black backgrounds(i.e., border type = 
NONE, fill color = (0,0,0), fill opacity = SOLID), and borderless 
transparent windows (i.e., border type = NONE, fill opacity = 
TRANSPARENT).
    (i) Predefined window and pen styles. Predefined Window Style and 
Pen Style ID's may be provided in the DefineWindow command. At a 
minimum, decoders should implement Predefined Window Attribute Style 1 
and Predefined Pen Attribute Style 1, as shown in Table 4 and Table 5, 
respectively.

[[Page 736]]

    (j) Pen size. (1) Decoders must support the standard, large, and 
small pen sizes and must allow the caption provider to choose a pen size 
and allow the viewer to choose an alternative size. The STANDARD pen 
size should be implemented such that the height of the tallest character 
in any implemented font is no taller than \1/15\ of the height of the 
safe-title area, and the width of the widest character is no wider than 
\1/32\ of the width of the safe-title area for 4:3 displays and \1/42\ 
of the safe-title area width for 16:9 displays.
    (2) The LARGE pen size should be implemented such that the width of 
the widest character in any implemented font is no wider than \1/32\ of 
the safe-title area for 16:9 displays. This recommendation allows for 
captions to grow to a LARGE pen size without having to reformat the 
caption since no caption will have more than 32 characters per row.
    (k) Font styles. (1) Decoders must support the eight fonts listed 
below. Caption providers may specify 1 of these 8 font styles to be used 
to write caption text. The styles specified in the ``font style'' 
parameter of the SetPenAttributes command are numbered from 0 through 7. 
The following is a list of the 8 required font styles. For information 
purposes only, each font style references one or more popular fonts 
which embody the characteristics of the style:
    (i) 0--Default (undefined)
    (ii) 1--Monospaced with serifs (similar to Courier)
    (iii) 2--Proportionally spaced with serifs (similar to TimesNew 
Roman)
    (iv) 3--Monospaced without serifs (similar to HelveticaMonospaced)
    (v) 4--Proportionally spaced without serifs (similar to Arial and 
Swiss)
    (vi) 5--Casual font type (similar to Dom and Impress)
    (vii) 6--Cursive font type (similar to Coronet and Marigold)
    (viii) 7--Small capitals (similar to Engravers Gothic)
    (2) Font styles may be implemented in any typeface which the decoder 
manufacturer deems to be a readable rendition of the font style, and 
need not be in the exact typefaces given in the example above. Decoders 
must include the ability for consumers to choose among the eight fonts. 
The decoder must display the font chosen by the caption provider unless 
the viewer chooses a different font.
    (l) Character offsetting. Decoders need not implement the character 
offsetting (i.e., subscript and superscript) pen attributes.
    (m) Pen styles. At a minimum, decoders must implement normal, 
italic, and underline pen styles.
    (n) Foreground color and opacity. (1) At a minimum, decoders must 
implement transparent, translucent, solid and flashing character 
foreground type attributes.
    (2) At a minimum, decoders must implement the following character 
foreground colors: white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta and 
cyan.
    (3) Caption providers may specify the color/opacity. Decoders must 
include the ability for consumers to choose among the color/opacity 
options. The decoder must display the color/opacity chosen by the 
caption provider unless the viewer chooses otherwise.
    (o) Background color and opacity. (1) Decoders must implement the 
following background colors: white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, 
magenta and cyan. It is recommended that this background is extended 
beyond the character foreground to a degree that the foreground is 
separated from the underlying video by a sufficient number of background 
pixels to insure the foreground is separated from the background.
    (2) Decoders must implement transparent, translucent, solid and 
flashing background type attributes. Caption providers may specify the 
color/opacity. Decoders must include the ability for consumers to choose 
among the color/opacity options. The decoder must display the color/
opacity chosen by the caption provider unless the viewer chooses 
otherwise.
    (p) Character edges. Decoders must implement separate edge color and 
type attribute control.
    (q) Color representation. (1) At a minimum, decoders must support 
the 8 colors listed in Table 6.

    (2)(i) When a decoder supporting this Minimum Color List receives an 
RGB value not in the list, it will map the received value to one of the 
values in the list via the following algorithm:
    (A) All one (1) values are to be changed to 0.
    (B) All two (2) values are to remain unchanged.
    (C) All three (3) values are to be changed to 2.
    (ii) For example, the RGB value (1,2,3) will be mapped to 
(0,2,2),(3,3,3) will be mapped to (2,2,2) and (1,1,1) will be mapped to 
(0,0,0).
    (3) Table 7 is an alternative minimum color list table supporting 22 
colors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) When a decoder supporting the Alternative Minimum Color List in 
Table 7 receives an RGB value not in the list (i.e., an RGB value whose 
non-zero elements are not the same value), it will map the received 
value to one of the values in the list via the following algorithm:
    (A) For RGB values with all elements non-zero and different--e.g., 
(1,2,3), (3,2,1), and (2,1,3), the 1 value will be changed to 0, the 2 
value will remain unchanged, and the 3 value will be changed to 2.
    (B) For RGB values with all elements non-zero and with two common 
elements--e.g. (3,1,3), (2,1,2), and (2,2,3), if the common elements are 
3 and the uncommon one is 1, then the 1 elements is changed to 0; e.g. 
(3,1,3) [rarr] (3,0,3). If the common elements are 1 and the uncommon 
element is 3, then the 1 elements are changed to 0, and the 3 element is 
changed to 2; e.g. (1,3,1) [rarr] (0,2,0). In all other cases, the 
uncommon element is changed to the common value; e.g., (2,2,3) [rarr] 
(2,2,2), (1,2,1) [rarr] (1,1,1), and (3,2,3) [rarr] (3,3,3).
    (ii) All decoders not supporting either one of the two color lists 
described above, must support the full 64 possible RGB color value 
combinations.
    (r) Character rendition considerations. In NTSC Closed Captioning, 
decoders were required to insert leading and trailing spaces on each 
caption row. There were two reasons for this requirement:
    (1) To provide a buffer so that the first and last characters of a 
caption row do not fall outside the safe title area, and
    (2) To provide a black border on each side of a character so that 
the ``white'' leading pixels of the first character on a row and the 
trailing ``white'' pixels of the last character on a row do not bleed 
into the underlying video.
    (i) Since caption windows are required to reside in the safe title 
area of the DTV screen, reason 1 (above) is not applicable to DTVCC 
captions.
    (ii) The attributes available in the SetPenAttributes command for 
character rendition (e.g., character background and edge attributes) 
provide unlimited flexibility to the caption provider when describing 
caption text in an ideal decoder implementation. However, manufacturers 
need not implement all pen attributes. Thus it is recommended that no 
matter what the level of implementation, decoder manufacturers should 
take into account the readability of all caption text against a variety 
of all video backgrounds, and should implement some

[[Page 738]]

automatic character delineation when the individual control of character 
foreground, background and edge is not supported.
    (s) Service synchronization. Service Input Buffers must be at least 
128 bytes in size. Caption providers must keep this lower limit in mind 
when following Delay commands with other commands and window text. In 
other words, no more than 128 bytes of DTVCC commands and text should be 
transmitted (encoded) before a pending Delay command's delay interval 
expires.
    (t) Settings. Decoders must include an option that permits a viewer 
to choose a setting that will display captions as intended by the 
caption provider (a default). Decoders must also include an option that 
allows a viewer's chosen settings to remain until the viewer chooses to 
alter these settings, including periods when the television is turned 
off.

                    Subpart C--Intentional Radiators


<R05>
Sec. 15.201  Equipment authorization requirement.

    (a) Intentional radiators operated as carrier current systems and 
devices operated under the provisions of Secs. 15.211, 15.213 and 15.221 
shall be verified pursuant to the procedures in subpart J of part 2 of 
this chapter prior to marketing.
    (b) Except as otherwise exempted in paragraph (c) of this section 
and in Sec. 15.23 of this part, all intentional radiators operating 
under the provisions of this part shall be certificated by the 
Commission pursuant to the procedures in subpart J of part 2 of this 
chapter prior to marketing.
    (c) For devices such as perimeter protection systems which, in 
accordance with Sec. 15.31(d), are required to be measured at the 
installation site, each application for certification must be 
accompanied by a statement indicating that the system has been tested at 
three installations and found to comply at each installation. Until such 
time as certification is granted, a given installation of a system that 
was measured for the submission for certification will be considered to 
be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the 
marketing regulations in subpart I of part 2 of this chapter, if tests 
at that installation show the system to be in compliance with the 
relevant technical requirements. Similarly, where measurements must be 
performed on site for equipment subject to verification, a given 
installation that has been verified to demonstrate compliance with the 
applicable standards will be considered to be in compliance with the 
provisions of this chapter, including the marketing regulations in 
subpart I of part 2 of this chapter.
    (d) For perimeter protection systems operating in the frequency 
bands allocated to television broadcast stations operating under part 73 
of this chapter, the holder of the grant of certification must test each 
installation prior to initiation of normal operation to verify 
compliance with the technical standards and must maintain a list of all 
installations and records of measurements. For perimeter protection 
systems operating outside of the frequency bands allocated to television 
broadcast stations, upon receipt of a grant of certification, further 
testing of the same or similar type of system or installation is not 
required.


<R05>
Sec. 15.203  Antenna requirement.

    An intentional radiator shall be designed to ensure that no antenna 
other than that furnished by the responsible party shall be used with 
the device. The use of a permanently attached antenna or of an antenna 
that uses a unique coupling to the intentional radiator shall be 
considered sufficient to comply with the provisions of this section. The 
manufacturer may design the unit so that a broken antenna can be 
replaced by the user, but the use of a standard antenna jack or 
electrical connector is prohibited. This requirement does not apply to 
carrier current devices or to devices operated under the provisions of 
Sec. 15.211, Sec. 15.213, Sec. 15.217, Sec. 15.219, or Sec. 15.221. 
Further, this requirement does not apply to intentional radiators that 
must be professionally installed, such as perimeterprotection systems 
and some field disturbance sensors, or to other

[[Page 739]]

intentional radiators which, in accordance with Sec. 15.31(d), must be 
measured at the installation site. However, the installer shall be 
responsible for ensuring that the proper antenna is employed so that the 
limits in this part are not exceeded.

<R05>
Sec. 15.204  External radio frequency power amplifiers and antenna modifications.

    (a) Except as otherwise described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
no person shall use, manufacture, sell or lease, offer for sale or lease 
(including advertising for sale or lease), or import, ship, or 
distribute for the purpose of selling or leasing, any external radio 
frequency power amplifier or amplifier kit intended for use with a Part 
15 intentional radiator.
    (b) A transmission system consisting of an intentional radiator, an 
external radio frequency power amplifier, and an antenna, may be 
authorized, marketed and used under this part. However, when a 
transmission system is authorized as a system, it must always be 
marketed as a complete system and must always be used in the 
configuration in which it was authorized. An external radio frequency 
power amplifier shall be marketed only in the system configuration with 
which the amplifier is authorized and shall not be marketed as a 
separate product.
    (c) Only the antenna with which an intentional radiator is 
authorized may be used with the intentional radiator.

Sec. 15.207  Conducted limits.

    (a) Except as shown in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, for 
an intentional radiator that is designed to be connected to the public 
utility (AC) power line, the radio frequency voltage that is conducted 
back onto the AC power line on any frequency or frequencies, within the 
band 150 kHz to 30 MHz, shall not exceed the limits in the following 
table, as measured using a 50 [mu]H/50 ohms line impedance stabilization 
network (LISN). Compliance with the provisions of this paragraph shall 
be based on the measurement of the radio frequency voltage between each 
power line and ground at the power terminal. The lower limit applies at 
the boundary between the frequency ranges.

shall be subject to the following standards:
    (1) For carrier current system containing their fundamental emission 
within the frequency band 535-1705 kHz and intended to be received using 
a standard AM broadcast receiver: no limit on conducted emissions.
    (2) For all other carrier current systems: 1000 [mu]V within the

Sec. 15.221, Sec. 15.223, or Sec. 15.227, as appropriate.
    (c) Measurements to demonstrate compliance with the conducted limits 
are not required for devices which only employ battery power for 
operation and which do not operate from the AC power lines or contain 
provisions for operation while connected to the AC power lines. Devices 
that include, or make provisions for, the use of battery chargers which 
permit operating while charging, AC adapters or battery eliminators or 
that connect to the AC power lines indirectly, obtainig their power 
through another device which is connected to the AC power lines, shall 
be tested to demonstrate compliance with the conducted limits.

** Except as provided in paragraph (g), fundamental emissions from
  intentional radiators operating under this section shall not be
  located in the frequency bands 54-72 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz or
  470-806 MHz. However, operation within these frequency bands is
  permItted under other sections of this part, e.g., Secs.  15.231 and
  15.241.

    (b) In the emission table above, the tighter limit applies at the 
band edges.
    (c) The level of any unwanted emissions from an intentional radiator 
operating under these general provisions shall not exceed the level of 
the fundamental emission. For intentional radiators which operate under 
the provisions of other sections within this part and which are required 
to reduce their unwanted emissions to the limits specified in this 
table, the limits in this table are based on the frequency of the 
unwanted emission and not the fundamental frequency. However, the level 
of any unwanted emissions shall not exceed the level of the fundamental 
frequency.
    (d) The emission limits shown in the above table are based on 
measurements employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector except for the 
frequency bands 9-90 kHz, 110-490 kHz and above 1000 MHz. Radiated 
emission limits in these three bands are based on measurements employing 
an average detector.
    (e) The provisions in Secs. 15.31, 15.33, and 15.35 for measuring 
emissions at distances other than the distances specified in the above 
table, determining the frequency range over which radiated emissions are 
to be measured, and limiting peak emissions apply to all devices 
operated under this part.
    (f) In accordance with Sec. 15.33(a), in some cases the emissions 
from an intentional radiator must be measured to beyond the tenth 
harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency designed to be emitted by 
the intentional radiator because of the incorporation of a digital 
device. If measurements above the tenth harmonic are so required, the 
radiated emissions above the tenth harmonic shall comply with the 
general radiated emission limits applicable to the incorporated digital 
device, as shown in Sec. 15.109 and as based on the frequency of the 
emission being measured, or, except for emissions contained in the 
restricted frequency bands shown in Sec. 15.205, the limit on spurious 
emissions specified for the intentional radiator, whichever is the 
higher limit. Emissions which must be measured above the tenth harmonic 
of the highest fundamental frequency designed to be emitted by the 
intentional radiator and which fall within the restricted bands shall 
comply with the general radiated emission limits in Sec. 15.109 that are 
applicable to the incorporated digital device.
    (g) Perimeter protection systems may operate in the 54-72 MHz and 
76-88 MHz bands under the provisions of this section. The use of such 
perimeter protection systems is limited to industrial, business and 
commercial applications.

Sec. 15.211  Tunnel radio systems.

    An intentional radiator utilized as part of a tunnel radio system 
may operate on any frequency provided it meets all of the following 
conditions:
    (a) Operation of a tunnel radio system (intentional radiator and all 
connecting wires) shall be contained solely within a tunnel, mine or 
other structure that provides attenuation to the radiated signal due to 
the presence of naturally surrounding earth and/or water.
    (b) Any intentional or unintentional radiator external to the 
tunnel, mine or other structure, as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, shall be subject to the other applicable regulations contained 
within this part.
    (c) The total electromagnetic field from a tunnel radio system on 
any frequency or frequencies appearing outside of the tunnel, mine or 
other structure described in paragraph (a) of this section, shall not 
exceed the limits shown in Sec. 15.209 when measured at the specified 
distance from the surrounding

[[Page 742]]

structure, including openings. Particular attention shall be paid to the 
emissions from any opening in the structure to the outside environment. 
When measurements are made from the openings, the distances shown in 
Sec. 15.209 refer to the distance from the plane of reference which fits 
the entire perimeter of each above ground opening.
    (d) The conducted limits in Sec. 15.207 apply to the radiofrequency 
voltage on the public utility power lines outside of the tunnel.


<R05>
Sec. 15.213  Cable locating equipment.

    An intentional radiator used as cable locating equipment, as defined 
in Sec. 15.3(d), may be operated on any frequency within the band 9-490 
kHz, subject to the following limits: Within the frequency band 9 kHz, 
up to, but not including, 45 kHz, the peak output power from the cable 
locating equipment shall not exceed 10 watts; and, within the frequency 
band 45 kHz to 490 kHz, the peak output power from the cable locating 
equipment shall not exceed one watt. If provisions are made for 
connection of the cable locating equipment to the AC power lines, the 
conducted limits in Sec. 15.207 also apply to this equipment.

Sec. 15.214  Cordless telephones.

    (a) For equipment authorization, a single application form, FCC Form 
731, may be filed for a cordless telephone system, provided the 
application clearly identifies and provides data for all parts of the 
system to show compliance with the applicable technical requirements. 
When a single application form is submitted, both the base station and 
the portable handset must carry the same FCC identifier. The application 
shall include a fee for certification of each type of transmitter and 
for certification, if appropriate, for each type of receiver included in 
the system.
    (b) A cordless telephone that is intended to be connected to the 
public switched telephone network shall also comply with the applicable 
regulations in part 68 of this chapter. A separate procedure for 
approval under part 68 is required for such terminal equipment.
    (c) The label required under subpart A of this part shall also 
contain the following statement: ``Privacy of communications may not be 
ensured when using this phone.''
    (d) Cordless telephones shall incorporate circuitry which makes use 
of a digital security code to provide protection against unintentional 
access to the public switched telephone network by the base unit and 
unintentional ringing by the handset. These functions shall operate such 
that each access of the telephone network or ringing of the handset is 
preceded by the transmission of a code word. Access to the telephone 
network shall occur only if the code transmitted by the handset matches 
code set in the base unit. Similarly, ringing of the handset shall occur 
only if the code transmitted by the base unit matches the code set in 
the handset. The security code required by this section may also be 
employed to perform other communications functions, such as providing 
telephone billing information. This security code system is to operate 
in accordance with the following provisions.
    (1) There must be provision for at least 256 possible discrete 
digital codes. Factory-set codes must be continuously varied over at 
least 256 possible codes as each telephone is manufactured. The codes 
may be varied either randomly, sequentially, or using another systematic 
procedure.
    (2) Manufacturers must use one of the following approaches for 
facilitating variation in the geographic distribution of individual 
security codes:
    (i) Provide a means for the user to readily select from among at 
least 256 possible discrete digital codes. The cordless telephone shall 
be either in a non-operable mode after manufacture until the user 
selects a security code or the manufacturer must continuously vary the 
initial security code as each telephone is produced.
    (ii) Provide a fixed code that is continuously varied among at least 
256 discrete digital codes as each telephone is manufactured.
    (iii) Provide a means for the cordless telephone to automatically 
select a different code from among at least 256 possible discrete 
digital codes each time it is activated.
    (iv) It is permissible to provide combinations of fixed, automatic, 
and user-

[[Page 743]]

selectable coding provided the above criteria are met.
    (3) A statement of the means and procedures used to achieve the 
required protection shall be provided in any application for equipment 
authorization of a cordless telephone.

             Radiated Emission Limits, Additional Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 15.215  Additional provisions to the general radiated emission limitations.

    (a) The regulations in Secs. 15.217 through 15.255 provide 
alternatives to the general radiated emission limits for intentional 
radiators operating in specified frequency bands. Unless otherwise 
stated, there are no restrictions as to the types of operation permitted 
under these sections.
    (b) In most cases, unwanted emissions outside of the frequency bands 
shown in these alternative provisions must be attenuated to the emission 
limits shown in Sec. 15.209. In no case shall the level of the unwanted 
emissions from an intentional radiator operating under these additional 
provisions exceed the field strength of the fundamental emission.
    (c) Intentional radiators operating under the alternative provisions 
to the general emission limits, as contained in Secs. 15.217 through 
15.255 and in subpart E of this part, must be designed to ensure that 
the 20 dB bandwidth of the emission is contained within the frequency 
band designated in the rule section under which the equipment is 
operated. The requirement to contain the 20 dB bandwidth of the emission 
within the specified frequency band includes the effects from frequency 
sweeping, frequency hopping and other modulation techniques that may be 
employed as well as the frequency stability of the transmitter over 
expected variations in temperature and supply voltage. If a frequency 
stability is not specified in the regulations, it is recommended that 
the fundamental emission be kept within at least the central 80% of the 
permitted band in order to minimize the possibility of out-of-band 
operation.

Sec. 15.217  Operation in the band 160-190 kHz.

    (a) The total input power to the final radio frequency stage 
(exclusive of filament or heater power) shall not exceed one watt.
    (b) The total length of the transmission line, antenna, and ground 
lead (if used) shall not exceed 15 meters.
    (c) All emissions below 160 kHz or above 190 kHz shall be attenuated 
at least 20 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier. Determination 
of compliance with the 20 dB attenuation specification may be based on 
measurements at the intentional radiator's antenna output terminal 
unless the intentional radiator uses a permanently attached antenna, in 
which case compliance shall be demonstrated by measuring the radiated 
emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 15.219  Operation in the band 510-1705 kHz.

    (a) The total input power to the final radio frequency stage 
(exclusive of filament or heater power) shall not exceed 100 milliwatts.
    (b) The total length of the transmission line, antenna and ground 
lead (if used) shall not exceed 3 meters.
    (c) All emissions below 510 kHz or above 1705 kHz shall be 
attenuated at least 20 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier. 
Determination of compliance with the 20 dB attenuation specification may 
be based on measurements at the intentional radiator's antenna output 
terminal unless the intentional radiator uses a permanentlyattached 
antenna, in which case compliance shall be deomonstrated by measuring 
the radiated emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 15.221  Operation in the band 525-1705 kHz.

    (a) Carrier current systems and transmitters employing a leaky 
coaxial cable as the radiating antenna may operate in the band 525-1705 
kHz provided the field strength levels of the radiated emissions do not 
exceed 15 uV/

[[Page 744]]

m, as measured at a distance of 47,715/(frequency in kHz) meters 
(equivalent to Lambda/2Pi) from the electric power line or the coaxial 
cable, respectively. The field strength levels of emissions outside this 
band shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in 
Sec. 15.209.
    (b) As an alternative to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this 
section, intentional radiators used for the operation of an AM broadcast 
station on a college or university campus or on the campus of any other 
education institution may comply with the following:
    (1) On the campus, the field strength of emissions appearing outside 
of this frequency band shall not exceed the general radiated emission 
limits shown in Sec. 15.209 as measured from the radiating source. There 
is no limit on the field strength of emissions appearing within this 
frequency band, except that the provisions of Sec. 15.5 continue to 
comply.
    (2) At the perimeter of the campus, the field strength of any 
emissions, including those within the frequency band 525-1705 kHz, shall 
not exceed the general radiated emission in Sec. 15.209.
    (3) The conducted limits specified in Sec. 15.207 apply to the radio 
frequency voltage on the public utility power lines outside of the 
campus. Due to the large number of radio frequency devices which may be 
used on the campus, contributing to the conducted emissions, as an 
alternative to measuring conducted emissions outside of the campus, it 
is acceptable to demonstrate compliance with this provision by measuring 
each individual intentional radiator employed in the system at the point 
where it connects to the AC power lines.
    (c) A grant of equipment authorization is not required for 
intentional radiators operated under the provisions of this section. In 
lieu thereof, the intentional radiator shall be verified for compliance 
with the regulations in accordance with subpart J of part 2 of this 
chapter. This data shall be kept on file at the location of the studio, 
office or control room associated with the transmitting equipment. In 
some cases, this may correspond to the location of the transmitting 
equipment.
    (d) For the band 535-1705 kHz, the frequency of operation shall be 
chosen such that operation is not within the protected field strength 
contours of licensed AM stations.

<R05>
Sec. 15.223  Operation in the band 1.705-10 MHz.

    (a) The field strength of any emission within the band 1.705-10.0 
MHz shall not exceed 100 microvolts/meter at a distance of 30 meters. 
However, if the bandwidth of the emission is less than 10% of the center 
frequency, the field strength shall not exceed 15 microvolts/meter or 
(the bandwidth of the device in kHz) divided by (the center frequency of 
the device in MHz) microvolts/meter at a distance of 30 meters, 
whichever is the higher level. For the purposes of this section, 
bandwidth is determined at the points 6 dB down from the modulated 
carrier. The emission limits in this paragraph are based on measurement 
instrumentation employing an average detector. The provisions in 
Sec. 15.35(b) for limiting peak emissions apply.
    (b) The field strength of emissions outside of the band 1.705-10.0 
MHz shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in

    (b) The field strength of any emissions appearing outside of this 
band shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits shown in 
Sec. 15.209.
    (c) The frequency tolerance of the carrier signal shall be 
maintained within [plusmn]0.01% of the operating frequency over a 
temperature variation of -20 degrees to +50 degrees C at normal supply 
voltage, and for a variation in the primary supply voltage from 85% to 
115% of the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 20 degrees C. For 
battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be performed using 
a new battery.

    (a) The field strength of any emission within this band shall not 
exceed 10,000 microvolts/meter at 3 meters. The emission limit in this 
paragraph is based on measurement instrumentation employing an average 
detector. The provisions in Sec. 15.35 for limiting peak emissions 
apply.
    (b) The field strength of any emissions which appear outside of this 
band shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in 
Sec. 15.209.

    (a) Unless operating pursuant to the provisions in Sec. 15.231, the 
field strength of any emissions within this band shall not exceed 1,000 
microvolts/meter at 3 meters.
    (b) As an alternative to the limit in paragraph (a) of this section, 
perimeter protection systems may demonstrate compliance with the 
following: the field strength of any emissions within this band shall 
not exceed 500 microvolts/meter at 3 meters, as determined using 
measurement instrumentations employing an average detector. The 
provisions in Sec. 15.35 for limiting peak emissions apply where 
compliance of these devices is demonstrated under this alternative 
emission limit.
    (c) The field strength of any emissions appearing outside of this 
band shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in 
Sec. 15.209.
    (d) The frequency tolerance of the carrier signal shall be 
maintained within [plusmn]0.01% of the operating frequency over a 
temperature variation of -20 degrees to +50 degrees C at normal supply 
voltage, and for a variation in the primary supply voltage from 85% to 
115% of the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 20 degrees C. For 
battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be performed using

Sec. 15.231  Periodic operation in the band 40.66-40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz.

    (a) The provisions of this section are restricted to periodic 
operation within the band 40.66-40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz. Except as 
shown in paragraph (e) of this section, the intentional radiator is 
restricted to the transmission of a control signal such as those used 
with alarm systems, door openers, remote switches, etc. Radio control of 
toys is not permitted. Continuous transmissions, such as voice or video, 
and data transmissions are not permitted. The prohibition against data 
transmissions does not preclude the use of recognition codes. Those 
codes are used to identify the sensor that is activated or to identify 
the particular component as being part of the system. The following 
conditions shall be met to comply with the provisions for this periodic 
operation:
    (1) A manually operated transmitter shall employ a switch that will 
automatically deactivate the transmitter within not more than 5 seconds 
of being released.
    (2) A transmitter activated automatically shall cease transmission 
within 5 seconds after activation.
    (3) Periodic transmissions at regular predetermined intervals are 
not permitted. However, polling or supervision transmissions to 
determine system integrity of transmitters used in security or safety 
applications are allowed if the periodic rate of transmission does not 
exceed one transmission of not more than one second duration per hour 
for each transmitter.
    (4) Intentional radiators which are employed for radio control 
purposes during emergencies involving fire, security, and safety of 
life, when activated to signal an alarm, may operate during the pendency 
of the alarm condition
    (b) In addition to the provisions of Sec. 15.205, the field strength 
of emissions from intentional radiators operated under this section 
shall not exceed the following:

    (1) The above field strength limits are specified at a distance of 3 
meters. The tighter limits apply at the band edges.
    (2) Intentional radiators operating under the provisions of this 
section shall demonstrate compliance with the limits on the field 
strength of emissions, as shown in the above table, based on the average 
value of the measured emissions. As an alternative, compliance with the 
limits in the above table may be based on the use of measurement 
instrumentation with a CISPR quasi-peak detector. The specific method of 
measurement employed shall be specified in the application for equipment 
authorization. If average emission measurements are employed, the 
provisions in Sec. 15.35 for averaging pulsed emissions and for limiting 
peak emissions apply. Further, compliance with the provisions of 
Sec. 15.205 shall be demonstrated using the measurement instrumentation 
specified in that section.
    (3) The limits on the field strength of the spurious emissions in 
the above table are based on the fundamental frequency of the 
intentional radiator. Spurious emissions shall be attenuated to the 
average (or, alternatively, CISPR quasi-peak) limits shown in this table 
or to the general limits shown in Sec. 15.209, whichever limit permits a 
higher field strength.
    (c) The bandwidth of the emission shall be no wider than 0.25% of 
the center frequency for devices operating above 70 MHz and below 900 
MHz. For devices operating above 900 MHz, the emission shall be no wider 
than 0.5% of the center frequency. Bandwidth is determined at the points 
20 dB down from the modulated carrier.
    (d) For devices operating within the frequency band 40.66-40.70 MHz, 
the bandwidth of the emission shall be confined within the band edges 
and the frequency tolerance of the carrier shall be [plusmn]0.01%. This 
frequency tolerance shall be maintained for a temperature variation of -
20 degrees to +50 degrees C at normal supply voltage, and for a 
variation in the primary supply voltage from 85% to 115% of the rated 
supply voltage at a temperature of 20 degrees C. For battery operated 
equipment, the equipment tests shall be performed using a new battery.
    (e) Intentional radiators may operate at a periodic rate exceeding 
that specified in paragraph (a) of this section and may be employed for 
any type of operation, including operation prohibited in paragraph (a) 
of this section, provided the intentional radiator complies with the 
provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, except the

    (c) The field strength of the fundamental emission shall not exceed 
10,000 microvolts/meter at 3 meters. The emission limit in this 
paragraph is based on measurement instrumentation employing an average 
detector. The provisions in Sec. 15.35 for limiting peak emissions 
apply.
    (d) The fundamental emission shall be confined within a 20 kHz band 
and shall be centered on a carrier frequency shown above, as adjusted by 
the frequency tolerance of the transmitter at the time testing is 
performed. Modulation products outside of this 20 kHz band shall be 
attenuated at least 26 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier or 
to the general limits in Sec. 15.209, whichever permits the higher 
emission levels. Emissions on any frequency more than 20 kHz removed 
from the center frequency shall consist solely of unwanted emissions and 
shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in Sec. 15.209. 
Tests to determine compliance with these requirements shall be performed 
using an appropriate input signal as prescribed in Sec. 2.989 of this 
chapter.
    (e) All emissions exceeding 20 microvolts/meter at 3 meters are to 
be reported in the application for certification.
    (f) If the device provides for the connection of external 
accessories, including external electrical input signals, the device 
must be tested with the accessories attached. The emission tests shall 
be performed with the device and accessories configured in a manner 
which tends to produce the maximum level of emissions within the range 
of variations that can be expected under normal operating conditions.
    (g) The frequency tolerance of the carrier signal shall be 
maintained within [plusmn]0.01% of the operating frequency. The

employed solely on the premises of health care facilities.
    (1) A health care facility includes hospitals and other 
establishments that offer services, facilities, and beds for use beyond 
24 hours in rendering medical treatment and institutions and 
organizations regularly engaged in providing medical services through 
clinics, public health facilities, and similar establishments, including 
governmental entities and agencies for their own medical activities.
    (2) This authority to operate does not extend to mobile vehicles, 
such as ambulances, even if those vehicles are associated with a health 
care facility.
    (b) The fundamental emissions from a biomedical telemetry device 
operating under the provisions of this section shall be contained within 
a single television broadcast channel, as defined in part 73 of this 
chapter, under all conditions of operation and shall lie wholly within 
the frequency ranges of 174-216 MHz and 470-668 MHz.
    (c) The field strength of the fundamental emissions shall not exceed 
200 mV/m, as measured at a distance of 3 meters using a quasi-peak 
detector. Manufacturers should note that a quasi-peak detector function 
indicates field strength per 120 kHz of bandwidth [plusmn]20 kHz. 
Accordingly, the total signal level over the band of operation may be 
higher than 200 mV/m. The field strength of emissions radiated on any 
frequency outside of the television broadcast channel within which the 
fundamental is contained shall not exceed the general limits in 
Sec. 15.209.
    (d) The user and the installer of a biomedical telemetry device 
operating within the frequency range 174-216 MHz, 470-608 MHz or 614-668 
MHz shall ensure that the following minimum separation distances are 
maintained between the biomedical telemetry device and the authorized 
radio services operating on the same frequencies:
    (1) At least 10.3 km outside of the Grade B field strength contour 
(56 dBuV/m) of a TV broadcast station or an associated TV booster 
station operating within the band 174-216 MHz.
    (2) At least 5.5 km outside of the Grade B field strength contour 
(64 dBuV/m) of a TV broadcast station or an associated TV booster 
station operating within the bands 470-608 MHz or 614-668 MHz.
    (3) At least 5.1 km outside of the 68 dBuV/m field strength contour 
of a low power TV or a TV translator station operating within the band 
174-216 MHz.

[[Page 750]]

    (4) At least 3.1 km outside of the 74 dBuV/m field strength contour 
of a low power TV or a TV translator station operating within the bands 
470-608 MHz or 614-668 MHz.
    (5) Whatever distance is necessary to protect other authorized users 
within these bands.
    (e) The user and the installer of a biomedical telemetry device 
operating within the frequency range 608-614 MHz and that will be 
located within 32 km of the very long baseline array (VLBA) stations or 
within 80 km of any of the other radio astronomy observatories noted in 
footnote US 311 of Section 2.106 of this chapter must coordinate with, 
and obtain the written concurrence of, the director of the affected 
radio astronomy observatory before the equipment can be installed or 
operated. The National Science Foundation point of contact for 
coordination is: Spectrum Manager, Division of Astronomical Sciences, 
NSF Rm 1045, 4201 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22230; tel: (703) 306-
1823.
    (f) Biomedical telemetry devices must not cause harmful interference 
to licensed TV broadcast stations or to other authorized radio services, 
such as operations on the broadcast frequencies under subparts G and H 
of part 74 of this chapter, land mobile stations operating under part 90 
of this chapter in the 470-512 MHz band, and radio astronomy operation 
in the 608-614 MHz band. (See Sec. 15.5.) If harmful interference 
occurs, the interference must either be corrected or the device must 
immediately cease operation on the occupied frequency. Further, the 
operator of the biomedical telemetry device must accept whatever level 
of interference is received from other radio operations. The operator, 
i.e., the health care facility, is responsible for resolving any 
interference that occurs subsequent to the installation of these 
devices.
    (g) The manufacturers, installers, and users of biomedical telemetry 
devices are reminded that they must ensure that biomedical telemetry 
transmitters operating under the provisions of this section avoid 
operating in close proximity to authorized services using this spectrum. 
Sufficient separation distance, necessary to avoid causing or receiving 
harmful interference, must be maintained from co-channel operations. 
These parties are reminded that the frequencies of the authorized 
services are subject to change, especially during the implementation of 
the digital television services. The operating frequencies of the part 
15 devices may need to be changed, as necessary and in accordance with 
the permissive change requirements of this chapter, to accommodate 
changes in the operating frequencies of the authorized services.
    (h) The manufacturers, installers and users of biomedical telemetry 
devices are cautioned that the operation of this equipment could result 
in harmful interference to other nearby medical devices.

building or to open building doors, 25.0 mV/m.
    (ii) For all other field disturbance sensors, 7.5 mV/m.
    (iii) Field disturbance sensors designed to be used in motor 
vehicles or aircraft must include features to prevent continuous 
operation unless their emissions in the restricted bands fully comply 
with the limits given in Sec. 15.209. Continuous operation of field 
disturbance sensors designed to be used in farm equipment, vehicles such 
as fork lifts that are intended primarily for use indoors or for very 
specialized operations, or railroad locomotives, railroad cars and other 
equipment which travels on fixed tracks is permitted. A field 
disturbance sensor will be considered not to be operating in a 
continuous mode if its operation is limited to specific activities of 
limited duration (e.g., putting a vehicle into reverse gear, activating 
a turn signal, etc.).
    (2) Field strength limits are specified at a distance of 3 meters.
    (3) Emissions radiated outside of the specified frequency bands, 
except for harmonics, shall be attenuated by at least 50 dB below the 
level of the fundamental or to the general radiated emission limits in 
Sec. 15.209, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (4) The emission limits shown above are based on measurement 
instrumentation employing an average detector. The provisions in 
Sec. 15.35 for limiting peak emissions apply.

Sec. 15.247  Operation within the bands 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz, and 5725-5850 MHz.

    (a) Operation under the provisions of this section is limited to 
frequency hopping and digitally modulated intentional radiators that 
comply with the following provisions:
    (1) Frequency hopping systems shall have hopping channel carrier 
frequencies separated by a minimum of 25 kHz or the 20 dB bandwidth of 
the hopping channel, whichever is greater. The system shall hop to 
channel frequencies that are selected at the system hopping rate from a 
pseudorandomly ordered list of hopping frequencies. Each frequency must 
be used equally on the average by each transmitter. The system receivers 
shall have input bandwidths that match the hopping channel bandwidths of 
their corresponding transmitters and shall shift frequencies in 
synchronization with the transmitted signals.
    (i) For frequency hopping systems operating in the 902-928 MHz band: 
if the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is less than 250 kHz, the 
system shall use at least 50 hopping frequencies and the average time of 
occupancy on any frequency shall not be greater than 0.4 seconds within 
a 20 second period; if the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is 250 
kHz or greater, the system shall use at least 25 hopping frequencies and 
the average time of occupancy on any frequency shall not be greater than 
0.4 seconds within a 10 second period. The maximum allowed 20 dB 
bandwidth of the hopping channel is 500 kHz.

[[Page 752]]

    (ii) Frequency hopping systems operating in the 5725-5850 MHz band 
shall use at least 75 hopping frequencies. The maximum 20 dB bandwidth 
of the hopping channel is 1 MHz. The average time of occupancy on any 
frequency shall not be greater than 0.4 seconds within a 30 second 
period.
    (iii) Frequency hopping systems in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band shall 
use at least 15 non-overlapping channels. The average time of occupancy 
on any channel shall not be greater than 0.4 seconds within a period of 
0.4 seconds multiplied by the number of hopping channels employed. 
Frequency hopping systems which use fewer than 75 hopping frequencies 
may employ intelligent hopping techniques to avoid interference to other 
transmissions. Frequency hopping systems may avoid or suppress 
transmissions on a particular hopping frequency provided that a minimum 
of 15 non-overlapping channels are used.
    (2) Systems using digital modulation techniques may operate in the 
902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz, and 5725-5850 MHz bands. The minimum 6 dB 
bandwidth shall be at least 500 kHz.
    (b) The maximum peak output power of the intentional radiator shall 
not exceed the following:
    (1) For frequency hopping systems in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band 
employing at least 75 hopping channels, and all frequency hopping 
systems in the 5725-5850 MHz band: 1 Watt. For all other frequency 
hopping systems in the 2400-2483.5 band: 0.125 Watt.
    (2) For frequency hopping systems operating in the 902-928 MHz band: 
1 watt for systems employing at least 50 hopping channels; and, 0.25 
watts for systems employing less than 50 hopping channels, but at least 
25 hopping channels, as permitted under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (3) For systems using digital modulation in the 902-928 MHz, 2400-
2483.5 MHz, and 5725-5850 MHz bands: 1 Watt.
    (4) Except as shown in paragraphs (b)(3) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this 
section, if transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi 
are used thepeak output power from the intentional radiator shall be 
reduced below the stated values in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section, as appropriate, by the amount in dB that the directional gain 
of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (i) Systems operating in the 2400-2483.5 MHz band that are used 
exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations may employ transmitting 
antennas with directional gain greater than 6 dBi provided the maximum 
peak output power of the intentional radiator is reduced by 1 dB for 
every 3 dB that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (ii) Systems operating in the 5725-5850 MHz band that are used 
exclusively for fixed, point-to-point operations may employ transmitting 
antennas with directional gain greater than 6 dBi without any 
corresponding reduction in transmitter peak output power.
    (iii) Fixed, point-to-point operation, as used in paragraphs 
(b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, excludes the use of point-to-
multipoint systems, omnidirectional applications, and multiple co-
located intentional radiators transmitting the same information. The 
operator of the spread spectrum intentional radiator or, if the 
equipment is professionally installed, the installer is responsible for 
ensuring that the system is used exclusively for fixed, point-to-point 
operations. The instruction manual furnished with the intentional 
radiator shall contain language in the installation instructions 
informing the operator and the installer of this responsibility.
    (5) Systems operating under the provisions of this section shall be 
operated in a manner that ensures that the public is not exposed to 
radio frequency energy levels in excess of the Commission's guidelines. 
See Sec. 1.1307(b)(1) of this chapter.
    (c) In any 100 kHz bandwidth outside the frequency band in which the 
spread spectrum or digitally modulated intentional radiator is 
operating, the radio frequency power that is produced by the intentional 
radiator shall be at least 20 dB below that in the 100 kHz bandwidth 
within the band that contains the highest level of the desired power, 
based on either an RF conducted or a radiated measurement. Attenuation 
below the general limits specified in Sec. 15.209(a) is not required.

[[Page 753]]

In addition, radiated emissions which fall in the restricted bands, as 
defined in Sec. 15.205(a), must also comply with the radiated emission 
limits specified in Sec. 15.209(a) (see Sec. 15.205(c)).
    (d) For digitally modulated systems, the peak power spectral density 
conducted from the intentional radiator to the antenna shall not be 
greater than 8 dBm in any 3 kHz band during any time interval of 
continuous transmission.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) For the purposes of this section, hybrid systems are those that 
employ a combination of both frequency hopping and digital modulation 
techniques. The frequency hopping operation of the hybrid system, with 
the direct sequence or digital modulation operation turned off, shall 
have an average time of occupancy on any frequency not to exceed 0.4 
seconds within a time period in seconds equal to the number of hopping 
frequencies employed multiplied by 0.4. The digital modulation operation 
of the hybrid system, with the frequency hopping operation turned off, 
shall comply with the power density requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (g) Frequency hopping spread spectrum systems are not required to 
employ all available hopping channels during each transmission. However, 
the system, consisting of both the transmitter and the receiver, must be 
designed to comply with all of the regulations in this section should 
the transmitter be presented with a continuous data (or information) 
stream. In addition, a system employing short transmission bursts must 
comply with the definition of a frequency hopping system and must 
distribute its transmissions over the minimum number of hopping channels 
specified in this section.
    (h) The incorporation of intelligence within a frequency hopping 
spread spectrum system that permits the system to recognize other users 
within the spectrum band so that it individually and independently 
chooses and adapts its hopsets to avoid hopping on occupied channels is 
permitted. The coordination of frequency hopping systems in any other 
manner for the express purpose of avoiding the simultaneous occupancy of 
individual hopping frequencies by multiple transmitters is not 
permitted.

    Note: Spread spectrum systems are sharing these bands on a 
noninterference basis with systems supporting critical Government 
requirements that have been allocated the usage of these bands, 
secondary only to ISM equipment operated under the provisions of part 18 
of this chapter. Many of these Government systems are airborne 
radiolocation systems that emit a high EIRP which can cause interference 
to other users. Also, investigations of the effect of spread spectrum 
interference to U. S. Government operations in the 902-928 MHz band may 
require a future decrease in the power limits allowed for spread 
spectrum operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Fixed, point-to-point operation as referred to in this paragraph 
shall be limited to systems employing a fixed transmitter transmitting 
to a fixed remote location. Point-to-multipoint systems, omnidirectional 
applications, and multiple co-located intentional radiators transmitting 
the same information are not allowed. Fixed, point-to-point operation is 
permitted in the 24.05-24.25 GHz band subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The field strength of emissions in this band shall not exceed 
2500 millivolts/meter.
    (2) The frequency tolerance of the carrier signal shall be 
maintained within [plusmn]0.001% of the operating frequency over a

at a temperature of 20 degrees C. For battery operated equipment, the 
equipment tests shall be performed using a new battery.
    (3) Antenna gain must be at least 33 dBi. Alternatively, the main 
lobe beamwidth must not exceed 3.5 degrees. The beamwidth limit shall 
apply to both the azimuth and elevation planes. At antenna gains over 33 
dBi or beamwidths narrower than 3.5 degrees, power must be reduced to 
ensure that the field strength does not exceed 2500 millivolts/meter.
    (c) Field strength limits are specified at a distance of 3 meters.
    (d) Emissions radiated outside of the specified frequency bands, 
except for harmonics, shall be attenuated by at least 50 dB below the 
level of the fundamental or to the general radiated emission limits in 
Sec. 15.209, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (e) As shown in Sec. 15.35(b), for frequencies above 1000 MHz, the 
field strength limits in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are 
based on average limits. However, the peak field strength of any 
emission shall not exceed the maximum permitted average limits specified 
above by more than 20 dB under any condition of modulation. For point-
to-point operation under paragraph (b) of this section, the peak field 
strength shall not exceed 2500 millivolts/meter at 3 meters along the 
antenna azimuth.
    (f) Parties considering the manufacture, importation, marketing or 
operation of equipment under this section should also note the 
requirement in Sec. 15.37(d).

    (a) Operation under the provisions of this section is not permitted 
for the following products:
    (1) Equipment used on aircraft or satellites.
    (2) Field disturbance sensors, including vehicle radar systems, 
unless the field disturbance sensors are employed for fixed operation. 
For the purposes of this section, the reference to fixed operation 
includes field disturbance sensors installed in fixed equipment, even if 
the sensor itself moves within the equipment.
    (b) Within the 57-64 GHz band, emission levels shall not exceed the 
following:
    (1) For products other than fixed field disturbance sensors, the 
average power density of any emission, measured during the transmit 
interval, shall not exceed 9 [mu]W/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from the 
radiating structure, and the peak power density of any emission shall 
not exceed 18 [mu]W/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from the radiating 
structure.
    (2) For fixed field disturbance sensors that occupy 500 MHz or less 
of bandwidth and that are contained wholly within the frequency band 
61.0-61.5 GHz, the average power density of any emission, measured 
during the transmit interval, shall not exceed 9 [mu]W/cm\2\, as 
measured 3 meters from the radiating structure, and the peak power 
density of any emission shall not exceed 18 [mu]W/cm\2\, as measured 3 
meters from the radiating structure. In addition, the average power 
density of any emission outside of the 61-61.5 GHz band, measured during 
the transmit interval, but still within the 57-64 GHz band, shall not 
exceed 9 nW/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from the radiating structure, 
and the peak power density of any emission shall not exceed 18 nW/cm\2\, 
as measured three meters from the radiating structure.
    (3) For fixed field disturbance sensors other than those operating 
under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the peak 
transmitter output power shall not exceed 0.1 mW and the peak power 
density shall not exceed 9 nW/cm\2\ at a distance of 3 meters.
    (4) Peak power density shall be measured with an RF detector that 
has a detection bandwidth that encompasses the 57-64 GHz band and has a 
video bandwidth of at least 10 MHz, or using an equivalent measurement 
method.
    (5) The average emission limits shall be calculated, based on the 
measured peak levels, over the actual time period during which 
transmission occurs.
    (c) Limits on spurious emissions:
    (1) The power density of any emissions outside the 57-64 GHz band 
shall consist solely of spurious emissions.
    (2) Radiated emissions below 40 GHz shall not exceed the general 
limits in Sec. 15.209.
    (3) Between 40 GHz and 200 GHz, the level of these emissions shall 
not exceed 90 pW/cm\2\ at a distance of 3 meters.
    (4) The levels of the spurious emissions shall not exceed the level 
of the fundamental emission.
    (d) Only spurious emissions and transmissions related to a publicly-
accessible coordination channel, whose purpose is to coordinate 
operation between diverse transmitters with a view towards reducing the 
probability of interference throughout the 57-64 GHz band, are permitted 
in the 57-57.05 GHz band.

    Note to paragraph (d):
    The 57-57.05 GHz is reserved exclusively for a publicly-accessible 
coordination channel. The development of standards for this channel 
shall be performed pursuant to authorizations issued under part 5 of 
this chapter.

    (e) Except as specified elsewhere in this paragraph (e), the total 
peak transmitter output power shall not exceed 500 mW.
    (1) Transmitters with an emission bandwidth of less than 100 MHz 
must limit their peak transmitter output power to the product of 500 mW 
times their emission bandwidth divided by

[[Page 757]]

100 MHz. For the purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), emission bandwidth 
is defined as the instantaneous frequency range occupied by a steady 
state radiated signal with modulation, outside which the radiated power 
spectral density never exceeds 6 dB below the maximum radiated power 
spectral density in the band, as measured with a 100 kHz resolution 
bandwidth spectrum analyzer. The center frequency must be stationary 
during the measurement interval, even if not stationary during normal 
operation (e.g. for frequency hopping devices).
    (2) Peak transmitter output power shall be measured with an RF 
detector that has a detection bandwidth that encompasses the 57-64 GHz 
band and that has a video bandwidth of at least 10 MHz, or using an 
equivalent measurement method.
    (3) For purposes of demonstrating compliance with this paragraph 
(e), corrections to the transmitter output power may be made due to the 
antenna and circuit loss.
    (f) Fundamental emissions must be contained within the frequency 
bands specified in this section during all conditions of operation. 
Equipment is presumed to operate over the temperature range -20 to +50 
degrees celsius with an input voltage variation of 85% to 115% of rated 
input voltage, unless justification is presented to demonstrate 
otherwise.
    (g) Regardless of the power density levels permitted under this 
section, devices operating under the provisions of this section are 
subject to the radiofrequency radiation exposure requirements specified 
in Secs. 1.1307(b), 2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. 
Applications for equipment authorization of devices operating under this 
section must contain a statement confirming compliance with these 
requirements for both fundamental emissions and unwanted emissions. 
Technical information showing the basis for this statement must be 
submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (h) Any transmitter that has received the necessary FCC equipment 
authorization under the rules of this chapter may be mounted in a group 
installation for simultaneous operation with one or more other 
transmitter(s) that have received the necessary FCC equipment 
authorization, without any additional equipment authorization. However, 
no transmitter operating under the provisions of this section may be 
equipped with external phase-locking inputs that permit beam-forming 
arrays to be realized.
    (i) For all transmissions that emanate from inside of a building, 
within any one second interval of signal transmission, each transmitter 
with a peak output power equal to or greater than 0.1 mW or a peak power 
density equal to or greater than 3 nW/cm\2\, as measured 3 meters from 
the radiating structure, must transmit a transmitter identification at 
least once. Each application for equipment authorization for equipment 
that will be used inside of a building must declare that the equipment

specify a method whereby interested parties can obtain sufficient 
information, at no cost, to enable them to fully detect and decode this 
transmitter identification information. Upon the completion of decoding, 
the transmitter identification data block must provide the following 
fields:
    (1) FCC Identifier, which shall be programmed at the factory.
    (2) Manufacturer's serial number, which shall be programmed at the 
factory.
    (3) Provision for at least 24 bytes of data relevant to the specific

<R05>
Sec. 15.301  Scope.

    This subpart sets out the regulations for unlicensed personal 
communications services (PCS) devices operating

[[Page 758]]

in the 1910-1930 MHz and 2390-2400 MHz frequency bands.

[60 FR 13073, Mar. 10, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 15.303  Definitions.

    (a) Asynchronous devices. Devices that transmit RF energy at 
irregular time intervals, as typified by local area network data 
systems.
    (b) Coordinatable PCS device. PCS devices whose geographical area of 
operation is sufficiently controlled either by necessity of operation 
with a fixed infrastructure or by disabling mechanisms to allow adequate 
coordination of their locations relative to incumbent fixed microwave 
facilities.
    (c) Emission bandwidth. For purposes of this subpart the emission 
bandwidth shall be determined by measuring the width of the signal 
between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above 
the carrier center frequency, that are 26 dB down relative to the 
maximum level of the modulated carrier. Compliance with the emissions 
limits is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a 
peak detector function with an instrument resolutions bandwidth 
approximately equal to 1.0 percent of the emission bandwidth of the 
device under measurement.
    (d) Isochronous devices. Devices that transmit at a regular 
interval, typified by time-division voice systems.
    (e) Noncoordinatable PCS device. A PCS device that is capable of 
randomly roaming and operating in geographic areas containing incumbent 
microwave facilities such that operation of the PCS device will 
potentially cause harmful interference to the incumbent microwave 
facilities.
    (f) Peak transmit power. The peak power output as measured over an 
interval of time equal to the frame rate or transmission burst of the 
device under all conditions of modulation. Usually this parameter is 
measured as a conducted emission by direct connection of a calibrated 
test instrument to the equipment under test. If the device cannot be 
connected directly, alternative techniques acceptable to the Commission 
may be used.
    (g) Personal Communications Services (PCS) Devices [Unlicensed]. 
Intentional radiators operating in the frequency bands 1910-1930 MHz and 
2390-2400 MHz that provide a wide array of mobile and ancillary fixed 
communication services to individuals and businesses.
    (h) Spectrum window. An amount of spectrum equal to the intended 
emission bandwidth in which operation is desired.
    (i) Sub-band. For purposes of this subpart the term sub-band refers 
to the spectrum allocated for isochronous or asynchronous transmission.
    (j) Thermal noise power. The noise power in watts defined by the 
formula N=kTB where N is the noise power inwatts, K is Boltzmann's 
constant, T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin (e.g., 295 
[deg]K) and B is the emission bandwidth of the device in hertz.
    (k) Time window. An interval of time in which transmission is 
desired.

    (a) UTAM, Inc. is designated to coordinate and manage the transition 
of the 1910-1930 MHz band from the Private Operational-Fixed Microwave 
Service (OFS) operating under part 101 of this chapter to unlicensed PCS 
operations,
    (b) Each application for certification of equipment operating under 
the provisions of this subpart must be accompanied by an affidavit from 
UTAM, Inc. certifying that the applicant is a participating member of 
UTAM, Inc. In the event a grantee fails to fulfill the obligations 
attendant to participation in UTAM, Inc., the Commission may invoke 
administrative sanctions as

[[Page 759]]

necessary to preclude continued marketing and installation of devices 
covered by the grant of certification, including but not limited to 
revoking certification.
    (c) An application for certification of a PCS device that is deemed 
by UTAM, Inc. to be noncoordinatable will not be accepted until the 
Commission announces that a need for coordination no longer exists.
    (d) A coordinatable PCS device is required to incorporate means that 
ensure that it cannot be activated until its location has been 
coordinated by UTAM, Inc. The application for certification shall 
contain an explanation of all measures taken to prevent unauthorized 
operation. This explanation shall include all procedural safeguards, 
such as the mandatory use of licensed technicians to install the 
equipment, and a complete description of all technical features 
controlling activation of the device.
    (e) A coordinatable PCS device shall incorporate an automatic 
mechanism for disabling operation in the event it is moved outside the 
geographic area where its operation has been coordinated by UTAM, Inc. 
The application for certification shall contain a full description of 
the safeguards against unauthorized relocation and must satisfy the 
Commission that the safeguards cannot be easily defeated.
    (f) At such time as the Commission deems that the need for 
coordination between unlicensed PCS operations and existing Part 101 
Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Services ceases to exist, the 
disabling mechanism required by paragraph (e) of this section will no 
longer be required.
    (g) Operations under the provisions of this subpart are required to 
protect systems in the Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Service 
operating within the 1850-1990 MHz band until the dates and conditions 
specified in Secs. 101.69 through 101.73 of this chapter for termination 
of primary status. Interference protection is not required for part 101 
stations in this band licensed on a secondary basis.
    (h) The operator of a PCS device that is relocated from the 
coordinated area specified by UTAM, Inc., must cease operating the 
device until coordination for the new location is verified by UTAM, Inc.

<R05>
Sec. 15.321  Specific requirements for asynchronous devices operating in the 1910-1920 MHz and 2390-2400 MHz bands.

    (a) Operation shall be contained within either or both of the 1910-
1920 MHz and 2390-2400 MHz bands. The emission bandwidth of any 
intentional radiator operating in these bands shall be no less than 500 
kHz.
    (b) All systems of less than 2.5 MHz emission bandwidth shall start 
searching for an available spectrum window within 3 MHz of the band edge 
at 1910, 1920, 2390, or 2400 MHz while systems of more than 2.5 MHz 
emission bandwidth will first occupy the center half of the band. 
Devices with an emission bandwidth of less than 1.0 MHz may not occupy 
the center half of the band if other spectrum is available.
    (c) Asynchronous devices must incorporate a mechanism for monitoring 
the spectrum that its transmission is intended to occupy. The following 
criteria must be met:
    (1) Immediately prior to initiating a transmission, devices must 
monitor the spectrum window they intend to use for at least 50 
microseconds.
    (2) The monitoring threshold must not be more than 32 dB above the 
thermal noise power for a bandwidth equivalent to the emission bandwidth 
of the device.
    (3) If no signal above the threshold level is detected, a 
transmission burst may commence in the monitored spectrum window. Once a 
transmission burst has started, an individual device or a group of 
cooperative devices is not

[[Page 761]]

required to monitor the spectrum window provided the intraburst gap 
timing requirement specified below is not exceeded.
    (4) After completion of a transmission, an individual device or 
cooperating group of devices must cease transmission and wait a 
deference time randomly chosen from a uniform random distribution 
ranging from 50 to 750 microseconds, after which time an attempt to 
access the band again may be initiated. For each occasion that an access 
attempt fails after the initial inter-burst interval, the range of the 
deference time chosen shall double until an upper limit of 12 
milliseconds is reached. The deference time remains at the upper limit 
of 12 milliseconds until an access attempt is successful. The deference 
time is re-initialized after each successful access attempt.
    (5) The monitoring system bandwidth must be equal to or greater than 
the emission bandwidth of the intended transmission and shall have a 
maximum reaction time less than 50xSQRT(1.25/emission bandwidth in MHz) 
microseconds for signals at the applicable threshold level but shall not 
be required to be less than 50 microseconds. If a signal is detected 
that is 6 dB or more above the threshold level, the maximum reaction 
time shall be 35xSQRT(1.25/emission bandwidth in MHz) microseconds but 
shall not be required to be less than 35 microseconds.
    (6) The monitoring system shall use the same antenna used for 
transmission, or an antenna that yields equivalent reception at that 
location.
    (7) Devices that have a power output lower than the maximum 
permitted under the rules may increase their detection threshold by one 
decibel for each one decibel that the transmitter power is below the 
maximum permitted.
    (d) Emissions shall be attenuated below a reference power of 112 
milliwatts as follows: 30 dB between the sub-band edges and 1.25 MHz 
above or below the sub-band; 50 dB between 1.25 and 2.5 MHz above or 
below the sub-band; and 60 dB at 2.5 MHz or greater above or below the 
sub-band. Compliance with the emissions limits is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing a peak detector function with an 
instrument resolution bandwidth approximately equal to 1.0 percent of 
the emission bandwidth of the device under measurement.
    (e) The frequency stability of the carrier frequency of intentional 
radiators operating in accordance with this section shall be [plusmn]10 
ppm over 10 milliseconds or the interval between channel access 
monitoring, whichever is shorter. The frequency stability shall be 
maintained over a temperature variation of -20[deg] to +50 [deg]Celsius 
at normal supply voltage, and over a variation in the primary supply 
voltage of 85 percent to 115 percent of the rated supply voltage at a 
temperature of 20 degreesCelsius. For equipment that is capable of 
operating only from a battery, the frequency stability tests shall be 
performed using a new battery without any further requirement to vary 
supply voltage.
    (f) An asynchronous transmission burst is a series of transmissions 
from one or more transmitters acting cooperatively. The transmission 
burst duration from one device or group of devices acting cooperatively 
shall be no greater than 10 milliseconds. Any intraburst gap between 
cooperating devices shall not exceed 25 microseconds.
    (g) Operation of devices in the 2390-2400 MHz band from aircraft 
while airborne is prohibited, in order to protect space research 
operations at the National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center at Arecibo, 
Puerto Rico.

<R05>
Sec. 15.323  Specific requirements for isochronous devices operating in the 1920-1930 MHz sub-band.

    (a) Operation shall be contained within one of eight 1.25 MHz 
channels starting with 1920-1921.25 MHz and ending with 1928.75-1930 
MHz. Further sub-division of a 1.25 MHz channel is permitted with a 
reduced power level, as specified in Sec. 15.319(c), but in no event 
shall the emission bandwidth be less than 50 kHz.
    (b) Intentional radiators with an intended emission bandwidth less 
than

[[Page 762]]

625 kHz shall start searching for an available time and spectrum window 
within 3 MHz of the sub-band edge at 1920 MHz and search upward from 
that point. Devices with an intended emission bandwidth greater than 625 
kHz shall start searching for an available time and spectrum window 
within 3 MHz of the sub-band edge at 1930 MHz and search downward from 
that point.
    (c) Isochronous devices must incorporate a mechanism for monitoring 
the time and spectrum windows that its transmission is intended to 
occupy. The following criteria must be met:
    (1) Immediately prior to initiating transmission, devices must 
monitor the combined time and spectrum windows in which they intend to 
transmit for a period of at least 10 milliseconds for systems designed 
to use a 10 milliseconds or shorter frame period or at least 20 
milliseconds for systems designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period.
    (2) The monitoring threshold must not be more than 30 dB above the 
thermal noise power for a bandwidth equivalent to the emission bandwidth 
used by the device.
    (3) If no signal above the threshold level is detected, transmission 
may commence and continue with the same emission bandwidth in the 
monitored time and spectrum windows without further monitoring. However, 
occupation of the same combined time and spectrum windows by a device or 
group of cooperating devices continuously over a period of time longer 
than 8 hours is not permitted without repeating the access criteria.
    (4) Once access to specific combined time and spectrum windows is 
obtained an acknowledgment from a system participant must be received by 
the initiating transmitter within one second or transmission must cease. 
Periodic acknowledgments must be received at least every 30 seconds or 
transmission must cease. Channels used exclusively for control and 
signaling information may transmit continuously for 30 seconds without 
receiving an acknowledgment, at which time the access criteria must be 
repeated.
    (5) If access to spectrum is not available as determined by the 
above, and a minimum of 40 duplex system access channels are defined for 
the system, the time and spectrum windows with the lowest power level 
below a monitoring threshold of 50 dB above the thermal noise power 
determined for the emission bandwidth may be accessed. A device 
utilizing the provisions of this paragraph must have monitored all 
access channels defined for its system within the last 10 seconds and 
must verify, within the 20 milliseconds (40 milliseconds for devices 
designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period) immediately preceding 
actual channel access that the detected power of the selected time and 
spectrum windows is no higher than the previously detected value. The 
power measurement resolution forthis comparsion must be accurate to 
within 6 dB. No device or group of cooperating devices located within 1 
meter of each other shall occupy more than three 1.25 MHz channels 
during any frame period. Devices in an operational state that are 
utilizing the provisions of this section are not required to use the 
search provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (6) If the selected combined time and spectrum windows are 
unavailable, the device may either monitor and select different windows 
or seek to use the same windows after waiting an amount of time, 
randomly chosen from a uniform random distribution between 10 and 150 
milliseconds, commencing when the channel becomes available.
    (7) The monitoring system bandwidth must be equal to or greater than 
the emission bandwidth of the intended transmission and have a maximum 
reaction time less than 50xSQRT (1.25/emission bandwidth in MHz) 
microseconds for signals at the applicable threshold level but shall not 
be required to be less than 50 microseconds. If a signal is detected 
that is 6 dB or more above the applicable threshold level, the maximum 
reaction time shall be 35xSQRT (1.25/emission bandwidth in MHz) 
microseconds but shall not be required to be less than 35 microseconds.
    (8) The monitoring system shall use the same antenna used for 
transmission, or an antenna that yields equivalent reception at that 
location.
    (9) Devices that have a power output lower than the maximum 
permitted

[[Page 763]]

under this subpart may increase their monitoring detection threshold by 
one decibel for each one decibel that the transmitter power is below the 
maximum permitted.
    (10) An initiating device may attempt to establish a duplex 
connection by monitoring both its intended transmit and receive time and 
spectrum windows. If both the intended transmit and receive time and 
spectrum windows meet the access criteria, then the initiating device 
can initiate a transmission in the intended transmit time and spectrum 
window. If the power detected by the responding device can be decoded as 
a duplex connection signal from the initiating device, then the 
responding device may immediately begin transmitting on the receive time 
and spectrum window monitored by the initiating device.
    (11) An initiating device that is prevented from monitoring during 
its intended transmit window due to monitoring system blocking from the 
transmissions of a co-located (within one meter) transmitter of the same 
system, may monitor the portions of the time and spectrum windows in 
which they intend to receive over a period of at least 10 milliseconds. 
The monitored time and spectrum window must total at least 50 percent of 
the 10 millisecond frame interval and the monitored spectrum must be 
within the 1.25 MHz frequency channel(s) already occupied by that device 
or co-located co-operating devices. If the access criteria is met for 
the intended receive time and spectrum window under the above 
conditions, then transmission in the intended transmit window by the 
initiating device may commence.
    (12) The provisions of (c)(10) or (c)(11) of this section shall not 
be used to extend the range of spectrum occupied over space or time for 
the purpose of denying fair access to spectrum to other devices.
    (d) Emissions shall be attenuated below a reference power of 112 
milliwatts as follows: 30 dB between the channel edges and 1.25 MHz 
above or below the channel; 50 dB between 1.25 and 2.5 MHz above or 
below the channel; and 60 dB at 2.5 MHz or greater above or below the 
channel. Systems that further sub-divide a 1.25 MHz channel into X sub-
channels must comply with the following emission mask: In the bands 
between 1B and 2B measured from the center of the emission bandwidth the 
total power emitted by the device shall be at least 30 dB below the 
transmit power permitted for that device; in the bands between 2B and 3B 
measured from the center of the emission bandwidth the total power 
emitted by an intentional radiator shall be at least 50 dB below the 
transmit power permitted for that radiator; in the bands between 3B and 
the 1.25 MHz channel edge the total power emitted by an intentional 
radiator in the measurement bandwidth shall be at least 60dB below the 
transmit power permitted for that radiator. ``B'' is defined as the 
emission bandwidth of the device in hertz. Compliance with the emission 
limits is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a 
peak detector function with an instrument resolution bandwidth 
approximately equal to 1.0 percent of the emission bandwidth of the 
device under measurement.
    (e) The frame period (a set of consecutive time slots in which the 
position of each time slot can be identified by reference to a 
synchronizing source) of an intentional radiator operating in these sub-
bands shall be 20 milliseconds or 10 milliseconds/X where X is a 
positive whole number. Each device that implements time division for the 
purposes of maintaining a duplex connection on a given frequency carrier 
shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a frequency stability of at 
least 50 parts per million (ppm). Each device which further divides 
access in time in order to support multiple communication links on a 
given frequency carrier shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a 
frequency stability of at least 10 ppm. The jitter (time-related, 
abrupt, spurious variations in the duration of the frame interval) 
introduced at the two ends of such a communication link shall not exceed 
25 microseconds for any two consecutive transmissions. Transmissions 
shall be continuous in every time and spectrum window during the frame 
period defined for the device.

[[Page 764]]

    (f) The frequency stability of the carrier frequency of the 
intentional radiator shall be maintained within [plusmn]10 ppm over 1 
hour or the interval between channel access monitoring, whichever is 
shorter. The frequency stability shall be maintained over a temperature 
variation of -20[deg] to +50 [deg]C at normal supply voltage, and over a 
variation in the primary supply voltage of 85 percent to 115 percent of 
the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 20 [deg]C. For equipment 
that is capable only of operating from a battery, the frequency 
stability tests shall be performed using a new battery without any 
further requirement to vary supply voltage.

Information Infrastructure (U-NII) devices operating in the 5.15-5.35 
GHz and 5.725-5.825 GHz bands.

[63 FR 40835, July 31, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 15.403  Definitions.

    (a) Average symbol envelope power. The average symbol envelope power 
is the average, taken over all symbols in the signaling alphabet, of the 
envelope power for each symbol.
    (b) Digital modulation. The process by which the characteristics of 
a carrier wave are varied among a set of predetermined discrete values 
in accordance with a digital modulating function as specified in 
document ANSI C63.17-1998.
    (c) Emission bandwidth. For purposes of this subpart the emission 
bandwidth shall be determined by measuring the width of the signal 
between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above 
the carrier center frequency, that are 26 dB down relative to the 
maximum level of the modulated carrier. Determination of the emissions 
bandwidth is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a 
peak detector function with an instrument resolutions bandwidth 
approximately equal to 1.0 percent of the emission bandwidth of the 
device under measurement.
    (d) Peak power spectral density. The peak power spectral density is 
the maximum power spectral density, within the specified measurement 
bandwidth, within the U-NII device operating band.

an interval of time of at most 30/B or the transmission pulse duration 
of the device, whichever is less, under all conditions of modulation.
    (f) Power spectral density. The power spectral density is the total 
energy output per unit bandwidth from a pulse or sequence of pulses for 
which the transmit power is at its peak or maximum level, divided by the 
total duration of the pulses. This total time does not include the time 
between pulses during which the transmit power is off or below its 
maximum level.
    (g) Pulse. A pulse is a continuous transmission of a sequence of 
modulation symbols, during which the average symbol envelope power is

interval of at most 30/B (where B is the 26 dB emission bandwidth of the 
signal in hertz) or the duration of the transmission pulse, whichever is 
less, divided by the interval duration.
    (i) U-NII devices. Intentional radiators operating in the frequency

contained in the U-NII device. Other aspects of the operation of a U-NII 
device may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in this 
chapter. In particular, a U-NII device that includes digital circuitry 
not directly associated with the radio transmitter also is subject to 
the requirements for unintentional radiators in subpart B.

[63 FR 40835, July 31, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 15.407  General technical requirements.

    (a) Power limits:
    (1) For the band 5.15-5.25 GHz, the peak transmit power over the 
frequency band of operation shall not exceed the lesser of 50 mW or 4 
dBm + 10logB, where B is the 26-dB emission bandwidth in MHz. In 
addition, the peak power spectral density shall not exceed 4 dBm in any 
1-MHz band. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 
dBi are used, both the peak transmit power and the peak power spectral 
density shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional gain 
of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (2) For the band 5.25-5.35 GHz, the peak transmit power over the 
frequency band of operation shall not exceed the lesser of 250 mW or 11 
dBm + 10logB, where B is the 26-dB emission bandwidth in MHz. In 
addition, the peak power spectral density shall not exceed 11 dBm in any 
1-MHz band. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 
dBi are used, both the peak transmit power and the peak power spectral 
density shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional gain 
of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
    (3) For the band 5.725-5.825 GHz, the peak transmit power over the 
frequency band of operation shall not exceed the lesser of 1 W or 17 dBm 
+ 10logB, where B is the 26-dB emission bandwidth in MHz. In addition, 
the peak power spectral density shall not exceed 17 dBm in any 1-MHz 
band. If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi 
are used, both the peak transmit power and the peak power spectral 
density shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional gain 
of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi. However, fixed point-to-point U-NII 
devices operating in this band may employ transmitting antennas with 
directional gain up to 23 dBi without any corresponding reduction in the 
transmitter peak output power or peak power spectral density. For fixed, 
point-to-point U-NII transmitters that employ a directional antenna gain 
greater than 23 dBi, a 1 dB reduction in peak transmitter power and peak 
power spectral density for each 1 dB of antenna gain in excess of 23 dBi 
would be required. Fixed, point-to-point operations exclude the use of 
point-to-multipoint systems, omni directional applications, and multiple 
collocated transmitters transmitting the same information. The operator 
of the U-NII device, or if the equipment is professionally installed, 
the installer, is responsible for ensuring that systems employing high 
gain directional antennas are used exclusively for fixed, point-to-point 
operations.

    Note to paragraph (a)(3):
    The Commission strongly recommends that parties employing U-NII 
devices to provide critical communications services should determine if 
there are any nearby Government radar systems that could affect their 
operation.

    (4) The peak transmit power must be measured over any interval of 
continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an 
rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly 
adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response 
times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the 
emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak 
measurement conforming to the definitions in this paragraph for the 
emission in question.
    (5) The peak power spectral density is measured as a conducted 
emission by direct connection of a calibrated test instrument to the 
equipment under test. If the device cannot be connected directly, 
alternative techniques acceptable to the Commission may be used. 
Measurements are made over a bandwidth of 1 MHz or the 26 dB emission 
bandwidth of the device, whichever is less. A resolution bandwidth less 
than the measurement bandwidth can be used, provided that the measured 
power is integrated to show total

[[Page 766]]

power over the measurement bandwidth. If the resolution bandwidth is 
approximately equal to the measurement bandwidth, and much less than the 
emission bandwidth of the equipment under test, the measured results 
shall be corrected to account for any difference between the resolution 
bandwidth of the test instrument and its actual noise bandwidth.
    (6) The ratio of the peak excursion of the modulation envelope 
(measured using a peak hold function) to the peak transmit power 
(measured as specified in this paragraph) shall not exceed 13 dB across 
any 1 MHz bandwidth or the emission bandwidth whichever is less.
    (b) Undesirable emission limits: Except as shown in paragraph (b)(6) 
of this section, the peak emissions outside of the frequency bands of 
operation shall be attenuated in accordance with the following limits:
    (1) For transmitters operating in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band: all 
emissions outside of the 5.15-5.35 GHz band shall not exceed an EIRP of 
-27 dBm/MHz.
    (2) For transmitters operating in the 5.25-5.35 GHz band: all 
emissions outside of the 5.15-5.35 GHz band shall not exceed an EIRP of 
-27 dBm/MHz. Devices operating in the 5.25-5.35 GHz band that generate 
emissions in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band must meet all applicable technical 
requirements for operation in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band (including indoor 
use) or alternatively meet an out-of-band emission EIRP limit of -27 
dBm/MHz in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band.
    (3) For transmitters operating in the 5.725-5.825 GHz band: all 
emissions within the frequency range from the band edge to 10 MHz above 
or below the band edge shall not exceed an EIRP of -17 dBm/MHz; for 
frequencies 10 MHz or greater above or below the band edge, emissions 
shall not exceed an EIRP of -27 dBm/MHz.
    (4) The emission measurements shall be performed using a minimum 
resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz. A lower resolution bandwidth may be 
employed near the band edge, when necessary, provided the measured 
energy is integrated to show the total power over 1 MHz.
    (5) Unwanted emissions below 1 GHz must comply with the general 
field strength limits set forth in Sec. 15.209. Further, any U-NII 
devices using an AC power line are required to comply also with the 
conducted limits set forth in Sec. 15.207.
    (6) The provisions of Sec. 15.205 apply to intentional radiators 
operating under this section.
    (7) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier 
frequency shall be adjusted as close to the upper and lower frequency 
block edges as the design of the equipment permits.
    (c) The device shall automatically discontinue transmission in case 
of either absence of information to transmit or operational failure. 
These provisions are not intended to preclude the transmission of 
control or signalling information or the use of repetitive codes used by 
certain digital technologies to complete frame or burst intervals. 
Applicants shall include in their application for equipment 
authorization a description of how this requirement is met.
    (d) Any U-NII device that operates in the 5.15-5.25 GHz band shall 
use a transmitting antenna that is an integral part of the device.
    (e) Within the 5.15-5.25 GHz band, U-NII devices will be restricted 
to indoor operations to reduce any potential for harmful interference to 
co-channel MSS operations.
    (f) U-NII devices are subject to the radio frequency radiation 
exposure requirements specified in Sec. 1.1307(b), Sec. 2.1091 and 
Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. All equipment shall be 
considered to operate in a ``general population/uncontrolled'' 
environment. Applications for equipment authorization of devices 
operating under this section must contain a statement confirming 
compliance with these requirements for both fundamental emissions and 
unwanted emissions. Technical information showing the basis for this 
statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request.
    (g) Manufacturers of U-NII devices are responsible for ensuring 
frequency stability such that an emission is maintained within the band 
of operation under all conditions of normal operation as specified in 
the users manual.

                   Subpart F--Ultra-Wideband Operation

    Source: 67 FR 34856, May 16, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 15.501  Scope.

    This subpart sets out the regulations for unlicensed ultra-wideband 
transmission systems.


<R05>
Sec. 15.503  Definitions.

    (a) UWB bandwidth. For the purpose of this subpart, the UWB 
bandwidth is the frequency band bounded by the points that are 10 dB 
below the highest radiated emission, as based on the complete 
transmission system including the antenna. The upper boundary is 
designated f<INF>H</INF> and the lower boundary is designated 
f<INF>L</INF>. The frequency at which the highest radiated emission 
occurs is designated f<INF>M</INF>.
    (b) Center frequency. The center frequency, f<INF>C</INF>, equals 
(f<INF>H</INF> + f<INF>L</INF>)/2.
    (c) Fractional bandwidth. The fractional bandwidth equals 
2(f<INF>H</INF>-f<INF>L</INF>)/ (f<INF>H</INF> + f<INF>L</INF>).
    (d) Ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter. An intentional radiator that, 
at any point in time, has a fractional bandwidth equal to or greater 
than 0.20 or has a UWB bandwidth equal to or greater than 500 MHz, 
regardless of the fractional bandwidth.
    (e) Imaging system. A general category consisting of ground 
penetrating radar systems, medical imaging systems, wall imaging systems 
through-wall imaging systems and surveillance systems. As used in this 
subpart, imaging systems do not include systems designed to detect the 
location of tags or systems used to transfer voice or data information.
    (f) Ground penetrating radar (GPR) system. A field disturbance 
sensor that is designed to operate only when in contact with, or within 
one meter of, the ground for the purpose of detecting or obtaining the 
images of buried objects or determining the physical properties within 
the ground. The energy from the GPR is intentionally directed down into 
the ground for this purpose.
    (g) Medical imaging system. A field disturbance sensor that is 
designed to detect the location or movement of objects within the body 
of a person or animal.
    (h) Wall imaging system. A field disturbance sensor that is designed 
to detect the location of objects contained within a ``wall'' or to 
determine the physical properties within the ``wall.'' The ``wall'' is a 
concrete structure, the side of a bridge, the wall of a mine or another 
physical structure that is dense enough and thick enough to absorb the 
majority of the signal transmitted by the imaging system. This category 
of equipment does not include products such as ``stud locators'' that 
are designed to locate objects behind gypsum, plaster or similar walls 
that are not capable of absorbing the transmitted signal.
    (i) Through-wall imaging system. A field disturbance sensor that is 
designed to detect the location or movement of persons or objects that 
are located on the other side of an opaque structure such as a wall or a 
ceiling. This category of equipment may include products such as ``stud 
locators'' that are designed to locate objects behind gypsum, plaster or 
similar walls that are not thick enough or dense enough to absorb the 
transmitted signal.
    (j) Surveillance system. A field disturbance sensor used to 
establish a stationary RF perimeter field that is used for security 
purposes to detect the intrusion of persons or objects.
    (k) EIRP. Equivalent isotropically radiated power, i.e., the product 
of the power supplied to the antenna and the antenna gain in a given 
direction relative to an isotropic antenna. The EIRP, in terms of dBm, 
can be converted to a field strength, in dBuV/m at 3 meters, by adding 
95.2. As used in this subpart, EIRP refers to the highest signal 
strength measured in any direction and at any frequency from the UWB 
device, as tested in accordance with the procedures specified in 
Sec. 15.31(a) and 15.523 of this chapter.
    (l) Law enforcement, fire and emergency rescue organizations. As 
used in this subpart, this refers to those parties eligible to obtain a 
license from the FCC under the eligibility requirements specified in 
Sec. 90.20(a)(1) of this chapter.

[[Page 768]]

    (m) Hand held. As used in this subpart, a hand held device is a 
portable device, such as a lap top computer or a PDA, that is primarily 
hand held while being operated and that does not employ a fixed 
infrastructure.


<R05>
Sec. 15.505  Cross reference.

    (a) Except where specifically stated otherwise within this subpart, 
the provisions of subparts A and B and of Secs. 15.201 through 15.204 
and 15.207 of subpart C of this part apply to unlicensed UWB intentional 
radiators. The provisions of Sec. 15.35(c) and 15.205 do not apply to 
devices operated under this subpart. The provisions of Footnote US 246 
to the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in Sec. 2.106 of this 
chapter does not apply to devices operated under this subpart.
    (b) The requirements of this subpart apply only to the radio 
transmitter, i.e., the intentional radiator, contained in the UWB 
device. Other aspects of the operation of a UWB device may be subject to 
requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a UWB 
device that contains digital circuitry not directly associated with the 
operation of the transmitter also is subject to the requirements for 
unintentional radiators in subpart B of this part. Similarly, an 
associated receiver that operates (tunes) within the frequency range 30 
MHz to 960 MHz is subject to the requirements in subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 15.507  Marketing of UWB equipment.

    In some cases, the operation of UWB devices is limited to specific 
parties, e.g., law enforcement, fire and rescue organizations operating 
under the auspices of a state or local government. The marketing of UWB 
devices must be directed solely to parties eligible to operate the 
equipment. The responsible party, as defined in Sec. 2.909 of this 
chapter, is responsible for ensuring that the equipment is marketed only 
to eligible parties. Marketing of the equipment in any other manner may 
be considered grounds for revocation of the grant of certification 
issued for the equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 15.509  Technical requirements for ground penetrating radars and wall imaging systems.

    (a) The UWB bandwidth of an imaging system operating under the 
provisions of this section must be below 10.6 GHz.
    (b) Operation under the provisions of this section is limited to 
GPRs and wall imaging systems operated for purposes associated with law 
enforcement, fire fighting, emergency rescue, scientific research, 
commercial mining, or construction.
    (1) Parties operating this equipment must be eligible for licensing 
under the provisions of part 90 of this chapter.

a wall imaging system shall contain a manually operated switch that 
causes the transmitter to cease operation within 10 seconds of being 
released by the operator. In lieu of a switch located on the imaging 
system, it is permissible to operate an imaging system by remote control 
provided the imaging system ceases transmission within 10 seconds of the 
remote switch being released by the operator.
    (d) The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device 
operating under the provisions of this section shall not exceed the 
emission levels in Sec. 15.209. The radiated emissions above 960 MHz 
from a device operating under the provisions of this section shall not 
exceed the following average limits when measured using a resolution 
bandwidth of 1 MHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Frequency in MHz                        EIRP in dBm

1559-1610.................................................         -75.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) For UWB devices where the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>, is above 960 MHz, there is a 
limit on the peak level of the emissions contained within a 50 MHz 
bandwidth centered on f<INF>M</INF>. That limit is 0 dBm EIRP. It is 
acceptable to employ a different resolution bandwidth, and a 
correspondingly different peak emission limit, following the procedures 
described in Sec. 15.521.

Sec. 15.515  Technical requirements for vehicular radar systems.

    (a) Operation under the provisions of this section is limited to UWB 
field disturbance sensors mounted in terrestrial transportation 
vehicles. These devices shall operate only when the vehicle is 
operating, e.g., the engine is running. Operation shall occur only upon 
specific activation, such as upon starting the vehicle, changing gears, 
or engaging a turn signal.
    (b) The UWB bandwidth of a vehicular radar system operating under 
the provisions of this section shall be contained between 22 GHz and 29 
GHz. In addition, the center frequency, f<INF>C</INF>, and the frequency 
at which the highest level emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>, must be

attenuate any emissions within the 23.6-24.0 GHz band that appear 38 
degrees or greater above the horizontal plane by 25 dB below the limit 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For equipment authorized, 
manufactured or imported on or after January 1, 2005, this level of 
attenuation shall be 25 dB for any emissions within the 23.6-24.0 GHz 
band that appear 30 degrees or greater above the horizontal plane. For 
equipment authorized, manufactured or imported on or after January 1, 
2010, this level of attenuation shall be 30 dB for any emissions within 
the 23.6-24.0 GHz band that appear 30 degrees or greater above the 
horizontal plane. For equipment authorized, manufactured or imported on 
or after January 1, 2014, this level of attenuation shall be 35 dB for 
any emissions within the 23.6-24.0 GHz band that appear 30 degrees or 
greater above the horizontal plane. This level of attenuation can be 
achieved through the antenna directivity, through a reduction in output 
power or any other means.
    (d) The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device 
operating under the provisions of this section shall not exceed the 
emission levels in Sec. 15.209. The radiated emissions above 960 MHz

<R05>
Sec. 15.517  Technical requirements for indoor UWB systems.

    (a) Operation under the provisions of this section is limited to UWB 
transmitters employed solely for indoor operation.
    (1) Indoor UWB devices, by the nature of their design, must be 
capable of operation only indoors. The necessity to operate with a fixed 
indoor infrastructure, e.g., a transmitter that must be connected to the 
AC power lines, may be considered sufficient to demonstrate this.
    (2) The emissions from equipment operated under this section shall 
not be intentionally directed outside of the building in which the 
equipment is located, such as through a window or a doorway, to perform 
an outside function, such as the detection of persons about to enter a 
building.
    (3) The use of outdoor mounted antennas, e.g., antennas mounted on 
the outside of a building or on a telephone pole, or any other outdoors 
infrastructure is prohibited.
    (4) Field disturbance sensors installed inside of metal or 
underground storage tanks are considered to operate indoors provided the 
emissions are directed towards the ground.
    (5) A communications system shall transmit only when the intentional 
radiator is sending information to an associated receiver.
    (b) The UWB bandwidth of a UWB system operating under the provisions 
of this section must be contained between 3100 MHz and 10,600 MHz.
    (c) The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device 
operating under the provisions of this section shall not exceed the 
emission levels in Sec. 15.209. The radiated emissions above 960 MHz 
from a device operating under the provisions of this section shall not 
exceed the following average limits when measured using a resolution 
bandwidth of 1 MHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm
------------------------------------------------------------------------
960-1610.............................................              -75.3

3100-10600...........................................              -41.3
Above 10600..........................................              -51.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) In addition to the radiated emission limits specified in the 
table in paragraph (c) of this section, UWB transmitters operating under 
the provisions of this section shall not exceed the following average 
limits when measured using a resolution bandwidth of no less than 1 kHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1164-1240............................................              -85.3
1559-1610............................................              -85.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) There is a limit on the peak level of the emissions contained 
within a 50 MHz bandwidth centered on the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>. That limit is 0 dBm EIRP. It is 
acceptable to employ a different resolution bandwidth, and a 
correspondingly different peak emission limit, following the procedures 
described in Sec. 15.521.
    (f) UWB systems operating under the provisions of this section shall 
bear the following or similar statement in a conspicuous location on the 
device or in the instruction manual supplied with the device:

    ``This equipment may only be operated indoors. Operation outdoors is 
in violation of 47 U.S.C. 301 and could subject the operator to serious 
legal penalties.''

<R05>
Sec. 15.519  Technical requirements for hand held UWB systems.

    (a) UWB devices operating under the provisions of this section must 
be hand held, i.e., they are relatively small devices that are primarily 
hand held while being operated and do not employ a fixed infrastructure.

[[Page 773]]

    (1) A UWB device operating under the provisions of this section 
shall transmit only when it is sending information to an associated 
receiver. The UWB intentional radiator shall cease transmission within 
10 seconds unless it receives an acknowledgement from the associated 
receiver that its transmission is being received. An acknowledgment of 
reception must continue to be received by the UWB intentional radiator 
at least every 10 seconds or the UWB device must cease transmitting.
    (2) The use of antennas mounted on outdoor structures, e.g., 
antennas mounted on the outside of a building or on a telephone pole, or 
any fixed outdoors infrastructure is prohibited. Antennas may be mounted 
only on the hand held UWB device.
    (3) UWB devices operating under the provisions of this section may 
operate indoors or outdoors.
    (b) The UWB bandwidth of a device operating under the provisions of 
this section must be contained between 3100 MHz and 10,600 MHz.
    (c) The radiated emissions at or below 960 MHz from a device 
operating under the provisions of this section shall not exceed the 
emission levels in Sec. 15.209. The radiated emissions above 960 MHz 
from a device operating under the provisions of this section shall not 
exceed the following average limits when measured using a resolution 
bandwidth of 1 MHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm
------------------------------------------------------------------------
960-1610.............................................              -75.3
1610-1990............................................              -63.3
1990-3100............................................              -61.3
3100-10600...........................................              -41.3
Above 10600..........................................              -61.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) In addition to the radiated emission limits specified in the 
table in paragraph (c) of this section, UWB transmitters operating under 
the provisions of this section shall not exceed the following average 
limits when measured using a resolution bandwidth of no less than 1 kHz:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Frequency in MHz                       EIRP in dBm
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1164-1240............................................              -85.3
1559-1610............................................              -85.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) There is a limit on the peak level of the emissions contained 
within a 50 MHz bandwidth centered on the frequency at which the highest 
radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>. That limit is 0 dBm EIRP. It is 
acceptable to employ a different resolution bandwidth, and a 
correspondingly different peak emission limit, following the procedures 
described in Sec. 15.521.

<R05>
Sec. 15.521  Technical requirements applicable to all UWB devices.

    (a) UWB devices may not be employed for the operation of toys. 
Operation onboard an aircraft, a ship or a satellite is prohibited.
    (b) Manufacturers and users are reminded of the provisions of 
Secs. 15.203 and 15.204.
    (c) Emissions from digital circuitry used to enable the operation of 
the UWB transmitter shall comply with the limits in Sec. 15.209, rather 
than the limits specified in this subpart, provided it can be clearly 
demonstrated that those emissions from the UWB device are due solely to 
emissions from digital circuitry contained within the transmitter and 
that the emissions are not intended to be radiated from the 
transmitter's antenna. Emissions from associated digital devices, as 
defined in Sec. 15.3(k), e.g., emissions from digital circuitry used to 
control additional functions or capabilities other than the UWB 
transmission, are subject to the limits contained in Subpart B of this 
part.
    (d) Within the tables in Sec. Sec. 15.509, 15.511, 15.513, 15.515, 
15.517, and 15.519, the tighter emission limit applies at the band 
edges. Radiated emission levels at and below 960 MHz are based on 
measurements employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector. Radiated emission 
levels above 960 MHz are based on RMS average measurements over a 1 MHz 
resolution bandwidth. The RMS average measurement is based on the use of 
a spectrum analyzer with a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz, an RMS 
detector, and a 1 millisecond or less averaging time. If pulse gating is 
employed where the transmitter is quiescent for intervals that are long 
compared to the nominal pulse repetition interval, measurements shall be 
made with the

[[Page 774]]

pulse train gated on. Alternative measurement procedures may be 
considered by the Commission.
    (e) The frequency at which the highest radiated emission occurs, 
f<INF>M</INF>, must be contained within the UWB bandwidth.
    (f) Imaging systems may be employed only for the type of information 
exchange described in their specific definitions contained in 
Sec. 15.503. The detection of tags or the transfer or data or voice 
information is not permitted under the standards for imaging systems.
    (g) When a peak measurement is required, it is acceptable to use a 
resolution bandwidth other than the 50 MHz specified in this subpart. 
This resolution bandwidth shall not be lower than 1 MHz or greater than 
50 MHz, and the measurement shall be centered on the frequency at which 
the highest radiated emission occurs, f<INF>M</INF>. If a resolution 
bandwidth other than 50 MHz is employed, the peak EIRP limit shall be 20 
log (RBW/50) dBm where RBW is the resolution bandwidth in megahertz that 
is employed. This may be converted to a peak field strength level at 3 
meters using E(dBuV/m) = P(dBm EIRP) + 95.2. If RBW is greater than 3 
MHz, the application for certification filed with the Commission must 
contain a detailed description of the test procedure, calibration of the 
test setup, and the instrumentation employed in the testing.
    (h) The highest frequency employed in Sec. 15.33 to determine the 
frequency range over which radiated measurements are made shall be based 
on the center frequency, f<INF>C</INF>, unless a higher frequency is 
generated within the UWB device. For measuring emission levels, the 
spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest frequency generated in 
the UWB transmitter, without going below 9 kHz, up to the frequency 
range shown in Sec. 15.33(a) or up to f<INF>C</INF> + 3/(pulse width in 
seconds), whichever is higher. There is no requirement to measure 
emissions beyond 40 GHz provided f<INF>C</INF> is less than 10 GHz; 
beyond 100 GHz if f<INF>C</INF> is at or above 10 GHz and below 30 GHz; 
or beyond 200 GHz if f<INF>C</INF> is at or above 30 GHz.
    (i) The prohibition in Sec. 2.201(f) and 15.5(d) of this chapter 
against Class B (damped wave) emissions does not apply to UWB devices 
operating under this subpart.
    (j) Responsible parties are reminded of the other standards and 
requirements cross referenced in Sec. 15.505, such as a limit on 
emissions conducted onto the AC power lines.

Sec. 15.523  Measurement procedures.

    Measurements shall be made in accordance with the procedures 
specified by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 15.525  Coordination requirements.

    (a) UWB imaging systems require coordination through the FCC before 
the equipment may be used. The operator shall comply with any 
constraints on equipment usage resulting from this coordination.
    (b) The users of UWB imaging devices shall supply operational areas 
to the FCC Office of Engineering and Technology, which shall coordinate 
this information with the Federal Government through the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration. The information 
provided by the UWB operator shall include the name, address and other 
pertinent contact information of the user, the desired geographical 
area(s) of operation, and the FCC ID number and other nomenclature of 
the UWB device. If the imaging device is intended to be used for mobile 
applications, the geographical area(s) of operation may be the state(s) 
or county(ies) in which the equipment will be operated. The operator of 
an imaging system used for fixed operation shall supply a specific 
geographical location or the address at which the equipment will be 
operated. This material shall be submitted to Frequency Coordination 
Branch, OET, Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW, 
Washington, D.C. 20554, Attn: UWB Coordination.
    (c) The manufacturers, or their authorized sales agents, must inform 
purchasers and users of their systems of the requirement to undertake 
detailed coordination of operational areas with the FCC prior to the 
equipment being operated.

[[Page 775]]

    (d) Users of authorized, coordinated UWB systems may transfer them 
to other qualified users and to different locations upon coordination of 
change of ownership or location to the FCC and coordination with 
existing authorized operations.
    (e) The FCC/NTIA coordination report shall identify those 
geographical areas within which the operation of an imaging system 
requires additional coordination or within which the operation of an 
imaging system is prohibited. If additional coordination is required for 
operation within specific geographical areas, a local coordination 
contact will be provided. Except for operation within these designated 
areas, once the information requested on the UWB imaging system is 
submitted to the FCC no additional coordination with the FCC is required 
provided the reported areas of operation do not change. If the area of 
operation changes, updated information shall be submitted to the FCC 
following the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) The coordination of routine UWB operations shall not take longer 
than 15 business days from the receipt of the coordination request by 
NTIA. Special temporary operations may be handled with an expedited 
turn-around time when circumstances warrant. The operation of UWB 
systems in emergency situations involving the safety of life or property 
may occur without coordination provided a notification procedure, 
similar to that contained in Sec. 2.405(a) through (e) of this chapter, 
is followed by the UWB equipment user.

Sec. 17.1  Basis and purpose.

    (a) The rules in this part are issued pursuant to the authority 
contained in Title III of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
which vest authority in the Federal Communications Commission to issue 
licenses to radio stations when it is found that the public interest, 
convenience, and necessity would be served thereby, and to require the 
painting, and/or illumination of antenna structures if and when in its 
judgment such structures constitute, or there is reasonable possibility 
that they may constitute, a menace to air navigation.
    (b) The purpose of this part is to prescribe certain procedures for 
antenna structure registration and standards with respect to the 
Commission's consideration of proposed antenna structures which will 
serve as a guide to antenna structure owners. The standards are 
referenced from two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory 
Circulars.

    (a) Antenna structure. The term antenna structure includes the 
radiating and/or receive system, its supporting structures and any 
appurtenances mounted thereon.
    (b) An antenna farm area is defined as a geographical location, with 
established boundaries, designated by the Federal Communications 
Commission, in which antenna towers with a common impact on aviation may 
be grouped.
    (c) Antenna structure owner. For the purposes of this part, an 
antenna structure owner is the individual or entity vested with 
ownership, equitable ownership, dominion, or title to the antenna 
structure. Notwithstanding any agreements made between the owner and any 
entity designated by the owner to maintain the antenna structure, the 
owner is ultimately responsible for compliance with the requirements of 
this part.
    (d) Antenna structure registration number. A unique number, issued 
by the Commission during the registration process, which identifies an 
antenna structure. Once obtained, this number must be used in all 
filings related to this structure.

<R05>
Sec. 17.4  Antenna structure registration.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1996, the owner of any proposed or existing 
antenna structure that requires notice of proposed construction to the 
Federal Aviation Administration must register the structure with the 
Commission. This includes those structures used as part of stations 
licensed by the Commission for the transmission of radio energy, or to 
be used as part of a cable television head end system. If a Federal 
Government antenna structure is to be used by a Commission licensee, the 
structure must be registered with the Commission.
    (1) For a proposed antenna structure or alteration of an existing 
antenna structure, the owner must register the structure prior to 
construction or alteration.
    (2) For an existing antenna structure that had been assigned 
painting or lighting requirements prior to July 1, 1996, the owner must 
register the structure prior to July 1, 1998.
    (3) For a structure that did not originally fall under the 
definition of ``antenna structure,'' the owner must register the 
structure prior to hosting a Commission licensee.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each owner 
must file FCC Form 854 with the Commission. Additionally, each owner of 
a proposed structure referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this 
section must submit a valid FAA determination of ``no hazard.'' In order 
to be considered valid by the Commission, the FAA determination of ``no 
hazard'' must not have expired prior to the date on which FCC Form 854 
is received by the Commission. The height of the structure will include 
the highest point of the structure including any obstruction lighting or 
lighting arrester.

[[Page 777]]

    (c) If an Environmental Assessment is required under Sec. 1.1307 of 
this chapter, the Bureau will address the environmental concerns prior 
to processing the registration.
    (d) If a final FAA determination of ``no hazard'' is not submitted 
along with FCC Form 854, processing of the registration may be delayed 
or disapproved.
    (e) If the owner of the antenna structure cannot file FCC Form 854 
because it is subject to a denial of Federal benefits under the Anti-
Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. 862, the first tenant licensee 
authorized to locate on the structure (excluding tenants that no longer 
occupy the structure) must register the structure using FCC Form 854, 
and provide a copy of the Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form 854R) 
to the owner. The owner remains responsible for providing a copy of FCC 
Form 854R to all tenant licensees on the structure and for posting the 
registration number as required by paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) The Commission shall issue, to the registrant, FCC Form 854R, 
Antenna Structure Registration, which assigns a unique Antenna Structure 
Registration Number. The structure owner shall immediately provide a 
copy of Form 854R to each tenant licensee and permittee.
    (g) Except as described in paragraph (h) of this section, the 
Antenna Structure Registration Number must be displayed in a conspicuous 
place so that it is readily visible near the base of the antenna

<R05>
Sec. 17.8  Establishment of antenna farm areas.

    (a) Each antenna farm area will be established by an appropriate 
rulemaking proceeding, which may be commenced by the Commission on its 
own motion after consultation with the FAA, upon request of the FAA, or 
as a result of a petition filed by any interested person. After receipt 
of a petition from an interested person disclosing sufficient reasons to 
justify institution of a rulemaking proceeding, the Commission will 
request the advice of the FAA with respect to the considerations of 
menace to air navigation in terms of air safety which may be presented 
by the proposal. The written communication received from the FAA in 
response to the Commission's request shall be placed in the Commission's 
public rulemaking file containing the petition, and interested persons 
shall be allowed a period of 30 days within which to file statements 
with respect thereto.

[[Page 779]]

Suchstatements shall also be filed with the Administrator of the FAA 
with proof of such filing to be established in accordance with Sec. 1.47 
of this chapter. The Administrator of the FAA shall have a period of 15 
days within which to file responses to such statements. If the 
Commission, upon consideration of the matters presented to it in 
accordance with the above procedure, is satisfied that establishment of 
the proposed antenna farm would constitute a menace to air navigation 
for reasons of air safety, rulemaking proceedings will not be 
instituted. If rulemaking proceedings are instituted, any person filing 
comments therein which concern the question of whether the proposed 
antenna farm will constitute a menace to air navigation shall file a 
copy of the comments with the Administrator of the FAA. Proof of such 
filing shall be established in accordance with Sec. 1.47 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to mean that only one 
antenna farm area will be designated for a community. The Commission 
will consider on a case-by-case basis whether or not more than one 
antenna farm area shall be designated for a particular community.

Sec. 17.14  Certain antenna structures exempt from notification to the FAA.

    A notification to the Federal Aviation Administration is not 
required for any of the following construction or alteration:
    (a) Any object that would be shielded by existing structures of a 
permanent and substantial character or by natural terrain or topographic 
features of equal or greater height, and would be located in the 
congested area of a city, town, or settlement where it is evident beyond 
all reasonable doubt that the structure so shielded will not adversely 
affect safety in air navigation. Applicant claiming such exemption under 
Sec. 17.14(a) shall submit a statement with their application to the FCC 
explaining basis in detail for their finding.
    (b) Any antenna structure of 6.10 meters (20 feet) or less in height

significantly regulated by the Commission under that Act. In addition, 
the Commissioners are prohibited by section 4(b) of the Communications 
Act, at 47 U.S.C. 154(b)(4), from engaging in any other business, 
vocation, profession, or employment.

    Note: Under the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Federal Communications Commission, at 5 CFR 3901.102, 
professional employees of the Commission must obtain approval before 
engaging in the private practice of the same profession as that of the

communications, manufacturing, or sales activities which are subject to 
regulation by the Commission.

    (2) To determine whether an entity has a significant interest in 
communications related activities that are subject to Commission 
regulations, the Commission shall consider, without excluding other 
relevant factors, the criteria in section 4(b) of the Communications 
Act, at 47 U.S.C. 154(b)(3). These criteria include:

    The Commission shall have authority to waive, from time to time, the 
application of the prohibitions established in subparagraph (A) of 
section 4(b) to persons employed by the Commission if the Commission 
determines that the financial interests of a person which are involved 
in a particular case are minimal, except that such waiver authority 
shall be subject to the provisions of section 208 of title 18, United 
States Code. The waiver authority established in this subparagraph shall 
not apply with respect to members of the Commission.

    (ii)(A) Requests for waiver of the provisions of 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(A) may be submitted by an employee to the Head of the 
employee's Office or Bureau, who will endorse the request with an 
appropriate recommendation and forward the request to the Designated 
Agency Ethics Official. The Designated Agency Ethics Official has 
delegated authority to waive the applicability of 47 U.S.C. 
154(b)(2)(A).
    (B) All requests for waiver shall be in writing and in the required 
detail. The dollar value for the financial interest sought to be waived 
shall be expressed explicitly or in categories of value provided at 5 
CFR 2634.301(d).

be maintained by the Designated Agency Ethics Official. In any case in 
which the Commission exercises the waiver authority established in 
section 4(b) of the Communications Act, the Commission shall publish 
notice of such action in the Federal Register and shall furnish notice 
of such action to the appropriate committees of each House of the

[[Page 794]]

Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b); or
    (2) Actions or decisions made by the Commission at closed meetings 
or by circulation prior to the public release of such information by the 
Commission.
    (b) An employee engaged in outside teaching, lecturing, or writing 
shall not use nonpublic information obtained as a result of his 
Government employment in connection with such teaching, lecturing, or 
writing except when the Chairman gives written authorization for the use 
of that nonpublic information on the basis that its use is in the public 
interest.
    (c) This section does not prohibit the disclosure of an official 
Commissionmeeting agenda listing titles and summaries of items for

prohibit the disclosure of information about the scheduling of 
Commission agenda items.
    (d) Any person regulated by or practicing before the Commission 
coming into possession of written nonpublic information (including 
written material transmitted in electronic form) as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section under circumstances where it appears that 
its release was inadvertent or otherwise unauthorized shall promptly 
return the written information to the Commission's Office of the 
Inspector General without further distribution or use of the written 
nonpublic information. Any person regulated by or practicing before the 
Commission who willfully violates this section by failing to promptly 
notify the Commission's Office of the Inspector General of the receipt 
of written nonpublic information (including written material transmitted 
in electronic form) that he knew or should have known was released 
inadvertently or in any otherwise unauthorized manner may be subject to 
appropriate sanctions by the Commission. In the case of attorneys 
practicing before the Commission, such sanctions may include 
disciplinary action under the provisions of Sec. 1.24 of this chapter.

    Note: Employees also should refer to the provisions of the Standards 
of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, at 5 CFR 
2635.703, on the use of nonpublic information.Additionally, employees 
should refer to Sec. 19.735-107 of this part, which provides that 
employees of the Commission who violate this part may be subject to 
disciplinary action which may be in addition to any other penalty 
prescribed by law. As is the case with section 2635.703, this part is 
intended only to cover knowing unauthorized disclosures of nonpublic 
information.
