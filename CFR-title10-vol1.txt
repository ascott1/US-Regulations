                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 0.735-1  Cross-reference to employee ethical conduct standards and financial disclosure regulations.

    Employees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) are subject to 
the executive branch-wide Standards of Ethical Conduct at 5 CFR part 
2635, the NRC regulation at 5 CFR part 5801 which supplements the 
executive branch-wide standards, and the executive branch-wide financial 
disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634.

[59 FR 17460, Apr. 13, 1994]


<R04>
              Subpart B--Conflict of Interest Restrictions


<R05>
Sec. 0.735-2  Exemptions for financial interests.

    (a) Exemption of remote or inconsequential financial interests. (1) 
In accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2), the NRC has 
exempted the following financial interests from 18 U.S.C. 208(a) upon 
the ground that such interests are too remote or too inconsequential to 
affect the integrity of its employees' services:
    (i) Financial interests in an enterprise in the form of shares in 
the ownership thereof, including preferred and common stocks whether 
voting or nonvoting, and warrants to purchase such shares;
    (ii) Financial interests in an enterprise in the form of bonds, 
notes, or other evidence of indebtedness;
    (iii) Investments in State or local government bonds and investments 
in shares of a widely held diversified mutual fund or regulated 
investment company, except holdings in mutual investment funds or 
regulated investment companies dealing primarily in atomic energy 
stocks; Provided, That in the case of paragraph (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of 
this section:
    (A) The total market value of the financial interests described in 
said subdivisions with respect to any individual enterprise does not 
exceed $1000; and
    (B) The holdings in any class of shares, or bonds, or other 
evidences of indebtedness, of the enterprise do not exceed 1 percent of 
the dollar value of the outstanding shares, or bonds or other evidences 
of indebtedness in said class.
    (2) Where a person covered by this exemption is a member of a group 
organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities, the 
interest of such person in any enterprise in which the group holds 
securities shall be based upon said person's equity share of the 
holdings of the group in that enterprise.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, computations 
of dollar value of financial interests in corporations shall be by means 
of:
    (i) Market value in the case of stocks listed on national exchanges; 
or
    (ii) Over-the-counter market quotations as reported by the National 
Daily Quotation Service in the case of unlisted stocks; or
    (iii) By means of net book value (i.e. assets less liabilities) in 
the case of stocks not covered by the preceding two categories. With 
respect to debt securities, face value shall be used for valuation 
purposes.

[[Page 6]]

    (4) The dollar value and percentage of financial interests listed 
above in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be computed as of the 
date on which the employee first participated personally and 
substantially in any particular matter, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 
208(a), relating to the enterprise concerned. The dollar value and 
percentage so computed shall govern during the entire period that the 
employee participates in the particular matter unless, after the date of 
computation, the employee, or other person or organization referred to 
in paragraph (a) of this section acquires an additional interest in the 
same enterprise. In the event of such subsequent acquisition, the dollar 
value and percentage shall be recomputed as of the date of the 
subsequent acquisition. If, as a result of the subsequent acquisition, 
the dollar value and percentage computed exceeds the limitations 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the general exemption 
provided therein shall no longer be applicable and an ad hoc exemption 
must be sought in accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1).
    (b) Special exemption for special Government employees. Federal 
Personnel Manual Chapter 735, Appendix C provides that a special 
Government employee should in general be disqualified from participating 
as such in a matter of any type the outcome of which will have a direct 
and predictable effect upon the financial interests covered by 18 U.S.C. 
208. However, that chapter states that the power of exemption may be 
exercised in this situation ``if the special Government employee renders 
advice of a general nature from which no preference or advantage over 
others might be gained by any particular person or organization.'' It is 
the policy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in conformity with the 
foregoing to exercise the power of exemption pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
208(b) in such situations.

                         Subpart A--Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 1.1   Creation and authority.

    (a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was established by the Energy 
Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, Pub. L. 93-438, 88 Stat. 1233 
(42 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.). This Act abolished the Atomic Energy 
Commission and, by section 201, transferred to the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission all the licensing and related regulatory functions assigned 
to the Atomic Energy Commission by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, Pub. L. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.). These 
functions included those of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel. 
The Energy Reorganization Act became effective January 19, 1975 (E.O. 
11834).
    (b) As used in this part:
    Commission means the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission or a quorum thereof sitting as a body, as provided by section 
201 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended.
    NRC means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the agency established 
by title II of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, 
comprising the members of the Commission and all offices, employees, and 
representatives authorized to act in any case or matter.

Subpart A--Procedure for Issuance, Amendment, Transfer, or Renewal of a 
                                 License


<R05>
Sec. 2.100   Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the procedures for issuance of a license; 
amendment of a license at the request of the licensee; and transfer and 
renewal of a license.


<R05>
Sec. 2.101   Filing of application.

    (a)(1) An application for a license or an amendment to a license 
shall be filed with the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or 
Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as prescribed by the 
applicable provisions of this chapter. A prospective applicant may 
confer informally with the staff prior to the filing of an application.
    (2) Each application for a license for a facility or for receipt of 
waste radioactive material from other persons for the purpose of 
commercial disposal by the waste disposal licensee will be assigned a 
docket number. However, to allow a determination as to whether an 
application for a construction permit or operating license for a 
production or utilization facility is complete and acceptable for 
docketing, it will be initially treated as a tendered application after 
it is received and a copy of the tendered application will be available 
for public inspection in the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L 
Street, NW., Washington, DC. Generally, that determination will be made 
within a period of thirty (30) days. However, in selected construction 
permit applications, the Commission may decide to determine 
acceptability on the basis of the technical adequacy of the application 
as well as its completeness. In such cases, the Commission, pursuant to 
Sec. 2.104(a), will direct that the notice of hearing be issued as soon 
as practicable after the application has been tendered, and the 
determination of acceptability will generally be made within a period of 
sixty (60) days. For docketing and other requirements for applications 
pursuant to part 61 of this chapter, see paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) If the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, determines that 
a tendered application for a construction permit or operating license 
for a production or utilization facility, and/or any environmental 
report required pursuant to subpart A of part 51 of this chapter, or 
part thereof as provided in paragraphs (a)(5) or (a-1) of this section 
are complete and acceptable for docketing, a docket number will be 
assigned to the

[[Page 25]]

application or part thereof, and the applicant will be notified of the 
determination. With respect to the tendered application and/or 
environmental report or part thereof that is acceptable for docketing, 
the applicant will be requested to:
    (i) Submit to the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director 
of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, such 
additional copies as the regulations in part 50 and subpart A of part 51 
require;
    (ii) Serve a copy on the chief executive of the municipality in 
which the facility is to be located or, if the facility is not to be 
located within a municipality, on the chief executive of the county, and 
serve a notice of availability of the application or environmental 
report on the chief executives of the municipalities or counties which 
have been identified in the application or environmental report as the 
location of all or part of the alternative sites, containing the 
following information: Docket number of the application, a brief 
description of the proposed site and facility; the location of the site 
and facility as primarily proposed and alternatively listed; the name, 
address, and telephone number of the applicant's representative who may 
be contacted for further information; notification that a draft 
environmental impact statement will be issued by the Commission and will 
be made available upon request to the Commission; and notification that 
if a request is received from the appropriate chief executive, the 
applicant will transmit a copy of the application and environmental 
report, and any changes to such documents which affect the alternative 
site location, to the executive who makes the request. In complying with 
the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii) the applicant should not 
make public distribution of those parts of the application subject to 
Sec. 2.790(d). The applicant shall submit to the Director of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation an affidavit that service of the notice of 
availability of the application or environmental report has been 
completed along with a list of names and addresses of those executives 
upon whom the notice was served; and
    (iii) Make direct distribution of additional copies to Federal, 
State, and local officials in accordance with the requirements of this 
chapter and written instructions furnished to the applicant by the 
Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate. Such written instructions will be 
furnished as soon as practicable after all or any part of the 
application, or environmental report, is tendered. The copies submitted 
to the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear 
Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, and distributed by the 
applicant shall be completely assembled documents, identified by docket 
number. Subsequently distributed amendments to applications, however, 
may include revised pages to previous submittals and, in such cases, the 
recipients will be responsible for inserting the revised pages.
    (4) The tendered application for a construction permit or operating 
license for a production or utilization facility will be formally 
docketed upon receipt by the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or 
Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, of 
the required additional copies. Distribution of the additional copies 
shall be deemed to be complete as of the time the copies are deposited 
in the mail or with a carrier prepaid for delivery to the designated 
addresses. The date of docketing shall be the date when the required 
copies are received by the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or 
Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate. 
Within ten (10) days after docketing the applicant shall submit to the 
Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, an affidavit that distribution of 
the additional copies to Federal, State, and local officials has been 
completed in accordance with requirements of this chapter and written 
instructions furnished to the applicant by the Director of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material Safety and 
Safeguards, as appropriate. Amendments to the application and 
environmental report shall be filed and

[[Page 26]]

distributed and an affidavit shall be furnished to the Director of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material Safety and 
Safeguards, as appropriate, in the same manner as for the initial 
application and environmental report. If it is determined that all or 
any part of the tendered application and/or environmental report is 
incomplete and therefore not acceptable for processing, the applicant 
will be informed of this determination, and the respects in which the 
document is deficient.
    (5) An applicant for a construction permit for a production or 
utilization facility which is subject to Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter, 
and is of the type specified in Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 
of this chapter or is a testing facility may submit the information 
required of applicants by part 50 of the chapter in three parts. One 
part shall be accompanied by the information required by Sec. 50.30(f) 
of this chapter, another part shall include any information required by 
Sec. 50.34(a) and, if applicable, Sec. 50.34a of this chapter and a 
third part shall include any information required by Sec. 50.33a. One 
part may precede or follow other parts by no longer than six (6) months 
except that the part including information required by Sec. 50.33a shall 
be submitted in accordance with time periods specified in Sec. 50.33a. 
If an applicant for a construction permit for a nuclear power reactor is 
exempted pursuant to Sec. 50.33a of this chapter from filing the 
information described by Sec. 50.33a of this chapter, such applicant 
shall file with the first part of its application an affidavit setting 
forth facts as to the electrical generating capacity of its system. If 
it is determined that any one of the parts as described above is 
incomplete and not acceptable for processing, the Director of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material Safety and 
Safeguards, as appropriate, will inform the applicant of this 
determination and the respects in which the document is deficient. Such 
a determination of completeness will generally be made within a period 
of thirty (30) days. Except for the part including information required 
by Sec. 50.33a, whichever part is filed first shall also include the fee 
required by Secs. 50.30(e) and 170.21 of this chapter and the 
information required by Secs. 50.33, 50.34((a)(1), and 50.37 of this 
chapter. The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, will accept for 
docketing an application for a construction permit for a production or 
utilization facility which is subject to Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter, 
and is of the type specified in Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 
of this chapter or is a testing facility where one part of the 
application as described above is complete and conforms to the 
requirements of part 50 of this chapter. Additional parts will be 
docketed upon a determination by the Director of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as 
appropriate, that they are complete.
    (a-1) Early consideration of site suitability issues. An applicant 
for a construction permit for a utilization facility which is subject to 
Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter and is of the type specified in 
Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 of this chapter or is a testing 
facility, may request that the Commission conduct an early review and

subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission a written notice of 
violation; a separate notice may be omitted if an order pursuant to 
Sec. 2.202 or demand for information pursuant to Sec. 2.204 is issued 
that otherwise identifies the apparent violation. The notice of 
violation will concisely state the alleged violation and may require 
that the licensee or other person submit, within 20 days of the date of 
the notice or other specified time, a written explanation or statement 
in reply if the Commission believes that the licensee has not already 
addressed all the issues contained in the notice of violation, 
including:
    (1) Corrective steps which have been taken by the licensee or other 
person and the results achieved;
    (2) Corrective steps which will be taken; and
    (3) The date when full compliance will be achieved.
    (b) The notice may require the licensee or other person subject to 
the jurisdiction of the Commission to admit or deny the violation and to 
state the reasons for the violation, if admitted. It may provide that, 
if an adequate reply is not received within the time specified in the 
notice, the Commission may issue an order or a demand for information as 
to why the license should not be modified, suspended or revoked or why 
such other action as may be proper should not be taken.

Sec. 2.202   Orders.

    (a) The Commission may institute a proceeding to modify, suspend, or 
revoke a license or to take such other action as may be proper by 
serving on the licensee or other person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Commission an order that will:
    (1) Allege the violations with which the licensee or other person 
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction is charged, or the potentially 
hazardous conditions or other facts deemed to be sufficient ground for 
the proposed action, and specify the action proposed;
    (2) Provide that the licensee or other person must file a written 
answer to the order under oath or affirmation within twenty (20) days of 
its date, or such other time as may be specified in the order;
    (3) Inform the licensee or any other person adversely affected by 
the order of his or her right, within twenty (20) days of the date of 
the order, or such other time as may be specified in the order, to 
demand a hearing on all or part of the order, except in a case where the 
licensee or other person has consented in writing to the order;
    (4) Specify the issues for hearing; and
    (5) State the effective date of the order; if the Commission finds 
that the public health, safety, or interest so requires or that the 
violation or conduct causing the violation is willful, the order may 
provide, for stated reasons, that the proposed action be immediately 
effective pending further order.

[[Page 40]]

    (b) A licensee or other person to whom the Commission has issued an 
order under this section must respond to the order by filing a written 
answer under oath or affirmation. The answer shall specifically admit or 
deny each allegation or charge made in the order, and shall set forth 
the matters of fact and law on which the licensee or other person 
relies, and, if the order is not consented to, the reasons as to why the 
order should not have been issued. Except as provided in paragraph (d) 
of this section, the answer may demand a hearing.
    (c) If the answer demands a hearing, the Commission will issue an 
order designating the time and place of hearing.
    (1) If the answer demands a hearing with respect to an immediately 
effective order, the hearing will be conducted expeditiously, giving due 
consideration to the rights of the parties.
    (2) (i) The licensee or other person to whom the Commission has 
issued an immediately effective order may, in addition to demanding a 
hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding 
officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the order on the 
ground that the order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, 
is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded 
allegations, or error. The motion must state with particularity the 
reasons why the order is not based on adequate evidence and must be 
accompanied by affidavits or other evidence relied on. The NRC staff 
shall respond within (5) days of the receipt of the motion. The motion 
must be decided by the presiding officer expeditiously. During the 
pendency of the motion or at any other time, the presiding officer may 
not stay the immediate effectiveness of the order, either on its own 
motion, or upon motion of the licensee or other person. The presiding 
officer will uphold the immediate effectiveness of the order if it finds 
that there is adequate evidence to support immediate effectiveness. An 
order upholding immediate effectiveness will constitute the final agency 
action on immediate effectiveness. An order setting aside immediate 
effectiveness will be referred promptly to the Commission itself and 
will not be effective pending further order of the Commission.
    (ii) The presiding officer may, on motion by the staff or any other 
party to the proceeding, where good cause exists, delay the hearing on 
the immediately effective order at any time for such periods as are 
consistent with the due process rights of the licensee and other 
affected parties.
    (d) An answer may consent to the entry of an order in substantially 
the form proposed in the order with respect to all or some of the 
actions proposed in the order. The consent, in the answer or other 
written document, of the licensee or other person to whom the order has 
been issued to the entry of an order shall constitute a waiver by the 
licensee or other person of a hearing, findings of fact and conclusions 
of law, and of all right to seek Commission and judicial review or to 
contest the validity of the order in any forum as to those matters which 
have been consented to or agreed to or on which a hearing has not been 
requested. An order that has been consented to shall have the same force 
and effect as an order made after hearing by a presiding officer or the 
Commission, and shall be effective as provided in the order.
    (e) If the order involves the modification of a part 50 license and 
is a backfit, the requirements of Sec. 50.109 of this chapter shall be 
followed, unless the licensee has consented to the action required.

Sec. 2.204  Demand for information.

    (a) The Commission may issue to a licensee or other person subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Commission a demand for information for the 
purpose of determining whether an order under Sec. 2.202 should be 
issued, or whether other action should be taken, which demand will:
    (1) Allege the violations with which the licensee or other person is 
charged, or the potentially hazardous conditions or other facts deemed 
to be sufficient ground for issuing the demand; and
    (2) Provide that the licensee must, or the other person may, file a 
written answer to the demand for information under oath or affirmation 
within twenty (20) days of its date, or such other time as may be 
specified in the demand for information.
    (b) A licensee to whom the Commission has issued a demand for 
information under this section must respond to the demand by filing a 
written answer under oath or affirmation; any other person to whom the 
Commission has issued a demand for information may, in its discretion, 
respond to the demand by filing a written answer under oath or 
affirmation. The licensee's answer shall specifically admit or deny each 
allegation or charge made in the demand for information, and shall set 
forth the matters of fact and law on which the licensee relies. A person 
other than a licensee may answer as described above, or by setting forth 
its reasons why the demand should not have been issued and, if the 
requested information is not provided, the reasons why it is not 
provided.
    (c) Upon review of the answer filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, or if no answer is filed, the Commission may institute a 
proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 to take such action as may be 
proper.
    (d) An answer may consent to the entry of an order pursuant to 
Sec. 2.202 in substantially the form proposed in the demand for 
information. Such consent shall constitute a waiver as provided in 
Sec. 2.202(d).

or dates, facts, and the nature of the alleged act or omission with 
which the person is charged, and shall indentify specifically the 
particular provision or provisions of the law, rule, regulation, 
license, permit, or cease and desist order involved in the alleged 
violation and must state the amount of each proposed penalty. The notice 
of violation shall also advise the person charged that the civil penalty 
may be paid in the amount specified therein, or the proposed imposition 
of the civil penalty may be protested in its entirety or in part, by a 
written answer, either denying the violation or showing extenuating 
circumstances. The notice of violation shall advise the person charged 
that upon failure to pay a civil penalty subsequently determined by the 
Commission, if any, unless compromised, remitted, or mitigated, be 
collected by civil action, pursuant to section 234c of the Act.
    (b) Within twenty (20) days of the date of a notice of violation or 
other time specified in the notice, the person charged may either pay 
the penalty in the amount proposed or answer the notice of violation. 
The answer to the notice of violation shall state any facts, 
explanations, and arguments, denying the charges of violation, or 
demonstrating any extenuating circumstances, error in the notice of 
violation, or other reason why the penalty should not be imposed and may 
request remission or mitigation of the penalty.
    (c) If the person charged with violation fails to answer within the 
time

[[Page 42]]

specified in paragraph (b) of this section, an order may be issued 
imposing the civil penalty in the amount set forth in the notice of 
violation described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) If the person charged with violation files an answer to the 
notice of violation, the Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials 
Safety, Safeguards, and Operations Support, or the Deputy's designee, 
upon consideration of the answer, will issue an order dismissing the 
proceeding or imposing, mitigating, or remitting the civil penalty. The 
person charged may, within twenty (20) days of the date of the order or 
other time specified in the order, request a hearing.
    (e) If the person charged with violation requests a hearing, the 
Commission will issue an order designating the time and place of 
hearing.
    (f) If a hearing is held, an order will be issued after the hearing 
by the presiding officer or the Commission dismissing the proceeding or 
imposing, mitigating, or remitting the civil penalty.
    (g) The Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials Safety, 
Safeguards, and Operations Support, or the Deputy's designee, as 
appropriate may compromise any civil penalty, subject to the provisions 
of Sec. 2.203.
    (h) If the civil penalty is not compromised, or is not remitted by 
the Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials Safety, Safeguards, 
and Operations Support, or the Deputy's designee, as appropriate, the 
presiding officer, or the Commission, and if payment is not made within 
ten (10) days following either the service of the order described in 
paragraph (c) or (f) of this section, or the expiration of the time for 
requesting a hearing described in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials Safety, Safeguards, and 
Operations Support, or the Deputy's designee, as appropriate, may refer 
the matter to the Attorney General for collection.
    (i) Except when payment is made after compromise or mitigation by 
the Department of Justice or as ordered by a court of the United States, 
following reference of the matter to the Attorney General for 
collection, payment of civil penalties imposed under section 234 of the 
Act shall be made by check, draft, or money order payable to the 
Treasurer of the United States, and mailed to the Director, Office of 
Enforcement.
    (j) Amount. A civil monetary penalty imposed under Section 234 of 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or any other statute within 
the jurisdiction of the Commission that provides for imposition of a 
civil penalty in an amount equal to the amount set forth in Section 234, 
may not exceed $110,000 for each violation. If any violation is a 
continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate 
violation for the purpose of computing the applicable civil penalty.

Sec. 2.604  Notice of hearing on application for early review of site suitability issues.

    (a) Where an applicant for a construction permit for a utilization 
facility subject to this subpart requests an early review and hearing 
and an early partial decision on issues of site suitability pursuant to 
Sec. 2.101(a-1), the provisions in the notice of hearing setting forth 
the matters of fact and law to be considered, as required by Sec. 2.104, 
shall be modified so as to relate only to the site suitability issue or 
issues under review.
    (b) After docketing of part two of the application, as provided in 
Secs. 2.101(a-1) and 2.603, a supplementary notice of hearing will be 
published pursuant to Sec. 2.104 with respect to the remaining 
unresolved issues in the proceeding within the scope of Sec. 2.104. Such 
supplementary notice of hearing will provide that any person whose 
interest may be

[[Page 48]]

affected by the proceeding and who desires to participate as a party in 
the resolution of the remaining issues shall file a petition for leave 
to intervene pursuant to Sec. 2.714 within the time prescribed in the 
notice. Such supplementary notice will also provide appropriate 
opportunities for participation by a representative of an interested 
state under Sec. 2.715(c) and for limited appearances pursuant to 
Sec. 2.715(a).
    (c) Any person who was permitted to intervene as a party pursuant to 
the initial notice of hearing on site suitability issues and who was not 
dismissed or did not withdraw as a party may continue to participate as 
a party to the proceeding with respect to the remaining unresolved 
issues, provided that within the time prescribed for filing of petitions 
for leave to intervene in the supplementary notice of hearing, he files 
a notice of his intent to continue as a party, along with a supporting 
affidavit identifying the specific aspect or aspects of the subject 
matter of the proceeding as to which he wishes to continue to 
participate as a party and setting forth with particularity the basis 
for his contentions with regard to each such aspect or aspects. A party 
who files a non-timely notice of intent to continue as a party may be 
dismissed from the proceeding, absent a determination that the party has 
made a substantial showing of good cause for failure to file on time, 
and with particular reference to the factors specified in Secs. 2.714(a) 
(1) through (4) and 2.714(d). The notice will be ruled upon by the 
Commission or atomic safety and licensing board designated to rule on 
petitions for leave to intervene.
    (d) To the maximum extent practicable, the membership of the atomic 
safety and licensing board designated to preside in the proceeding on 
the remaining unresolved issues pursuant to the supplemental notice of 
hearing will be the same as the membership designated to preside in the 
initial notice of hearing on site suitability issues.


<R05>
Sec. 2.605  Additional considerations.

    (a) The Commission will not conduct more than one review of site 
suitability issues with regard to a particular site prior to filing and 
review of part two of the application described in Sec. 2.101(a-1) of 
this part.
    (b) The Commission, upon its own initiative, or upon the motion of 
any party to the proceeding filed at least sixty (60) days prior to the 
date of the commencement of the evidentiary hearing on site suitability 
issues, may decline to initiate an early hearing or render an early 
partial decision on any issue or issues of site suitability:
    (1) In cases where no partial decision on the relative merits of the 
proposed site and alternative sites under subpart A of part 51 is 
requested, upon determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that 
further review would identify one or more preferable alternative sites 
and the partial decision on one or more site suitability issues would 
lead to an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources prior 
to the submittal of the remainder of the information required by 
Sec. 50.30(f) of this chapter that would prejudice the later review and 
decision on such alternative sites; or
    (2) In cases where it appears that an early partial decision on any 
issue or issues of site suitability would not be in the public interest 
considering (i) the degree of likelihood that any early findings on 
those issues would retain their validity in later reviews, (ii) the 
objections, if any, of cognizant state or local government agencies to 
the conduct of an early review on those issues, and (iii) the possible 
effect on the public interest and the parties of having an early, if not 
necessarily conclusive, resolution of those issues.

<R05>
Sec. 2.606  Partial decisions on site suitability issues.

    (a) The provisions of Secs. 2.754, 2.755, 2.760, 2.761, 2.762, 
2.763, and 2.764(a) shall apply to any partial initial decision rendered 
in accordance with this subpart. Section 2.764(b) shall not apply to any 
partial initial decision rendered in accordance with this subpart. No 
limited work authorization may be issued pursuant to Sec. 50.10(e) of 
part 50 of this chapter and no construction permit may be issued without 
completion of the full review required by section 102(2) of the National 
Environmental

[[Page 49]]

Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and subpart A of part 51 of this 
chapter. The authority of the Commission to review such a partial 
initial decision sua sponte, or to raise sua sponte an issue that has 
not been raised by the parties, will be exercised within the same time 
period as in the case of a full decision relating to the issuance of a 
construction permit.
    (b)(1) A partial decision on one or more site suitability issues 
pursuant to the applicable provisions of part 50, subpart A of part 51, 
and part 100 of this chapter issued in accordance with this subpart 
shall (i) clearly identify the site to which the partial decision 
applies and (ii) indicate to what extent additional information may be 
needed and additional review may be required to enable the Commission to 
determine in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the 
applicable provisions of the regulations in this chapter whether a 
construction permit for a facility to be located on the site identified 
in the partial decision should be issued or denied.
    (2) Following completion of Commission review of the partial initial 
decision of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, after hearing, on the 
site suitability issues, the partial decision shall remain in effect 
either for a period of five years or, where the applicant for the 
construction permit has made timely submittal of the information 
required to support the application as provided in Sec. 2.101(a-1), 
until the proceeding for a permit to construct a facility on the site 
identified in the partial decision has been concluded, <SUP>3 unless the 
Commission or Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, upon its own initiative 
or upon motion by a party to the proceeding, finds that there exists 
significant new information that substantially affects the earlier 
conclusions and reopens the hearing record on site suitability issues. 
Upon good cause shown, the Commission may extend the five year period 
during which a partial decision shall remain in effect for a reasonable 
period of time not to exceed one year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>3 The partial decision on site suitability issues shall be 
incorporated in the decision regarding issuance of a construction permit 
to the extent that it serves as a basis for the decision on a specific 
site issue(s).

    (a) Standards of practice. In the exercise of their functions under 
this subpart, the Commission, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards, 
and Administrative Law Judges function in a quasijudicial capacity. 
Accordingly, parties and their representatives in proceedings subject to 
this subpart are expected to conduct themselves with honor, dignity, and 
decorum as they should before a court of law.

[[Page 54]]

    (b) Representation. A person may appear in an adjudication on his or 
her own behalf or by an attorney-at-law. A partnership, corporation or 
unincorporated association may be represented by a duly authorized 
member or officer, or by an attorney-at-law. A party may be represented 
by an attorney-at-law provided the attorney is in good standing and has 
been admitted to practice before any Court of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, or the highest court of any State, territory, or 
possession of the United States. Any person appearing in a 
representative capacity shall file with the Commission a written notice 
of appearance which shall state his or her name, address, and telephone 
number; the name and address of the person on whose behalf he or she 
appears; and, in the case of an attorney-at-law, the basis of his or her 
eligibility as a representative or, in the case of another 
representative, the basis of his or her authority to act on behalf of 
the party.
    (c) Reprimand, censure or suspension from the proceeding. (1) A 
presiding officer or the Commission may, if necessary for the orderly 
conduct of a proceeding, reprimand, censure or suspend from 
participation in the particular proceeding pending before it any party 
or representative of a party who shall refuse to comply with its 
directions, or who shall be guilty of disorderly, disruptive, or 
contemptuous conduct.
    (2) A reprimand, a censure or a suspension which is ordered to run 
for one day or less shall be ordered with grounds stated on the record 
of the proceeding and shall advise the person disciplined of the right 
to appeal pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A suspension 
which is ordered for a longer period shall be in writing, shall state 
the grounds on which it is based, and shall advise the person suspended 
of the right to appeal and to request a stay pursuant to paragraphs 
(c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. A proceeding may be stayed for a 
reasonable time in order for an affected party to obtain other 
representation if this would be necessary to prevent injustice.
    (3) Anyone disciplined pursuant to this section may within ten (10) 
days after issuance of the order file an appeal with the Commission. The 
appeal shall be in writing and state concisely, with supporting 
argument, why the appellant believes the order was erroneous, either as 
a matter of fact or law. The Commission shall consider each appeal on 
the merits, including appeals in cases in which the suspension period 
has already run. If necessary for a full and fair consideration of the 
facts, the Commission may conduct further evidentiary hearings, or may 
refer the matter to another presiding officer for development of a 
record. In the latter event, unless the Commission provides specific 
directions to the presiding officer, that officer shall determine the 
procedure to be followed and who shall present evidence, subject to 
applicable provisions of law. Such hearing shall commence as soon as 
possible. In the case of an attorney, if no appeal is taken of a 
suspension, or, if the suspension is upheld at the conclusion of the 
appeal, the presiding officer, or the Commission, as appropriate, shall 
notify the state bar(s) to which the attorney is admitted. Such 
notification shall include copies of the order of suspension, and, if an 
appeal was taken, briefs of the parties, and the decision of the 
Commission.
    (4) A suspension exceeding 1 day shall not be effective for 72 hours 
from the date the suspension order is issued. Within this time a 
suspended individual may request a stay of the sanction from the 
appropriate reviewing tribunal pending appeal. No responses to the stay 
request from other parties will be entertained. If a timely stay request 
is filed, the suspension shall be stayed until the reviewing tribunal 
rules on the motion. The stay request shall be in writing and contain 
the information specified in Sec. 2.788(b) (1), (2) and (3) of this 
part. The Commission shall rule on the stay request within 10 days after 
the filing of the motion. The Commission shall consider the factors 
specified in Sec. 2.788(e) (1) and (2) of this part is determining 
whether to grant or deny a stay application.

Sec. 2.714   Intervention.

    (a)(1) Any person whose interest may be affected by a proceeding and 
who desires to participate as a party shall file

[[Page 55]]

a written petition for leave to intervene. In a proceeding noticed 
pursuant to Sec. 2.105, any person whose interest may be affected may 
also request a hearing. The petition and/or request shall be filed not 
later than the time specified in the notice of hearing, or as provided 
by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Board designated to rule on the petition and/or request, or as 
provided in Sec. 2.102(d)(3). Nontimely filings will not be entertained 
absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the petition 
and/or request, that the petition and/or request should be granted based 
upon a balancing of the following factors in addition to those set out 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section:
    (i) Good cause, if any, for failure to file on time.
    (ii) The availability of other means whereby the petitioner's 
interest will be protected.
    (iii) The extent to which the petitioner's participation may 
reasonably be expected to assist in developing a sound record.
    (iv) The extent to which the petitioner's interest will be 
represented by existing parties.
    (v) The extent to which the petitioner's participation will broaden 
the issues or delay the proceeding.
    (2) The petition shall set forth with particularity the interest of 
the petitioner in the proceeding, how that interest may be affected by 
the results of the proceeding, including the reasons why petitioner 
should be permitted to intervene, with particular reference to the 
factors in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and the specific aspect or 
aspects of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner 
wishes to intervene.
    (3) Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or 
who has been admitted as a party pursuant to this section may amend his 
petition for leave to intervene. A petition may be amended without prior 
approval of the presiding officer at any time up to fifteen (15) days 
prior to the holding of the special prehearing conference pursuant to 
Sec. 2.751a, or where no special prehearing conference is held, fifteen 
(15) days prior to the holding of the first prehearing conference. After 
this time a petition may be amended only with approval of the presiding 
officer, based on a balancing of the factors specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. Such an amended petition for leave to intervene 
must satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (a) of this section 
pertaining to specificity.
    (b)(1) Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the holding of the 
special prehearing conference pursuant to Sec. 2.751a, or if no special 
prehearing conference is held, fifteen (15) days prior to the holding of 
the first prehearing conference, the petitioner shall file a supplement 
to his or her petition to intervene that must include a list of the 
contentions which petitioner seeks to have litigated in the hearing. A 
petitioner who fails to file a supplement that satisfies the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to at 
least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. 
Additional time for filing the supplement may be granted based upon a 
balancing of the factors in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (2) Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the 
issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the 
petitioner shall provide the following information with respect to each 
contention:
    (i) A brief explanation of the bases of the contention.
    (ii) A concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion 
which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely 
in proving the contention at the hearing, together with references to 
those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware 
and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or 
expert opinion.
    (iii) Sufficient information (which may include information pursuant 
to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section) to show that a genuine 
dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. 
This showing must include references to the specific portions of the 
application (including the applicant's environmental report and

[[Page 56]]

safety report) that the petitioner disputes and the supporting reasons 
for each dispute, or, if the petitioner believes that the application 
fails to contain information on a relevant matter as required by law, 
the identification of each failure and the supporting reasons for the 
petitioner's belief. On issues arising under the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the petitioner shall file contentions based on the 
applicant's environmental report. The petitioner can amend those 
contentions or file new contentions if there are data or conclusions in 
the NRC draft or final environmental impact statement, environmental 
assessment, or any supplements relating thereto, that differ 
significantly from the data or conclusions in the applicant's document.
    (c) Any party to a proceeding may file an answer to a petition for 
leave to intervene or a supplement thereto within ten (10) days after 
service of the petition or supplement, with particular attention to the 
factors set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The staff may 
file such an answer within fifteen (15) days after service of the 
petition or supplement.
    (d) The Commission, the presiding officer, or the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Board designated to rule on petitions to intervene and/or 
requests for hearing shall permit intervention, in any hearing on an 
application for a license to receive and possess high-level radioactive 
waste at a geologic repository operations area, by the State in which 
such area is located and by any affected Indian Tribe as defined in part 
60 of this chapter. In all other circumstances, such ruling body or 
officer shall, in ruling on--
    (1) A petition for leave to intervene or a request for a hearing, 
consider the following factors, among other things:
    (i) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a 
party to the proceeding.
    (ii) The nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, 
or other interest in the proceeding.
    (iii) The possible effect of any order that may be entered in the 
proceeding on the petitioner's interest.
    (2) The admissibility of a contention, refuse to admit a contention 
if:
    (i) The contention and supporting material fail to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
    (ii) The contention, if proven, would be of no consequence in the 
proceeding because it would not entitle petitioner to relief.
    (e) If the Commission or the presiding officer determines that any 
of the admitted contentions constitute pure issues of law, those 
contentions must be decided on the basis of briefs or oral argument 
according to a schedule determined by the Commission or presiding 
officer.
    (f) An order permitting intervention and/or directing a hearing may 
be conditioned on such terms as the Commission, presiding officer or the 
designated atomic safety and licensing board may direct in the interests 
of:
    (1) Restricting irrelevant, duplicative, or repetitive evidence and 
argument,
    (2) Having common interests represented by a spokesman, and
    (3) Retaining authority to determine priorities and control the 
compass of the hearing.
    (g) In any case in which, after consideration of the factors set 
forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Commission or the 
presiding officer finds that the petitioner's interest is limited to one 
or more of the issues involved in the proceeding, any order allowing 
intervention shall limit his participation accordingly.
    (h) A person permitted to intervene becomes a party to the 
proceeding, subject to any limitations imposed pursuant to paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (i) Unless otherwise expressly provided in the order allowing 
intervention, the granting of a petition for leave to intervene does not 
change or enlarge the issues specified in the notice of hearing.
    (j) The provisions of this section do not apply to license 
applications docketed under subpart J of this part.

Sec. 2.714a  Petitions for review of certain rulings on petitions for leave to intervene and/or requests for hearing.

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 2.730(f), an order of the 
presiding officer or the atomic safety and licensing board designated to 
rule on petitions for leave to intervene and/or requests for hearing may 
be appealed, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to the 
Commission within ten (10) days after service of the order. The appeal 
shall be asserted by the filing of a notice of appeal and accompanying 
supporting brief. Any other party may file a brief in support of or in 
opposition to the appeal within ten (10) days after service of the 
appeal. No other appeals from rulings on petitions and/or requests for 
hearing shall be allowed.
    (b) An order wholly denying a petition for leave to intervene and/or 
request for a hearing is appealable by the petitioner on the question 
whether the petition and/or hearing request should have been granted in 
whole or in part.
    (c) An order granting a petition for leave to intervene and/or 
request for a hearing is appealable by a party other than the petitioner 
on the question whether the petition and/or the request for a hearing 
should have been wholly denied.

Sec. 2.715   Participation by a person not a party.

    (a) A person who is not a party may, in the discretion of the 
presiding officer, be permitted to make a limited appearance by making 
oral or written statement of his position on the issues at any session 
of the hearing or any prehearing conference within such limits and on 
such conditions as may be fixed by the presiding officer, but he may not 
otherwise participate in the proceeding.
    (b) The Secretary will give notice of a hearing to any person who 
requests it prior to the issuance of the notice of hearing, and will 
furnish a copy of the notice of hearing to any person who requests it 
thereafter. When a communication bears more than one signature, the 
Commission will give the notice to the person first signing unless the 
communication clearly indicates otherwise.
    (c) The presiding officer will afford representatives of an 
interested State, county, municipality, and/or agencies thereof, a 
reasonable opportunity to participate and to introduce evidence, 
interrogate witnesses, and advise the Commission without requiring the 
representative to take a position with respect to the issue. Such 
participants may also file proposed findings and exceptions pursuant to 
Secs. 2.754 and 2.762 and petitions for review by the Commission 
pursuant to Sec. 2.786. The presiding officer may require such 
representative to indicate with reasonable specificity, in advance of 
the hearing, the subject matters on which he desires to participate.
    (d) If a matter is taken up by the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 2.786, a person who is not a party may, in the discretion of the 
Commission, respectively, be permitted to file a brief ``amicus 
curiae''. A person who is not a party and desires to file a brief must 
submit a motion for leave to do so which identifies the interest of the 
person and states the reasons why a brief is desirable. Except as 
otherwise provided by the Commission, such brief must be filed within 
the time allowed to the party whose position the brief will support. A 
motion of a person who is not a party to participate in oral argument 
before the Commission will be granted at the discretion of the 
Commission.

Sec. 2.715a   Consolidation of parties in construction permit or operating license proceedings.

    On motion or on its or his own initiative, the Commission or the 
presiding officer may order any parties in a proceeding for the issuance 
of a construction permit or an operating license for a production or 
utilization facility who have substantially the same interest that may 
be affected by the proceeding and who raise substantially the same 
questions, to consolidate their presentation of evidence, cross-
examination, briefs, proposed findings of fact, and

[[Page 58]]

conclusions of law and argument. However, it may not order any 
consolidation that would prejudice the rights of any party. A 
consolidation under this section may be for all purposes of the 
proceeding, all of the issues of the proceeding, or with respect to any 
one or more issues thereof.

[37 FR 15132, July 28, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 2.716  Consolidation of proceedings.

    On motion and for good cause shown or on its own initiative, the 
Commission or the presiding officers of each affected proceeding may 
consolidate for hearing or for other purposes two or more proceedings, 
or may hold joint hearings with interested States and/or other federal 
agencies on matters of concurrent jurisdiction, if it is found that such 
action will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business and to 
the ends of justice and will be conducted in accordance with the other 
provisions of this subpart.

Sec. 2.717   Commencement and termination of jurisdiction of presiding officer.

    (a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the jurisdiction of 
the presiding officer designated to conduct a hearing over the 
proceeding, including motions and procedural matters, commences when the 
proceeding commences. If no presiding officer has been designated, the 
Chief Administrative Law Judge has such jurisdiction or, if he is 
unavailable, another administrative law judge has such jurisdiction. A 
proceeding is deemed to commence when a notice of hearing or a notice of 
proposed action pursuant to Sec. 2.105 is issued. When a notice of 
hearing provides that the presiding officer is to be an administrative 
law judge, the Chief Administrative Law Judge will designate by order 
the administrative law judge who is to preside. The presiding officer's 
jurisdiction in each proceeding will terminate upon the expiration of 
the period within which the Commission may direct that the record be 
certified to it for final decision, or when the Commission renders a 
final decision, or when the presiding officer shall have withdrawn 
himself from the case upon considering himself disqualified, whichever 
is earliest.
    (b) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, may issue an 
order and take any otherwise proper administrative action with respect 
to a licensee who is a party to a pending proceeding. Any order related 
to the subject matter of the pending proceeding may be modified by the 
presiding officer as appropriate for the purpose of the proceeding.

Sec. 2.718   Power of presiding officer.

    A presiding officer has the duty to conduct a fair and impartial 
hearing according to law, to take appropriate action to avoid delay, and 
to maintain order. He has all powers necessary to those ends, including 
the powers to:
    (a) Administer oaths and affirmations.
    (b) Issue subpoenas authorized by law.
    (c) Rule on offers of proof, and receive evidence.
    (d) Order depositions to be taken.
    (e) Regulate the course of the hearing and the conduct of the 
participants.
    (f) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters.

either in his discretion or on direction of the Commission.
    (j) Reopen a proceeding for the reception of further evidence at any 
time prior to initial decision.
    (k) Appoint special assistants from the Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Board Panel pursuant to Sec. 2.722;
    (l) Issue initial decisions; and
    (m) Take any other action consistent with the Act, this chapter, and 
sections 551-558 of title 5 of the United States Code.

<R05>
Sec. 2.720   Subpoenas.

    (a) On application by any party, the designated presiding officer 
or, if he is not available, the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Board Panel, the Chief Administrative Law Judge, or other 
designated officer will issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and 
testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence. The officer to 
whom application is made may require a showing of general relevance of 
the testimony or evidence sought, and may withhold the subpoena if such 
a showing is not made, but he shall not attempt to determine the 
admissibility of evidence.
    (b) Every subpoena will bear the name of the Commission, the name 
and office of the issuing officer and the title of the hearing, and will 
command the person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony 
or produce specified documents or other things at a designated time and 
place. The subpoena will also advise of the quashing procedure provided 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (c) Unless the service of a subpoena is acknowledged on its face by 
the witness or is served by an officer or employee of the Commission, it 
shall be served by a person who is not a party to the hearing and is not 
less than eighteen (18) years of age. Service of a subpoena shall be 
made by delivery of a copy of the subpoena to the person named in it and 
tendering him the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed 
by law. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Commission, fees 
and mileage need not be tendered, and the subpoena may be served by 
registered mail.
    (d) Witnesses summoned by subpoena shall be paid, by the party at 
whose instance they appear, the fees and mileage paid to witnesses in 
the district courts of the United States.
    (e) The person serving the subpoena shall make proof of service by 
filing the subpoena and affidavit or acknowledgment of service with the 
officer before whom the witness is required to testify or produce 
evidence or with the Secretary. Failure to make proof of service shall 
not affect the validity of the service.
    (f) On motion made promptly, and in any event at or before the time 
specified in the subpoena for compliance by the person to whom the 
subpoena is directed, and on notice to the party at whose instance the 
subpoena was issued, the presiding officer or, if he is unavailable, the 
Commission may: (1) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable 
or requires evidence not relevant to any matter in issue, or (2) 
condition denial of the motion on just and reasonable terms.
    (g) On application and for good cause shown, the Commission will 
seek judicial enforcement of a subpoena issued to a party and which has 
not been quashed.
    (h)(1) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section 
are not applicable to the attendance and testimony of the Commissioners 
or NRC personnel, or to the production of records or documents in the 
custody thereof.
    (2)(i) In a proceeding in which the NRC is a party, the NRC staff 
will make available one or more witnesses designated by the Executive 
Director for Operations, for oral examination at the hearing or on 
deposition regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to 
the issues in the proceeding. The attendance and testimony of the 
Commissioners and named NRC personnel at a hearing or on deposition may 
not be required by the presiding officer, by subpoena or otherwise: 
Provided, That the presiding officer may, upon a showing of exceptional 
circumstances, such as a case in which a particular named NRC employee 
has direct personal knowledge of a material fact not known to the 
witnesses made available by the Executive Director for Operations 
require the attendance and testimony of named NRC personnel.
    (ii) In addition, a party may file with the presiding officer 
written interrogatories to be answered by NRC personnel with knowledge 
of the facts designated by the Executive Director for

[[Page 60]]

Operations. Upon a finding by the presiding officer that answers to the 
interrogatories are necessary to a proper decision in the proceeding and 
that answers to the interrogatories are not reasonably obtainable from 
any other source, the presiding officer may require that the staff 
answer the interrogatories.
    (iii) No deposition of a particular named NRC employee or answer to 
interrogatories by NRC personnel pursuant to paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and 
(ii) of this section shall be required before the matters in controversy 
in the proceeding have been identified by order of the Commission or the 
presiding officer, pursuant to Sec. 2.751a, or after the beginning of 
the prehearing conference held pursuant to Sec. 2.752 except upon leave 
of the presiding officer for good cause shown.
    (iv) The provisions of Sec. 2.740 (c) and (e) shall apply to 
interrogatories served pursuant to this paragraph.
    (3) Records or documents in the custody of the Commissioners and NRC 
personnel are available for inspection and copying or photographing 
pursuant to Secs. 2.744 and 2.790.

Sec. 2.721   Atomic safety and licensing boards.

    (a) The Commission or the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Board Panel may from time to time establish one or more atomic 
safety and licensing boards, each comprised of three members, one of 
whom will be qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings and 
two of whom shall have such technical or other qualifications as the 
Commission or the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board 
Panel deems appropriate to the issues to be decided, to preside in such 
proceedings for granting, suspending, revoking, or amending licenses or 
authorizations as the Commission may designate, and to perform such 
other adjudicatory functions as the Commission deems appropriate. The 
members of an atomic safety and licensing board shall be designated from 
the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel established by the 
Commission.
    (b) The Commission or the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Board Panel may designate an alternate qualified in the 
conduct of administrative proceedings, or an alternate having technical 
or other qualifications, or both, for an atomic safety and licensing 
board established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If a member 
of a board becomes unavailable, the Commission or the Chairman of the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel may constitute the alternate 
qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings, or the alternate 
having technical or other qualifications, as appropriate, as a member of 
the board by notifying the alternate who will, as of the date of such 
notification, serve as member of the board. In the event that an 
alternate is unavailable or no alternates have been designated, and a 
member of a board becomes unavailable, the Commission or the Chairman of 
the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel may appoint a member of the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel who is qualified in the conduct 
of administrative proceedings or a member having technical or other 
qualifications, as appropriate, as a member of the atomic safety and 
licensing board by notifying the appointee who will, as of the date of 
such notification, serve as a member of the Board.
    (c) An atomic safety and licensing board shall have the duties and 
may exercise the powers of a presiding officer as granted by Sec. 2.718 
and otherwise in this part. At any time when such a board is in 
existence but is not actually in session, any powers which could be 
exercised by a presiding officer or by the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge may be exercised with respect to such a proceeding by the chairman 
of the board having jurisdiction over it. Two members of an atomic 
safety and licensing board constitute a quorum, if one of those members 
is the member

qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings.

Sec. 2.722  Special assistants to the presiding officer.

    (a) In consultation with the Panel Chairman, the presiding officer 
may, at his discretion, appoint from the Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Board Panel established by the Commission, personnel to assist the 
presiding officer in taking evidence and preparing a suitable record for 
review. Such appointment may occur at any appropriate time during the 
proceeding but shall, at the time of the appointment, be subject to the 
notice and disqualification provisions as described in Sec. 2.704. Such 
special assistants may function as:
    (1) Technical interrogators in their individual fields of expertise. 
Such interrogators shall be required to study the written testimony and 
sit with the presiding officer to hear the presentation and cross-
examination by the parties of all witnesses on the issues of the 
interrogators' expertise, taking a leading role in examining such 
witnesses to ensure that the record is as complete as possible;
    (2) Upon consent of all the parties, Special Masters to hear 
evidentiary presentations by the parties on specific technical matters, 
and, upon completion of the presentation of evidence, to prepare a 
report that would become part of the record. Special Masters may rule on 
evidentiary issues brought before them, in accordance with Secs. 2.743 
and 2.757. Appeals from such rulings may be taken to the presiding 
officer in accordance with procedures which shall be established in the 
presiding officer's order appointing the Special Master. Special 
Masters' reports are advisory only; the presiding officer shall retain 
final authority with respect to the issues heard by the Special Master; 
or
    (3) Alternate Atomic Safety and Licensing Board members to sit with 
the presiding officer, to participate in the evidentiary sessions on the 
issue for which the alternate members were designated by examining 
witnesses, and to advise the presiding officer of their conclusions 
through an on-the-record report. This report is advisory only; the 
presiding officer shall retain final authority on the issue for which 
the alternate member was designated.
    (4) Discovery Master to rule on the matters specified in 
Sec. 2.1018(a)(2) of this part.
    (b) The presiding officer may, as a matter of discretion, informally 
seek the assistance of Members of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board 
Panel to brief the presiding officer on the general technical background 
of subjects involving complex issues which the presiding officer might 
otherwise have difficulty in quickly grasping. Such informal briefings 
shall take place prior to the hearing on the subject involved and shall 
supplement the reading and study undertaken by the presiding officer. 
They are not subject to the procedures described in Sec. 2.704.

                                 Motions


<R05>
Sec. 2.730   Motions.

    (a) Presentation and disposition. All motions shall be addressed to 
the Commission or, when a proceeding is pending before a presiding 
officer, to the presiding officer. All written motions shall be filed 
with the Secretary, and served on all parties to the proceeding.
    (b) Form and content. Unless made orally on the record during a 
hearing, or the presiding officer directs otherwise, a motion shall be 
in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds and the relief 
sought, and shall be accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence 
relied on, and, as appropriate, a proposed form of order.
    (c) Answers to motions. Within ten (10) days after service of a 
written motion, or such other period as the Secretary or the Assistant 
Secretary or presiding officer may prescribe, a party may file an answer 
in support of or in opposition to the motion, accompanied by affidavits 
or other evidence. However, the staff may file such an answer within 
fifteen (15) days after service of a

[[Page 62]]

written motion. The moving party shall have no right to reply, except as 
permitted by the presiding officer or the Secretary or the Assistant 
Secretary.
    (d) Oral arguments; briefs. No oral argument will be heard on a 
motion unless the presiding officer or the Commission directs otherwise. 
A written brief may be filed with a motion or an answer to a motion, 
stating the arguments and authorities relied on.
    (e) The Board may dispose of written motions either by written order 
or by ruling orally during the course of a prehearing conference or 
hearing. The Board should ensure that parties not present for the oral 
ruling are notified promptly of the order.
    (f) Interlocutory appeals to the Commission. No interlocutory appeal 
may be taken to the Commission from a ruling of the presiding officer. 
When in the judgment of the presiding officer prompt decision is 
necessary to prevent detriment to the public interest or unusual delay 
or expense, the presiding officer may refer the ruling promptly to the 
Commission, and notify the parties either by announcement on the record 
or by written notice if the hearing is not in session.
    (g) Effect of filing a motion or certification of question to the 
Commission. Unless otherwise ordered, neither the filing of a motion nor 
the certification of a question to the Commission shall stay the 
proceeding or extend the time for the performance of any act.
    (h) Where the motion in question is a motion to compel discovery 
under Sec. 2.720(h)(2) or Sec. 2.740(f), parties may file answers to the 
motion pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. The presiding officer 
in his or her discretion, may order that the answer be given orally 
during a telephone conference or other prehearing conference, rather 
than in writing. If responses are given over the telephone the presiding 
officer shall issue a written order on the motion which summarizes the 
views presented by the parties. This does not preclude the presiding 
officer from issuing a prior oral ruling on the matter which is 
effective at the time of such ruling, provided that the terms of the 
ruling are incorporated in the subsequent written order.

Sec. 2.733   Examination by experts.

    A party may request the presiding officer to permit a qualified 
individual who has scientific or technical training or experience to 
participate on behalf of that party in the examination and cross-
examination of expert witnesses. The presiding officer may permit such 
individual to participate on behalf of the party in the examination and 
cross-examination of expert witnesses, where it would serve the purpose 
of furthering the conduct of the proceeding, upon finding: (a) That the 
individual is qualified by scientific or technical training or 
experience to contribute to the development of an adequate decisional 
record in the proceeding by the conduct of such examination or cross-
examination, (b) that the individual has read any written testimony on 
which he intends to examine or cross-examine and any documents to be 
used or referred to in the course of the examination or cross-
examination, and (c) that the individual has prepared himself to conduct 
a meaningful and expeditious examination or cross-examination. 
Examination or cross-examination conducted pursuant to this section 
shall be limited to areas within the expertise of the individual 
conducting the examination or cross-examination. The party on behalf of 
whom such examination or cross-examination is

[[Page 63]]

conducted and his attorney shall be responsible for the conduct of 
examination or cross-examination by such individuals.

<R05>
Sec. 2.734  Motions to reopen.

    (a) A motion to reopen a closed record to consider additional 
evidence will not be granted unless the following criteria are 
satisfied:
    (1) The motion must be timely, except that an exceptionally grave 
issue may be considered in the discretion of the presiding officer even 
if untimely presented.
    (2) The motion must address a significant safety or environmental 
issue.
    (3) The motion must demonstrate that a materially different result 
would be or would have been likely had the newly proffered evidence been 
considered initially.
    (b) The motion must be accompanied by one or more affidavits which 
set forth the factual and/or technical bases for the movant's claim that 
the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied. 
Affidavits must be given by competent individuals with knowledge of the 
facts alleged, or by experts in the disciplines appropriate to the 
issues raised. Evidence contained in affidavits must meet the 
admissibility standards set forth in Sec. 2.743(c). Each of the criteria 
must be separately addressed, with a specific explanation of why it has 
been met. Where multiple allegations are involved, the movant must 
identify with particularity each issue it seeks to litigate and specify 
the factual and/or technical bases which it believes support the claim 
that this issue meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) A motion predicated in whole or in part on the allegations of a 
confidential informant must identify to the presiding officer the source 
of the allegations and must request the issuance of an appropriate 
protective order.
    (d) A motion to reopen which relates to a contention not previously 
in controversy among the parties must also satisfy the requirements for 
nontimely contentions in Sec. 2.714(a)(1) (i) through (v).

 Depositions and Written Interrogatories; Discovery; Admission; Evidence


<R05>
Sec. 2.740   General provisions governing discovery.

    (a) Discovery methods. Parties may obtain discovery by one or more 
of the following methods: Depositions upon oral examination or written 
interrogatories (Sec. 2.740a); written interrogatories (Sec. 2.740b); 
production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or 
other property, for inspection and other purposes (Sec. 2.741); and 
requests for admission (Sec. 2.742).
    (b) Scope of discovery. Unless otherwise limited by order of the 
presiding officer in accordance with this section, the scope of 
discovery is as follows:
    (1) In general. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, 
not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the 
proceeding, whether it relates to the claim or defense of any other 
party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, 
and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the 
identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable 
matter. Where any book, document or other tangible thing sought is 
reasonably available from another source, such as from the Commission's 
Public Document Room or local Public Document Room, a sufficient 
response to an interrogatory involving such materials would be the 
location, the title and a page reference to the relevant book, document 
or tangible thing. In a proceeding on an application for a construction 
permit or an operating license for a production or utilization facility, 
discovery shall begin only after the prehearing conference provided for 
in Sec. 2.751a and shall relate only to those matters in controversy 
which have been identified by the Commission or the presiding officer in 
the prehearing order entered at the conclusion of that prehearing 
conference. In such a proceeding, no discovery shall be had after

[[Page 64]]

the beginning of the prehearing conference held pursuant to Sec. 2.752 
except upon leave of the presiding officer upon good cause shown. It is 
not ground for objection that the information sought will be 
inadmissible at the hearing if the information sought appears reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (2) Trial preparation materials. A party may obtain discovery of 
documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section and prepared in anticipation of or for the 
hearing by or for another party's representative (including his 
attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a 
showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the 
materials in the preparation of this case and that he is unable without 
undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by 
other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required 
showing has been made, the presiding officer shall protect against 
disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal 
theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning 
the proceeding.
    (3) While interrogatories may seek to elicit factual information 
reasonably related to a party's position in the proceeding, including 
data used, assumptions made, and analyses performed by the party, such 
interrogatories may not be addressed to, or be construed to require: (A) 
Reasons for not using alternative data, assumptions, and analyses where 
the alternative data, assumptions, and analyses were not relied on in 
developing the party's position; or (B) Performance of additional 
research or analytical work beyond that which is needed to support the 
party's position on any particular matter.
    (c) Protective order. Upon motion by a party or the person from whom 
discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, the presiding officer may 
make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, 
including one or more of the following: (1) That the discovery not be 
had; (2) that the discovery may be had only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time or place; (3) that the 
discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that 
selected by the party seeking discovery; (4) that certain matters not be 
inquired into, or that the scope of discovery be limited to certain 
matters; (5) that discovery be conducted with no one present except 
persons designated by the presiding officer; (6) that, subject to the 
provisions of Secs. 2.744 and 2.790, a trade secret or other 
confidential research, development, or commercial information not be 
disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; (7) that studies and 
evaluations not be prepared. If the motion for a protective order is 
denied in whole or in part, the presiding officer may, on such terms and 
conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide or permit 
discovery.
    (d) Sequence and timing of discovery. Unless the presiding officer 
upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the 
interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used 
in any sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, 
whether by deposition or otherwise, shall not operate to delay any other 
party's discovery.
    (e) Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a 
request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is 
under no duty to supplement his response to include information 
thereafter acquired, except as follows:
    (1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response 
with respect to any question directly addressed to (i) the identity and 
location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (ii) 
the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness 
at the hearing, the subject matter on which he is expected to testify, 
and the substance of his testimony.
    (2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if 
he obtains information upon the basis of which (i) he knows that the 
response was incorrect when made, or (ii) he knows that the response 
though correct when made is no longer true and

[[Page 65]]

the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in 
substance a knowing concealment.
    (3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the 
presiding officer or agreement of the parties.
    (f) Motion to compel discovery. (1) If a deponent or party upon whom 
a request for production of documents or answers to interrogatories is 
served fails to respond or objects to the request, or any part thereof, 
or fails to permit inspection as requested, the deposing party or the 
party submitting the request may move the presiding officer, within ten 
(10) days after the date of the response or after failure of a party to 
respond to the request for an order compelling a response or inspection 
in accordance with the request. The motion shall set forth the nature of 
the questions or the request, the response or objection of the party 
upon whom the request was served, and arguments in support of the 
motion. For purposes of this paragraph, an evasive or incomplete answer 
or response shall be treated as a failure to answer or respond. Failure 
to answer or respond shall not be excused on the ground that the 
discovery sought is objectionable unless the person or party failing to 
answer or respond has applied for a protective order pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) In ruling on a motion made pursuant to this section, the 
presiding officer may make such a protective order as he is authorized 
to make on a motion made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) This section does not preclude an independent request for 
issuance of a subpena directed to a person not a party for production of 
documents and things. This section does not apply to requests for the 
testimony or interrogatories of the regulatory staff pursuant to 
Sec. 2.720(h)(2) or production of NRC documents pursuant to Sec. 2.744 
or Sec. 2.790, except for paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section.

54 FR 33181, Aug. 11, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 2.740a   Depositions upon oral examination and upon written interrogatories.

    (a) Any party desiring to take the testimony of any party or other 
person by deposition on oral examination or written interrogatories 
shall, without leave of the Commission or the presiding officer, give 
reasonable notice in writing to every other party, to the person to be 
examined and to the presiding officer of the proposed time and place of 
taking the deposition; the name and address of each person to be 
examined, if known, or if, the name is not known, a general description 
sufficient to identify him or the class or group to which he belongs; 
the matters upon which each person will be examined and the name or 
descriptive title and address of the officer before whom the deposition 
is to be taken.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Within the United States, a deposition may be taken before any 
officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States 
or of the place where the examination is held. Outside of the United 
States, a deposition may be taken before a secretary of an embassy or 
legation, a consul general, vice consul or consular agent of the United 
States, or a person authorized to administer oaths designated by the 
Commission.
    (d) The deponent shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions 
are put to him. Examination and cross-examination shall proceed as at a 
hearing. Each question propounded shall be recorded and the answer taken 
down in the words of the witness. Objections on questions of evidence 
shall be noted in short form without the arguments. The officer shall 
not decide on the competency, materiality, or relevancy of evidence but 
shall record the evidence subject to objection. Objections on questions 
of evidence not made before the officer shall not be deemed waived 
unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated 
or removed if presented at that time.
    (e) When the testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition shall be 
submitted to the deponent for examination and signature unless he is ill 
or cannot be found or refuses to sign. The officer

[[Page 66]]

shall certify the deposition or, if the deposition is not signed by the 
deponent, shall certify the reasons for the failure to sign, and shall 
promptly forward the deposition by registered mail to the Commission.
    (f) Where the deposition is to be taken on written interrogatories, 
the party taking the deposition shall serve a copy of the 
interrogatories, showing each interrogatory separately and consecutively 
numbered, on every other party with a notice stating the name and 
address of the person who is to answer them, and the name, description, 
title, and address of the officer before whom they are to be taken. 
Within ten (10) days after service, any other party may serve cross-
interrogatories. The interrogatories, cross-interrogatories, and answers 
shall be recorded and signed, and the deposition certified, returned, 
and filed as in the case of a deposition on oral examination.
    (g) A deposition will not become a part of the record in the hearing 
unless received in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in 
evidence by a party, any other party may introduce any other parts. A 
party shall not be deemed to make a person his own witness for any 
purpose by taking his deposition.
    (h) A deponent whose deposition is taken and the officer taking a 
deposition shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like 
services in the district courts of the United States, to be paid by the 
party at whose instance the deposition is taken.
    (i) The witness may be accompanied, represented, and advised by 
legal counsel.
    (j) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section are 
not applicable to NRC personnel. Testimony of NRC personnel by oral 
examination and written interrogatories addressed to NRC personnel are 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 2.720(h).

Sec. 2.740b   Interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Any party may serve upon any other party (other than the 
staff)<SUP>4 written interrogatories to be answered in writing by the 
party served, or if the party served is a public or private corporation 
or a partnership or association, by any officer or agent, who shall 
furnish such information as is available to the party. A copy of the 
interrogatories, answers, and all related pleadings shall be filed with 
the Secretary of the Commission and shall be served on the presiding 
officer and upon all parties to the proceeding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>4Interrogatories addressed to the staff are subject to 
Sec. 2.720(h)(2)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in 
writing under oath or affirmation, unless it is objected to, in which 
event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. 
The answers shall be signed by the person making them, and the 
objections by the attorney making them. The party upon whom the 
interrogatories were served shall serve a copy of the answers and 
objections upon all parties to the proceeding within 14 days after 
service of the interrogatories, or within such shorter or longer period 
as the presiding officer may allow. Answers may be used in the same 
manner as depositions (see Sec. 2.740a(g)).

Sec. 2.741   Production of documents and things and entry upon land for inspection and other purposes.

    (a) Request for discovery. Any party may serve on any other party a 
request to:
    (1) Produce and permit the party making the request, or a person 
acting on his behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents, or 
to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which are 
within the scope of Sec. 2.740 and which are in the possession, custody, 
or control of the party upon whom the request is served; or
    (2) Permit entry upon designated land or other property in the 
possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for 
the purpose of

[[Page 67]]

inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling 
the property or any designated object or operation thereon, within the 
scope of Sec. 2.740.
    (b) Service. The request may be served on any party without leave of 
the Commission or the presiding officer. Except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 2.740, the request may be served after the proceeding is set for 
hearing.
    (c) Contents. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected 
either by individual item or by category, and describe each item and 
category with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a 
reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and 
performing the related acts.
    (d) Response. The party upon whom the request is served shall serve 
on the party submitting the request a written response within thirty 
(30) days after the service of the request. The response shall state, 
with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related 
activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is 
objected to, in which case the reasons for objection shall be stated. If 
objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be 
specified.
    (e) NRC records and documents. The provisions of paragraphs (a) 
through (d) of this section do not apply to the production for 
inspection and copying or photographing of NRC records or documents. 
Production of such records or documents is subject to the provisions of 
Secs. 2.744 and 2.790.

<R05>
Sec. 2.742   Admissions.

    (a) Apart from any admissions made during or as a result of a 
prehearing conference, at any time after his answer has been filed, a 
party may file a written request for the admission of the genuineness 
and authenticity of any relevant document described in or attached to 
the request, or for the admission of the truth of any specified relevant 
matter of fact. A copy of the document shall be delivered with the 
request unless a copy has already been furnished.
    (b) Each requested admission shall be deemed made unless, within a 
time designated by the presiding officer or the Commission, and not less 
than ten (10) days after service of the request or such further time as 
may be allowed on motion, the party to whom the request is directed 
serves on the requesting party either (1) a sworn statement denying 
specifically the relevant matters of which an admission is requested or 
setting forth in detail the reasons why he can neither truthfully admit 
nor deny them, or (2) written objections on the ground that some or all 
of the matters involved are privileged or irrelevant or that the request 
is otherwise improper in whole or in part. Answers on matters to which 
such objections are made may be deferred until the objections are 
determined. If written objections are made to only a part of a request, 
the remainder of the request shall be answered within the time 
designated.
    (c) Admissions obtained pursuant to the procedure in this section 
may be used in evidence to the same extent and subject to the same 
objections as other admissions.

<R05>
Sec. 2.743   Evidence.

    (a) General. Every party to a proceeding shall have the right to 
present such oral or documentary evidence and rebuttal evidence and to 
conduct, in accordance with an approved cross-examination plan that 
contains the information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
if so directed by the presiding officer, such cross-examination as may 
be required for full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (b)(1) Testimony and cross-examination. The parties shall submit 
direct testimony of witnesses in written form, unless otherwise ordered 
by the presiding officer on the basis of objections presented. In any 
proceeding in which advance written testimony is to be used, each party 
shall serve copies of its proposed written testimony on each other party 
at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the session of the hearing at 
which its testimony is to be presented. The presiding officer may permit 
the introduction of written testimony not so served, either with the 
consent of all parties present or after they have had a reasonable 
opportunity to examine

[[Page 68]]

it. Written testimony must be incorporated into the transcript of the 
record as if read or, in the discretion of the presiding officer, may be 
offered and admitted in evidence as an exhibit.
    (2) The presiding officer may require a party seeking an opportunity 
to cross-examine to request permission to do so in accordance with a 
schedule established by the presiding officer. A request to conduct 
cross-examination shall be accompanied by a cross-examination plan that 
contains the following information:
    (i) A brief description of the issue or issues on which cross-
examination will be conducted;
    (ii) The objective to be achieved by cross-examination; and
    (iii) The proposed line of questions that may logically lead to 
achieving the objective of the cross-examination.
The cross-examination plan may be submitted only to the presiding 
officer and must be kept by the presiding officer in confidence until 
issuance of the initial decision on the issue being litigated. The 
presiding officer shall then provide each cross-examination plan to the 
Commission's Secretary for inclusion in the official record of the 
proceeding.
    (3) Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to 
proceedings under subpart B of this part for modification, suspension, 
or revocation of a license or to proceedings for imposition of a civil 
penalty.
    (c) Admissibility. Only relevant, material, and reliable evidence 
which is not unduly repetitious will be admitted. Immaterial or 
irrelevant parts of an admissible document will be segregated and 
excluded so far as is practicable.
    (d) Objections. An objection to evidence shall briefly state the 
grounds of objection. The transcript shall include the objection, the 
grounds, and the ruling. Exception to an adverse ruling is preserved 
without notation on the record.
    (e) Offer of proof. An offer of proof made in connection with an 
objection to a ruling of the presiding officer excluding or rejecting 
proffered oral testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance 
of the proffered evidence. If the excluded evidence is written, a copy 
shall be marked for identification. Rejected exhibits, adequately marked 
for identification, shall be retained in the record.
    (f) Exhibits. A written exhibit will not be received in evidence 
unless the original and two copies are offered and a copy is furnished 
to each party, or the parties have been previously furnished with copies 
or the presiding officer directs otherwise. The presiding officer may 
permit a party to replace with a true copy an original document admitted 
in evidence. Exhibits in the proceeding on an application for a license 
to receive and possess high-level radioactive waste at a geologic 
repository operations area are governed by Sec. 2.1013 of this part.
    (g) Proceedings involving applications. In any proceeding involving 
an application, there shall be offered in evidence by the staff any 
report submitted by the ACRS in the proceeding in compliance with 
section 182b. of the Act, any safety evaluation prepared by the staff 
and any environmental impact statement prepared by the Director of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material Safety and 
Safeguards, as appropriate, or his designee in the proceeding pursuant 
to subpart A of part 51 of this chapter.
    (h) Official record. An official record of a government agency or 
entry in an official record may be evidenced by an official publication 
or by a copy attested by the officer having legal custody of the record 
and accompanied by a certificate of his custody.
    (i) Official notice. (1) The Commission or the presiding officer may 
take official notice of any fact of which a court of the United States 
may take judicial notice or of any technical or scientific fact within 
the knowledge of the Commission as an expert body. Each fact officially 
noticed under this subparagraph shall be specified in the record with 
sufficient particularity to advise the parties of the matters which have 
been noticed or brought to the attention of the parties before final 
decision and each party adversely affected by the decision shall be 
given opportunity to controvert the fact.
    (2) If a decision is stated to rest in whole or in part on official 
notice of a fact which the parties have not had a prior opportunity to 
controvert, a

[[Page 69]]

party may controvert the fact by filing an appeal from an initial 
decision or a petition for reconsideration of a final decision clearly 
and concisely setting forth the information relied upon to show the 
contrary.

Sec. 2.744   Production of NRC records and documents.

    (a) A request for the production of an NRC record or document not 
available pursuant to Sec. 2.790 by a party to an initial licensing 
proceeding may be served on the Executive Director for Operations, 
without leave of the Commission or the presiding officer. The request 
shall set forth the records or documents requested, either by individual 
item or by category, and shall describe each item or category with 
reasonable particularity and shall state why that record or document is 
relevant to the proceeding.
    (b) If the Executive Director for Operations objects to producing a 
requested record or document on the ground that (1) it is not relevant 
or (2) it is exempted from disclosure under Sec. 2.790 and the 
disclosure is not necessary to a proper decision in the proceeding or 
the document or the information therein is reasonably obtainable from 
another source, he shall so advise the requesting party.
    (c) If the Executive Director for Operations objects to producing a 
record or document, the requesting party may apply to the presiding 
officer, in writing, to compel production of that record or document. 
The application shall set forth the relevancy of the record or document 
to the issues in the proceeding. The application shall be processed as a 
motion in accordance with Sec. 2.730 (a) through (d). The record or 
document covered by the application shall be produced for the ``in 
camera'' inspection of the presiding officer, exclusively, if requested 
by the presiding officer and only to the extent necessary to determine:
    (1) The relevancy of that record or document;
    (2) Whether the document is exempt from disclosure under Sec. 2.790;
    (3) Whether the disclosure is necessary to a proper decision in the 
proceeding;
    (4) Whether the document or the information therein is reasonably 
obtainable from another source.
    (d) Upon a determination by the presiding officer that the 
requesting party has demonstrated the relevancy of the record or 
document and that its production is not exempt from disclosure under 
Sec. 2.790 or that, if exempt, its disclosure is necessary to a proper 
decision in the proceeding, and the document or the information therein 
is not reasonably obtainable from another source, he shall order the 
Executive Director for Operations, to produce the document.
    (e) In the case of requested documents and records (including 
Safeguards Information referred to in sections 147 and 181 of the Atomic 
Energy Act, as amended) exempt from disclosure under Sec. 2.790, but 
whose disclosure is found by the presiding officer to be necessary to a 
proper decision in the proceeding, any order to the Executive Director 
for Operations to produce the document or records (or any other order 
issued ordering production of the document or records) may contain such 
protective terms and conditions (including affidavits of non-disclosure) 
as may be necessary and appropriate to limit the disclosure to parties 
in the proceeding, to interested States and other governmental entities 
participating pursuant to Sec. 2.715(c), and to their qualified 
witnesses and counsel. When Safeguards Information protected from 
disclosure under section 147 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, is 
received and possessed by a party other than the Commission staff, it 
shall also be protected according to the requirements of Sec. 73.21 of 
this chapter. The presiding officer may also prescribe such additional 
procedures as will effectively safeguard and prevent disclosure of 
Safeguards Information to unauthorized persons with minimum impairment 
of the procedural rights which would be available if Safeguards 
Information were not involved. In addition to any other sanction that 
may be imposed by the presiding officer for

[[Page 70]]

violation of an order issued pursuant to this paragraph, violation of an 
order pertaining to the disclosure of Safeguards Information protected 
from disclosure under section 147 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, 
may be subject to a civil penalty imposed pursuant to Sec. 2.205. For 
the purpose of imposing the criminal penalties contained in section 223 
of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, any order issued pursuant to this 
paragraph with respect to Safeguards Information shall be deemed an 
order issued under section 161b of the Atomic Energy Act.
    (f) A ruling by the presiding officer or the Commission for the 
production of a record or document will specify the time, place, and 
manner of production.
    (g) No request pursuant to this section shall be made or entertained 
before the matters in controversy have been identified by the Commission 
or the presiding officer, or after the beginning of the prehearing 
conference held pursuant to Sec. 2.752 except upon leave of the 
presiding officer for good cause shown.
    (h) The provisions of Sec. 2.740 (c) and (e) shall apply to 
production of NRC records and documents pursuant to this section.

                    Summary Disposition on Pleadings


<R05>
Sec. 2.749   Authority of presiding officer to dispose of certain issues on the pleadings.

    (a) Any party to a proceeding may move, with or without supporting 
affidavits, for a decision by the presiding officer in that party's 
favor as to all or any part of the matters involved in the proceeding. 
The moving party shall annex to the motion a separate, short, and 
concise statement of the material facts as to which the moving party 
contends that there is no genuine issue to be heard. Motions may be 
filed at any time. Any other party may serve an answer supporting or 
opposing the motion, with or without affidavits, within twenty (20) days 
after service of the motion. The party shall annex to any answer 
opposing the motion a separate, short, and concise statement of the 
material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue 
to be heard. All material facts set forth in the statement required to 
be served by the moving party will be deemed to be admitted unless 
controverted by the statement required to be served by the opposing 
party. The opposing party may, within ten (10) days after service, 
respond in writing to new facts and arguments presented in any statement 
filed in support of the motion. No further supporting statements or 
responses thereto may be entertained. The presiding officer may dismiss 
summarily or hold in abeyance motions filed shortly before the hearing 
commences or during the hearing if the other parties or the presiding 
officer would be required to divert substantial resources from the 
hearing in order to respond adequately to the motion and thereby extend 
the proceeding.
    (b) Affidavits shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in 
evidence and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to 
testify to the matters stated therein. The presiding officer may permit 
affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to 
interrogatories or further affidavits. When a motion for summary 
decision is made and supported as provided in this section, a party 
opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of 
his answer; his answer by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this 
section must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine 
issue of fact. If no such answer is filed, the decision sought, if 
appropriate, shall be rendered.
    (c) Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the 
motion that he cannot, for reasons stated, present by affidavit facts 
essential to justify his opposition, the presiding officer may refuse 
the application for summary decision or may order a continuance to 
permit affidavits to be obtained or make such other order as is 
appropriate and a determination to that effect shall be made a matter of 
record.
    (d) The presiding officer shall render the decision sought if the 
filings in the proceeding, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and 
admissions on file,

[[Page 71]]

together with the statements of the parties and the affidavits, if any, 
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. However, in 
any proceeding involving a construction permit for a production or 
utilization facility, the procedure described in this section may be 
used only for the determination of specific subordinate issues and may 
not be used to determine the ultimate issue as to whether the permit 
shall be issued.

<R05>
Sec. 2.750   Official reporter; transcript.

    (a) A hearing will be reported under the supervision of the 
presiding officer, stenographically or by other means, by an official 
reporter who may be designated from time to time by the Commission or 
may be a regular employee of the Commission. The transcript prepared by 
the reporter shall be the sole official transcript of the proceeding. 
Except as limited pursuant to section 181 of the Act or order of the 
Commission, the transcript will be open for inspection at the Public 
Document Room. Copies of transcripts are available to parties and to the 
public from the official reporter on payment of the charges fixed 
therefor.
    (b) Transcript corrections. Corrections of the official transcript 
may be made only in the manner provided by this paragraph. Corrections 
ordered or approved by the presiding officer shall be included in the 
record as an appendix, and when so incorporated the Secretary shall make 
the necessary physical corrections in the official transcript so that it 
will incorporate the changes ordered. In making corrections there shall 
be no substitution of pages but, to the extent practicable, corrections 
shall be made by running a line through the matter to be changed without 
obliteration and writing the matter as changed immediately above. Where 
the correction consists of an insertion, it shall be added by rider or 
interlineation as near as possible to the text which is intended to 
precede and follow it.
    (c) Free transcript. Except in an antitrust proceeding, in any 
adjudicatory proceeding on an application for a license or an amendment 
thereto, the presiding officer may arrange for provision of one free 
transcript to a party, other than the applicant, upon request by that 
party. The transcript will be made available to a party at the same time 
and location as it is made available to the NRC staff. If a transcript 
is mailed to the staff, it will also be mailed to the requesting party. 
A presiding officer has the discretion to control the distribution of 
transcripts to parties.\1\

to the proceeding. Objections to the order may be filed by a party 
within five (5) days after service of the order, except that the staff 
may file objections to such order within ten (10) days after service. 
Parties may not file replies to the objections unless the Board so

presiding officer so orders. The board may revise the order in 
consideration of the objections presented and, as permitted by 
Sec. 2.718(i), may certify for determination to the Commission such 
matters raised in the objections as it deems appropriate. The order 
shall control the subsequent course of the proceeding unless modified

a proceeding on an application for a construction permit or an operating 
license for a facility of a type described in Secs. 50.21(b) or 50.22 of 
this chapter or a testing facility, shall direct the parties or their 
counsel to appear at a specified time and place for a conference to 
consider:
    (1) Simplification, clarification, and specification of the issues;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amending the pleadings;
    (3) The obtaining of stipulations and admissions of fact and of the

<R05>
Sec. 2.753   Stipulations.

    Apart from any stipulations made during or as a result of a 
prehearing conference, the parties may stipulate in writing at any stage 
of the proceeding or orally during the hearing, any relevant fact or the 
contents or authenticity of any document. Such a stipulation may be

days after filing of proposed findings and conclusions of law and briefs 
by other parties.
    (b) Failure to file proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law or 
briefs when directed to do so may be deemed a default, and an order or 
initial decision may be entered accordingly.
    (c) Proposed findings of fact must be clearly and concisely set 
forth in numbered paragraphs and must be confined to the material issues 
of fact presented on the record, with exact citations to the transcript 
of record and exhibits in support of each proposed finding. Proposed 
conclusions of law must be set forth in numbered paragraphs as to all 
material issues of law or discretion presented on the record. An

presiding officer may:
    (a) Limit the number of witnesses whose testimony may be cumulative;
    (b) Strike argumentative, repetitious, cumulative, or irrelevant 
evidence;
    (c) Take necessary and proper measures to prevent argumentative, 
repetitious, or cumulative cross-examination; and

<R05>
Sec. 2.758   Consideration of Commission rules and regulations in adjudicatory proceedings.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section, any rule or regulation of the Commission, or any provision 
thereof, issued in its program for the licensing of production and 
utilization facilities, source material, special nuclear material, or 
byproduct material is not subject to attack by way of discovery, proof, 
argument, or other means in any adjudicatory proceeding involving 
initial or renewal licensing subject to this subpart.
    (b) A party to an adjudicatory proceeding involving initial or 
renewal licensing subject to this subpart may petition that the 
application of a specified Commission rule or regulation or any 
provision thereof, of the type described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, be waived or an exception made for the particular proceeding. 
The sole ground for petition for waiver or exception shall be that 
special circumstances with respect to the subject matter of the 
particular proceeding are such that the application of the rule or 
regulation (or provision thereof) would not serve the purposes for which 
the rule or regulation was adopted. The petition shall be accompanied by 
an affidavit that identifies the specific aspect or aspects of the 
subject matter of the proceeding as to which the application of the rule 
or regulation (or provision thereof) would not serve the purposes for 
which the rule or regulation was adopted, and shall set forth with 
particularity the special circumstances alleged to justify the waiver or 
exception requested. Any other party may file a response thereto, by 
counter affidavit or otherwise.
    (c) If, on the basis of the petition, affidavit and any response 
thereto provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the presiding 
officer determines that the petitioning party has not made a prima facie 
showing that the application of the specific Commission rule or 
regulation or provision thereof to a particular aspect or aspects of the 
subject matter of the proceeding would not serve the purposes for which 
the rule or regulation was adopted and that application of the rule or 
regulation should be waived or an exception granted, no evidence may be 
received on that matter and no discovery, cross-examination or argument 
directed to the matter will be permitted, and the presiding officer may 
not further consider the matter.
    (d) If, on the basis of the petition, affidavit and any response 
provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the presiding officer 
determines that such a prima facie showing has been made, the presiding 
officer shall, before ruling thereon, certify directly to the 
Commission<SUP>7 for determination the matter of whether the application 
of the Commission rule or regulation or provision thereof to a 
particular aspect or aspects of the subject matter of the proceeding, in 
the context of this section, should be waived or an exception made. The 
Commission may, among other things, on the basis of the petition, 
affidavits, and any response, determine whether the application of the 
specified rule or regulation (or provision thereof) should be waived or 
an exception be made, or the Commission may direct such further 
proceedings as it deems appropriate to aid its determination.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>7 The matter will be certified to the Commission 
notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 2.785.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Whether or not the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section is 
available, a party to an initial or renewal licensing proceeding may 
file a petition for rulemaking pursuant to Sec. 2.802.

<R05>
Sec. 2.759   Settlement in initial licensing proceedings.

    The Commission recognizes that the public interest may be served 
through settlement of particular issues in a proceeding or the entire 
proceeding. Therefore, to the extent that it is not inconsistent with 
hearing requirements in section 189 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2239), the 
fair and reasonable settlement of contested initial licensing 
proceedings is encouraged. It is expected

[[Page 75]]

that the presiding officer and all of the parties to those proceedings 
will take appropriate steps to carry out this purpose.

                 Initial Decision and Commission Review


<R05>
Sec. 2.760   Initial decision and its effect.

    (a) After hearing, the presiding officer will render an initial 
decision which will constitute the final action of the Commission forty 
(40) days after its date unless any party petitions for Commission 
review in accordance with Sec. 2.786 or the Commission takes review sua 
sponte or the decision is subject to the provisions of Sec. 2.764.
    (b) Where the public interest so requires, the Commission may direct 
that the presiding officer certify the record to it without an initial 
decision, and may:
    (1) Prepare its own decision which will become final unless the 
Commission grants a petition for reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 2.771; 
or
    (2) Omit an initial decision on a finding that due and timely 
execution of its functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires.
    (c) An initial decision will be in writing and will be based on the 
whole record and supported by reliable, probative, and substantial 
evidence. The initial decision will include:
    (1) Findings, conclusions and rulings, with the reasons or basis for 
them, on all material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on 
the record;
    (2) All facts officially noticed and relied on in making the 
decision;
    (3) The appropriate ruling, order or denial of relief with the 
effective date;
    (4) The time within which a petition for review of the decision may 
be filed, the time within which answers in support of or in opposition 
to a petition for review filed by another party may be filed and, in the 
case of an initial decision which may become final in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section, the date when it may become final.

<R05>
Sec. 2.760a   Initial decision in contested proceedings on applications for facility operating licenses.

    In any initial decision in a contested proceeding on an application 
for an operating license for a production or utilization facility, the 
presiding officer shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law on 
the matters put into controversy by the parties to the proceeding and on 
matters which have been determined to be the issues in the proceeding by 
the Commission or the presiding officer. Matters not put into 
controversy by the parties will be examined and decided by the presiding 
officer only where he or she determines that a serious safety, 
environmental, or common defense and security matter exists. Depending 
on the resolution of those matters, the Director of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as

and is of the type specified in Sec. 51.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 
of this chapter or is a testing facility, the presiding officer shall, 
unless the parties agree otherwise or the rights of any party would be 
prejudiced thereby, commence a hearing on issues covered by 
Sec. 50.10(e)(2)(ii) and subpart A of part 51 of this chapter as soon as 
practicable after issuance of the staff of its final environmental 
impact statement, but no later than thirty (30) days after issuance of 
such statement, and complete such a hearing and issue an initial

Sec. 2.764  Immediate effectiveness of initial decision directing issuance or amendment of construction permit or operating license.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this 
section, or as otherwise ordered by the Commission in special 
circumstances, an initial decision directing the issuance or amendment 
of a construction permit, a construction authorization, an operating 
license, or a license under 10 CFR part 72 to store spent fuel in an 
independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) at a reactor site 
shall be effective immediately upon issuance unless the presiding 
officer finds that good cause has been shown by a party why the initial 
decision should not become immediately effective, subject to review 
thereof and further decision by the Commission upon petition for review 
filed by any party pursuant to Sec. 2.786 or upon its own motion.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this 
section, or as otherwise ordered by the Commission in special 
circumstances, the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, notwithstanding 
the filing or granting of a petition for review, shall issue a 
construction permit, a construction authorization, an operating license, 
or a license under 10 CFR part 72 to store spent fuel in an independent 
spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) at a reactor site, or amendments 
thereto, authorized by an initial decision, within ten (10) days from 
the date of issuance of the decision.
    (c) An initial decision directing the issuance of an initial license 
for the

[[Page 77]]

construction and operation of an independent spent fuel storage 
installation (ISFSI) located at a site other than a reactor site or a 
monitored retrievable storage installation (MRS) under 10 CFR part 72 
shall become effective only upon order of the Commission. The Director 
of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards shall not issue an initial 
license for the construction and operation of an independent spent fuel 
storage installation (ISFSI) located at a site other than a reactor site 
or a monitored retrievable storage installation (MRS) under 10 CFR part 
72 until expressly authorized to do so by the Commission.
    (d)  [Reserved]
    (e) Nuclear power reactor construction permits--(1) Atomic Safety 
and Licensing Boards.
    (i) Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards shall hear and decide all 
issues that come before them, indicating in their decisions the type of 
licensing action, if any, which their decision would authorize. The 
Boards' decisions concerning construction permits shall not become 
effective until the Commission actions outlined in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section have taken place.
    (ii) In reaching their decisions the Boards should interpret 
existing regulations and regulatory policies with due consideration to 
the implications for those regulations and policies of the Three Mile 
Island accident. As provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, in 
addition to taking generic rulemaking actions, the Commission will be 
providing case-by-case guidance on changes in regulatory policies in 
conducting its reviews in adjudicatory proceedings. The Boards shall, in 
turn, apply these revised regulations and policies in cases then pending 
before them to the extent that they are applicable. The Commission 
expects the Licensing Boards to pay particular attention in their 
decisions to analyzing the evidence on those safety and environmental 
issues arising under applicable Commission regulations and policies 
which the Boards believe present serious, close questions and which the 
Boards believe may be crucial to whether a license should become 
effective before full appellate review is completed. Furthermore, the 
Boards should identify any apects of the case which in their judgment, 
present issues on which prompt Commission policy guidance is called for. 
The Boards may request the assistance of the parties in identifying such 
policy issues but, absent specific Commission directives, such policy 
issues shall not be the subject of discovery, examination, or cross-
examination.
    (2) Commission. Within sixty days of the service of any Licensing 
Board decision that would otherwise authorize issuance of a construction 
permit, the Commission will seek to issue a decision on any stay motions 
that are timely filed. Such motions shall be filed as provided by 10 CFR 
2.788. For the purpose of this policy, a ``stay'' motion is one that 
seeks to defer the effectiveness of a Licensing Board decision beyond 
the period necessary for the Commission action described herein. If no 
stay papers are filed, the Commission will, within the same time period 
(or earlier if possible), analyze the record and construction permit 
decision below on its own motion and will seek to issue a decision on 
whether a stay is warranted. It shall not, however, decide that a stay 
is warranted without giving the affected parties an opportunity to be 
heard. The initial decision will be considered stayed pending the 
Commission's decision. In deciding these stay questions, the Commission 
shall employ the procedures set out in 10 CFR 2.788.
    (f) Nuclear power reactor operating licenses--(1) Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Boards. (i) Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards shall hear and 
decide all issues that come before them, indicating in their decisions 
the type of licensing action, if any, which their decision would 
authorize. A Board's decision authorizing issuance of an operating 
license may not become effective insofar as it authorizes operating at 
greater than 5 percent of rated power until the Commission actions 
outlined below in paragraph (f)(2) of this section have taken place. 
Insofar as it authorizes operation up to 5 percent, the decision is 
effective and the Director shall issue the appropriate license in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 78]]

    (ii) In reaching their decisions the Boards should interpret 
existing regulations and regulatory policies with due consideration to 
the implications for those regulations and policies of the Three Mile 
Island accident. In this regard it should be understood that as a result 
of analyses still under way the Commission may change its present 
regulations and regulatory policies in important respects and thus 
compliance with existing regulations may turn out to no longer warrant 
approval of a license application. As provided in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section, in addition to taking generic rulemaking actions, the 
Commission will be providing case-by-case guidance on changes in 
regulatory policies in conducting its reviews in adjudicatory 
proceedings. The Boards shall, in turn, apply these revised regulations 
and policies in cases then pending before them to the extent that they 
are applicable. The Commission expects the Licensing Boards to pay 
particular attention in their decisions to analyzing the evidence on 
those safety and environmental issues arising under applicable 
Commission regulations and policies which the Boards believe present 
serious, close questions and which the Boards believe may be crucial to 
whether a license should become effective before full appellate review 
is completed. Furthermore, the Boards should identify any aspects of the 
case which in their judgment, present issues on which prompt Commission 
policy guidance is called for. The Boards may request the assistance of 
the parties in identifying such policy issues but, absent specific 
Commission directive, such policy issues shall not be the subject of 
discovery, examination, or cross-examination.
    (2) Commission. (i) Reserving the power to step in at an earlier 
time, the Commission will, upon receipt of the Licensing Board decision 
authorizing issuance of an operating license, other than a decision 
authorizing only fuel loading and low power (up to 5 percent of rated 
power) testing, review the matter on its own motion to determine whether 
to stay the effectiveness of the decision. An operating license decision 
will be stayed by the Commission, insofar as it authorizes other than 
fuel loading and low power testing, if it determines that it is in the 
public interest to do so, based on a consideration of the gravity of the 
substantive issue, the likelihood that it has been resolved incorrectly 
below, the degree to which correct resolution of the issue would be 
prejudiced by operation pending review, and other relevant public 
interest factors.
    (ii) For operating license decisions other than those authorizing 
only fuel loading and low power testing consistent with the target 
schedule set forth below, the parties may file brief comments with the 
Commission pointing out matters which, in their view, pertain to the 
immediate effectiveness issue. To be considered, such comments must be 
received within 10 days of the Board decision. However, the Commission 
may dispense with comments by so advising the parties. No extensive stay 
shall be issued without giving the affected parties an opportunity to be 
heard.
    (iii) The Commission intends to issue a stay decision within 30 days 
of receipt of the Licensing Board's decision. The Licensing Board's 
initial decision will be considered stayed pending the Commission's 
decision insofar as it may authorize operations other than fuel loading 
and low power (up to 5 percent of rated power) testing.
    (iv) In announcing a stay decision, the Commission may allow the 
proceeding to run its ordinary course or give instructions as to the 
future handling of the proceeding. Furthermore, the Commission may in a 
particular case determine that compliance with existing regulations and 
policies may no longer be sufficient to warrant approval of a license 
application and may alter those regulations and policies.
    (g) The Commission's effectiveness determination is entirely without 
prejudice to proceedings under Sec. 2.786 or Sec. 2.788.

Sec. 2.786  Review of decisions and actions of a presiding officer.

    (a) Within forty (40) days after the date of a decision or action by 
a presiding officer, or within thirty (30) days after a petition for 
review of the decision or action has been filed under paragraph (b) of 
this section, whichever is greater, the Commission may review the 
decision or action on its own motion, unless the Commission, in its 
discretion, extends the time for its review.
    (b)(1) Within fifteen (15) days after service of a full or partial 
initial decision by a presiding officer, and within fifteen (15) days 
after service of any other decision or action by a presiding officer 
with respect to which a petition for review is authorized by this part, 
a party may file a petition for review with the Commission on the 
grounds specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The filing of a 
petition for review is mandatory for a party to exhaust its 
administrative remedies before seeking judicial review.
    (2) A petition for review under this paragraph must be no longer 
than ten (10) pages, and must contain the following:
    (i) A concise summary of the decision or action of which review is 
sought;
    (ii) A statement (including record citation) where the matters of 
fact or law raised in the petition for review were previously raised 
before the presiding officer and, if they were not why they could not 
have been raised;
    (iii) A concise statement why in the petitioner's view the decision 
or action is erroneous; and
    (iv) A concise statement why Commission review should be exercised.
    (3) Any other party to the proceeding may, within ten (10) days 
after service of a petition for review, file an answer supporting or 
opposing Commission review. This answer must be no longer than ten (10) 
pages and should concisely address the matters in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section to the extent appropriate. The petitioning party shall have 
no right to reply, except as permitted by the Commission.
    (4) The petition for review may be granted in the discretion of the 
Commission, giving due weight to the existence of a substantial question 
with respect to the following considerations:
    (i) A finding of material fact is clearly erroneous or in conflict 
with a finding as to the same fact in a different proceeding;
    (ii) A necessary legal conclusion is without governing precedent or 
is a departure from or contrary to established law;
    (iii) A substantial and important question of law, policy or 
discretion has been raised;
    (iv) The conduct of the proceeding involved a prejudicial procedural 
error; or
    (v) Any other consideration which the Commission may deem to be in 
the public interest.
    (5) A petition for review will not be granted to the extent that it 
relies on matters that could have been but were not raised before the 
presiding officer. A matter raised sua sponte by a presiding officer has 
been raised before the presiding officer for the purpose of this 
section.
    (6) A petition for review will not be granted as to issues raised 
before the presiding officer on a pending motion for reconsideration.
    (c) If within thirty (30) days after the filing of a petition for 
review the Commission does not grant the petition, in whole or in part, 
the petition shall be deemed denied, unless the Commission in its 
discretion extends the time for its consideration of the petition and 
any answers thereto.
    (d) If a petition for review is granted, the Commission will issue 
an order specifying the issues to be reviewed and designating the 
parties to the review proceeding and direct that appropriate briefs be 
filed, oral argument be held, or both.
    (e) Petitions for reconsideration of Commission decisions granting 
or denying review in whole or in part will not be entertained. A 
petition for reconsideration of a Commission decision after review may 
be filed within ten (10) days, but is not necessary for exhaustion of 
administrative remedies. However, if a petition for reconsideration is 
filed, the Commission decision is not final until the petition is 
decided.

[[Page 83]]

    (f) Neither the filing nor the granting of a petition for review 
will stay the effect of the decision or action of the presiding officer, 
unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.
    (g) Certified questions and referred rulings. A question certified 
to the Commission under Sec. 2.718(i) or a ruling referred under 
Sec. 2.730(f) must meet one of the alternative standards in this 
subsection to merit Commission review. A certified question or referred 
ruling will be reviewed if it either--
    (1) Threatens the party adversely affected by it with immediate and 
serious irreparable impact which, as a practical matter, could not be 
alleviated through a petition for review of the presiding officer's 
final decision; or
    (2) Affects the basic structure of the proceeding in a pervasive or 
unusual manner.

<R05>
Sec. 2.788  Stays of decisions of presiding officers pending review.

    (a) Within ten (10) days after service of a decision or action of a 
presiding officer any party to the proceeding may file an application 
for a stay of the effectiveness of the decision or action pending filing 
of and a decision on a petition for review. This application may be 
filed with the Commission or the presiding officer, but not both at the 
same time.
    (b) An application for a stay must be no longer than ten (10) pages, 
exclusive of affidavits, and must contain the following:
    (1) A concise summary of the decision or action which is requested 
to be stayed;
    (2) A concise statement of the grounds for stay, with reference to 
the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (3) To the extent that an application for a stay relies on facts 
subject to dispute, appropriate references to the record or affidavits 
by knowledgeable persons.
    (c) Service of an application for a stay on the other parties shall 
be by the same method, e.g., telecopier message, mail, as the method for 
filing the application with the Commission or the presiding officer.
    (d) Within ten (10) days after service of an application for a stay 
under this section, any party may file an answer supporting or opposing 
the granting of a stay. This answer must be no longer than ten (10) 
pages, exclusive of affidavits, and should concisely address the matters 
in paragraph (b) of this section to the extent appropriate. No further 
replies to answers will be entertained. Filing of and service of an 
answer on the other parties must be by the same method, e.g., telecopier 
message, mail, as the method for filing the application for the stay.
    (e) In determining whether to grant or deny an application for a 
stay, the Commission or presiding officer will consider:
    (1) Whether the moving party has made a strong showing that it is 
likely to prevail on the merits;
    (2) Whether the party will be irreparably injured unless a stay is 
granted;
    (3) Whether the granting of a stay would harm other parties; and
    (4) Where the public interest lies.
    (f) In extraordinary cases, where prompt application is made under 
this section, the Commission or presiding officer may grant a temporary 
stay to preserve the status quo without waiting for filing of any 
answer. The application may be made orally provided the application is 
promptly confirmed by telecopier message. Any party applying under this 
paragraph shall make all reasonable efforts to inform the other parties 
of the application, orally if made orally.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of 
this section, final NRC records and documents,<SUP>8 including but not 
limited to correspondence to and from the NRC regarding the issuance, 
denial, amendment, transfer, renewal, modification, suspension,

[[Page 84]]

part shall not, in the absence of a compelling reason for nondisclosure 
after a balancing of the interests of the person or agency urging 
nondisclosure and the public interest in disclosure, be exempt from 
disclosure and will be made available for inspection and copying in the 
NRC Public Document Room, except for matters that are:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>8 Such records and documents do not include handwritten notes 
and drafts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and (ii) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
Executive order;
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 
U.S.C.) 552(b), provided that such statute (i) requires that the matters 
be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion 
on the issue, or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or 
refers to particular types or matters to be withheld.
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Interagency or intraagency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the Commission;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information.
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority, or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential 
source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual;
    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition 
reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; 
or
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (b)(1) A person who proposes that a document or a part be withheld 
in whole or part from public disclosure on the ground that it contains 
trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial 
information shall submit an application for withholding accompanied by 
an affidavit which:
    (i) Identifies the document or part sought to be withheld and the 
position of the person making the affidavit, and
    (ii) Contains a full statement of the reasons on the basis of which 
it is claimed that the information should be withheld from public 
disclosure. Such statement shall address with specificity the 
considerations listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. In the case 
of an affidavit submitted by a company, the affidavit shall be executed 
by an officer or upper-level management official who has been 
specifically delegated the function of reviewing the information sought 
to be withheld and authorized to apply for its withholding on behalf of 
the company. The affidavit shall be executed by the owner of the 
information, even though the information sought to be withheld is 
submitted to the Commission by another person. The application and 
affidavit shall be

[[Page 85]]

submitted at the time of filing the information sought to be withheld. 
The information sought to be withheld shall be incorporated, as far as 
possible, into a separate paper. The affiant may designate with 
appropriate markings information submitted in the affidavit as a trade 
secret or confidential or privileged commercial or financial information 
within the meaning of Sec. 9.17(a)(4) of this chapter and such 
information shall be subject to disclosure only in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 9.19 of this chapter.
    (2) A person who submits commercial or financial information 
believed to be privileged or confidential or a trade secret shall be on 
notice that it is the policy of the Commission to achieve an effective 
balance between legitimate concerns for protection of competitive 
positions and the right of the public to be fully apprised as to the 
basis for and effects of licensing or rule making actions, and that it 
is within the discretion of the Commission to withhold such information 
from public disclosure.
    (3) The Commission shall determine whether information sought to be 
withheld from public disclosure pursuant to this paragraph: (i) is a 
trade secret or confidential or privileged commercial or financial 
information; and (ii) if so, should be withheld from public disclosure.
    (4) In making the determination required by paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section, the Commission will consider:
    (i) Whether the information has been held in confidence by its 
owner;
    (ii) Whether the information is of a type customarily held in 
confidence by its owner and whether there is a rational basis therefor;
    (iii) Whether the information was transmitted to and received by the 
Commission in confidence;
    (iv) Whether the information is available in public sources;
    (v) Whether public disclosure of the information sought to be 
withheld is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position 
of the owner of the information, taking into account the value of the 
information to the owner; the amount of effort or money, if any, 
expended by the owner in developing the information; and the ease or 
difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or 
duplicated by others.
    (5) If the Commission determines, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, that the record or document contains trade secrets or 
privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, the 
Commission will then determine (i) whether the right of the public to be 
fully apprised as to the bases for and effects of the proposed action 
outweighs the demonstrated concern for protection of a competitive 
position and (ii) whether the information should be withheld from public 
disclosure pursuant to this paragraph. If the record or document for 
which withholding is sought is deemed by the Commission to be irrelevant 
or unnecessary to the performance of its functions, it shall be returned 
to the applicant.
    (6) Withholding from public inspection shall not affect the right, 
if any, of persons properly and directly concerned to inspect the 
document. The Commission may require information claimed to be a trade 
secret or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information 
to be subject to inspection: (i) Under a protective agreement, by 
contractor personnel or government officials other than NRC officials; 
(ii) by the presiding officer in a proceeding; and (iii) under 
protective order, by parties to a proceeding, pending a decision of the 
Commission on the matter of whether the information should be made 
publicly available or when a decision has been made that the information 
should be withheld from public disclosure. In camera sessions of 
hearings may be held when the information sought to be withheld is 
produced or offered in evidence. If the Commission subsequently 
determines that the information should be disclosed, the information and 
the transcript of such in camera session will be made publicly 
available.
    (c) If a request for withholding pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section is denied, the Commission will notify an applicant for 
withholding of the denial with a statement of reasons. The notice of 
denial will specify a time, not less than thirty (30) days after the 
date of the notice, when the document will

[[Page 86]]

be placed in the Public Document Room. If, within the time specified in 
the notice, the applicant requests withdrawal of the document, the 
document will not be placed in the Public Document Room and will be 
returned to the applicant: Provided, That information submitted in a 
rule making proceeding which subsequently forms the basis for the final 
rule will not be withheld from public disclosure by the Commission and 
will not be returned to the applicant after denial of any application 
for withholding submitted in connection with that information. If a 
request for withholding pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section is 
granted, the Commission will notify the applicant of its determination 
to withhold the information from public disclosure.
    (d) The following information shall be deemed to be commercial or 
financial information within the meaning of Sec. 9.17(a)(4) of this 
chapter and shall be subject to disclosure only in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 9.19 of this chapter.
    (1) Correspondence and reports to or from the NRC which contain 
information or records concerning a licensee's or applicant's physical 
protection or material control and accounting program for special 
nuclear material not otherwise designated as Safeguards Information or 
classified as National Security Information or Restricted Data.
    (2) Information submitted in confidence to the Commission by a 
foreign source.
    (e) The presiding officer, if any, or the Commission may, with 
reference to the NRC records and documents made available pursuant to 
this section, issue orders consistent with the provisions of this 
section and Sec. 2.740(c).

petition of any other interested person.


<R05>
Sec. 2.802  Petition for rulemaking.

    (a) Any interested person may petition the Commission to issue, 
amend or rescind any regulation. The petition should be addressed to the 
Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, 
Attention: Chief, Docketing and Service Branch.
    (b) A prospective petitioner may consult with the NRC before filing 
a petition for rulemaking by writing the Director, Freedom of 
Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Chief, 
Rules Review and Directives Branch. A prospective petitioner may also

limited to--
    (i) Describing the procedure and process for filing and responding 
to a petition for rulemaking;
    (ii) Clarifying an existing NRC regulation and the basis for the

issues of concern to the petitioner.
    (2) In any consultation prior to the filing of a petition for 
rulemaking, in providing the assistance permitted in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, the NRC staff will not draft or develop text or 
alternative approaches to address matters in the prospective petition 
for rulemaking.
    (c) Each petition filed under this section shall:

forth the specific issues involved, the petitioner's views or arguments 
with respect to those issues, relevant technical, scientific or other 
data involved which is reasonably available to the petitioner, and such 
other pertinent information as the petitioner deems necessary to support 
the action sought. In support of its petition, petitioner should note 
any specific cases of which petitioner is aware where the current rule 
is unduly burdensome, deficient, or needs to be strengthened.
    (d) The petitioner may request the Commission to suspend all or any

that the petition does not include the information required by paragraph 
(c) of this section and is incomplete, the petitioner will be notified 
of that determination and the respects in which the petition is 
deficient and will be accorded an opportunity to submit additional data. 
Ordinarily this determination will be made within 30 days from the date

petitioner that the petition is incomplete, the petition may be returned 
to the petitioner without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to 
file a new petition.

<R05>
Sec. 2.803   Determination of petition.

    No hearing will be held on the petition unless the Commission deems 
it advisable. If the Commission determines that sufficient reason

case, it will deny the petition and will notify the petitioner with a 
simple statement of the grounds of denial.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, when the 
Commission proposes to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation, it will 
cause to be published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed 
rulemaking, unless all persons subject to the notice are named and 
either are personally served or otherwise have actual notice in 
accordance with law.
    (b) The notice will include:
    (1) Either the terms or substance of the proposed rule, or a

    (2) When the Commission for good cause finds that notice and public 
comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest, and are not required by statute. This finding, and the reasons 
therefor, will be incorporated into any rule issued without notice and 
comment for good cause.
    (e) The Commission shall provide for a 30-day post-promulgation 
comment period for--
    (1) Any rule adopted without notice and comment under the good cause 
exception on paragraph (d)(2) of this section where the basis is that 
notice and comment is ``impracticable'' or ``contrary to the public 
interest.''
    (2) Any interpretative rule, or general statement of policy adopted 
without notice and comment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
except for those cases for which the Commission finds that such 
procedures would serve no public interest, or would be so burdensome as 
to outweigh any foreseeable gain.
    (f) For any post-promulgation comments received under paragraph (e) 
of this section, the Commission shall publish a statement in the Federal 
Register containing an evaluation of the significant comments and any 
revisions of the rule or policy statement made as a result of the 
comments and their evaluation.

published in the notice of rule making.


<R05>

briefs, motions, responses or other pleadings, where such schedules may 
differ from those elsewhere prescribed in these rules or where these 
rules do not prescribe a schedule;
    (b) Rule on motions for extensions of time;
    (c) Reject motions, briefs, pleadings, and other documents filed 
with the Commission later than the time prescribed by the Secretary or

<R05>
Sec. 2.809  Participation by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards.

    (a) In its advisory capacity to the Commission, the ACRS may 
recommend that the Commission initiate rulemaking in a particular area. 
The Commission will respond to such rulemaking recommendation in writing 
within 90 days, noting its intent to implement, study, or defer action 
on the recommendation. In the event the Commission decides not to accept 
or decides to defer action on the recommendation, it will give its 
reasons for doing so. Both the ACRS recommendation and the Commission's 
response will be placed in the NRC Public Document Room following 
transmittal of the Commission's response to the ACRS.
    (b) When a rule involving nuclear safety matters within the purview 
of the ACRS is under development by the NRC Staff, the Staff will ensure 
that the ACRS is given an opportunity to provide advice at appropriate 
stages and to identify issues to be considered during rulemaking 
hearings.

<R05>
Sec. 2.810  NRC size standards.

    The NRC shall use the size standards contained in this section to 
determine whether a licensee qualifies as a small entity in its 
regulatory programs.
    (a) A small business is a for-profit concern and is a--
    (1) Concern that provides a service or a concern not engaged in 
manufacturing with average gross receipts of $5 million or less over its 
last 3 completed fiscal years; or
    (2) Manufacturing concern with an average number of 500 or fewer 
employees based upon employment during each pay period for the preceding 
12 calendar months.
    (b) A small organization is a not-for-profit organization which is 
independently owned and operated and has annual gross receipts of $5 
million or less.
    (c) A small governmental jurisdiction is a government of a city, 
county, town, township, village, school district, or special district 
with a population of less than 50,000.
    (d) A small educational institution is one that is--
    (1) Supported by a qualifying small governmental jurisdiction; or
    (2) Not state or publicly supported and has 500 or fewer employees.
    (e) For the purposes of this section, the NRC shall use the Small 
Business Administration definition of receipts (13 CFR 121.402(b)(2)). A 
licensee who is a subsidiary of a large entity does not qualify as a 
small entity for purposes of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 2.905   Access to restricted data and national security information for parties; security clearances.

    (a) Access to restricted data and national security information 
introduced into proceedings. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this 
section, restricted data or national security information introduced 
into a proceeding subject to this part will be made available to any 
interested party having the required security clearance; to counsel for 
an interested party provided the counsel has the required security 
clearance; and to such additional persons having the required security 
clearance as the Commission or the presiding officer determined are 
needed by such party for adequate preparation or presentation of his 
case. Where the interest of such party will not be prejudiced, the 
Commission or presiding officer may postpone action upon an application 
for access under this paragraph until after a notice of hearing, 
answers, and replies have been filed.
    (b) Access to Restricted Data or National Security Information not 
introduced into proceedings.
    (1) On application showing that access to Restricted Data or 
National Security Information may be required for the preparation of a 
party's case, and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, 
the Commission or the presiding officer will issue an order granting 
access to such Restricted Data or National Security Information to the 
party upon his obtaining the required security clearance, to counsel for 
the party upon their obtaining the required security clearance, and to 
such other individuals as may be needed by the party for the preparation 
and presentation of his case upon their obtaining the required 
clearance.
    (2) Where the interest of the party applying for access will not be 
prejudiced, the Commission or the presiding officer may postpone action 
on an application pursuant to this paragraph until after a notice of 
hearing, answers and replies have been filed.
    (c) The Commission will consider requests for appropriate security 
clearances in reasonable numbers pursuant

[[Page 91]]

to this section. A reasonable charge will be made by the Commission for 
costs of security clearance pursuant to this section.
    (d) The presiding officer may certify to the Commission for its 
consideration and determination any questions relating to access to 
Restricted Data or National Security Information arising under this 
section. Any party affected by a determination or order of the presiding 
officer under this section may appeal forthwith to the Commission from

National Security Information shall stay the order pending determination 
of the appeal by the Commission.
    (e) Application granting access to restricted data or national 
security information.
    (1) An application under this section for orders granting access to 
restricted data or national security information not received from 
another Government agency will normally be acted upon by the presiding 
officer, or if a proceeding is not before a presiding officer, by the 
Commission.
    (2) An application under this section for orders granting access to 
restricted data or national security information where the information 
has been received by the Commission from another Government agency will 
be acted upon by the Commission.
    (f) To the extent practicable, an application for an order granting 
access under this section shall describe the subjects of Restricted Data 
or National Security Information to which access is desired and the 
level of classification (confidential, secret or other) of the 
information; the reasons why access to the information is requested; the 
names of individuals for whom clearances are requested; and the reasons 
why security clearances are being requested for those individuals.
    (g) On the conclusion of a proceeding, the Commission will terminate 
all orders issued in the proceeding for access to Restricted Data or 
National Security Information and all security clearances granted 
pursuant to them; and may issue such orders requiring the disposal of 
classified matter received pursuant to them or requiring the observance 
of other procedures to safeguard such classified matter as it deems 
necessary to protect Restricted Data or National Security Information.
    (h) Refusal to grant access to restricted data or national security 
information.
    (1) The Commission will not grant access to restricted data or 
national security information unless it determines that the granting of 
access will not be inimical to the common defense and security.
    (2) Access to Restricted Data or National Security Information which 
has been received by the Commission from another Government agency will 
not be granted by the Commission if the originating agency determines in 
writing that access should not be granted. The Commission will consult 
the originating agency prior to granting access to such data or 
information received from another Government agency.

introduction of Restricted Data or National Security Information into 
the proceeding, it will file a notice of intent to introduce Restricted 
Data or National Security Information.
    (b) If, at the time of filing of an answer to the notice of hearing 
it appears to the party filing that it will be impracticable for the 
party to avoid the introduction of Restricted Data or National Security 
Information into the proceeding, the party shall state in the answer a 
notice of intent to introduce Restricted Data or National Security 
Information into the proceeding.

[[Page 92]]

    (c) If, at any later stage of a proceeding, it appears to any party 
that it will be impracticable to avoid the introduction of Restricted 
Data or National Security Information into the proceeding, the party 
shall give to the other parties prompt written notice of intent to 
introduce Restricted Data or National Security Information into the 
proceeding.
    (d) Restricted Data or National Security Information shall not be 
introduced into a proceeding after publication of a notice of hearing

required by Sec. 2.907(c), may be given orally on the record.


<R05>
Sec. 2.909   Rearrangement or suspension of proceedings.

    In any proceeding subject to this part where a party gives a notice 
of intent to introduce Restricted Data or other National Security 
Information, and the presiding officer determines that any other 
interested party does not have required security clearances, the 
presiding officer may in his discretion:
    (a) Rearrange the normal order of the proceeding in a manner which 
gives such interested parties an opportunity to obtain required security 
clearances with minimum delay in the conduct of the proceeding.
    (b) Suspend the proceeding or any portion of it until all interested 
parties have had opportunity to obtain required security clearances. No 
proceeding shall be suspended for such reasons for more than 100 days 
except with the consent of all parties or on a determination by the 
presiding officer that further suspension of the proceeding would not be 
contrary to the public interest.
    (c) Take such other action as he determines to be in the best 
interest of all parties and the public.


<R05>
Sec. 2.910   Unclassified statements required.

    (a) Whenever Restricted Data or other National Security Information 
is introduced into a proceeding, the party offering it shall submit to 
the presiding officer and to all parties to the proceeding an 
unclassified statement setting forth the information in the classified 
matter as accurately and completely as possible.
    (b) In accordance with such procedures as may be agreed upon by the 
parties or prescribed by the presiding officer, and after notice to all 
parties and opportunity to be heard thereon, the presiding officer shall 
determine whether the unclassified statement or any portion of it, 
together with any appropriate modifications suggested by any party, may 
be substituted for the classified matter or any portion of it without 
prejudice to the interest of any party or to the public interest.
    (c) If the presiding officer determines that the unclassified 
statement, together with such unclassified modifications as he finds are 
necessary or appropriate to protect the interest of other parties and 
the public interest, adequately sets forth information in the classified 
matter which is relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding, 
he shall direct that the classified matter be excluded from the record 
of the proceeding. His determination will be considered by the

[[Page 93]]

Commission as a part of the decision in the event of review.
    (d) If the presiding officer determines that an unclassified 
statement does not adequately present the information contained in the 
classified matter which is relevant and material to the issues in the 
proceeding, he shall include his reasons in his determination. This 
determination shall be included as part of the record and will be 
considered by the Commission in the event of review of the 
determination.
    (e) The presiding officer may postpone all or part of the procedures 
established in this section until the reception of all other evidence 
has been completed. Service of the unclassified statement required in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall not be postponed if any party does 
not have access to Restricted Data or other National Security 
Information.


<R05>
Sec. 2.911   Admissibility of restricted data or other national security information.

National Security Information to the issues in the preceeding, and its 
competence, are clearly established; and
    (b) The exclusion of the Restricted Data or other National Security 
Information would prejudice the interests of a party or the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 2.912   Weight to be attached to classified evidence.

    In considering the weight and effect of any Restricted Data or other 
National Security Information received in evidence to which an 
interested party has not had opportunity to receive access, the 
presiding officer and the Commission shall give to such evidence such 
weight as is appropriate under the circumstances, taking into 
consideration any lack of opportunity to rebut or impeach the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 2.913   Review of Restricted Data or other National Security Information received in evidence.

    At the close of the reception of evidence, the presiding officer 
shall review the record and shall direct that any Restricted Data or 
other National Security Information be expunged from the record where 
such expunction would not prejudice the interests of a party or the 
public interest. Such directions by the presiding officer will be

opinion.
    (D) Sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists 
with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. This showing must 
include reference to the specific documentary material that provides a 
basis for the contention, or if the petitioner believes that any 
documentary material fails to contain information on a relevant matter 
as required by law, the identification of each failure and the 
supporting reasons for the petitioner's belief. In determining whether a 
genuine dispute exists on a material issue of law or fact, a dispositive 
factor shall be whether the contention, if proven,

[[Page 105]]

would be of no consequence in the proceeding because it would not 
entitle the petitioner to relief.
    (E) The specific regulatory or statutory requirement to which the 
contention is relevant.
    (3) Any petitioner who fails to satisfy paragraphs (a)(2) (ii) and 
(iii) of this section with respect to at least one contention shall not 
be permitted to participate as a party.
    (4) Any party may amend its contentions specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section. The Presiding Officer shall rule on any 
petition to amend such contentions based on the balancing of the factors 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and a showing that a 
significant safety or environmental issue is involved or that the 
amended contention raises a material issue related to the performance 
evaluation anticipated by Secs. 60.112 and 60.113 of this chapter.
    (b) Any party or interested governmental participant may file an 
answer to a petition for leave to intervene or a petition to amend 
contentions within twenty days after service of the petition.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Commission, or 
the Presiding Officer designated to rule on petitions to intervene and/
or requests for hearing shall permit intervention, in any hearing on an 
application for a license to receive and possess high-level radioactive 
waste at a geologic repository operations area, by an affected unit of 
local government as defined in section 2(31) of the Nuclear Waste Policy 
Act of 1982, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 10101. In all other circumstances, 
the Commission or Presiding Officer shall, in ruling on a petition for 
leave to intervene, consider the following factors, among other things:
    (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Atomic Energy Act 
to be made a party to the proceeding;
    (2) The nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, 
or other interest in the proceeding;
    (3) The possible effect of any order that may be entered in the 
proceeding on the petitioner's interest;
    (4) The failure of the petitioner to participate as a potential 
party in the Licensing Support System.
    (5) In determining whether a genuine dispute exists on a material 
issue of law or fact, whether the contention, if proven, would be of no 
consequence in the proceeding because it would not entitle petitioner to 
relief.
    (d) An order permitting intervention and/or directing a hearing may 
be conditioned on such terms as the Commission, or the designated 
Presiding Officer may direct in the interests of:
    (1) Restricting irrelevant, duplicative, or repetitive evidence and 
argument,
    (2) Having common interests represented by a spokesman, and
    (3) Retaining authority to determine priorities and control the 
compass of the hearing.
    (e) In any case in which, after consideration of the factors set 
forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission or the Presiding 
Officer finds that the petitioner's interest is limited to one or more 
of the issues involved in the proceeding, any order allowing 
intervention shall limit the petitioner's participation accordingly.
    (f) A person permitted to intervene becomes a party to the 
proceeding, subject to any limitations imposed pursuant to paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (g) Unless otherwise expressly provided in the order allowing 
intervention, the granting of a petition for leave to intervene does not 
change or enlarge the issues specified in the notice of hearing.
    (h) If the Commission or the Presiding Officer determines that any 
of the admitted contentions constitute pure issues of law, those 
contentions must be decided on the basis of briefs or oral argument 
according to a schedule determined by the Commission or the Presiding 
Officer.

Sec. 2.1016  Motions.

    (a) All motions shall be addressed to the Commission or, when a 
proceeding is pending before a Presiding Officer, to the Presiding 
Officer. All motions, unless made orally on the record, shall be filed 
according to the provisions of Sec. 2.1013(c) of this subpart.
    (b) A motion shall state with particularity the grounds and the 
relief sought, and shall be accompanied by any affidavits or other 
evidence relied on, and, as appropriate, a proposed form of order.
    (c) Within ten days after service of a motion a party, potential 
party, or interested governmental participant may file an answer in 
support of or in opposition to the motion, accompanied by affidavits or 
other evidence. The moving party shall have no right to reply, except as

hearing.
    (e) Where the motion in question is a motion to compel discovery

parties, potential parties, and interested governmental participants may 
file answers to the motion pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. 
The Presiding Officer in its discretion, may order that the answer be 
given orally during a telephone conference or other prehearing 
conference, rather than filed electronically. If responses are given 
over the telephone the Presiding Officer shall issue a written order on 
the motion which summarizes the views presented by the parties, 
potential parties, and interested governmental participants unless the 
conference has been transcribed. This does not preclude the Presiding 
Officer from issuing a prior oral ruling on the matter which is 
effective at the time of its issuance, provided that the terms of the 
ruling are incorporated in the subsequent written order.

Sec. 2.1017  Computation of time.

    In computing any period of time, the day of the act, event, or 
default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not 
included. The last day of the period so computed is included unless it 
is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday at the place where the action or 
event is to occur, in which event the period runs until the end of the 
next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor holiday. Whenever a 
party, potential party, or interested governmental participant, has the 
right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the 
service of a notice or other document upon it, one day shall be added to 
the prescribed period. If the Licensing Support System is unavailable 
for more than four access hours of any day that would be counted in the 
computation of time, that day will not be counted in the computation of 
time.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1018  Discovery.

    (a)(1) Parties, potential parties, and interested governmental 
participants in the high-level waste licensing proceeding may obtain 
discovery by one or more of the following methods: Access to the 
documentary material in the Licensing Support System submitted pursuant 
to Sec. 2.1003 of this subpart; entry upon land for inspection, access 
to raw data, or other purposes pursuant to Sec. 2.1020 of this subpart; 
access to, or the production of, copies of documentary material for 
which bibliographic headers only have been submitted pursuant to 
Sec. 2.1003 (c) and (d) of this subpart; depositions upon oral 
examination pursuant to Sec. 2.1019 of this subpart; requests for 
admission pursuant to Sec. 2.742 of this subpart; informal requests for 
information not available in the Licensing Support System, such as the 
names of witnesses and the subjects they plan to address; and 
interrogatories and depositions upon written questions, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

[[Page 108]]

    (2) Interrogatories and depositions upon written questions may be 
authorized by order of the discovery master appointed under paragraph 
(g) of this section, or if no discovery master has been appointed, by 
order of the Presiding Officer, in the event that the parties are 
unable, after informal good faith efforts, to resolve a dispute in a 
timely fashion concerning the production of information.
    (b)(1) Parties, potential parties, and interested governmental 
participants, pursuant to the methods set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, 
which is relevant to the licensing of the likely candidate site for a 
geologic repository, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the 
person seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other person. 
Except for discovery pursuant to Secs. 2.1018(a)(2) and 2.1019 of this 
subpart, all other discovery shall begin during the pre-license 
application phase. Discovery pursuant to Secs. 2.1018(a)(2) and 2.1019 
of this subpart shall begin after the issuance of the first pre-hearing 
conference order under Sec. 2.1021 of this subpart, and shall be limited 
to the issues defined in that order or subsequent amendments to the 
order. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will 
be inadmissible at the hearing if the information sought appears 
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (2) A party, potential party, or interested governmental participant 
may obtain discovery of documentary material otherwise discoverable 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and prepared in anticipation of, 
or for the hearing by, or for another party's, potential party's, or 
interested governmental participant's representative (including its 
attorney, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or similar agent) only upon a 
showing that the party, potential party, or interested governmental 
participant seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in 
the preparation of its case and that it is unable without undue hardship 
to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In 
ordering discovery of these materials when the required showing has been 
made, the Presiding Officer shall protect against disclosure of the 
mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an 
attorney or other representative of a party, potential party, or 
interested governmental participant concerning the proceeding.
    (c) Upon motion by a party, potential party, interested governmental 
participant, or the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good 
cause shown, the Presiding Officer may make any order that justice 
requires to protect a party, potential party, interested governmental 
participant, or other person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, 
or undue burden, delay, or expense, including one or more of the 
following: (1) That the discovery not be had; (2) that the discovery may 
be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation 
of the time or place; (3) that the discovery may be had only by a method 
of discovery other than that selected by the party, potential party, or 
interested governmental participant seeking discovery; (4) that certain 
matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of discovery be limited 
to certain matters; (5) that discovery be conducted with no one present 
except persons designated by the Presiding Officer; (6) that, subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 2.790 of this part, a trade secret or other 
confidential research, development, or commercial information not be 
disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; (7) that studies and 
evaluations not be prepared. If the motion for a protective order is 
denied in whole or in part, the Presiding Officer may, on such terms and 
conditions as are just, order that any party, potential party, 
interested governmental participant or other person provide or permit 
discovery.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, and unless 
the Presiding Officer upon motion, for the convenience of parties, 
potential parties, interested governmental participants, and witnesses 
and in the interest of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery 
may be used in any sequence, and the fact that a party, potential party, 
or interested governmental participant is conducting discovery, whether 
by deposition or otherwise,

[[Page 109]]

shall not operate to delay any other party's, potential party's, or 
interested governmental participant's discovery.
    (e) A party, potential party, or interested governmental participant 
who has included all documentary material relevant to any discovery 
request in the Licensing Support System or who has responded to a 
request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is 
under no duty to supplement its response to include information 
thereafter acquired, except as follows:
    (1) To the extent that written interrogatories are authorized 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a party or interested 
governmental participant is under a duty to seasonably supplement its 
response to any question directly addressed to (i) the identity and 
location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (ii) 
the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness 
at the hearing, the subject matter on which the witness is expected to 
testify, and the substance of the witness' testimony.
    (2) A party, potential party, or interested governmental participant 
is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if it obtains 
information upon the basis of which (i) it knows that the response was 
incorrect when made, or (ii) it knows that the response though correct 
when made is no longer true and the circumstances are such that a 
failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.
    (3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the 
Presiding Officer or agreement of the parties, potential parties, and 
interested governmental participants.
    (f)(1) If a deponent of a party, potential party, or interested 
governmental participant upon whom a request for discovery is served 
fails to respond or objects to the request, or any part thereof, the 
party, potential party, or interested governmental participant 
submitting the request or taking the deposition may move the Presiding 
Officer, within five days after the date of the response or after 
failure to respond to the request, for an order compelling a response in 
accordance with the request. The motion shall set forth the nature of 
the questions or the request, the response or objection of the party, 
potential party, interested governmental participant, or other person 
upon whom the request was served, and arguments in support of the 
motion. For purposes of this paragraph, an evasive or incomplete answer 
or response shall be treated as a failure to answer or respond. Failure 
to answer or respond shall not be excused on the ground that the 
discovery sought is objectionable unless the person, party, potential 
party, or interested governmental participant failing to answer or 
respond has applied for a protective order pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (2) In ruling on a motion made pursuant to this section, the 
Presiding Officer may make such a protective order as it is authorized 
to make on a motion made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) An independent request for issuance of a subpoena may be 
directed to a nonparty for production of documents. This section does 
not apply to requests for the testimony of the NRC regulatory staff 
pursuant to Sec. 2.720(h)(2)(i) of this part.
    (g) The Presiding Officer pursuant to Sec. 2.722 of this part may 
appoint a discovery master to resolve disputes between parties 
concerning informal requests for information as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

Sec. 2.1019  Depositions.

    (a) Any party or interested governmental participant desiring to 
take the testimony of any person by deposition on oral examination 
shall, without leave of the Commission or the Presiding Officer, give 
reasonable notice in writing to every other party and interested 
governmental participant, to the person to be examined, and to the 
Presiding Officer of the proposed time and place of taking the 
deposition; the name and address of each person to be examined, if 
known, or if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to 
identify him or her or the class or group to which he or she belongs, 
the matters upon which each person

[[Page 110]]

will be examined and the name or descriptive title and address of the 
officer before whom the deposition is to be taken.
    (b) Within the United States, a deposition may be taken before any 
officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States 
or of the place where the examination is held. Outside of the United 
States, a deposition may be taken before a secretary of an embassy or 
legation, a consul general, vice consul or consular agent of the United 
States, or a person authorized to administer oaths designated by the 
Commission. Depositions may be conducted by telephone or by video 
teleconference at the option of the party or interested governmental 
participant taking the deposition.
    (c) The deponent shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions 
are put to him or her. Examination and cross-examination shall proceed 
as at a hearing. Each question propounded shall be recorded and the 
answer taken down in the words of the witness. Objections on questions 
of evidence shall be noted in short form without the arguments. The 
officer shall not decide on the competency, materiality, or relevancy of 
evidence but shall record the evidence subject to objection. Objections 
on questions of evidence not made before the officer shall not be deemed 
waived unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been 
obviated or removed if presented at that time.
    (d) When the testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition shall be 
submitted to the deponent for examination and signature unless the 
deponent is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. The officer shall 
certify the deposition or, if the deposition is not signed by the 
deponent, shall certify the reasons for the failure to sign, and shall 
promptly transmit the deposition to the LSS Administrator for submission 
into the Licensing Support System.
    (e) Where the deposition is to be taken on written questions as 
authorized under Sec. 2.1018(a)(2) of this subpart, the party or 
interested governmental participant taking the deposition shall serve a 
copy of the questions, showing each question separately and 
consecutively numbered, on every other party and interested governmental 
participant with a notice stating the name and address of the person who 
is to answer them, and the name, description, title, and address of the 
officer before whom they are to be asked. Within ten days after service, 
any other party or interested governmental participant may serve cross-
questions. The questions, cross-questions, and answers shall be recorded 
and signed, and the deposition certified, returned, and transmitted to 
the LSS Administrator as in the case of a deposition on oral 
examination.
    (f) A deposition will not become a part of the evidentiary record in 
the hearing unless received in evidence. If only part of a deposition is 
offered in evidence by a party or interested governmental participant, 
any other party or interested governmental participant may introduce any 
other parts. A party or interested governmental participant shall not be 
deemed to make a person its own witness for any purpose by taking his or 
her deposition.
    (g) A deponent whose deposition is taken and the officer taking a 
deposition shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like 
services in the district courts of the United States, to be paid by the 
party or interested governmental participant at whose instance the 
deposition is taken.
    (h) The deponent may be accompanied, represented, and advised by 
legal counsel.
    (i)(1) After receiving written notice of the deposition under 
paragraph (a) or paragraph (e) of this section, and ten days before the 
scheduled date of the deposition, the deponent shall submit an index of 
all documents in his or her possession, relevant to the subject matter 
of the deposition, including the categories of documents set forth in 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section, to all parties and interested 
governmental participants. The index shall identify those records which 
have already been entered into the Licensing Support System. All 
documents that are not identical to documents already in the Licensing 
Support System, whether by reason of subsequent modification or by the 
addition of notations, shall be treated as separate documents.

[[Page 111]]

    (2) The following material is excluded from initial entry into the 
Licensing Support System, but is subject to derivative discovery under 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section--
    (i) Personal records;
    (ii) Travel vouchers;
    (iii) Speeches;
    (iv) Preliminary drafts;
    (v) Marginalia.
    (3) Subject to paragraph (i)(6) of this section, any party or 
interested governmental participant may request from the deponent a 
paper copy of any or all of the documents on the index that have not 
already been entered into the Licensing Support System.
    (4) Subject to paragraph (i)(6) of this section, the deponent shall 
bring a paper copy of all documents on the index that the deposing party 
or interested governmental participant requests that have not already 
been entered into the Licensing Support System to an oral deposition 
conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or in the case of a 
deposition taken on written questions pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section, shall submit such documents with the certified deposition.
    (5) Subject to paragraph (i)(6) of this section, a party or 
interested governmental participant may request that any or all 
documents on the index that have not already been entered into the 
Licensing Support System, and on which it intends to rely at hearing, be 
entered into the LSS by the deponent.
    (6) The deposing party or interested governmental participant shall 
assume the responsibility for the obligations set forth in paragraphs 
(i)(1), (i)(3), (i)(4), and (i)(5) of this section when deposing someone 
other than a party or interested governmental participant.
    (j) In a proceeding in which the NRC is a party, the NRC staff will 
make available one or more witnesses designated by the Executive 
Director for Operations, for oral examination at the hearing or on 
deposition regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to 
the issues in the proceeding. The attendance and testimony of the 
Commissioners and named NRC personnel at a hearing or on deposition may 
not be required by the Presiding Officer, by subpoena or otherwise: 
Provided, That the Presiding Officer may, upon a showing of exceptional 
circumstances, such as a case in which a particular named NRC employee 
has direct personal knowledge of a material fact not known to the 
witnesses made available by the Executive Director for Operations and 
the testimony sought is not reasonably obtainable from another source by 
any party, require the attendance and testimony of named NRC personnel.

Sec. 2.1023  Immediate effectiveness.

    (a) Pending review and final decision by the Commission, an initial 
decision resolving all issues before the Presiding Officer in favor of 
issuance or amendment of a construction authorization pursuant to 
Sec. 60.31 of this chapter or a license to receive and possess high-
level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area 
pursuant to Sec. 60.41 of this chapter, will be immediately effective 
upon issuance except--
    (1) As provided in any order issued in accordance with Sec. 2.788 of 
this part that stays the effectiveness of an initial decision; or
    (2) As otherwise provided by the Commission in special 
circumstances.
    (b) The Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, 
notwithstanding the filing or pendency of an appeal or a petition for 
review pursuant to Sec. 2.1015 of this subpart, promptly shall issue a 
construction authorization or a license to receive and possess high-
level radioactive waste at a geologic respository operations area, or 
amendments thereto, following an initial decision resolving all issues 
before the Presiding Officer in favor of the licensing action, upon 
making the appropriate licensing findings, except--
    (1) As provided in paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (2) As provided in any order issued in accordance with Sec. 2.788 of 
this part that stays the effectiveness of an initial decision; or
    (3) As otherwise provided by the Commission in special 
circumstances.
    (c)(1) Before the Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards 
may issue a construction authorization or a license to receive and 
possess waste at a geologic repository operations area in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission, in the exercise of 
its supervisory authority over agency proceedings, shall undertake and 
complete a supervisory examination of those issues contested in the 
proceeding before the Presiding Officer to consider whether there is any 
significant basis for doubting that the facility will be constructed or 
operated with adequate protection of the public health and safety, and 
whether the Commission should take action to suspend or to otherwise 
condition the effectiveness of a Presiding Officer decision that 
resolves contested issues in a proceeding in favor of issuing a 
construction authorization or a license to receive and possess high-
level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area. This 
supervisory examination is not part of the adjudicatory proceeding. The 
Commission shall notify the Director in writing when its supervisory 
examination conducted in accordance with this paragraph has been 
completed.
    (2) Before the Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards 
issues a construction authorization or a license to receive and possess 
high-level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area, 
the Commission shall review those issues that have not been contested in 
the proceeding before the Presiding Officer but about which the Director 
must make appropriate findings prior to the issuance of such a license. 
The Director shall issue a construction authorization or a license to 
receive and possess high-level radioactive waste at a geologic 
repository operations area only after written notification from the 
Commission of its completion of its review under this paragraph and of 
its determination that it is appropriate for the Director to issue such 
a construction authorization or license. This Commission review of 
uncontested issues is not part of the adjudicatory proceeding.
    (3) No suspension of the effectiveness of a Presiding Officer's 
initial decision or postponement of the Director's issuance of a 
construction authorization or license that results from a Commission 
supervisory examination of contested issues under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section or a review of uncontested issues under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section will be entered except in writing with a statement of the 
reasons. Such suspension or postponement will be limited to such period 
as is necessary for the Commission to resolve the matters at issue. If 
the supervisory examination results in a suspension of the effectiveness 
of the Presiding Officer's initial decision under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, the Commission will take review of the decision sua sponte 
and further proceedings relative to the

[[Page 114]]

contested matters at issue will be in accordance with procedures for 
participation by the DOE, the NRC staff, or other parties and interested 
governmental participants to the Presiding Officer proceeding 
established by the Commission in its written statement of reasons. If a 
postponement results from a review under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, comments on the uncontested matters at issue may be filed by 
the DOE within ten days of service of the Commission's written 
statement.

<R05>
Sec. 2.1025  Authority of the Presiding Officer to dispose of certain issues on the pleadings.

    (a) Any party may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for a 
decision by the Presiding Officer in that party's favor as to all or any 
part of the matters involved in the proceeding. The moving party shall 
annex to the motion a separate, short, and concise statement of the 
material facts as to which the moving party contends that there is no 
genuine issue to be heard. Motions may be filed at any time. Any other 
party may file an answer supporting or opposing the motion, with or 
without affidavits, within twenty (20) days after service of the motion. 
The party shall annex to any answer opposing the motion a separate, 
short, and concise, statement of the material facts as to which it is 
contended there exists a genuine issue to be heard. All material facts 
set forth in the statement to be filed by the moving party will be 
deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement required to 
be filed by the opposing party. The opposing party may, within ten (10) 
days after service, respond in writing to new facts and arguments 
presented in any statement filed in support of the motion. No further 
supporting statements or responses thereto may be entertained. The 
Presiding Officer may dismiss summarily or hold in abeyance motions 
filed shortly before the hearing commences or during the hearing if the 
other parties or the Presiding Officer would be required to divert 
substantial resources from the hearing in order to respond adequately to 
the motion.
    (b) Affidavits must set forth those facts that would be admissible 
in evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to 
testify to the matters stated therein. The Presiding Officer may permit 
affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by further affidavits. When a 
motion for summary disposition is made and supported as provided in this 
section, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere 
allegations or denials of its answer; its answer by affidavits or as 
otherwise provided in this section must set forth specific facts showing 
that there is a genuine issue of fact. If no such answer is filed, the 
decision sought, if appropriate, must be rendered.
    (c) The Presiding Officer shall render the decision sought if the 
filings in the proceeding show that there is no genuine issue as to any 
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a decision as a 
matter of law. However, in any proceeding involving a construction 
authorization for a geologic repository operations area, the procedure 
described in this section may be used only for the determination of 
specific subordinate issues and may not be used to determine the 
ultimate issue as to whether the authorization must be issued.

extensions of no more than 15 days beyond any required time set forth in 
this subpart for a filing by a party to the proceeding. Except in the 
case of exceptional and unforseen circumstances, requests for extensions 
of more than 15 days must be filed no later than 5 days in advance of 
the required time set forth in this subpart for a filing by a party to 
the proceeding.
    (2) Extensions beyond 15 days must be referred to the Commission. If 
the Commission does not disapprove the extension within 10 days of 
receiving the request, the extension will be effective. If the 
Commission disapproves the

[[Page 115]]

extension, the date which was the subject of the extension request will 
be set for 5 days after the Commission's disapproval action.
    (c)(1) The Presiding Officer may delay the issuance of an order up 
to thirty days beyond the time set forth for the issuance in appendix D.
    (2) If the Presiding Officer anticipates that the issuance of an 
order will not occur until after the thirty day extension specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Presiding Officer shall notify the 
Commission at least ten days in advance of the scheduled date for the 
milestone and provide a justification for the delay.

Subpart K--Hybrid Hearing Procedures for Expansion of Spent Nuclear Fuel 
           Storage Capacity at Civilian Nuclear Power Reactors

Source: 50 FR 41670, Oct. 15, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1101  Purpose.

    The regulations in this subpart establish hybrid hearing procedures, 
as authorized by section 134 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (96 
Stat. 2230), to be used at the request of any party in certain contested 
proceedings on applications for a license or license amendment to expand 
the spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at the site of a civilian 
nuclear power plant. These procedures are intended to encourage and 
expedite onsite expansion of spent nuclear fuel storage capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1103  Scope.

    The procedures in this subpart apply to contested proceedings on 
applications filed after January 7, 1983, for a license or license 
amendment under Part 50 of this chapter, to expand the spent fuel 
storage capacity at the site of a civilian nuclear power plant, through 
the use of high density fuel storage racks, fuel rod compaction, the 
transshipment of spent nuclear fuel to another civilian nuclear power 
reactor within the same utility system, the construction of additional 
spent nuclear fuel pool capacity or dry storage capacity, or by other 
means. This subpart also applies to proceedings on applications for a 
license under part 72 of this chapter to store spent nuclear fuel in an 
independent spent fuel storage installation located at the site of a 
civilian nuclear power reactor. This subpart shall not apply to the 
first application for a license or license amendment to expand the spent 
fuel storage capacity at a particular site through the use of a new 
technology not previously approved by the Commission for use at any 
other nuclear power plant.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1105  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Civilian nuclear power reactor means a civilian nuclear power 
plant required to be licensed as a utilization facility under section 
103 or 104(b) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
    (b) Spent nuclear fuel means fuel that has been withdrawn from a 
nuclear reactor following irradiation, the constituent elements of which 
have not been separated by reprocessing.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1107  Notice of proposed action.

    In connection with each application filed after January 7, 1983, for 
a license or an amendment to a license to expand the spent nuclear fuel 
storage capacity at the site of a civilian nuclear power plant, for 
which the Commission has not found that a hearing is required in the 
public interest, for which an adjudicatory hearing has not yet been 
convened, and for which a notice of proposed action has not yet been 
published as of the effective date of this subpart, the Commission will, 
prior to acting thereon, cause to be published in the Federal Register a

[[Page 116]]

notice of proposed action in accordance with Sec. 2.105. The notice of 
proposed action will identify the availability of the hybrid hearing 
procedures in this subpart, specify that any party may invoke these 
procedures by filing a timely request for oral argument under 
Sec. 2.1109, and provide that if a request for oral argument is granted, 
any hearing held on the application shall be conducted in accordance 
with the procedures in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1109  Requests for oral argument.

    (a)(1) Within ten (10) days after an order granting a request for 
hearing or petition for leave to intervene, any party may invoke the 
hybrid hearing procedures in this subpart by requesting an oral 
argument. Requests for oral argument shall be in writing and shall be 
filed with the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall grant a 
timely request for oral argument.
    (2) The presiding officer may grant an untimely request for oral 
argument only upon a showing of good cause by the requesting party for 
failure to file on time and after providing the other parties an 
opportunity to respond to the untimely request.
    (b) The presiding officer shall issue a written order ruling on any 
requests for oral argument. If the presiding officer grants a request 
for oral argument, the order shall include a schedule for discovery and 
subsequent oral argument with respect to the admitted contentions.
    (c) If no party to the proceeding requests oral argument, or if all 
untimely requests for oral argument are denied, the presiding officer 
shall conduct the proceeding in accordance with subpart G of 10 CFR part 
2.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1111  Discovery.

    Discovery shall begin and end at such times as the presiding officer 
shall order. It is expected that all discovery shall be completed within 
90 days. The presiding officer may extend the time for discovery upon 
good cause shown based on exceptional circumstances and after providing 
the other parties an opportunity to respond to the request.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1113  Oral argument.

    (a) Fifteen (15) days prior to the date set for oral argument, each 
party, including the NRC staff, shall submit to the presiding officer a 
detailed written summary of all the facts, data, and arguments which are 
known to the party at such time and on which the party proposes to rely 
at the oral argument either to support or to refute the existence of a 
genuine and substantial dispute of fact. Each party shall also submit 
all supporting facts and data in the form of sworn written testimony or 
other sworn written submission. Each party's written summary and 
supporting information shall be simultaneously served on all other 
parties to the proceeding.
    (b) Only facts and data in the form of sworn written testimony or 
other sworn written submission may be relied on by the parties during 
oral argument, and the presiding officer shall consider those facts and 
data only if they are submitted in that form.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1115  Designation of issues for adjudicatory hearing.

    (a) After due consideration of the oral presentation and the written 
facts and data submitted by the parties and relied on at the oral 
argument, the presiding officer shall promptly by written order:
    (1) Designate any disputed issues of fact, together with any 
remaining issues of law, for resolution in an adjudicatory hearing; and
    (2) Dispose of any issues of law or fact not designated for 
resolution in an adjudicatory hearing.

With regard to each issue designated for resolution in an adjudicatory 
hearing, the presiding officer shall identify the specific facts that 
are in genuine and substantial dispute, the reason why the decision of 
the Commission is likely to depend on the resolution of that dispute, 
and the reason why an adjudicatory hearing is likely to resolve the 
dispute. With regard to issues not designated for resolution in an 
adjudicatory hearing, the presiding officer shall include a brief 
statement of the reasons for the disposition. If the presiding officer 
finds that there are no disputed issues of fact or law requiring 
resolution in an adjudicatory hearing,

[[Page 117]]

the presiding officer shall also dismiss the proceeding.
    (b) No issue of law or fact shall be designated for resolution in an 
adjudicatory hearing unless the presiding officer determines that:
    (1) There is a genuine and substantial dispute of fact which can 
only be resolved with sufficient accuracy by the introduction of 
evidence in an adjudicatory hearing; and
    (2) The decision of the Commission is likely to depend in whole or 
in part on the resolution of that dispute.
    (c) In making a determination under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the presiding officer shall not consider:
    (1) Any issue relating to the design, construction, or operation of 
any civilian nuclear power reactor already licensed to operate at the 
site, or any civilian nuclear power reactor for which a construction 
permit has been granted at the site, unless the presiding officer 
determines that any such issue substantially affects the design, 
construction, or operation of the facility or activity for which a 
license application, authorization, or amendment to expand the spent 
nuclear fuel storage capacity is being considered; or
    (2) Any siting or design issue fully considered and decided by the 
Commission in connection with the issuance of a construction permit or 
operating license for a civilian nuclear power reactor at that site, 
unless (i) such issue results from any revision of siting or design 
criteria by the Commission following such decision; and (ii) the 
presiding officer determines that such issue substantially affects the 
design, construction, or operation of the facility or activity for which 
a license application, authorization, or amendment to expand the spent 
nuclear fuel storage capacity is being considered.
    (d) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply only 
with respect to licenses, authorizations, or amendments to licenses or 
authorizations applied for under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, before December 31, 2005.
    (e) Unless the presiding officer disposes of all issues and 
dismisses the proceeding, appeals from the presiding officer's order 
disposing of issues and designating one or more issues for resolution in 
an adjudicatory hearing are interlocutory and must await the end of the 
proceeding.

20852, or by mail addressed to the Executive Director for Operations, 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.
    (g) Within ten (10) days of service of a request for a hearing filed 
under paragraph (c) of this section, the applicant may file an answer. 
The NRC staff, if it chooses or is ordered to participate as a party in 
accordance with Sec. 2.1213, may file an answer to a request for a 
hearing within ten (10) days of the designation of the presiding 
officer.
    (h) In ruling on a request for a hearing filed under paragraph (d) 
of this section, the presiding officer shall determine that the 
specified areas of concern are germane to the subject matter of the 
proceeding and that the petition is timely. The presiding officer also 
shall determine that the requestor meets the judicial standards for 
standing and shall consider, among other factors--
    (1) The nature of the requestor's right under the Act to be made a 
party to the proceeding;
    (2) The nature and extent of the requestor's property, financial, or 
other interest in the proceeding; and
    (3) The possible effect of any order that may be entered in the 
proceeding upon the requestor's interest.
    (i) If a hearing request filed under paragraph (b) of this section 
is granted, the applicant and the NRC staff shall be parties to the 
proceeding. If a hearing request filed under paragraph (c) or (d) of 
this section is granted, the requestor shall be a party to the 
proceeding along with the applicant and the NRC staff, if the NRC staff 
chooses or is ordered to participate as a party in accordance with 
Sec. 2.1213.
    (j) If a request for hearing is granted and a notice of the kind 
described in paragraph (d)(1) previously has not been published in the 
Federal Register, a notice of hearing must be published in the Federal 
Register stating--
    (1) The time, place, and nature of the hearing;
    (2) The authority under which the hearing is to be held;
    (3) The matters of fact and law to be considered;
    (4) The time within which any other person whose interest may be 
affected

[[Page 120]]

by the proceeding may petition for leave to intervene, as specified in 
paragraph (j) of this section; and
    (5) The time within which a request to participate under 
Sec. 2.1211(b) must be filed.
    (k) Any petition for leave to intervene must be filed within 30 days 
of the date of publication of the notice of hearing. The petition must 
set forth the information required under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (1) A petition for leave to intervene must be served upon the 
applicant. The petition also must be served upon the NRC staff--
    (i) By delivery to the Executive Director for Operations, One White 
Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852; or
    (ii) By mail addressed to the Executive Director for Operations, 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.
    (2) Within ten (10) days of service of a petition for leave to 
intervene, the applicant and the NRC staff, if the staff chooses or is 
ordered to participate as a party in accordance with Sec. 2.1213, may 
file an answer.
    (3) Thereafter, the petition for leave to intervene must be ruled 
upon by the presiding officer, taking into account the matters set forth 
in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (4) If the petition is granted, the petitioner becomes a party to 
the proceeding.
    (l)(1) A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene 
found by the presiding officer to be untimely under paragraph (d) or (k) 
of this section will be entertained only upon determination by the 
Commission or the presiding officer that the requestor or petitioner has 
established that--
    (i) The delay in filing the request for a hearing or the petition 
for leave to intervene was excusable; and
    (ii) The grant of the request for a hearing or the petition for 
leave to intervene will not result in undue prejudice or undue injury to 
any other participant in the proceeding, including the applicant and the 
NRC staff, if the staff chooses or is ordered to participate as a party 
in accordance with Sec. 2.1213.
    (2) If the request for a hearing on the petition for leave to 
intervene is found to be untimely and the requestor or petitioner fails 
to establish that it otherwise should be entertained on the paragraph 
(l)(1) of this section, the request or petition will be treated as a 
petition under Sec. 2.206 and referred for appropriate disposition.
    (m) The filing or granting of a request for a hearing or petition 
for leave to intervene need not delay NRC staff action regarding an 
application for a licensing action covered by this subpart.
    (n) An order granting a request for a hearing or a petition for 
leave to intervene may condition or limit participation in the interest 
of avoiding repetitive factual presentations and argument.
    (o) If the presiding officer denies a request for a hearing or a 
petition for leave to intervene in its entirety, the action is 
appealable within ten (10) days of service of the order on the question 
whether the request for a hearing or the petition for leave to intervene 
should have been granted in whole or in part. If a request for a hearing 
or a petition for leave to intervene is granted, parties other than the 
requestor or petitioner may appeal that action within ten (10) days of 
service of the order on the question whether the request for a hearing 
or the petition for leave to intervene should have been denied in its 
entirety. An appeal may be taken by filing and serving upon all parties 
a statement that succinctly sets out, with supporting argument, the 
errors alleged. The appeal may be supported or opposed by any party by 
filing a counter-statement within fifteen (15) days of the service of 
the appeal brief.

Sec. 2.1211  Participation by a person not a party.

    (a) The presiding officer may permit a person who is not a party to 
make a limited appearance in order to state his or her views on the 
issues. Limited appearances may be in writing or oral, at the discretion 
of the presiding officer, and are governed by rules adopted by the 
presiding officer. A limited appearance statement is not to be 
considered part of the decisional record under Sec. 2.1251(c).
    (b) Within 30 days of an order granting a request for a hearing made 
under Sec. 2.1205 (b)-(d) or, in instances when it is published, within 
30 days of notice of hearing issued under Sec. 2.1205(j), the 
representative of the interested State, county, municipality, or an 
agency thereof, may request an opportunity to participate in a 
proceeding under this subpart. The request for an opportunity to 
participate must state with reasonable specificity the requestor's areas 
of concern about the licensing activity that is the subject matter of 
the proceeding. Upon receipt of a request that is filed in accordance 
with these time limits and that specifies the requestor's areas of 
concern, the presiding officer shall afford the representative a 
reasonable opportunity to make written and oral presentations in 
accordance with Secs. 2.1233 and 2.1235, without requiring the 
representative to

[[Page 122]]

take a position with respect to the issues. Participants under this 
subsection may notice an appeal of an initial decision in accordance 
with Sec. 2.1253 with respect to any issue on which they participate.

Sec. 2.1213  Role of the NRC staff.

    If a hearing request is filed under Sec. 2.1205(b), the NRC staff 
shall be a party to the proceeding. If a hearing request is filed under 
Sec. 2.1205 (c) or (d), within 10 days of the designation of a presiding 
officer pursuant to Sec. 2.1207, the NRC staff shall notify the 
presiding officer whether or not the staff desires to participate as a 
party to the adjudication. In addition, upon a determination by the 
presiding officer that the resolution of any issue in the proceeding 
would be aided materially by the staff's participation in the proceeding 
as a party, the presiding officer may order or permit the NRC staff to 
participate as a party with respect to that particular issue.

<R05>
Sec. 2.1215  Appearance and practice.

    (a) An individual may appear in an adjudication under this subpart 
on his or her own behalf or by an attorney-at-law. Representation by an 
attorney-at-law is not necessary in order for an organization or a 
Sec. 2.1211(b) participant to appear in an adjudication conducted under 
this subpart. If the representative of an organization is not an 
attorney-at-law, he or she shall be a member or officer of the 
organization represented. Upon request of the presiding officer, an 
individual acting as a representative shall provide appropriate 
information establishing the basis of his or her authority to act in a 
representational capacity.
    (b) Any action to reprimand, censure, or suspend a party, a 
Sec. 2.1211(b) participant, or the representative of a party or a 
Sec. 2.1211(b) participant must be in accordance with the procedures in 
Sec. 2.713(c).

Sec. 2.1231  Hearing file; prohibition on discovery.

    (a) Within thirty (30) days of the presiding officer's entry of an 
order granting a request for a hearing, the NRC staff shall file in the 
docket, present to the presiding officer, and make available to the 
applicant and any other party to the proceeding a hearing file. 
Thereafter, within ten (10) days of the date a petition for leave to 
intervene or a request to participate under Sec. 2.1211(b) is granted, 
the NRC staff shall make the hearing file available to the petitioner or 
the Sec. 2.1211(b) participant.
    (1) The hearing file must be made available to the applicant and any 
other party or Sec. 2.1211(b) participant to the proceeding either by--
    (i) Service in accordance with Sec. 2.1203(e); or
    (ii) Placing the file in an established local public document room 
in the vicinity of the principal location where nuclear material that is 
the subject of a proceeding under this subpart will be possessed, and 
informing the applicant, party, or Sec. 2.1211(b) participant in writing 
of its action and the location of the file. If an established local 
public document room does not exist, the NRC staff will arrange for the 
documents contained in the hearing file, along with any other material 
docketed in accordance with Sec. 2.1203, to be made available for public 
inspection and copying during the course of the adjudication in a 
library or other facility that is accessible to the general public 
during regular business hours and is in the vicinity of the principal 
location where the nuclear material that is the subject of the 
proceeding will be possessed.
    (2) The hearing file also must be made available for public 
inspection and copying during regular business hours at the NRC Public 
Document Room in Washington, DC.
    (b) The hearing file will consist of the application and any 
amendment thereto, any NRC environmental impact statement or assessment 
relating to the application, and any NRC report and any correspondence 
between the

[[Page 123]]

applicant and the NRC that is relevant to the application. Hearing file 
documents already in an established local public document room or the 
NRC Public Document Room when the hearing request is granted may be 
incorporated into the hearing file at those locations by a reference 
indicating where at those locations the documents can be found. The 
presiding officer shall rule upon any issue regarding the appropriate 
materials for the hearing file.
    (c) The NRC staff has a continuing duty to keep the hearing file up 
to date with respect to the materials set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section and to provide those materials for the docket, the presiding 
officer, and the applicant or any party or Sec. 2.1211(b) participant in 
a manner consistent with the way the hearing file was made available 
initially under paragraph (a).
    (d) A party or Sec. 2.1211(b) participant may not seek discovery 
from any other party, Sec. 2.1211(b) participant, or the NRC or its 
personnel, whether by document production, deposition, interrogatories, 
or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1233  Written presentations; written questions.

    (a) After publication of a notice of hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 2.1205(i) and after the NRC staff has made the hearing file

participants shall be afforded the opportunity to submit, under oath or 
affirmation, written presentations of their arguments and documentary 
data, informational material, and other supporting written evidence at 
the time or times and in the sequence the presiding officer establishes 
by appropriate order. The presiding officer also may, on his or her 
initiative, submit written questions to the parties to be answered in 
writing, under oath or affirmation, and supported by appropriate 
documentary data, informational material, or other written evidence.
    (b) In a hearing initiated under Sec. 2.1205(b), the initial written 
presentation of the applicant that is issued a notice of proposed denial 
or a notice of denial must describe in detail any deficiency or omission 
in the agency's denial or proposed denial of its application and what 
relief is sought with respect to each deficiency or omission.
    (c) In a hearing initiated under Sec. 2.1205(d), the initial written 
presentation of a party that requested a hearing or petitioned for leave 
to intervene must describe in detail any deficiency or omission in the 
license application, with references to any particular section or 
portion of the application considered deficient, give a detailed 
statement of reasons why any particular sections or portion is deficient 
or why an omission is material, and describe in detail what relief is 
sought with respect to each deficiency or omission.
    (d) A party or Sec. 2.1211(b) participant making an initial written 
presentation under this section shall submit with its presentation or 
identify by reference to a generally available publication or source, 
such as the hearing file, all documentary data, informational material, 
or other written evidence upon which it relies to support or illustrate 
each omission or deficiency complained of. Thereafter, additional 
documentary data, informational material, or other written evidence may 
be submitted or referenced by any party, other than the NRC staff, or by 
any Sec. 2.1211(b) participant in a written presentation or in response 
to a written question only as the presiding officer, in his or her 
discretion, permits.
    (e) Strict rules of evidence do not apply to written submissions 
under this section, but the presiding officer may, on motion or on the 
presiding officer's own initiative, strike any portion of a written 
presentation or a response to a written question that is cumulative, 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unreliable.

<R05>
Sec. 2.1235  Oral presentations; oral questions.

    (a) Upon a determination that it is necessary to create an adequate 
record for decision, in his or her discretion the presiding officer may 
allow or require oral presentations by any party or Sec. 2.1211(b) 
participant, including testimony by witnesses. Oral presentations are 
subject to any appropriate time limits the presiding officer imposes. 
Responsibility for the conduct of the

[[Page 124]]

examination of any witness rests with the presiding officer who may 
allow a party or Sec. 2.1211(b) participant to propose questions for the 
presiding officer to pose to a witness.
    (b) Oral presentations and responses to oral questioning to be 
relied upon as oral evidence must be given under oath or affirmation. 
All oral presentations or oral questioning must be stenographically 
reported and, except as requested pursuant to section 181 of the Act, 
must be public unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.
    (c) Strict rules of evidence do not apply to oral submissions under 
this section, but the presiding officer may, on motion or on the 
presiding officer's own initiative, strike any portion of an oral 
presentation or a response to oral questioning that is cumulative, 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unreliable.

or the proponent of an order has the burden of proof.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1239  Consideration of Commission rules and regulations in informal adjudications.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any 
regulation of the Commission issued in its program for the licensing and 
regulation of production and utilization facilities, source material, 
special nuclear material, or byproduct material may not be challenged in 
any adjudication subject to this subpart.
    (b) A party to an adjudication subject to this subpart may petition 
that the application of a Commission regulation specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section be waived or an exception made for the particular 
proceeding. The sole ground for a request for waiver or exception must 
be that special circumstances exist so that application of the 
regulation to the subject matter of the proceeding would not serve the 
purposes for which the regulation was adopted. In the absence of a prima 
facie showing of special circumstances, the presiding officer may not 
further consider the matter. If the presiding officer determines that a 
prima facie showing has been made, he or she shall certify directly to 
the Commission itself for determination the matter of whether special 
circumstances support a waiver or an exception and whether a waiver or 
an exception should be granted. The Commission's determination shall be 
made after any further proceeding the Commission deems appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1241  Settlement of proceedings.

    The fair and reasonable settlement of proceedings subject to this 
subpart is encouraged. A settlement must be approved by the presiding 
officer or the Commission as appropriate in order to be binding in the 
proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 2.1251  Initial decision and its effect.

    (a) Unless the Commission directs that the record be certified to it 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the presiding officer 
shall render an initial decision after completion of an informal hearing 
under this subpart. That initial decision constitutes the final action 
of the Commission thirty (30) days after the date of issuance, unless 
any party petitions for Commission review in accordance with Sec. 2.786 
or the Commission takes review of the decision sua sponte.
    (b) The Commission may direct that the presiding officer certify the 
record to it without an initial decision and may omit an initial 
decision and prepare a final decision upon a finding that due and timely 
execution of its functions so requires.
    (c) An initial decision must be in writing and must be based only 
upon information in the record or facts officially noticed. The record 
must include all information submitted in the proceeding with respect to 
which all parties have been given reasonable prior notice and an 
opportunity to comment. The initial decision must include--
    (1) Findings, conclusions, and rulings, with the reasons or basis 
for

[[Page 125]]

them, on all material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on 
the record;
    (2) The appropriate ruling, order, or denial of relief with its 
effective date; and
    (3) The time within which a petition for review may be filed, the 
time within which any answer to a petition for review may be filed, and 
the date when the decision becomes final in the absence of the 
Commission taking review of the decision.
    (d) Matters not put into controversy by the parties may not be 
examined and decided by the presiding officer. If the presiding officer 
believes that a serious safety, environmental, or common defense and 
security matter exists that has not been placed in controversy, the 
presiding officer shall advise the Commission promptly of the basis for 
that view, and the Commission may take appropriate action.
    (e) Pending review and final decision by the Commission, an initial 
decision resolving all issues before the presiding officer in favor of 
authorizing licensing action subject to this subpart is immediately 
effective upon issuance except--
    (1) As provided in any order issued in accordance with Sec. 2.1263 
that stays the effectiveness of an initial decision; or
    (2) As otherwise provided by the Commission in special 
circumstances.
    (f) Following an initial decision resolving all issues in favor of 
the licensing action as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or the Director of Nuclear 
Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, notwithstanding the 
filing of a petition for review or pendency of any review taken by the 
Commission pursuant to Sec. 2.786, shall take the appropriate licensing 
action upon making the appropriate licensing findings promptly, except 
as may be provided pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section.

Appendix A to Part 2--Statement of General Policy and Procedure: Conduct 
 of Proceedings for the Issuance of Construction Permits and Operating 
 Licenses for Production and Utilization Facilities for Which a Hearing 
  is Required Under Section 189a of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
                                Amended*

    The following statement of general policy and procedure explains in 
detail the procedures which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission expects to 
be followed by atomic safety and licensing boards in the conduct of 
proceedings relating to the issuance of construction permits for nuclear 
power and test reactors and other production or utilization facilities 
for which a hearing is mandatory under section 189a of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Energy Reorganization Act of 
1974.\1\ The provisions are also applicable to proceedings for the 
issuance of operating licenses for such facilities, except as the 
context would otherwise indicate, or except as indicated in section 
VIII. Section VIII sets out the procedures specifically applicable to 
operating license proceedings. The Statement reflects the Commission's 
intent that such proceedings be conducted expeditiously and its concern 
that its procedures maintain sufficient flexibility to accommodate that 
objective. This position is founded upon the recognition that fairness 
to all the parties in such cases and the obligation of administrative 
agencies to conduct their functions with efficiency and economy, require 
that Commission adjudications be conducted without unnecessary delays. 
These factors take on added importance in nuclear power reactor 
licensing proceedings where the growing national need for electric power 
and the companion need for protecting the quality of the environment 
call for decision making which is both sound and timely. The Commission 
expects that its responsibilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other applicable 
statutes, as set out in the statement which follows, will be carried out 
in a manner consistent with this position in the overall public 
interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this 
appendix and any section of this part, the section governs.
    \1\Except as the context may otherwise indicate, this statement is 
also generally applicable to licensing proceedings of the type described 
in the statement which may be conducted by a hearing examiner as the 
presiding officer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Atomic safety and licensing boards are appointed from time to time 
by the Commission or the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Board Panel to conduct hearings in licensing cases under the authority 
of section 191 of the Act. Section 191 authorizes the Commission to 
establish one or more atomic safety and licensing boards to conduct 
public hearings and to make intermediate or final decisions in 
administrative proceedings relating to granting, suspending, revoking or 
amending licenses issued by the Commission. It requires that each board 
consist of one member who is qualified in the conduct of administrative 
proceedings and two members who have such technical or other 
qualifications as the Commission deems appropriate to the issues to be 
decided. Members of each board may be appointed by the Commission or by 
the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel from a panel 
selected from private life, the staff of the Commission or other Federal 
agencies.
    An Atomic Safety and Licensing Board may at its discretion appoint 
special assistants to the Board from the membership of the Atomic Safety 
and Licensing Board Panel established by the Commission. These special 
assistants are to be employed to facilitate the hearing process and 
improve the quality of the record produced for review. The special 
assistants may serve as technical interrogators in their individual 
fields of expertise, alternate Atomic Safety and Licensing Board members 
to sit with the Board and participate in the evidentiary sessions on the 
issue for which the alternate members were designated, Special Masters 
to hear evidentiary presentations by the parties on specific technical 
matters upon the consent of all parties, or informal consultants to 
brief the board prior to the hearing on the general technical background 
of subjects involving complex issues. The term ``alternate board 
member'' as a ``special assistant'' within the meaning of 10 CFR 
2.722(a)(3) should not be confused with the use of the term 
``alternate'' in 10 CFR 2.721(b). In the latter situation the 
``alternate'' is a substitute for a member of a Board who becomes 
unavailable. As a special assistant, the ``alternate'' sits with the 
three-member Board and not instead of the Board or any of its members.

                         I. Preliminary Matters

    (a) A public hearing is announced by the issuance of a notice of 
hearing, published in the Federal Register as soon as practicable after 
the application has been docketed, signed by the Secretary of the 
Commission

[[Page 127]]

stating the nature of the hearing and the issues to be considered. The 
time and place of the first prehearing conference pursuant to 
Sec. 2.751a will ordinarily be stated in the notice of hearing. Unless 
the initial notice of hearing states the time and place of the hearing, 
and the Chairman and other members of the Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Board that will conduct the hearing, those matters will be the subject 
of further notice in the Federal Register after publication of the 
initial notice of hearing. It is the Commission's policy and practice to 
begin the evidentiary hearing in the vicinity of the site of the 
proposed facility. The notice of hearing also states the procedures 
whereby persons may seek to intervene or make a limited appearance and 
explains the differences between those forms of participation in the 
proceeding, and states the times and places of the availability, in an 
appropriate office near the site of the proposed facility, of the notice 
of hearing, an updated copy of the application, the report of the 
Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), the staff safety 
evaluation, the applicant's environmental report, the Commission's 
environmental impact statement, the proposed construction permit or 
operating license and the transcripts of the prehearing conference and 
the hearing.
    (b) In fixing the time and place of any conference, including 
prehearing conferences, or of any adjourned session of the evidentiary 
hearing, due regard shall be had for the convenience and necessity of 
the parties, petitioners for leave to intervene, or the representatives 
of such persons, as well as of the Board members, the nature of such 
conference or adjourned session, and the public interest. Adjourned 
sessions of hearings may be held in the Washington, DC area if all 
parties so stipulate. If the parties disagree, and any party considers 
that there are valid reasons for holding such session in the Washington, 
DC area, the matter should be referred to the Commission for resolution.
    (c)(1) The Commission or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board may, 
consider on their own initiative, or a party may request the Commission 
or the board to consider, a particular issue or issues separately from, 
and prior to, other issues relating to the effect of the construction 
and/or operation of the facility upon the public health and safety, the 
common defense and security, and the environment or in regard to 
antitrust considerations. If the Commission or the Board determines that 
a separate hearing should be held, the notice of hearing or other 
appropriate notice will state the time and place of the separate hearing 
on such issue or issues. The board designated to conduct the hearing 
will issue an initial decision, if deemed appropriate, which will be 
dispositive of the issue(s) considered at the hearing, in the absence of 
an appeal or Commission review pursuant to Sec. 2.760, before the 
hearing on, and consideration of, the remaining issues in the 
proceeding.
    (2) In a proceeding relating to the issuance of a construction 
permit for a facility which is subject to the environmental impact 
statement requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and Subpart A of Part 51 of this 
chapter and which is a utilization facility for industrial or commercial 
purposes or is a testing facility, separate hearings may be held and 
decisions may be issued on National Environmental Policy Act and site 
suitability issues and other specified issues as provided by Subpart F 
and Sec. 2.761a.
    (d) Prior to a hearing, board members should review and become 
familiar with: The record of any relevant prior proceedings in the case, 
including initial decisions and Commission orders, the application, the 
ARCS report, the staff safety evaluation, the applicant's environmental 
report, the Commission's environmental impact statement, all other 
papers filed in the proceeding, the Commission's rules of practice, and 
other regulations or published statements of policy of the Commission as 
may be pertinent to the proceeding.
    (e) At any time when a board is in existence but is not actually in 
session, the chairman has all the powers of the board to take action on 
procedural matters. The chairman may have occasion, when the board is 
not in session, to dispose of preliminary procedural requests including, 
among other things, motions by parties relating to the conduct of the 
hearing. He may wish to discuss such requests with the other members of 
the board before ruling on them. No interlocutory appeal\2\ may be taken 
by a party as a matter of right from a ruling of the chairman or the 
board. The board should refer the challenged ruling to the Commission 
for a final decision if, in its judgment, a prompt decision is necessary 
to prevent detriment to the public interest or unusual delay or expense. 
This authority should be exercised sparingly, and only when deemed 
essential in fairness to the parties or the public.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\An interlocutory appeal means an appeal to the Commission from a 
ruling made by the board during the time between the issuance of a 
notice of hearing and the issuance of the initial decision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       II. Prehearing Conferences

    (a) A special prehearing conference will be held, within ninety (90) 
days after the notice of hearing has been published, or such other time 
as the Commission or the Board may deem appropriate, in addition to the 
standard prehearing conference provided by Sec. 2.752. The special 
prehearing conference, authorized by Sec. 2.751a, should be used to 
permit

[[Page 128]]

identification of key issues; take steps necessary for further 
identification of the issues; consider all intervention petitions to 
allow preliminary or final determination as to the parties; and 
establish a schedule for further actions in the proceeding.
    (b) Within sixty (60) days after discovery has been completed,\3\ or 
such other time as the presiding officer or the Commission deems 
appropriate, a second prehearing conference--the prehearing conference 
provided by Sec. 2.752--is held to consider simplification, 
clarification, and specification of the issues; consider amendments to 
the pleadings; obtain stipulations and admissions of facts and of the 
contents and authenticity of documents to avoid unnecessary proof; 
identification of witnesses; the setting of a hearing schedule; and such 
other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the hearing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ ``Discovery'', for this purpose, does not include production of 
the ACRS report, the staff's safety evaluation, or the detailed 
statement on environmental considerations prepared by the Director of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material Safety and 
Safeguards, as appropriate, or his designee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) A transcript of each prehearing conference will be prepared. The 
board will issue an order after the conclusion of the special prehearing 
conference which recites the action taken at the conference and 
agreements by the parties, identifies the key issues in controversy, 
makes a preliminary or final determination as to the parties, and 
provides for submission of status reports on discovery by the parties. 
The board will also issue an order after the conclusion of the second 
prehearing conference that specifies the issues in controversy in the 
proceeding. Each order shall be served upon all parties to the 
proceeding. Objections to such order may be filed by a party within five 
(5) days, or, in the case of the staff, within ten (10) days. The board 
may revise the order in the light of the objections presented and, as 
permitted by Sec. 2.718(i), may certify for determination to the 
Commission such matters raised in the objections as it deems 
appropriate. As specified in Sec. 2.752, the order shall control the 
subsequent course of the proceeding unless modified for good cause.
    (d) Prehearing conferences are open to the public except under 
exceptional circumstances involving such matters as classified 
information and certain privileged information not normally a part of 
the hearing record.
    (e) The applicant, the staff and other parties are required to 
provide each other and the board with copies of prepared testimony in 
advance of its being offered at the hearing. A schedule may be 
established at the second prehearing conference for exchange of prepared 
testimony. Prepared testimony is filed in the Commission's public 
document room and is available for public inspection. When the staff has 
reached its conclusions with respect to the application and prepared a 
safety evaluation, the safety evaluation will be made available--a point 
of time which may or may not be prior to the hearing.

                III. Intervention and Limited Appearances

    (a)(1) As required by Sec. 2.714, a person who wishes to intervene 
must set forth, in a petition for leave to intervene, his interest in 
the proceeding and how the interest may be affected by Commission 
action. Petitions for leave to intervene shall, as a basis for enabling 
the board or the Commission to determine how the petitioner's interest 
may be affected by the proceeding, set forth (i) the nature of his right 
under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding, (ii) the nature and 
extent of the interest that may be affected by the proceeding, and (iii) 
the effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the 
petitioner's interest. The petition must identify the specific aspects 
as to which the petitioner wishes to intervene and set forth with 
particularity the facts pertaining to his interest. The petitioner must 
file a supplement to his petition containing his contention(s) and basis 
therefor not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the holding of the 
special prehearing conference pursuant to Sec. 2.751a. After 
consideration of any answers to the petition, the board will rule on the 
petition. If the board finds that the petitioner's interest is limited 
to one or more of the issues in the proceeding, the intervenor's 
participation will be limited to those issues.
    Petitions and supplements thereto which set forth contentions 
relating only to matters outside the jurisdiction of the Commission will 
be denied. In any event, the granting of a petition for leave to 
intervene does not operate to enlarge the issues, or become a basis for 
receipt of evidence, with respect to matters beyond the jurisdiction of 
the Commission.
    (2) Petitions for leave to intervene which are not filed within the 
time specified in the notice of hearing will not be granted unless the 
board determines that the petition should be granted based upon 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and upon a balancing of (i) good cause, 
if any, for petitioner's failure to file on time, (ii) the availability 
of other means whereby the petitioner's interest will be protected, 
(iii) the extent to which petitioner's participation may reasonably be 
expected to assist in developing a sound record, (iv) the extent to 
which petitioner's interest will be represented by existing parties, and 
(v) the extent which the petitioner's participation will broaden the 
issues or delay the proceedings.

[[Page 129]]

    (3) Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, 
subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and 
have all the rights of the applicant to participate fully in the conduct 
of the hearing, such as the examination and cross-examination of 
witnesses, with respect to their contentions related to the matters at 
issue in the proceeding.
    (4) If more than one person who has been granted leave to intervene 
has substantially the same kind of interest that may be affected by the 
proceeding, and raises the same basic questions, the board or the 
Commission may order those persons to consolidate their presentation of 
evidence, cross-examination, briefs, proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law and argument, unless such consolidation cannot be 
accomplished without prejudice to the rights of a party.
    (b) A person who does not wish to, or is not qualified to become a 
party may be permitted at the discretion of the board, to make a limited 
appearance pursuant to Sec. 2.715. Persons permitted to make limited 
appearances do not become parties, but should be permitted to make 
statements at such stage of the proceeding as the board may consider 
appropriate. A person making a limited appearance may only make an oral 
or written statement on the record, and may not participate in the 
proceeding in any other way. The board may wish to limit the length of 
oral statements. A member of the public does not have the right to 
participate unless he has been granted the right to intervene as a party 
or the right of limited appearance for the purpose of making a 
statement.

                              IV. Discovery

    (a) Once the key issues in controversy are identified in the special 
prehearing conference order (Sec. 2.751a.(d)), discovery may proceed and 
will be limited to those matters. In no event should the parties be 
permitted to use discovery procedures to conduct a ``fishing 
expedition'' or to delay the proceeding.
    (b) Under the Commission's rules of practice, discovery permitted by 
Secs. 2.720, 2.740, 2.740a, 2.740b, 2.741, 2.742, and 2.744 must be 
completed by the second prehearing conference, except upon leave for 
good case shown.
    (c) Depositions, interrogatories and document production between 
parties other than the staff are obtainable on notice or request to the 
other party and without leave of the Commission or the board, in line 
with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (d) In general, staff documents that are relevant to a proceeding 
will be publicly available as a matter of course unless there is a 
compelling justification for their nondisclosure. Therefore, document 
discovery directed at the staff will be restricted, as provided in 
Sec. 2.744, since most staff documents will be publicly available and 
should reasonably disclose the basis for the staff's position. Formal 
discovery of documents against the staff will be limited to cases where 
it concerns a matter necessary to a proper decision in a case and the 
information sought is not obtainable elsewhere. Discovery as a 
legitimate means of obtaining information will not be inhibited, but in 
view of the comprehensive body of information routinely available 
without request, there should be minimum need to resort to time 
consuming discovery procedures. Discovery against the staff (and other 
NRC personnel, including consultants) by way of deposition is permitted 
upon a showing of exceptional circumstances. Interrogatories may be 
addressed to the staff where the information is necessary to proper 
decision in the case and not obtainable elsewhere.

                             V. The Hearing

    The board should use its powers under Secs. 2.718 and 2.757 to 
assure that the hearing is focused upon the matters in controversy among 
the parties and that the hearing process for the resolution of 
controverted matters is conducted as expeditiously as possible, 
consistent with the development of an adequate decisional record.
    The following procedures should be observed in the conduct of public 
hearings:
    (a) Preliminary:
    (1) A verbatim transcript will be made of the hearing.
    (2) The Chairman should convene the hearing by stating the title of 
the proceeding and describing its nature.
    (3) He should state the date, time, and place at which the 
prehearing conferences were held, and identify the persons participating 
in them. He should summarize the second prehearing conference order.
    (4) He should explain the procedures for the conduct of the hearing. 
He should request that counsel for the parties identify themselves on 
the record, and provide them with the opportunity to make opening 
statements of their respective positions.
    (5) He should describe, for the benefit of members of the public who 
may be present, the respective roles of the board, the ACRS and the 
staff, and the Commission procedures for review of the decision. He 
should also describe the continuing review and inspection surveillance 
conducted by the Commission after a construction permit or an operating 
license has been issued.
    (b)(1) The Chairman should call attention to the provisions of 
Sec. 2.715 for participation by limited appearance. He should briefly 
explain these provisions and the rights of persons who are permitted to 
make limited appearances.
    (2) The Chairman should inquire of those in attendance whether there 
are any who wish

[[Page 130]]

to participate in the hearing by limited appearance.
    (3) Should any person seek leave to intervene when the hearing has 
been convened, he must set forth, with particularity in a written 
petition, the reasons why it was not possible to file a petition within 
the time prescribed in the notice of hearing, as described in section 
III, to afford a basis for the board to determine whether or not good 
cause has been shown for the untimely filing. In granting a petition for 
leave to intervene which is not timely filed, the board will impose such 
conditions as are appropriate to minimize any delay in the proceeding.
    (4) A person making a limited appearance may want not only to state 
his position, but to raise questions which he would like to have 
answered. This should be permitted to the extent the questions are 
within the scope of the proceeding as defined by the issues set out in 
the notice of hearing, the prehearing conference order, and any later 
orders. Usually such persons should be asked to make their statements 
and raise their questions early in the proceeding so that the board will 
have an opportunity to be sure that relevant and meritorious questions 
are properly dealt with during the course of the hearing.
    (5) It is the Commission's view that the rules governing 
intervention and limited appearances are necessary in the interest of 
orderly proceedings. The Commission also believes that through these two 
methods of public participation all members of the public are assured of 
the right to participate by a method appropriate to their interest in 
the matter. This should be fully explained at the beginning of the 
hearing. In some cases the board may feel that it must deny an 
application to intervene but that it can still accommodate the desire of 
the person involved by allowing him to make a statement and raise 
questions under the limited appearance rule.
    (6) Boards have considerable discretion as to the manner in which 
they accommodate their conduct of the hearing to local public interest 
and the desires of local citizens to be heard. Particularly in cases 
where it is evident that there is local concern as to the safety of the 
proposed plant, boards should so conduct the hearing as to give 
appropriate opportunity for local citizens to express their views, while 
at the same time protecting the legal interests of all parties and the 
public interest in an orderly and efficient licensing process.
    (7) In some cases, argument and further hearing can add nothing to 
the filings of the parties. In those cases the board is authorized, 
pursuant to Sec. 2.749, on motion, to render a decision, if the filings 
in the proceeding and other materials show that there is no genuine 
issue as to any material fact. However, in proceedings involving 
construction permits, this procedure may be used only for determining 
subordinate issues and not the ultimate issue as to whether the 
construction permit should be issued.
    (c) Opening statements:
    (1) It is anticipated that the applicant, who has the burden of 
proof, will, at an appropriate time early in the proceeding, make an 
oral statement describing in terms that will be readily understood by 
the public, the principal safety and environmental considerations 
involved in carrying out the activity sought to be authorized.
    (2) Other parties to the proceeding may also make an oral opening 
statement describing their position on the proposed licensing action.
    (d) Evidence:
    (1) Pursuant to Sec. 2.732, the applicant has the burden of proof.
    (2) The parties are required to submit direct testimony in written 
form and serve copies of such prepared written testimony on all parties 
pursuant to the schedule established at the second prehearing 
conference--in any event, at least 15 days in advance of the session of 
the hearing at which such testimony is to be presented, as provided by 
Sec. 2.743(b), unless the board orders otherwise on the basis of 
objections presented. The staff's position is reflected primarily in the 
safety evaluation and final environmental impact statement. 
Consequently, the staff will not present its case until these documents 
are available. The use of such advance written testimony is expected to 
expedite the hearing process.
    (3) The testimony of all witnesses will be given under oath. These 
witnesses may be collectively sworn at the opening of the hearing or if 
additional witnesses are called upon to testify at a subsequent stage 
they may be sworn at the time of their appearance. There is ordinarily 
no need for oral recital of prepared testimony unless the Board 
considers that some useful purpose will be served.
    (4) The proceedings should be conducted as expeditiously as 
practicable, without impairing the development of a clear and adequate 
record. The order of presenting testimony may be freely varied in the 
conduct of the hearing. The Board may find it helpful to take expert 
testimony from witnesses on a roundtable basis after the receipt in 
evidence of prepared testimony.
    (5) To prevent unnecessary delays and an unnecessarily large record, 
the Board may, pursuant to Sec. 2.757, limit cumulative testimony, 
strike argumentative, repetitious, cumulative, or irrelevant evidence, 
take other necessary and proper steps to prevent argumentative, 
repetitious or cumulative cross examination, and impose appropriate time 
limitations on arguments.

[[Page 131]]

    (6) Documentary evidence may be offered in evidence as provided in 
Sec. 2.743. Such evidence offered during the course of the hearing 
should be described by counsel, and furnished to the reporter for 
marking. Documents offered for marking should be numbered in order of 
receipt. On identification of a document, it may be offered in evidence.
    (7) Objections may be made by counsel to any questions or any line 
of questioning, and to the admission of any document and should be ruled 
upon by the board. The board may admit the evidence, may sustain the 
objection, or may receive the evidence, reserving for later 
determination the question of admissibility. In passing on objections, 
the board, while not bound to view proferred evidence according to its 
admissibility under strict application of the rules of evidence in 
judicial proceedings, should exclude evidence that is irrelevant to 
issues in the case as defined in the notice of hearing or the prehearing 
conference order, or that pertains to matters outside the jurisdiction 
of the board or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Irrelevant material 
in prepared testimony submitted in advance under Sec. 2.743(b) may be 
subject to a motion to strike under the procedures provided in 
Sec. 2.730.
    (8) Use of scientifically or technically trained persons who are not 
attorneys to conduct direct or cross-examination on behalf of a party is 
provided for in Sec. 2.733. This procedure is a privilege, not a right, 
and may be granted to further the conduct of the hearing. Before 
permitting such a person to conduct examination of witnesses, the board 
must determine (i) that he has technical or scientific qualifications, 
(ii) that he has read the written testimony and any documents which are 
to be the subject of his examination, and (iii) that he has prepared 
himself to conduct a meaningful and expeditious examination. Permission 
to conduct examination will be limited to the areas in which the 
interrogator is shown to be qualified. The party on whose behalf the 
interrogator conducts the examination and his attorney are responsible 
for the interrogator's conduct of examination or cross-examination.
    (9) The extent to which challenges to NRC regulations can be made in 
a licensing proceeding is limited. A party may petition for waiver of or 
exception to the application of a specified NRC rule or regulation to an 
aspect of the subject matter of the proceeding. The party must file a 
petition and an affidavit that identifies the specific aspect of the 
subject matter of the proceeding as to which application of the rule or 
regulation would not serve the purpose for which the regulation was 
adopted and that sets forth with particularity the special circumstances 
alleged to justify a waiver or exception on that ground (Sec. 2.758). 
Upon a finding by the board, based on the petition and affidavits and 
any material submitted by other parties, that the party has not made a 
prima facie case, no evidence, discovery, or argument will be allowed on 
the matter. If the Board finds that such a showing has been made, it 
will certify the matter, without ruling, directly to the Commission for 
a determination as to whether the application of the regulation to a 
particular aspect of the subject matter of the proceeding should be 
waived or an exception made.
    (10) The Commission has recognized the public interest in achieving 
fair and reasonable settlement of contested proceedings (Sec. 2.759). 
Therefore, to the extent not inconsistent with the Act, fair and 
reasonable settlements are encouraged, either as to particular issues in 
a proceeding or the entire proceeding.
    (11) Unless testimony is being taken on a roundtable basis or there 
is some occasion for clarification of testimony as rendered, the board 
may wish to reserve its questions until the parties have completed 
questioning of the witnesses, since counsel for the respective parties 
will generally be prepared to develop the various lines of pertinent 
questions.
    (12) Conferences for the clarification of matters between the board 
and the parties, or the formulation of more meaningful questions, may be 
used to expedite the hearing and simplify the record. Informal 
conferences, including telephone conferences, should be encouraged to 
this end.
    (13) The board should ordinarily not adjourn the hearing once it has 
begun, except as the hearing may be divided into segments to permit 
consideration of discrete areas, such as (i) radiological health and 
safety or (ii) environmental impact. To the extent practicable, legal 
questions should be resolved prior to the hearing. If the board believes 
that additional information is required in the presentation of the case, 
it would be expected to request the applicant or other party to 
supplement the presentation. If a recess should prove necessary to 
obtain such additional evidence, the recess should ordinarily be 
postponed until available evidence has been received.
    (14) Many of the time limitations prescribed in Part 2 were set to 
allow the maximum time for the parties to the proceedings to perform 
various activities. Where the activities covered by the limitations can 
be performed in less time, the time limits may be reduced by order of 
the board, if appropriate, where such action would not prejudice a 
party. Similarly, in any case in which a time limit is not set by Part 
2, the board should impose reasonable time limits.
    (e) Record:
    (1) The transcript of testimony and the exhibits, together with all 
of the papers and requests filed in a proceeding, constitute the record 
for decision, except to the extent that official notice is taken.

[[Page 132]]

    (2) Generally speaking, a decision by a board must be made on the 
basis of evidence which is in the record of the proceeding. A board, 
however, is expected to use its expert knowledge and experience in 
evaluating and drawing conclusions from the evidence that is in the 
record. The board may also take account of and rely on certain facts 
which do not have to be ``proved'' since they are ``officially 
noticed''; these facts do not have to be ``proved'' since they are 
matters of common knowledge. Pursuant to Sec. 2.743(i) ``official 
notice'' may be taken of any fact of which judicial notice might be 
taken by the courts of the United States and of any technical or 
scientific fact within the knowledge of the Commission as an expert 
body. Each fact officially noticed must be specified in the record with 
sufficient particularity to advise the parties of the matters which have 
been noticed or brought to the attention of the parties before the final 
decision, and each party adversely affected by the decision must be 
afforded an opportunity to controvert the noticed fact. (For example, a 
board might take ``official notice'' of the fact that high level wastes 
are encountered mainly as liquid residue from fuel reprocessing plants.) 
Matters which are ``officially noticed'' by a board furnish the same 
basis for findings of fact as matters which have been placed in evidence 
and proved in the usual sense.
    (f) Participation by board members:
    (1) In contested proceedings, the board will determine controverted 
matters as well as decide whether the findings required by the Act and 
the Commission's regulations should be made and whether, in accordance 
with Subpart A of Part 51, the construction permit should be issued as 
proposed. Thus, in such proceedings, the board will determine the 
matters in controversy and may be called upon to make technical 
judgments of its own on those matters. As to matters pertaining to 
radiological health and safety which are not in controversy, boards are 
neither required nor expected to duplicate the review already performed 
by the staff and ACRS, and they are authorized to rely upon the 
testimony of the staff, the applicant, and the conclusions of the ACRS, 
which are not controverted by any party.
    (2) In an uncontested case, boards are neither required nor expected 
to duplicate the radiological safety review already performed by the 
staff and the ACRS and they are authorized to rely upon the testimony of 
the staff and the applicant, and the conclusions of the ACRS. The role 
of the board is not to conduct a de novo evaluation of the application, 
but rather to decide whether the application and the record of the 
proceeding contain sufficient information, and the review of the 
application by the Commission's staff, including the environmental 
review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, has 
been adequate, to support the findings proposed to be made by the 
Director of Regulation and the issuance of the construction permit 
proposed by the Director of Regulation. In doing so, the board is 
expected to be mindful of the fact that it is the applicant, not the 
staff, who is the proponent of the construction permit and who has the 
burden of proof.
    (3) Whether the construction permit proceeding is contested or 
uncontested, the board will, as to environmental impact matters, (a) 
determine whether the requirements of section 102(2) (A), (C) and (E) of 
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and Subpart A of Part 51 
of this chapter have been complied with; (b) independently consider the 
final balance among conflicting factors contained in the record, with a 
view to determining the appropriate action to be taken; and (c) 
determine whether the construction permit should be granted, denied, or 
appropriately conditioned to protect environmental values.
    (4) A question may be certified to the Commission for determination 
when a major or novel question of policy, law or procedure is involved 
which cannot be resolved except by the Commission and when the prompt 
and final decision of the question is important for the protection of 
the public interest or to avoid undue delay or serious prejudice to the 
interests of a party. For example, a board may find it appropriate to 
certify novel questions as to the regulatory jurisdiction of the 
Commission or the right of persons to intervene.
    (g) Close of hearing:
    (1) If, at the close of the hearing, the board should have 
uncertainties with respect to the matters in controversy because of a 
need for a clearer understanding of the evidence which has already been 
presented, it is expected that the board would normally invite further 
argument from the parties--oral or written or both--before issuing its 
initial decision. If the uncertainties arise from lack of sufficient 
information in the record, it is expected that the board would normally 
require further evidence to be submitted in writing with opportunity for 
the other parties to reply or reopen the hearing for the taking of 
further evidence, as appropriate. If either of such courses is followed, 
it is expected that the applicant would normally be afforded the 
opportunity to make the final submission.
    (2) A board should give each party the opportunity to make a brief 
closing statement.
    (3) A schedule should be set by the board and recorded, either in 
the transcript or by written order, of the dates upon which the parties 
are directed by the board to file proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law. In uncontested cases, the proposed findings will 
ordinarily be extremely brief. In contested proceedings, proposed 
findings of fact

[[Page 133]]

and conclusions of law submitted by the parties may be more detailed. 
While brevity in such submissions is encouraged, the proposed findings 
and conclusions should be such as to reflect the position of parties 
submitting them, and the technical and factual basis therefor.
    (4) The board should dispose of any additional procedural requests.
    (5) The chairman should formally close the hearing.

       VI. Posthearing Proceedings, Including the Initial Decision

    (a) A board, acting through the Chairman, should dispose of 
procedural requests made after the close of the hearing, including 
motions of the parties for correction of the transcript. Responses to 
requests and motions of the parties are made part of the record by 
issuance of written orders.
    (b) On receipt of proposed findings and conclusions from the 
parties, the board should prepare the initial decision. Under the 
Administrative Procedure Act and the Commission's regulations, the 
decision should include:
    (1) Findings, conclusions, and rulings, with the reasons or basis 
for them, on all material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented 
on the record;
    (2) All facts officially noticed and relied on, if any, in making 
the decision;
    (3) The appropriate ruling, order, or denial or relief, with the 
effective date and time within which a notice of appeal from the initial 
decision may be filed;
    (4) The time when the decision becomes final.
    (c) Issues to be decided by the board:
    (1) In a contested proceedings for the issuance of a construction 
permit, the board will determine the following issues:
    (i) Whether in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 50.35(a) of 
this chapter:
    (a) The applicant has described the proposed design of the facility, 
including, but not limited to, the principal architectural and 
engineering criteria for the design, and has identified the major 
features or components incorporated therein for the protection of the 
health and safety of the public;
    (b) Such further technical or design information as may be required 
to complete the safety analysis and which can reasonably be left for 
later consideration, will be supplied in the final safety analysis 
report;
    (c) Safety features or components, if any, which requires research 
and development have been described by the applicant and the applicant 
has identified, and there will be conducted, a research and development 
program reasonably designed to resolve any safety questions associated 
with such features and components; and
    (d) On the basis of the foregoing, there is reasonable assurance 
that
    (1) Such safety questions will be satisfactorily resolved at or 
before the latest date stated in the application for completion of 
construction of the proposed facility, and
    (2) Taking into consideration the site criteria contained in Part 
100 of this chapter, the proposed facility can be constructed and 
operated at the proposed location without undue risk to the health and 
safety of the public.
    (ii) Whether the applicant is technically qualified to design and 
construct the proposed facility;
    (iii) Whether the applicant is financially qualified to design and 
construct the proposed facility;
    (iv) Whether the issuance of a permit for the construction of the 
facility will be inimical to the common defense and security or to the 
health and safety of the public;
    (v) Whether, with respect to the requirements of section 102(2) (A), 
(C) and (E) of the National Environmental Policy Act, in accordance with 
Subpart A of Part 51 of this chapter, the construction permit should be 
issued as proposed.
    (2) In an uncontested proceeding for the issuance of a construction 
permit, the board will, without conducting a de novo evaluation of the 
application, determine:
    (i) Whether the application and the record of the proceeding contain 
sufficient information, and the review of the application by the 
Commission's staff has been adequate, to support the findings proposed 
to be made and required by the Act for the issuance of the construction 
permit proposed by the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or 
Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, and
    (ii) Whether the review conducted pursuant to the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 has been adequate.
    (3) Regardless of whether the proceeding is contested or 
uncontested, the board will, in its initial decision, in accordance with 
Subpart A of Part 51 of this chapter:
    (i) Determine whether the requirements of section 102(2)(A), (C) and 
(E) of the National Environmental Policy Act and Subpart A of Part 51 of 
this chapter have been complied with in the proceeding;
    (ii) Independently consider the final balance among conflicting 
factors contained in the record of the proceeding with a view to 
determining the appropriate action to be taken; and
    (iii) Determine whether the construction permit should be issued, 
denied, or appropriately conditioned to protect environmental values.
    (d) It is expected that ordinarily a board will render its initial 
decision within 35 days after its receipt of proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions of law filed by the parties in

[[Page 134]]

a contested case and within 15 days after receipt of such proposed 
findings and conclusions in an uncontested case.
    (e) The initial decision will be transmitted to the Chief, Docketing 
and Service Section, Office of the Secretary, for issuance.
    (f) After the board's initial decision is issued, the entire record 
of the hearing, including the board's initial decision, will be sent to 
the Commission for review. In the course of this review, the Commission 
may allow the board's decision to become the final decision of the 
Commission, may modify a board decision, or may send the case back to 
the board for additional testimony on particular points or for further 
consideration of particular issues.

                              VII. General

    (a) Two members, being a majority of the board, constitute a quorum, 
if one of those members is the member qualified in the conduct of 
administrative proceedings. The vote of a majority controls in any 
decision by a board, including rulings during the course of a hearing as 
well as formal orders and the initial decision. A dissenting member is 
of course, free to express his dissent and the reasons for it in a 
separate opinion for the record.
    (b) The Commission or the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and 
Licensing Board Panel may designate a technically qualified alternate or 
an alternate qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings, or 
both, for a board. The designation of an alternate is discretionary. 
Alternates may be designated where the Commission (or the Chairman of 
the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel) in its judgment believes 
that a proceeding involves factors that warrant the continuing 
assignment and presence of an alternate. If any alternates are 
designated before the hearing, they will receive copies and become 
familiar with the application and other documents filed by the parties 
prior to the start of the hearing. It is expected that an alternate will 
be constituted or appointed by the Commission or the Chairman of the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel as a member of the board in 
situations where a technically qualified member of the board, or the 
member qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings, becomes 
unavailable.
    (c) Section 2.781 specifies when consultation between Commissioners 
or boards, on the one hand, and the staff, on the other hand, is 
permitted in licensing proceedings conducted under Subpart G. Section 
2.781 also permits a board, in the same type of proceeding, to consult 
with members of the panel from which the members of the board are drawn.

      VIII. Procedures Applicable to Operating License Proceedings

    (a) This section sets out certain differences in procedure from 
those described in sections I-VII above, which are required by the fact 
that the proceeding is for the issuance of an operating license rather 
than a construction permit. Otherwise, the provisions of sections I 
through VII of this statement of general policy also apply to an 
operating license proceeding, except as the context requires otherwise.
    (b) In an operating license proceeding the board will determine the 
matters in controversy among the parties, and where the board determines 
that a serious safety, environmental, or common defense and security 
matter was not raised by the parties, the board will determine such 
matter as being among the issues to be decided. Those issues will be 
specified in the notice of a hearing issued by the Commission, or in a 
prehearing conference order issued by the board in the exercise of its 
discretion during the hearing.
    The issues will be the matters in controversy among the parties or 
raised by the board within the purview of the following:
    (1) Whether there is reasonable assurance that construction of the 
facility will be substantially completed, on a timely basis, in 
conformity with the construction permit and the application as amended, 
the provisions of the Act, and the rules and regulations of the 
Commission;
    (2) Whether the facility will operate in conformity with the 
application as amended, the provisions of the Act, and the rules and 
regulations of the Commission;
    (3) Whether there is reasonable assurance (i) that the activities to 
be authorized by the operating license can be conducted without 
endangering the health and safety of the public, and (ii) that such 
activities will be conducted in compliance with the Commission's 
regulations;
    (4) Whether the applicant is technically and financially qualified 
to engage in the activities to be authorized by the operating license in 
accordance with the Commission's regulations, except that the issue of 
financial qualification shall not be considered by the board if the 
applicant is an electric utility seeking a license to operate a 
utilization facility of the type described in Sec. 50.21(b) or 
Sec. 50.22.
    (5) Whether the applicable provisions of 10 CFR Part 140 have been 
satisfied;
    (6) Whether issuance of the license will be inimical to the common 
defense and security or to the health and safety of the public; and
    (7) Whether, with respect to the requirements of section 102(2) (A), 
(C), and (E) of the National Environmental Policy Act, in accordance 
with Subpart A of Part 51, the operating license should be issued as 
proposed.

[[Page 135]]

    (c) The board, in operating license proceedings, will make findings 
on the matters in controversy among the parties and any matter not 
raised by the parties but examined by the board in its discretion in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 2.760a. Depending 
on the resolution of those matters, the Director of Regulation would 
issue, deny, or appropriately condition the operating license.
    (d) In operating license proceedings, the procedure for summary 
disposition of the proceeding on the pleadings described in Sec. 2.749 
may be used to determine the ultimate issue of whether the operating 
license should be issued.

 X. Proceedings for the Consideration of Antitrust Aspects of Facility 
                          License Applications

    (a) Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Commission 
is required, with respect to applications for construction permits or 
operating licenses for production and utilization facilities for 
industrial or commercial purposes licensed under section 103, which 
include power reactors subject to the mandatory hearing requirements of 
section 189a of the Act, to follow procedures for antitrust review in 
section 105c of the Act. This section outlines the procedures used by 
the Commission to implement that section.
    (b)(1) When the antitrust information portion of an application is 
received and docketed for a facility construction permit under section 
103 of the Act which is subject to antitrust review under section 105c, 
the notice of receipt of the antitrust information published in the 
Federal Register shall state that persons who wish to have their views 
on the antitrust aspects of the application considered by the NRC and 
presented to the Attorney General for consideration shall submit such 
views to the Commission within sixty (60) days after publication of the 
notice.
    (2) Upon receipt of the antitrust information responsive to 
Regulatory Guide 9.3 submitted in connection with an application for a 
facility operating license under section 103 of the Act, the Director of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation or the Director of Nuclear Material Safety 
and Safeguards, as appropriate, shall publish in the Federal Register 
and in appropriate trade journals a ``Notice of Receipt of Operating 
License Antitrust Information.'' The notice shall invite persons to 
submit, within thirty (30) days after publication of the notice, 
comments or information concerning antitrust aspects of the application 
to assist the Director in determining, pursuant to section 105c of the 
Act, whether significant changes in the licensee's activities or 
proposed activities have occurred since completion of the previous 
antitrust review in connection with the construction permit application. 
The notice shall also state that persons who wish to have their views on 
the antitrust aspects of the application considered by the NRC and 
presented to the Attorney General for consideration should submit such 
views within thirty (30) days after publication of the notice to: U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Chief, 
Antitrust and Economic Analysis Branch.
    (3) If the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or the Director of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, after reviewing 
any comments or information received in response to the published notice 
and any comments or information regarding the applicant received from 
the Attorney General, concludes that there have been no significant 
changes since the completion of the previous antitrust review in 
connection with the construction permit, a finding of no significant 
changes shall be published in the Federal Register, together with a 
notice stating that any request for reevaluation of such finding should 
be submitted within thirty (30) days of publication of the notice. If no 
requests for reevaluation are received within that time, the finding 
shall become the NRC's final determination. Requests for a reevaluation 
of the no significant changes determination shall be accepted after the 
date when the Director's finding becomes final but before the issuance 
of the OL only if they contain new information, such as information 
about facts or events of antitrust significance that have occurred since 
that date, or information that could not reasonably have been submitted 
prior to that date.
    (4) If, as a result of the reevaluation of the finding described 
above, it is determined that there have been no significant changes, the 
Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, shall deny the request and shall 
publish a notice of finding of no significant changes in the Federal 
Register. The notice and finding become the final NRC decision thirty 
(30) days after being made and only in the event that the Commission has 
not exercised sua sponte review.
    (5) If the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or the Director of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, concludes that 
significant changes have occurred since the completion of the previous 
antitrust review in connection with the construction permit, then the 
provisions of Sec. 2.102(d) shall apply.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) below, the Director of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation or the Director of Nuclear Material Safety 
and Safeguards, as appropriate, shall refer and transmit a copy of each 
application for a construction permit or an operating license for a 
utilization or production facility under section 103 of the Act, to the 
Attorney General as required by section 105c of the

[[Page 136]]

Act. Under that section, the Attorney General will, within a reasonable 
time, but in no event to exceed 180 days after receipt, render such 
advice to the Commission as is determined to be appropriate in regard to 
the finding to be made by the Commission as to whether the activities 
under the license would create or maintain a situation inconsistent with 
the antitrust laws specified in subsection 105a of the Act.
    (2) The review by the Attorney General described in paragraph (c)(1) 
above is not required for applications for operating licenses for 
production or utilization facilities under section 103 of the Act for 
which the construction permit was also issued under section 103, unless 
the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or the Director of Nuclear 
Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, determines, after 
consultation with the Attorney General and in accordance with 
Sec. 2.101(e), that such review is advisable on the ground that 
significant changes in the licensee's activities or proposed activities 
have occurred subsequent to the previous review by the Attorney General 
and by the Commission under section 105c of the Act in connection with 
the construction permit.
    (d) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation or Director of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, will publish the 
Attorney General's advice in the Federal Register promptly upon receipt, 
and will make such advice a part of the record in any proceeding on 
antitrust matters conducted in accordance with subsection 105c(5) and 
section 189a of the Act. The Director of Regulation will also publish in 
the Federal Register a notice that the Attorney General has not rendered 
any such advice. The notice published in the Federal Register will also 
include a notice of hearing, if appropriate, or, if the Attorney General 
has not recommended a hearing, will state that any person whose interest 
may be affected by the proceeding may, pursuant to and in accordance 
with Sec. 2.714, file a petition for leave to intervene and request a 
hearing on the antitrust aspects of the application. The notice will 
state that petitions for leave to intervene and requests for hearing 
shall be filed within 30 days after publication of the notice.
    (e) If a hearing on antitrust aspects of the application is 
requested, or is recommended by the Attorney General, it will generally 
be held separately from the hearing held on matters of radiological 
health and safety and common defense and security described in sections 
I-VIII of this appendix. The notice of hearing will fix a time for the 
hearing, which will be as soon as practicable after the receipt of the 
Attorney General's advice and compliance with section 189a of the Act 
and other provisions of this part. However, as permitted by subsection 
105c(8) of the Act, with respect to proceedings in which an application 
for a construction permit was filed prior to December 19, 1970, and 
proceedings in which a written request for antitrust review of an 
application for an operating license to be issued under section 104b has 
been made by a person who intervened or sought by timely written notice 
to the Commission to intervene in the construction permit proceeding for 
the facility to obtain a determination of antitrust consideration or to 
advance a jurisdictional basis for such determination within 25 days 
after the date of publication in the Federal Register of notice of 
filing of the application for an operating license or December 19, 1970, 
whichever is later, the Commission may issue a construction permit or 
operating license, provided that the permit or license so issued 
contains the condition specified in Sec. 50.55b of this chapter.
    (f) Hearings on antitrust aspects will be conducted by a presiding 
officer, either an Administrative Law Judge or an atomic safety and 
licensing board comprised of three members, one of whom will be 
qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings and two of whom 
will have such technical or other qualifications as the Commission deems 
appropriate to the issues to be decided.
    (g) When the Attorney General has advised that there may be adverse 
antitrust aspects and recommends that a hearing be held, the Attorney 
General or his designee may participate as a party in the proceedings.
    (h) At the hearing, the presiding officer will give due 
consideration to the advice received from the Attorney General and to 
evidence pertaining to antitrust aspects received at the hearing.
    (i) The presiding officer will, in the initial decision, make a 
finding as to whether the activities under the proposed license would 
create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws as 
specified in section 105a of the Act. If the presiding officer finds 
that such a situation would be created or maintained, it will consider, 
in determining whether the permit or license should be issued or 
continued, such other factors as it deems necessary to protect the 
public interest, including the need for power in the affected area. The 
certainty of contravening the antitrust laws or the policies clearly 
underlying these laws is not intended to be implicit in this standard; 
nor is mere possibility of inconsistency. The finding will be based on 
reasonable probability of contravention of the antitrust laws or the 
policies clearly underlying these laws. The presiding officer will 
conclude whether, in its judgment, it is reasonably probable that the 
activities under the license would, when the license is issued or 
thereafter, be inconsistent with any of the antitrust laws or the 
policies clearly underlying these laws.

[[Page 137]]

    (j) On the basis of the findings in the proceeding on the antitrust 
aspect of the application, the presiding officer may (i) authorize the 
issuance of the permit or license after favorable consideration of 
matters of radiological health and safety and common defense and 
security, and matters raised under the National Environmental Policy Act 
of 1969, at the hearing described in sections I-VIII of this appendix; 
(ii) authorize the continuation of a permit or license already issued; 
(iii) direct the denial of the application for the permit or license, or 
the rescission of a permit or license already issued; or (iv) authorize 
the issuance of a permit or license subject to appropriate conditions, 
and subject to favorable consideration of matters of radiological health 
and safety and common defense matters raised under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 at the hearing described in sections I-
VIII of this appendix.

assistance is authorized under a law administered by NRC. The programs 
to which this part applies are listed in appendix A of this part;

way of grant, entitlement, cooperative agreement, loan, contract, or 
other agreement by NRC, or an authorized contractor or subcontractor of 
NRC, the terms of which require compliance with this part. If any 
statutes implemented by this part are otherwise applicable, the failure 
to list a program in appendix A does not mean the program is not covered 
by this part. This part does not apply to--
    (a) Contracts of insurance or guaranty; or
    (b) Procurement contracts; or

Sec. 4.11   General prohibition.

    No person in the United States shall, on the ground of sex, race, 
color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied 
the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any 
program to which this subpart applies.

<R05>
Sec. 4.12   Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.

    (a) A recipient under any program to which this subpart applies may 
not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the 
ground of sex, race, color, or national origin:
    (1) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (2) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an 
individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, 
from that provided to others under the program;
    (3) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in 
any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or 
other benefit under the program;
    (4) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, 
financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
    (5) Treat an individual differently from others in determining 
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibilty, 
membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet 
in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (6) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an 
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under 
the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as 
an employee but only to the extent set forth in Sec. 4.13).
    (b) A recipient in determining the types of services, financial aid, 
or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such 
program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will 
be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be 
afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, 
directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria 
or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting 
individuals to discrimination because of their sex, race, color, or 
national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects 
individuals of a particular sex, race, color, or national origin.
    (c) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient 
or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, 
on the grounds of sex, race, color, or national origin; or with the 
purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the 
accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this subpart.

[[Page 143]]

    (d) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other 
benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance 
shall be deemed to include any services, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal 
financial assistance.
    (e) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this section and Sec. 4.13 does not limit the generality of the 
prohibition in Sec. 4.11.
    (f) This subpart does not prohibit the consideration of sex, race, 
color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or 
overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have 
restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of sex, 
race, color or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice 
or usage tends, on the grounds of sex, race, color, or national origin, 
to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits 
of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity 
to which this subpart applies, the applicant or recipient has an 
obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the 
consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to 
accomplish the purposes of the Act.

Sec. 4.13   Employment practices.

    (a) Where a primary objective of a program of Federal financial 
assistance to which this subpart applies is to provide employment, a 
recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of 
sex, race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under 
such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, 
employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, 
rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities), 
including programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial 
assistance is (1) to assist such individuals through employment to meet 
expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education 
or training, or (2) to provide work experience which contributes to the 
education or training of such individuals. (Examples of such programs 
are nuclear training equipment grants, grants and loans of materials for 
training, and fellowship programs.) The requirements applicable to 
construction employment under any such program shall be those specified 
in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive 
order which supersedes it.
    (b) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is 
not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of sex, 
race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the 
recipient or other persons subject to this subpart tends, on the grounds 
of sex, race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from 
participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to 
discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the 
employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this 
subpart to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, 
and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.

Sec. 4.14   Medical emergencies.

    A recipient shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with 
Sec. 4.11 if immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an 
individual is necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of 
his health, and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except 
by or through a medical institution which refuses or fails to comply 
with Sec. 4.11.

                           Assurances Required


<R05>
Sec. 4.21   General requirements.

    (a) Every grant, loan or contract under a program to which this 
subpart applies, except a program to which Sec. 4.22 applies, shall, as 
a condition to its approval by NRC, or by the appropriate NRC contractor 
or subcontractor, and the extension of any Federal financial assistance 
pursuant thereto, contain or

[[Page 144]]

be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted in 
compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart. 
In the case of a grant, loan, or contract involving Federal financial 
assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance 
shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, 
the transferee, for the period during which the real property or 
structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial 
assistance is extended, or for another purpose involving the provision 
of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property the 
assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he 
retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the 
assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which 
Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the grant, loan or 
contract. The Commission will specify the form of the foregoing 
assurances for each program and the extent to which like assurances will 
be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, successors 
in interest, and other participants in the program. Any such assurance 
shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek 
its judicial enforcement.
    (b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements 
thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired with Federal financial 
assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is 
provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein 
from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the 
transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring 
nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used 
for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or 
for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or 
benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is 
improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to 
include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. 
Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such 
convenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be 
reserved by the NRC to revert title to the property in the event of a 
breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the NRC, such a 
condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the program and to the 
nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of 
real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real 
property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement 
of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the 
property was transferred, the NRC may agree, upon request of the 
transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such 
conditions as the NRC deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such 
right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other 
encumbrance remains effective.
    (c) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued 
by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).

    Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing 
Federal financial assistance shall require the submission of and every 
grant, loan, or contract to or with a State or a State agency to carry 
out a program involving continuing Federal financial assistance to which 
this subpart applies, shall, as a condition to its approval and the 
extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the grant, 
loan or contract, contain or be accompanied by, a statement that the 
program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in 
compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, 
and shall provide or be accompanied by provisions for such methods of 
administration for the program as are found by the responsible NRC 
official to give reasonable assurance that the recipient and all other 
recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will 
comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart.

Sec. 4.24   Assurances from institutions.

    (a) In the case of a grant, loan or contract involving Federal 
financial assistance to an institution of higher education, the 
assurance required by Sec. 4.21 shall extend to admission practices and 
to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.
    (b) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher 
education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance 
relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or 
other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or clients of the 
institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of 
services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to 
the entire institution unless the institution establishes, to the 
satisfaction of the responsible NRC official, that the institution's 
practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no 
way affect its practices in the program of the institution for which 
Federal financial assistance is sought, of the beneficiaries of or 
participants in such program. If in any such case the assistance sought 
is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the 
assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility and to 
facilities operated in connection therewith.

    (a) Each recipient shall keep records and submit to the responsible 
NRC official, timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at the 
times and in the form and containing the information that the 
responsible NRC official may determine to be necessary to enable the 
official to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying 
with this subpart.
    (b) In the case of any program under which a primary recipient 
extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, the other 
recipient shall also submit necessary compliance reports to the primary 
recipient to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations 
under this subpart.
    (c) The primary recipient shall retain each record of information 
needed to complete a compliance report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section for three years or as long as the primary recipient retains the 
status of primary recipient as defined in Sec. 4.4, whichever is 
shorter.

during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, 
and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent 
to ascertain compliance with this subpart. Where any information 
required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other 
agency, institution or person and that agency, institution or person 
shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so 
certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to 
obtain the information.


<R05>

of this subpart and its applicability to the program under which the 
recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such 
information available to them in such manner, as the responsible NRC 
official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections 
against discrimination assured them by the Act and this subpart.

days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for 
filing is extended by the responsible NRC official. A complaint shall be

by voluntary means, (b) there has been an express finding on the record, 
after opportunity for hearing,

[[Page 147]]

expiration of thirty (30) days after the Commission has filed with the 
committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having 
legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written

finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the 
particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has 
been so found.


<R05>

the statements shall have the effect of a denial. Allegations of fact 
not denied shall be deemed to be admitted. The answer shall separately 
state and identify matters alleged as affirmative defenses and may also 
set forth the matters of fact and law on which the applicant or 
recipient relies. The answer may request a hearing.

for the public interest. An answer to a notice of hearing is not 
required.

to request a hearing, without waiving the requirement for findings of 
fact and conclusions of law or the right to seek Commission review in

provisions of Secs. 4.71 through 4.74. At the time an answer is filed 
the applicant or recipient may also submit written information or 
argument for the record if he does not request a hearing.
    (e) An answer or stipulation may consent to the entry of an order in 
substantially the form set forth in the notice of opportunity for 
hearing; such order may be entered by the responsible Commission 
official. The consent of the applicant or recipient to the entry of an 
order shall constitute a waiver by him of a right to: (1) A hearing 
under the Act and Sec. 4.48, (2) findings of fact and conclusions of 
law, and (3) seek Commission review.
    (f) The failure of an applicant or recipient to file an answer 
within the period prescribed, or, if he requests a hearing, his failure 
to appear therefor, shall constitute a waiver by him of a right to: (1) 
A hearing under the Act and Sec. 4.48, (2) conclusions of law, and (3) 
seek Commission review. In the event of such waiver, the responsible NRC 
official may find the facts on the basis of the record available and 
enter an order in substantially the form set forth in the notice of 
opportunity for hearing.
    (g) An order entered in accordance with paragraph (e) or (f) of this 
section shall constitute the final decision of the Commission, unless 
the Commission, on its own motion, within forty-five (45) days after 
entry of the order, issues its own decision, which shall then constitute 
the final decision of the Commission.
    (h) A copy of an order entered by the responsible NRC official shall 
be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
    (i) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to place the burden of 
proof on the applicant or recipient.

thereunder, or
    (b) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder and any

substantially limits one or more major life activities.
    (4) Is regarded as having an impairment means:
    (i) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially 
limit major life activities but is treated by a recipient as 
constituting such a limitation;
    (ii) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits 
major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward 
such impairment; or
    (iii) Does not have a physical or mental impairment but is treated

                        Discriminatory Practices


<R05>
Sec. 4.121  General prohibitions against discrimination.

    (a) No qualified handicapped person, shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subject to discrimination under any program or activity 
that receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance.
    (b)(1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may 
not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, 
on the basis of handicap:
    (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;
    (iii) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, 
or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to 
obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same 
level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons than is 
provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified 
handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as 
effective as those provided to others;

aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program;
    (vi) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
    (vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the

opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not 
separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.
    (3) A recipient may not directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration: (i) That 
have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the purpose or 
effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the 
objectives of the recipient's program with respect to handicapped 
persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another 
recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative 
control or are agencies of the same State.
    (4) A recipient may not, in determining the site or location of a 
facility, make selections: (i) That have the effect of excluding 
handicapped persons from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise 
subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that 
receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance or (ii) that have 
the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the 
accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect 
to handicapped persons.
    (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or Executive Order to handicapped 
persons or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped persons from 
a program limited by Federal statute or Executive Order to a different 
class of handicapped persons is not prohibited by this subpart.
    (d) Recipients shall administer programs and activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped 
persons.

[[Page 153]]

    (e) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that

be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or 
activity that receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance.
    (b) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under 
any program or activity to which this subpart applies in a manner which 
ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur and 
may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way 
that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of 
handicap.
    (c) The prohibition against discrimination in employment applies to 
the following activities:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for 
employment;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, 
transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and 
rehiring;
    (3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in

applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. 
The relationships referred to in this paragraph include relationships 
with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, with 
organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of 
the recipient, and with organizations providing training and 
apprenticeship programs.


<R05>
Sec. 4.123  Reasonable accommodation.

    (a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known 
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped 
applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its 
program.
    (b) Reasonable accommodation may include: (1) Making facilities used 
by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, 
and (2) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, 
acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of 
readers or interpreters, and other similar actions. This list is neither 
all-inclusive nor meant to suggest that an employer must follow all the 
actions listed.
    (c) In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section whether 
an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a 
recipient's program, factors to be considered include:
    (1) The overall size of the recipient's program with respect to 
number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget;
    (2) The type of the recipient's operations, including the 
composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
    (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
    (d) A recipient may not deny any employment opportunity to a 
qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for denial is 
the need to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental 
limitations of the employee or applicant.

[[Page 154]]


<R05>
Sec. 4.124  Employment criteria.

    (a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other 
selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped 
persons or any class of handicapped persons unless:
    (1) The test score or other selection criterion as used by the 
recipient is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and
    (2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out 
or tend to screen out as many handicapped persons are not available.
    (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning 
employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant 
or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or 
employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test 
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or 
employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where 
those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).


<R05>
Sec. 4.125  Preemployment inquiries.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not 
make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant 
is a handicapped person or as to the nature of severity of a handicap. A 
recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's 
ability to perform job-related functions.
    (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination, or when a recipient is taking voluntary 
action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited 
participation in its federally assisted program or activity, or when a 
recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the recipient may invite applicants for 
employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped: 
Provided, That:
    (1) The recipient makes clear to the applicant that the information 
requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial 
action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and
    (2) The recipient makes clear to the applicant that the information 
is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept 
confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal 
to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, 
and that it will be used only in accordance with this subpart.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty: 
Provided, That:
    (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination 
regardless of handicap; and
    (2) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance 
with the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the 
medical condition or history of the applicant must be collected on 
separate forms. The recipient shall retain each form as a record for 
three years from the date the applicant's employment ends, or, if not 
hired, from the date of application. Each form must be accorded 
confidentiality as a medical record, except that:
    (1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions 
on the work or duties that may be assigned to handicapped persons and 
regarding necessary accommodations;
    (2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where 
appropriate, if the condition associated with the handicap might require 
emergency treatment; and
    (3) Government officials investigating compliance with the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 shall be provided relevant information upon 
request.

Sec. 4.126  General requirement concerning program accessibility.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, because a recipient's 
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be 
denied the

[[Page 155]]

benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives 
or benefits from Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 4.127  Existing facilities.

    (a) Program accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or 
activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, 
is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This 
paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its 
existing facilities or every part of an existing facility accessible to 
and usable by handicapped persons.
    (b) Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible 
buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of 
health, welfare or other social services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in 
conformance with the requirements of Sec. 4.128 or any other methods 
that result in making its program or activity accessible to and usable 
by handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing 
among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that 
offer programs and activities to handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of 
this subpart except that where structural changes in facilities are 
necessary, the changes are to be made within three years of the 
effective date of this subpart, but in any event, as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall develop a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete the changes. The plan is to be developed 
with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped 
persons, or organizations representing handicapped persons, and the plan 
is to meet with the approval of the NRC. The recipient shall retain a 
copy of the transition plan as a record until any structural change to a 
facility is complete. A copy of the transition plan is to be made 
available for public inspection. At a minimum, the plan is to:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility and usability of its program or activity to 
handicapped persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and, if the time period or the transition 
plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.
    (e) Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to 
ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision 
or hearing, can obtain information concerning the existence and location 
of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to, and 
usable by, handicapped persons.

Sec. 4.128  New construction.

    (a) Design, construction, and alteration. New facilities shall be 
designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the 
maximum extent feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (b) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of

shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section

[[Page 156]]

with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical 
and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are 
permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and 
usability of the building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without 
removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

discrimination occurred or (ii) with respect to handicapped persons who 
would have been participants in the program had the discrimination not 
occurred.
    (d) Voluntary action. A recipient may take steps, in addition to any 
action that is required by this subpart, to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's 
program or activity by qualified handicapped persons.
    (e) Self-evaluation. (1) A recipient shall as soon as practicable:

<R05>
Sec. 4.301  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of this subpart is to set forth NRC policies and 
procedures under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 which prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving 
Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 4.302  Application of this subpart.

    (a) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and these regulations apply

    (i) Provides any benefits or assistance to persons based on age; or
    (ii) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or
    (iii) Describes intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-
related terms.
    (2) Any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, 
labor organization, or any labor-management joint apprenticeship 
training program, except for any program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance for public service employment under the 
Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1974 (CETA) (29 U.S.C. 801 
et seq.).

              Standards for Determining Age Discrimination


<R05>
Sec. 4.311  Rules against age discrimination.

    The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions 
contained in Secs. 4.313 and 4.314 of this subpart.
    (a) General rule. No person in the United States shall, on the basis 
of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or 
be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance.
    (b) Specific rules. A recipient may not, in any program or activity 
receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual, 
licensing, or other arrangements use age distinctions or take any other 
actions which have the effect, on the basis of age, of--
    (1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or 
subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance, or
    (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to 
participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance.
    (c) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) 
of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.


<R05>
Sec. 4.312  Definitions of ``normal operation'' and ``statutory objective''.

    For purposes of Secs. 4.313 and 4.314, the terms ``normal 
operation'' and ``statutory objective'' have the following meaning:
    (a) Normal operation means the operation of a program or activity 
without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its 
objectives.
    (b) Statutory objective means any purposes of a program or activity 
expressly stated in any Federal statute State statute, or local statute 
or ordinance adopted by an elected general purpose legislative body.


<R05>
Sec. 4.313  Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination. Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.

    A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by 
Sec. 4.311, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor 
necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory 
objective of a program of activity. An action reasonably takes into 
account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the 
achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if--
    (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other 
characteristics; and
    (b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in 
order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, 
or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and
    (c) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or 
approximated by the use of age; and
    (d) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly 
on an individual basis.


<R05>
Sec. 4.314  Exceptions to the rule against age discrimination. Reasonable factors other than age.

    A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by 
Sec. 4.311 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that 
action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. 
An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor 
bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of 
the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.

[[Page 159]]


<R05>
Sec. 4.315  Burden of proof.

    The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls 
within the exceptions outlined in Secs. 4.313 and 4.314 is on the 
recipient of Federal financial assistance.

                        Duties of NRC Recipients


<R05>
Sec. 4.321  Assurance of compliance.

    Each NRC recipient has primary responsibility to ensure that its 
programs and activities are in compliance with the Act and these 
regulations. Each recipient will sign an assurance of compliance that 
its programs and activities will be conducted in compliance with all the 
requirements imposed by the Act and these regulations. A recipient also 
has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and to 
afford access to its records to NRC, to the extent required to determine 
whether it is in compliance with the Act and these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 4.322  Written notice, technical assistance, and educational materials.

    (a) NRC will provide written notice to each recipient of its 
obligations under the Act and these regulations, including its 
obligation under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Where a recipient makes available Federal financial assistance 
from NRC to a subrecipient, the recipient shall provide the subrecipient 
written notice of the subrecipient's obligations under the Act and these 
regulations.
    (c) NRC will provide technical assistance, where necessary, to 
recipients to aid them in complying with the Act and these regulations.

determine whether the recipient is complying with the Act and these 
regulations.
    (b) Permit reasonable access by NRC to the recipient's books, 
records, accounts, facilities, and other sources of information to the 
extent necessary to determine whether the recipient is in compliance 
with the Act and these regulations.

         Investigation, Conciliation, and Enforcement Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 4.331  Compliance reviews.

    (a) NRC may conduct compliance reviews and preaward reviews of 
recipients or use other similar procedures that will permit it to 
investigate and correct violations of the Act and these regulations. NRC 
may conduct these reviews even in absence of a complaint against a 
recipient. The review may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine 
whether a violation of these regulations has occurred.
    (b) If a compliance review or preaward review indicates a violation 
of the Act or these regulations, NRC will attempt to achieve voluntary 
compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, NRC 
will arrange for enforcement as described in Sec. 4.336.


<R05>
Sec. 4.332  Complaints.

    (a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class or on behalf 
of others, may file a complaint with NRC, alleging discrimination 
prohibited by the Act or these regulations based on an action occurring 
on or after July 1, 1979. A complainant shall file a complaint within 
180 days from the date the complainant first had knowledge of the 
alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, NRC may 
extend this time limit.
    (b) NRC will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever 
possible, including taking the following measures:
    (1) Accepting a complaint as sufficient for further processing 
that--
    (i) Is made in writing;
    (ii) Alleges a violation of the Act;
    (iii) Identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant 
first had knowledge of the alleged violation;
    (iv) Describes generally the action or practice complained of; and
    (v) Is signed by the complainant.
    (2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the 
complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint.

[[Page 160]]

    (3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient of their rights and 
obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to have a 
representative at all stages of the complaint procedures.
    (4) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their 
representatives) of their right to contact NRC for information and 
assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.
    (c) Each recipient and complainant shall participate actively in 
efforts toward speedy resolution of the complaint.
    (d) NRC will return to the complainant any complaint outside the 
jurisdiction of these regulations, and will state the reason(s) why it 
is outside the jurisdiction of these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 4.333  Mediation.

    (a) Referral of complaints for mediation. NRC will refer to a 
mediation agency designated by the Secretary of the Department of Health 
and Human Services all complaints that--
    (1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and these regulations; 
and
    (2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.
    (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the 
mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make 
an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. There must be at 
least one meeting with the mediator before NRC will accept a judgment 
that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the 
complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.
    (c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the 
mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the 
complainant and recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the 
agreement to NRC. NRC will take no further action on the complaint 
unless the complainant or recipient fails to comply with the agreement.
    (d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all 
information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator 
shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or 
otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the 
mediation process without prior approval of the head of the agency 
appointing the mediator.
    (e) NRC will use the mediation process for a maximum of 60 days 
after receiving a complaint. Mediation ends if--
    (1) From the time NRC receives the complaint 60 days elapse; or
    (2) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, the mediator determines 
an agreement is reached; or
    (3) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, the mediator determines 
that an agreement cannot be reached.
    (f) The mediator shall return unresolved complaints to NRC.


<R05>
Sec. 4.334  Investigation.

    (a) Informal investigation. (1) NRC will investigate complaints that 
are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of 
a mediation agreement.
    (2) As part of the initial investigation, NRC will use informal 
fact-finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the 
complaint and recipient to establish the facts and, if possible, settle 
the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. NRC 
may seek the assistance of any involved State program agency.
    (3) NRC will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the 
parties and an authorized official at NRC.
    (4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other 
enforcement effort of NRC, including compliance reviews and 
investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.
    (5) Settlement of a complaint under this section will not constitute 
a finding of discrimination by the NRC against a recipient or an 
admission of discrimination by the recipient.
    (b) Formal investigation. If NRC cannot resolve the complaint 
through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings 
through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation 
indicates a violation of these regulations, NRC will attempt to obtain 
voluntary compliance. If NRC cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it

[[Page 161]]

will begin enforcement as described in Sec. 4.336.


<R05>
Sec. 4.335  Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

    A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation 
against any person who--
    (a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act or these 
regulations; or
    (b) Cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing, or other 
part of NRC's investigation, conciliation, and enforcement process.


<R05>
Sec. 4.336  Compliance procedure.

    (a) NRC may enforce the Act and these regulations through--
    (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from 
NRC under the program or activity involved where the recipient has 
violated the Act or these regulations. The determination of the 
recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an 
opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law 
judge. Therefore, cases that are settled in mediation, or prior to a 
hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal fiancial 
assistance from NRC.
    (2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to--
    (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce 
any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipients created 
by the Act or these regulations.
    (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or 
local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a 
violation of the Act or these regulations.
    (b) NRC will limit any termination under Sec. 4.336(a)(1) to the 
particular recipient and particular program or activity NRC finds in 
violation of Act or these regulations. NRC will not base any part of a 
termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the 
recipient that does not receive Federal financial assistance from NRC.
    (c) NRC will take no action under paragraph (a) until--
    (1) The Commission, or designee, has advised the recipient of its 
failure to comply with the Act or these regulations and has determined 
that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.
    (2) 30 days have elapsed after the Commission, or designee, has sent 
a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the 
committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the 
Federal program or activity involved. A report will be filed whenever 
any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) NRC also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to 
a recipient when termination proceedings under Sec. 4.336(a)(1) are 
initiated.
    (1) New Federal financial assistance includes all assistance for 
which NRC requires an application or approval, including renewal or 
continuation of existing activities or authorization of new activities, 
during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance does not 
include increases in funding as a result of change computation of 
formula awards or assistance approved prior to the beginning of 
termination proceedings under Sec. 4.336(a)(1).
    (2) NRC will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a 
notice of an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 4.336(a)(1). NRC will 
not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun 
within that time or the time for beginning the hearings has been 
extended by mutual consent of the recipient and NRC. NRC will not 
continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the 
hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 4.337  Hearings, decisions, post-termination proceedings.

    Certain NRC procedural provisions applicable to title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply to NRC enforcement of these regulations. 
They are Secs. 4.61 through 4.64 and Secs. 4.71 through 4.75.


<R05>
Sec. 4.338  Remedial and affirmative action by recipients.

    (a) Where NRC finds a recipient has discriminated on the basis of 
age, the recipient shall take any remedial action that NRC may require 
to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient 
exercises control

[[Page 162]]

over the recipient that has discriminated, NRC may require both 
recipients to take remedial action.
    (b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient 
may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that 
resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity 
on the basis of age.
    (c) If a recipient, operating a program that serves the elderly or 
children in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits 
to the elderly or to children, the provision of those benefits shall be 
presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not 
have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from 
participation in the program.


<R05>
Sec. 4.339  Alternate funds disbursal procedure.

    (a) When NRC withholds funds from a recipient under these 
regulations, the Commission, or designee, may disburse the withheld 
funds directly to an alternate recipient, any public or nonprofit 
private organization or agency, or State or political subdivision of the 
State.
    (b) Any alternative recipient will be required to demonstrate--
    (1) The ability to comply with these regulations; and
    (2) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute 
authorizing the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 4.340  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

    (a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion 
of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are 
exhausted if--
    (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint 
and NRC has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
    (2) NRC issues any finding in favor of the recipient.
    (b) If NRC fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a 
finding in favor of the recipient, NRC will--
    (1) Promptly advise the complainant; and
    (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil 
action under section 305(e) of the Act of injunctive relief that will 
effect the purposes of the Act; and
    (3) Inform the complainant that--
    (i) The complainant may bring a civil action only in a United States 
District Court for the district in which the recipient is found or 
transacts business;
    (ii) A complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be 
awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, 
but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;
    (iii) That before commencing the action, the complainant shall give 
30 days notice by registered mail to the Commission, the Secretary of 
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General of the 
United States, and the recipient;
    (iv) The notice must state the relief requested, the court in which 
the complainant is bringing the action, and whether or not attorney's 
fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and
    (v) The complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged 
violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of pending 
action in any court of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 4.341  Reports.

    The NRC shall submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
not later than December 31 of each year, a report which--
    (a) Describes in detail the steps taken during the preceding fiscal 
year to carry out the Act; and
    (b) Contains data on the frequency, type, and resolution of 
complaints and on any compliance reviews, sufficient to permit analysis 
of the agency's progress in reducing age discrimination in programs 
receiving Federal financial assistance from NRC; and
    (c) Contains data directly relevant to the extent of any pattern or 
practice of age discrimination which NRC has identified in any programs 
receiving Federal financial assistance from NRC and to progress toward 
eliminating it; and
    (d) Contains evaluative or interpretative information which NRC 
determines is useful in analyzing agency

[[Page 163]]

progress in reducing age discrimination in programs receiving Federal 
financial assistance from NRC; and

Secs. 4.541--4.548  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 4.549  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 4.550, no qualified handicapped 
person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or 
unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded 
from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under 
any program or activity conducted by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 4.550  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 4.550(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not 
required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other 
methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The 
agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 4.550(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods

[[Page 167]]

that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a 
physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of 
Sec. 4.550(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program 
accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 4.551  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.
Secs. 4.552--4.559  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 4.560  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can

[[Page 168]]

demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a 
program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In 
those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed 
action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result 
in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden 
of proving that compliance with Sec. 4.560 would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

Disadvantaged Business Utilization/Civil Rights, shall be responsible 
for coordinating implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent 
to Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--

on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

Sec. 7.1  Policy.

    The regulations in this part define the policies and procedures to 
be followed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the establishment, 
utilization, and termination of advisory committees. In general, it is 
the policy of the Commission that--
    (a) Except where there is express legal authority to the contrary, 
the function of NRC advisory committees shall be advisory only.
    (b) Each NRC advisory committee shall function in compliance with 
the Federal Advisory Commitee Act and this part.
    (c) The number of NRC advisory committees shall be kept to the 
minimum necessary, and the number of members of each NRC advisory 
committee shall be limited to the fewest necessary to accomplish 
committee objectives.
    (d) An NRC advisory committee shall be established only when 
establishment of the committee is required by law or when the Commission 
determines that the committee is essential to the conduct of NRC 
business. In making such a

[[Page 170]]

determination, the Commission shall consider whether committee 
deliberations will result in a significant contribution to the creation, 
amendment, or elimination of regulations, guidelines, or rules affecting 
NRC business; whether the information to be obtained is available 
through another source within the Federal Government; whether the 
committee will make recommendations resulting in significant 
improvements in service or reductions in cost; or whether the 
committee's recommendations will provide an important additional 
perspective or viewpoint relating to NRC's mission.
    (e) Except where otherwise required by law, an NRC advisory 
committee shall be terminated whenever the stated objectives of the 
committee have been accomplished, the subject matter or work of the 
committee has become obsolete, the committee's main functions have been 
assumed by another entity within the Federal Government, or the cost of 
operating the committee has become excessive in relation to the benefits 
accruing to the Federal Government from its activities.
    (f) NRC advisory committees shall be balanced in their membership in 
terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be 
performed.
    (g) The Congress shall be kept informed of the number, purpose, 
membership, activities, and cost of NRC advisory committees.
    (h) NRC advisory committee meetings shall be open to the public, 
except where closure is determined to be justified under Sec. 7.15.

Sec. 7.4  Establishment of advisory committees.

    (a) An NRC advisory committee may be established under this part 
only if its establishment--
    (1) Is specifically directed or authorized by statute or by

    (2) Has been determined by the Commission to be in the public

[[Page 172]]

Commission. The letter shall contain the following information:
    (1) An explanation of why the committee is essential to the conduct

part, except that it shall not be subject to the requirements of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Such a subcommittee shall not,

established, the Commission shall so advise the GSA Secretariat in 
writing, stating whether NRC intends to take any further action with 
respect to the proposed advisory committee.
    (e) The date of filing of an advisory committee charter pursuant to

for an NRC advisory committee whose establishment is required or 
authorized by statute or by Executive Order of the President shall be 
coordinated with the General Counsel to ensure that they

[[Page 173]]

are consistent with the applicable statute or Executive Order. When the 
statute or Executive Order that directed or authorized the establishment 
of an advisory committee is amended to change the language that has been 
the basis for establishing the advisory committee, those sections of the 
current charter affected by the statute or Executive Order shall also be 
amended, and the amended charter shall be filed as specified in 
Sec. 7.8.
    (c)(1) The charter of an NRC advisory committee established under 
general agency authority may be amended when the Commission determines 
that the existing charter no longer reflects the objectives or functions 
of the committee. Such changes may be minor (such as revising the name 
of the advisory committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency 
of meetings), or they may be major (such as revising the objectives or 
composition of the committee). The procedures specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section shall be used in the case of charter amendments 
involving minor changes.
    (2) In the case of a major amendment to the charter of an advisory 
committee established under general agency authority, a letter 
requesting review of the proposed amendment and transmitting the 
proposed amended charter shall be submitted to the GSA Secretariat. The 
letter shall explain the purpose of the changes and why they are 
necessary.
    (3) A committee charter that has been amended pursuant to this 
paragraph is subject to the filing requirements set forth in Sec. 7.8.
    (4) Amendment of an existing advisory committee charter pursuant to 
this paragraph does not constitute renewal of the committee for purposes 
of Sec. 7.7.

this section; or
    (3) Its duration has been otherwise designated by law.
    The NRC Committee Management Officer shall notify the GSA 
Secretariat in writing of the effective date of termination of any 
advisory committee that has been terminated by the NRC.
    (b)(1) An NRC advisory committee that is established by statute 
shall require rechartering by the filing of a new charter every 2 years 
after the date of enactment of the statute establishing the committee. 
If a new charter is not filed, the committee is not terminated, but it 
may not meet or take any actions.
    (2) Any other NRC advisory committee may be renewed, provided that 
such renewal is carried out in compliance with the procedures set forth 
in Sec. 7.5 at least 30 and not more than 60 days before the committee 
would otherwise terminate; except that an advisory committee established 
by the President may be renewed by appropriate action of the President 
and the filing of a new charter. Renewal of an NRC advisory committee

qualifications required of the committee member; provided that the 
Chairman may not set the rate of pay for an NRC advisory committee 
member higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for a GG-15 
under NRC's General Salary Schedule, unless a higher rate is mandated by 
statute or the Commission itself has determined that a higher rate is 
justified and necessary. The Commission may not delegate the 
responsibility for making a determination that such a higher rate of pay 
is necessary and justified for an NRC advisory committee member, and 
such a determination must be reviewed annually.
    (3) An advisory committee member may not be paid at a rate higher 
than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for a GG-18 under NRC's 
General Salary Schedule.
    (c)(1) Each NRC advisory committee staff member may be paid at a 
rate that is the daily equivalent of a rate of NRC's General Salary 
Schedule in which the staff member's position would appropriately be 
placed.
    (2) A staff member of an NRC advisory committee may not be paid at a 
rate higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for a GG-15 
under NRC's General Salary Schedule, unless the Chairman of the 
Commission determines that the staff member's position would 
appropriately be placed at a grade higher than GG-15; provided that in 
establishing rates of compensation, the Chairman shall comply with any 
applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative 
guidelines.
    (3) A determination to set the rate of pay of a staff position at a 
grade higher than GG-15 under the NRC's General Salary Schedule rate of 
pay shall be reviewed annually by the Chairman of the Commission.
    (4) A Federal employee may serve as a staff member of an NRC 
advisory committee only with the knowledge of the Designated Federal 
Officer for the committee and the approval of the employee's direct 
supervisor. A staff member who is not otherwise a Federal employee shall 
be appointed in accordance with applicable agency procedures, following 
consultation with the advisory committee.
    (d) The following factors shall be considered in determining an 
appropriate rate of pay for a consultant to an NRC advisory committee:
    (1) The qualifications required of the consultant, and
    (2) The significance, scope, and technical complexity of the work 
for which his services are required;

Provided that the rate of pay for an NRC advisory committee consultant 
may not be higher than the maximum rate of pay applicable to NRC 
consultants. In establishing such a rate of pay, NRC shall comply with 
any applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and 
administrative guidelines.
    (e) A member or staff member of an NRC advisory committee engaged in 
the performance of duties away from his or her home or regular place of 
business may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of 
subsistence, as authorized by section 5703, title 5, United States Code, 
for persons employed intermittently in the Government service.
    (f) Nothing in this section shall--
    (1) Prevent any full-time Federal employee who provides services to 
an NRC advisory committee from receiving compensation at a rate at which 
he or she would otherwise be compensated as a full-time Federal 
employee.
    (2) Prevent any individual who provides services to an NRC advisory 
committee, and who immediately before providing such services was a 
full-time Federal employee, from receiving compensation at a rate at 
which he or she was compensated as a full-time Federal employee.
    (3) Affect a rate of pay or a limitation on a rate of pay that is 
specifically established by law or a rate of pay established under the 
NRC's General Salary Schedule and evaluation system (see NRC Manual).

<R05>
Sec. 8.1   Interpretation of section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; opinion of the General Counsel.

    (a) Inquiries have been received as to the applicability of the 
provisions of section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 
944) to inventions or discoveries made or conceived in the course of 
activities under licenses issued by the Atomic Energy Commission.
    (b) In my [General Counsel, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission] opinion a 
license issued by the Atomic Energy Commission is not a ``contract, 
subcontract, arrangement or other relationship with the Commission'' as 
those terms are used in section 152 of the act. Hence, the mere fact 
that an invention or discovery is made by a licensee in the course of 
activities authorized by a license would not give the Commission rights 
under section 152 with respect to such invention or discovery. On the 
other hand, if a licensee has entered into a ``contract,

[[Page 180]]

subcontract, arrangement or other relationship with the Commission,'' 
inventions or discoveries made or conceived by the licensee under the 
contract or other relationship would come within the purview of section 
152.
    (c) As used in this section, ``license'' means a license issued 
pursuant to Chapter 6 (Special Nuclear Material), 7 (Source Material), 8 
(Byproduct Material) or 10 (Atomic Energy Licenses) of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, or a construction permit issued pursuant to section 185 of 
the act.

[21 FR 1414, Mar. 3, 1956]


<R05>
Sec. 8.2   Interpretation of Price-Anderson Act, section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.

    (a) It is my opinion that an indemnity agreement entered into by the 
Atomic Energy Commission under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011, et seq.), hereafter cited as ``the Act,'' as 
amended by Pub. L. 85-256 (the ``Price-Anderson Act'') 42 U.S.C. 2210 
indemnifies persons indemnified against public liability for bodily 
injury, sickness, disease or death, or loss of or damage to property, or 
for loss of use of property caused outside the United States by a 
nuclear incident occurring within the United States.
    (b) Section 170 authorizes the Commission to indemnify against 
``public liability'' as defined in section 11(u) of the Act.<SUP>1 
Coverage under the Act therefore is predicated upon ``public 
liability,'' and requires (1) ``legal liability'' for (2) a ``nuclear 
incident.'' Determination of the Act's coverage, therefore, necessitates 
a finding that these two elements are present.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1Sec. 11u. ``The term `public liability' means any legal 
liability arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident, except 
claims under State or Federal Workmen's Compensation Acts of employees 
of persons indemnified who are employed at the site of and in connection 
with the activity where the nuclear incident occurs, and except for 
claims arising out of an act of war. `Public Liability' also includes 
damage to property of persons indemnified: Provided, That such property 
is covered under the terms of the financial protection required, except 
property which is located at the site of and used in connection with the 
activity where the nuclear incident occurs.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) In the case of damage outside of the United States caused by a 
nuclear facility based in the United States there would be a ``nuclear 
incident'' as defined in section 11(o) since there would be an 
``occurrence within the United States causing * * * damage.''<SUP>2 The 
``occurrence'' would be ``within the United States'' since 
``occurrence'' is intended by the Act to be ``that event at the site of 
the licensed activity * * * which may cause damage rather than the site 
where the damage may perhaps be caused.'' (S. Rep. 296, 85th Cong., 1st 
Sess., p. 16 1957) (hereafter cited as Report). In section 11(o) an 
``occurrence'' is that which causes damage. It would be, therefore, an 
event taking place at the site. This definition of ``occurrence'' is 
referred to in the Report at page 22 and is crucial to the Act's placing 
of venue under section 170(e).<SUP>3 027 In its definition of ``nuclear 
incident.'' The Act makes no limitation upon the place where the damage 
is received but states only that the ``occurrence'' must be within the 
United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>2Sec. 11o. ``The term `nuclear incident' means any occurrence 
within the United States causing bodily injury, sickness, disease, or 
death, or loss of or damage to property, or for loss of use of property, 
arising out of or resulting from the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or 
other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct 
material: * * *''
    <SUP>3 ``In order to provide a framework for establishing the 
limitation of liability, the Commission or any person indemnified is 
permitted to apply to the appropriate district court of the United 
States which has venue in bankruptcy matters over the site of the 
nuclear incident. Again it should be pointed out that the site is where 
the occurrence takes place which gives rise to the liability, not the 
place where the damage may be caused * * * '' Report. p. 22.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Similarly, the requirement of ``legal liability'' would be met. 
The words of the Act impose no limitation that the liability be one for 
damage caused in the United States but, on the contrary, are exceedingly 
broad permitting indemnification for ``any legal liability.'' In the 
most exhaustive study of the subject, it is stated that the phrase ``any 
legal liability'' indicates that liability for damage outside the United 
States is covered by the

[[Page 181]]

Act. Atomic Industrial Forum, Financial Protection Against Atomic 
Hazards 61 n. 355 (1957).
    (e) Thus the precise language of the Act provides coverage for 
damage ensuing both within and without the United States arising out of 
an occurrence within the United States. There would be no occasion for 
doubt were it not for a single statement contained in the Report of the 
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on the Price-Anderson Act. The Report 
states, at p. 16 that ``[i]f there is anything from a nuclear incident 
at the licensed activity which causes injury abroad, or if there is any 
activity abroad which causes further injury in the United States the 
situation will require further investigation at that time.'' This 
sentence follows an explicit and lengthy statement that the 
``occurrence'' is an event at the site of the activity:

    * * * The occurrence which is the subject of this definition is that 
event at the site of the licensed activity, or activity for which the 
Commission has entered into a contract, which may cause damage, rather 
than the site where the damage may perhaps be caused. This site must be 
within the United States. The suggested exclusion of facilities under 
license for export was not accepted. This is because the definition of 
``nuclear incident'' limits the occurrence causing damage to one within 
the United States. It does not matter what license may be applicable if 
the occurrence is within the United States. If there is anything from a 
nuclear incident at the licensed activity which causes injury abroad or 
if there is any activity abroad which causes further injury in the 
United States the situation will require further investigation by the 
Congress at that time * * *

Read literally, the last sentence would seem inconsistent with the 
preceding statement. It is, however, possible to read the sentence as 
consistent with the preceding statement if it is taken as indicating a 
recognition by Congress of the fact that the statutory limitation of 
liability to $500,000,000 would probably not limit claims by foreign 
residents to that amount in foreign courts and that therefore the 
persons indemnified were not fully protected against bankrupting claims, 
one of the primary purposes of the bill.<SUP>4

Hazards, The International Aspects, p. 52 (1959).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) The point in question received scant consideration during the 
hearings preceding adoption of the bill held by the Joint Committee on 
Atomic Energy. A summary of the study of the Atomic Industrial Forum, 
cited above, was introduced into the record of the hearing and included 
a conclusion that the provisions of the bill seemed to cover the 
situation.<SUP>5 That conclusion would seem entitled to more than 
ordinary weight since the Forum study received the careful consideration 
of the Joint Committee.<SUP>6 and the study referenced a statement from 
the 1956 Report very similar to the confusing statement in the 1957 
Report noted above.<SUP>7

    <SUP>6Hearings, p. 168.
    <SUP>7Hearings, p. 182.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) There was also a rather ambiguous colloquy in the hearings 
between Representative Cole and Mr. Charles Haugh in which 
Representative Cole indicated that the Joint Committee

 ``* * * will do pretty well if we successfully protect the American 
people and property owners in this country without worrying about those 
that live abroad.''<SUP>8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8Hearings, p. 97. It is significant to note that Mr. Haugh stated at 
that point the problem of the reactor operator who is concerned with any 
type of liability. He noted that the insurance contracts would cover ``* 
* * the instance where * * * something happen[ed] out of the country and 
a suit is brought in the United States on that.''

    (h) Congress, in enacting the Price-Anderson Indemnity Act added to 
section 2 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, a new subsection which 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
stated, inter alia:

    In order * * * to encourage the development of the atomic energy 
industry, * * * the United States may make funds available for a portion 
of the damages suffered by the public from nuclear incidents and may 
limit the liability of those persons liable for such losses.


[[Page 182]]


This statutory purpose is frustrated if the atomic energy industry is 
not protected from bankrupting liabilities for damages caused abroad by 
an accident occurring in the United States.<SUP>9 In the Report, the 
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy made explicit mention of the fact that 
the private insurance to be provided for reactor operators included 
coverage for damage in Canada and Mexico and, at another point, noted 
the Committee's hope that the insurance contract in its final form would 
cover the same scope as the bill.<SUP>10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9The Atomic Industrial Forum study notes that ``[T]o be adequate, 
the governmental indemnity must cover industry's liability to residents 
of the countries who suffer as a result of an accident at an 
installation based in the United States.'' p. 61. This is certainly the 
case and one of the major Congressional purposes is frustrated should 
the Act be said to be unclear on this point. The principal reason for 
the conclusion that there is coverage reached in the Forum study is the 
fact that Price-Anderson provides indemnity for ``any legal liability.'' 
Arthur Murphy, Director of the study, in a recent article, has stated 
that the confusing sentence in the Report is ``* * * inconsistent with 
the flat coverage of any legal liability by the indemnity.'' Murphy, 
Liability for Atomic Accidents and Insurance, in Law and Administration 
in Nuclear Energy 75 (1959). In the testimony before the Joint Committee 
last year, Professor Samuel D. Estep, one of three authors of the 
comprehensive study of Atoms and the Law apparently relying upon the 
legislative history, stated that the problem of a reactor accident in 
the United States causing damage in a foreign country was unclear, 
presumably since he considered the phrase ``any legal liability'' 
directed at a different problem. Hearings before the Joint Committee on 
Atomic Energy, Indemnity and Reactor Safety, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 
77 (1959); Stason Estep, and Pierce, Atoms and the Law, 577 (1959). 
Professor Estep stated that there ``surely ought to be'' coverage and 
suggested a clarifying amendment. His statement that the phrase ``any 
legal liability'' covers only the question of time restrictions for 
claims seems to me erroneous since the language used, ``any legal 
liability,'' seems intentionally broad. Additionally, should this very 
narrow reading be given to admittedly broad statutory language, the 
Congressional purpose would be frustrated.
    <SUP>10Report, p. 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) It is my opinion that since the language of the Act draws no 
distinction between damage received in the United States and that 
received abroad, none can properly be drawn. To read the Act as imposing 
such a limitation in the absence of statutory direction and in the light 
of an avowed Congressional intention to encourage the development of the 
atomic energy industry would be unwarranted. The confusing sentence 
cited in the Report must, therefore, be read consistently with the 
language of the Act in the manner suggested above, i.e., as recognizing 
Congressional inability to limit foreign liability, or must be ignored 
as inconsistent with the broad coverage of the statutory language.

<R05>
Sec. 8.4   Interpretation by the General Counsel: AEC jurisdiction over nuclear facilities and materials under the Atomic Energy Act.

    (a) By virtue of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,<SUP>11 
the individual States may not, in the absence of an agreement with the 
Atomic Energy Commission, regulate the materials described in the Act 
from the standpoint of radiological health and safety. Even States which 
have entered into agreements with the AEC lack authority to regulate the 
facilities described in the Act, including nuclear power plants and the 
discharge of effluents from such facilities, from the standpoint of 
radiological health and safety.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>11Pub. L. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 sets out a pattern for licensing 
and regulation of certain nuclear materials and facilities on the basis 
of the common defense and security and radiological health and safety. 
The regulatory pattern requires, in general, that the construction and 
operation of production facilities (nuclear reactors used for production 
and separation of plutonium or uranium-233 or fuel reprocessing plants) 
and utilization facilities (nuclear reactors used for production of 
power, medical therapy, research, and testing) and the possession and 
use of byproduct material (radioisotopes), source material (thorium and 
uranium ores), and special nuclear material (enriched uranium and 
plutonium, used as fuel in nuclear

[[Page 183]]

reactors), be licensed and regulated by the Commission.<SUP>12 In 
carrying out its statutory responsibilities for the protection of the 
public health and safety from radiation hazards and for the promotion of 
the common defense and security, the AEC has promulgated regulations 
which establish requirements for the issuance of licenses (Parts 30-36, 
40, 50, 70, 71, and 100 of this chapter) and specify standards for 
radiation protection (Part 20 of this chapter).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>12The terms ``byproduct material,'' ``source material,'' and 
``special nuclear material'' are defined in the Atomic Energy Act, 
sections 11e, 11z, and 11aa, respectively. The terms ``production 
facility'' and ``utilization facility'' are defined in sections 11v and 
11cc of the Act, respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 had the effect of preempting to 
the Federal Government the field of regulation of nuclear facilities and 
byproduct, source, and special nuclear material. Whatever doubts may 
have existed as to that preemption were settled by the passage of the 
Federal-State amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 in 1959.<SUP>13
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    13Pub. L. 86-373, 73 Stat. 688.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Prior to 1954, all nuclear facilities and the special nuclear 
material produced by or used in them were owned by the AEC.<SUP>14 This 
Federal monopoly of atomic energy activities was due in large part to 
the use of atomic energy materials and facilities in our national 
weapons program, and the large capital investment required for their 
development. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 permitted private ownership 
of nuclear facilities for the first time, but only under a 
comprehensive, pervasive system of Federal regulation and licensing. 
That Act recognized no State responsibility or authority over such 
facilities and materials except the States' traditional regulatory 
authority over generation, sale, and transmission of electric power 
produced through the use of nuclear facilities.<SUP>15 As interest grew 
in the private construction of facilities and the use of atomic energy 
materials, and the numbers of persons qualified in the field increased, 
questions arose as to the role State authorities should play with regard 
to the public health and safety aspects of such activities. Several 
bills were introduced with respect to Federal-State cooperation in 1956 
and 1957.<SUP>16 An AEC proposed bill which would have authorized 
concurrent radiation safety standards to be enforced by the States was 
forwarded to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1957, but was never 
reported out. Finally, in 1959, legislation was enacted whose purpose 
was to promote an orderly regulatory pattern between the Federal and 
State governments with respect to regulation of byproduct, source, and 
special nuclear material, while avoiding dual regulation (see section 
274a). That legislation added section 274, the so-called Federal-State 
amendment, to the Atomic Energy Act.

    (e) Section 274 (42 U.S.C. 2021) authorizes the Commission to enter 
into an agreement with the Governor of any State providing for the 
discontinuance of regulatory authority of the Commission with respect to 
byproduct materials, source materials, and special nuclear materials in 
quantities not sufficient to form a ``critical mass.'' However, section 
274c (42 U.S.C. 2021(c)) provides that the Commission shall retain 
authority and responsibility with respect to the regulation of:
    (1) The construction and operation of production or utilization 
facilities (note: this includes construction and operation of nuclear 
powerplants);
    (2) The export and import of by-product, source or special nuclear 
material or production or utilization facilities;
    (3) The disposal into the ocean of waste byproduct, source or 
special nuclear materials; and
    (4) The disposal of such other byproduct, source or special nuclear 
material as the Commission determines should, because of the hazards or 
potential hazards thereof, not be so disposed of without a Commission 
license.
    (f) The amendment, in providing for the discontinuance of some of 
the AEC's regulatory authority over source, by-product and special 
nuclear material in States which entered into agreements with the AEC, 
made clear

[[Page 184]]

that there should be no ``dual regulation'' with respect to those 
materials for the purpose of protection of the public health and safety 
from radiation hazards.
    (g) Section 274b of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2021(b)) states 
that:

    During the duration of such an agreement it is recognized that the 
State shall have authority to regulate the materials covered by the 
agreement for the protection of the public health and safety from 
radiation hazards.

Section 274k (42 U.S.C. 2021(k)) states:

    Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority 
of any State or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other 
than protection against radiation hazards.

    (h) In its comments on the bill that was enacted as section 274, the 
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy commented that:

    It is not intended to leave any room for the exercise of dual or 
concurrent jurisdiction by States to control radiation hazards by 
regulating byproduct, source, or special nuclear materials. The intent 
is to have the material regulated and licensed either by the Commission, 
or by the State and local governments, but not by both.<SUP>17
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    171959 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, v. 2, p. 
2879.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In explaining section 274k, the Joint Committee said:

    As indicated elsewhere, the Commission has exclusive authority to 
regulate for protection against radiation hazards until such time as the 
State enters into an agreement with the Commission to assume such 
responsibility.<SUP>18
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    18Id. at pp. 2882-3.

    (i) It seems completely clear that the Congress, in enacting section 
274, intended to preempt to the Federal Government the total 
responsibility and authority for regulating, from the standpoint of 
radiological health and safety, the specified nuclear facilities and 
materials; that it stated that intent unequivocally; and that the 
enactment of section 274 effectively carried out the Congressional 
intent, subject to the arrangement for limited relinquishment of AEC's 
regulatory authority and assumption thereof by states in areas 
permitted, and subject to conditions imposed, by section 274.<SUP>19
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    19As noted above, regulation of construction and operation of 
production or utilization facilities was one of the areas reserved to 
the AEC. It is clear from the legislative history of section 274 that 
control of ``operation'' of such facilities includes the regulation of 
the radiological effects of the discharge of affluents from the 
facilities. (Hearings before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on 
Federal-State Relationships in the Atomic Energy Field, 86th Cong., 
first session, 1959, p. 306.) AEC regulations implementing section 274 
recognize that intent by defining facility operation to include the 
discharge of radioactive effluents from the facility site (10 CFR 
150.15).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (j) Thus, under the pattern of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended by 
section 274, States which have not entered into a section 274 agreement 
with the AEC are without authority to license or regulate, from the 
standpoint of radiological health and safety, byproduct, source, and 
special nuclear material or production and utilization facilities. Even 
those States which have entered into a section 274 agreement with the 
AEC (Agreement States) lack authority to license or regulate, from the 
standpoint of radiological health and safety, the construction and 
operation of production and utilization facilities (including nuclear 
power plants) and other activities reserved to the AEC by section 274c. 
(To the extent that Agreement States have authority to regulate 
byproduct, source, and special nuclear material, their section 274

Sec. 8.5  Interpretation by the General Counsel of Sec. 73.55 of this chapter; illumination and physical search requirements.

    (a) A request has been received to interpret 10 CFR 73.55(c)(5) and 
73.55(d)(1).

10 CFR 73.55(c)(5) provides:

    Isolation zones and all exterior areas within the protected area 
shall be provided with illumination sufficient for the monitoring and 
observation requirements of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (h)(4) of 
this section, but not less than 02. footcandle measured horizontally at 
ground level.

    (b) The requester contends that the regulation is satisfied if 0.2 
footcandle is provided only at the protected area boundary and the 
isolation zone. The language of the regulation is clearly to the 
contrary. It requires not less than 0.2 footcandle for ``all exterior 
areas within the protected area.'' This regulation helps effectuate the 
monitoring and observation requirements of 10 CFR 73.55. For example, 10 
CFR 73.55(c)(4) states that ``All exterior areas within the protected 
area shall be periodically checked to detect the presence of 
unauthorized persons, vehicles, or materials.'' In the absence of 
illumination, such checking could not be fully effective.
    (c) The requester also asks whether the illumination requirement 
extends to the tops and sides of buildings within the protected area. To 
effectuate the monitoring and observation requirements cited above, 
illumination must be maintained for the tops and sides of all accessible 
structures within the protected area. This interpretation is consistent 
with that given by the Commission's staff to affected licensees and 
applicants at a series of regional meetings held in March of 1977 and 
will be reflected in forthcoming revisions to NUREG 0220, Draft Interim 
Acceptance Criteria for a Physical Security Plan for Nuclear Power 
Plants (March 1977).
    (d) 10 CFR 73.55(d)(1) provides in pertinent part: The search 
function for detection of firearms, explosives, and incendiary devices 
shall be conducted either by a physical search or by use of equipment 
capable of detecting such devices.
    (e) The requester contends that until ``equipment capable of 
detecting such devices'' is in place, a licensee need not comply with 
the search requirement, but can utilize instead previous security 
programs. This contention is based on the first sentence of 10 CFR 73.55 
which provides in pertinent part that the requirements of paragraph (d) 
of that section shall be met by May 25, 1977, ``except for any 
requirement involving construction and installation of equipment not 
already in place expressed in (paragraph)(d)(1) * * * '' Under this 
sentence only those requirements of paragraph (d) which involve 
``construction and installation of equipment'' do not take effect on May 
25, 1977. Because a ``physical search'' does not require ``constuction 
and installation of equipment'', implementation of such searches is 
required on May 25, 1977. The regulation provides alternative: ``the 
search function * * * shall be conducted either by a physical search or 
by use of equipment * * *.'' Thus when appropriate equipment is in 
place, the search function need not involve a physical search.
    (f) The paragraphs above set forth interpretation of regulations; 
they do not apply those regulations to particular factual settings. For 
example, no effort is made to state what lighting system might be used 
for a given facility; all that is stated is that a system must provide 
not less than 0.2 footcandle for all exterior areas within the protected 
area. Similarly, no effort is made to define what is an adequate 
``physical search''; all that is stated is that, in the absence of 
appropriate equipment, such searches must begin on May 25, 1977.

<R05>
Sec. 9.11  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes procedures for making NRC agency records 
available to the public for inspection and copying pursuant to the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and provides 
notice of procedures for obtaining NRC records otherwise publicly 
available. This subpart does not affect the dissemination or 
distribution of NRC-originated, or NRC contractor-originated, 
information to the public under any other NRC public, technical, or 
other information program or policy.


<R05>
Sec. 9.13  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Agency record is a record in the possession and control of the NRC 
that is associated with Government business. Agency record does not 
include records such as--
    (1) Publicly available books, periodicals, or other publications 
that are

[[Page 188]]

owned or copyrighted by non-Federal sources;
    (2) Records solely in the possession and control of NRC contractors;
    (3) Personal records in possession of NRC personnel that have not 
been circulated, were not required to be created or retained by the NRC, 
and can be retained or discarded at the author's sole discretion, or 
records of a personal nature that are not associated with any Government 
business; or
    (4) Non-substantive information in logs or schedule books of the 
Chairman or Commissioners, uncirculated except for typing or recording 
purposes.
    Commercial-use request means a request made under Sec. 9.23(b) for a 
use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests 
of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.
    Direct costs mean the expenditures that an agency incurs in 
searching for and duplicating agency records. For a commercial-use 
request, direct costs include the expenditures involved in reviewing 
records to respond to the request. Direct costs include the salary of 
the employee category performing the work based on that basic rate of 
pay plus 16 percent of that rate to cover fringe benefits and the cost 
of operating duplicating machinery.
    Duplication means the process of making a copy of a record necessary 
to respond to a request made under Sec. 9.23. Copies may take the form 
of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, disk, magnetic tape, 
or machine readable documentation, among others.
    Educational institution means an institution which operates a 
program or programs of scholarly research. Educational institution 
refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary 
school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of 
undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional 
education, or an institution of vocational education.
    Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that is 
not operated on a commercial basis, as the term ``commercial'' is 
referred to in the definition of ``commercial-use request,'' and is 
operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the 
results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or 
industry.
    Office, unless otherwise indicated, means all offices, boards, 
panels, and advisory committees of the NRC.
    Record means any book, paper, map, photograph, brochure, punch card, 
magnetic tape, paper tape, sound recording, pamphlet, slide, motion 
picture, or other documentary material regardless of form or 
characteristics. Record does not include an object or article such as a 
structure, furniture, a tangible exhibit or model, a vehicle, or piece 
of equipment.
    Representative of the news media means any person actively gathering 
news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or 
broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of 
``news'') who make their products available for purchase or 
subscriptions by the general public.
    Review means the process of examining records identified as 
responsive to a commercial-use request to determine whether they are 
exempted from disclosure in whole or in part. Also, review includes 
examining records to determine which Freedom of Information Act 
exemptions are applicable, identifying records or portions thereof to be 
disclosed, and excising from the records those portions which are to be 
withheld.
    Search means all time spent looking for records, either by manual 
search or search using existing computer programs, that respond to a 
request including a page-by-page or line-by-line identification of 
responsive information within the records.
    Unusual circumstances mean--
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;

[[Page 189]]

    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
NRC having substantial subject-matter interest therein.


<R05>
Sec. 9.15  Availability of records.

    The NRC will make available for public inspection and copying any 
reasonably described agency record in the possession and control of the 
NRC under the provisions of this subpart, and upon request by any 
person. Records that the NRC routinely makes publicly available are 
described in Sec. 9.21. Procedures and conditions governing requests for 
records are set forth in Sec. 9.23.


<R05>
Sec. 9.17  Agency records exempt from public disclosure.

    (a) The following types of agency records are exempt from public 
disclosure under Sec. 9.15:
    (1) Records (i) which are specifically authorized under criteria 
established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of 
national defense or foreign policy, and (ii) which are in fact properly 
classified pursuant to such Executive order;
    (2) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and 
practices of the agency;
    (3) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other 
than 5 U.S.C. 552b), provided that such statute--
    (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or
    (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Interagency or intraagency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the agency;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information--
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority, or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential 
source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual;
    (8) Matters contained in or related to examination, operating, or 
condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of any 
agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial 
institutions; or
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart authorizes withholding of information or 
limiting the availability of records to the public except as 
specifically provided

[[Page 190]]

in this part, nor is this subpart authority to withhold information from 
Congress.
    (c) Whenever a request is made which involves access to agency 
records described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the NRC may, 
during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records 
as not subject to the requirements of this subpart when--
    (1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of 
criminal law; and
    (2) There is reason to believe that--
    (i) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of 
its pendency; and
    (ii) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 9.19  Segregation of exempt information and deletion of identifying details.

    (a) For records required to be made available under 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(2), the NRC shall delete the name with any identifying details, 
if the release of the name or other identifying details of, or relating 
to, a private party will constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy. The NRC shall provide notification that names of 
parties and certain other identifying details have been removed in order 
to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the 
individuals involved.
    (b) In responding to a request for information submitted under 
Sec. 9.23, in which it has been determined to withhold exempt 
information, the NRC shall segregate--
    (1) Information that is exempt from public disclosure under 
Sec. 9.17(a) from nonexempt information; and
    (2) Factual information from advice, opinions, and recommendations 
in predecisional records unless the information is inextricably 
intertwined, or is contained in drafts, legal work products, and records 
covered by the lawyer-client privilege, or is otherwise exempt from 
disclosure.


<R05>

Sec. 9.23  Requests for records.

    (a)(1) A person may request access to records routinely made 
available by the NRC under Sec. 9.21 in person or in writing at the NRC 
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
    (i) Each record requested must be described in sufficient detail to 
enable the Public Document Room to locate the record. If the description 
of the record is not sufficient to allow the Public Document Room staff 
to identify the record, the Public Document Room shall advise the 
requester to select the record from the indexes published under 
Sec. 9.21(c)(6).
    (ii) In order to obtain copies of records expeditiously, a person 
may open an account at the Public Document Room with the private 
contracting firm that is responsible for duplicating NRC records.
    (2) A person may also order records routinely made available by the 
NRC under Sec. 9.21 from the National Technical Information Service, 
5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161.
    (b) A person may request agency records by submitting a request 
authorized by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) to the Director, Division of Freedom of 
Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. The request must be 
in writing and clearly state on the envelope and in the letter that it 
is a ``Freedom of Information Act request.'' The NRC does not consider a 
request as received until it has been received and logged in by the 
Director, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, 
Office of Administration.
    (1) A Freedom of Information request covers only agency records that 
are in existence on the date the Director, Division of Freedom of 
Information and Publications Services, receives the request. A request 
does not cover agency records destroyed or discarded before receipt of a 
request or which are created after the date of the request.
    (2) All Freedom of Information Act requests for copies of agency 
records must reasonably describe the agency records sought in sufficient 
detail to permit the NRC to identify the requested agency records. Where 
possible, the requester should provide specific information regarding 
dates, titles, docket numbers, file designations, and other information 
which may help identify the agency records. If a requested agency record 
is not described in sufficient detail to permit its identification, the 
Director, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, 
shall inform the requester of the deficiency within 10 working days 
after receipt of the request and ask the requester to submit additional 
information regarding the request or meet with appropriate NRC personnel 
in order to clarify the request.
    (3) Upon receipt of a request made under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the NRC shall provide written notification to the requester 
that indicates the request has been received, the name of the individual 
and telephone number to contact to find out the status of the request, 
and other pertinent matters regarding the processing of the request.
    (4) (i) The NRC shall advise a requester that fees will be assessed 
if--
    (A) A request involves anticipated costs in excess of the minimum 
specified in Sec. 9.39; and
    (B) Search and duplication is not provided without charge under 
Sec. 9.39; or
    (C) The requester does not specifically state that the cost involved 
is acceptable or acceptable up to a specified limit.
    (ii) The NRC has discretion to discontinue processing for records 
responsive to a request made under this paragraph (b) until--
    (A) A required advance payment has been received;
    (B) The requester has agreed to bear the estimated costs;
    (C) A determination has been made on a request for waiver or 
reduction of fees; or

for inspection and copying at the other location.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 9.39--
    (1) If the record requested under paragraph (b) of this section is a

Sec. 9.25  Initial disclosure determination.

    (a) The head of the responsible office shall review agency records 
located in a search under Sec. 9.23(b) to determine whether the agency 
records are exempt from disclosure under Sec. 9.17(a). If the head of 
the office determines that, although exempt, the disclosure of the 
agency records will not be contrary to the public interest and will not 
affect the rights of any person, the head of the office may authorize 
disclosure of the agency records. If the head of the office authorizes 
disclosure of the agency records, the head of the office shall furnish 
the agency records to the Director, Division of Freedom of Information 
and Publications Services, who shall notify the requester of the 
determination in the manner provided in Sec. 9.27.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if, as a 
result of the review specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
head of the responsible office finds that agency records should be 
denied in whole or in part, the head of the office will submit that 
finding to the Director, Division of Freedom of Information and 
Publications Services, who will, in consultation with the Office of the 
General Counsel, make an independent determination whether the agency 
records should be denied in whole or in part. If the Director, Division 
of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, determines that the 
agency records sought are exempt from disclosure and disclosure of the 
records is contrary to the public interest and will adversely affect the 
rights of any person, the Director, Division of Freedom of Information 
and Publications Services, shall notify the requester of the 
determination in the manner provided in Sec. 9.27.
    (c) For agency records located in the office of a Commissioner or in 
the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, the Assistant Secretary 
of the Commission shall make the initial determination to deny agency 
records in whole or in part under Sec. 9.17(a) instead of the Director, 
Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services. For agency 
records located in the Office of the General Counsel, the General 
Counsel shall make the initial determination to deny agency records in 
whole or in part instead of the Director, Division of Freedom of 
Information and Publications Services. For agency records located in the 
Office of the Inspector General, the Assistant Inspector General for 
Audits or the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations shall make 
the initial determination to deny agency records in whole or in part 
instead of the Director, Division of Freedom of Information and 
Publications Services. If the Assistant Secretary of the Commission, the 
General Counsel, the Assistant Inspector

[[Page 193]]

General for Audits, or the Assistant Inspector General for 
Investigations determines that the agency records sought are exempt from 
disclosure and that their disclosure is contrary to the public interest 
and will adversely affect the rights of any person, the Assistant 
Secretary of the Commission, the General Counsel, the Assistant 
Inspector General for Audits, or the Assistant Inspector General for 
Investigations shall furnish that determination to the Director, 
Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, who shall 
notify the requester of the determination in the manner provided in 
Sec. 9.27
    (d) If a requested record that is located is one of another 
Government agency or deals with subject matter over which an agency 
other than the NRC has exclusive or primary responsibility, the NRC 
shall promptly refer the record to that Government agency for 
disposition or for guidance regarding disposition.
    (e) The 10-working day period for response to a request for agency 
records provided in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section may be 
extended for unusual circumstances as provided in Sec. 9.31.
    (f) In exceptional circumstances where it does not appear possible 
to complete action on a request within the maximum 20 working-day limit 
as provided in Sec. 9.31, the Director, Division of Freedom of 
Information and Publications Services, may seek an agreement with the 
requester for a specified extension of time in which to act upon the 
request. The NRC shall confirm the agreement for an extension of time in 
writing.
    (g) If the NRC does not respond to a request within the 10-working-
day period, or within the extended periods described in paragraph (e) of 
this section, the requester may treat that delay as a denial of the 
request and immediately appeal to the Executive Director for Operations 
as provided in Sec. 9.29(a) or sue in a district court as noted in 
Sec. 9.29(c).

<R05>
Sec. 9.27  Form and content of responses.

    (a) When the NRC has located a requested agency record and has 
determined to disclose the agency record, the Director, Division of 
Freedom of Information and Publications Services, shall promptly furnish 
the agency record or notify the requester where and when the agency 
record will be available for inspection and copying. The NRC will 
normally place copies of agency records disclosed in response to Freedom 
of Information Act requests in the NRC Public Document Room and, for 
agency records relating to a specific nuclear power facility, in the 
Local Public Document Room established for that facility. The NRC shall 
also advise the requester of any applicable fees under Sec. 9.35.
    (b) When the NRC denies access to a requested agency record or 
denies a request for a waiver or reduction of fees, the Director, 
Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, shall 
notify the requester in writing. The denial includes as appropriate--
    (1) The reason for the denial;
    (2) A reference to the specific exemption under the Freedom of 
Information Act and the Commission's regulations authorizing the 
withholding of the agency record or portions of it;
    (3) The name and title or position of each person responsible for 
the denial of the request, including the head of the office recommending 
denial of a record;
    (4) A statement stating why the request does not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 9.41 if the request is for a waiver or reduction of 
fees; and
    (5) A statement that the denial may be appealed within 30 days from 
the receipt of the denial to the Executive Director for Operations, to 
the Secretary of the Commission, or to the Inspector General, as 
appropriate.
    (c) The Director, Division of Freedom of Information and 
Publications Services, shall maintain a copy of each letter granting or 
denying requested agency records or denying a request for waiver or 
reduction of fees in accordance with the NRC Comprehensive Records 
Disposition Schedule.

General.
    (b) The NRC shall make determination on any appeal made under this 
section within 20 working days after the receipt of the appeal.
    (c)(1) If the appeal of the denial of the request for agency records

a Deputy Director, or the Secretary of the Commission, or the Inspector 
General shall notify the requester of the denial specifying--
    (i) The exemptions relied upon;
    (ii) An explanation of how the exemption applies to the agency 
records withheld; and
    (iii) The reasons for asserting the exemption.
    (2) If, on appeal, the denial of a request for waiver or reduction 
of fees for locating and reproducing agency records is upheld in whole

District of Columbia.
    (d) The Executive Director for Operations, or a Deputy Executive

Sec. 9.40  Assessment of fees.

    (a) If the request is expected to require the NRC to assess fees in

Sec. 9.41  Requests for waiver or reduction of fees.

    (a)(1) The NRC shall collect fees for searching for, reviewing, and 
duplicating agency records, except as provided in Sec. 9.39, unless a 
requester submits a request in writing for a waiver or reduction of 
fees. To assure that there will be no delay in the processing of Freedom 
of Information Act requests, the request for a waiver or reduction of 
fees should be included in the initial Freedom of Information Act 
request letter.
    (2) Each request for a waiver or reduction of fees must be addressed 
to the Director, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications 
Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555.
    (b) A person requesting the NRC to waive or reduce search, review, 
or duplication fees shall:
    (1) Describe the purpose for which the requester intends to use the 
requested information;
    (2) Explain the extent to which the requester will extract and 
analyze the substantive content of the agency record;
    (3) Describe the nature of the specific activity or research in 
which the agency records will be used and the specific qualifications 
the requester possesses to utilize information for the intended use in 
such a way that it will contribute to public understanding;
    (4) Describe the likely impact on the public's understanding of the 
subject as compared to the level of understanding of the subject 
existing prior to disclosure;
    (5) Describe the size and nature of the public to whose 
understanding a contribution will be made;
    (6) Describe the intended means of dissemination to the general 
public;
    (7) Indicate if public access to information will be provided free

    (8) Describe any commercial or private interest the requester or any 
other party has in the agency records sought.
    (c) The NRC will waive or reduce fees, without further specific 
information from the requester if, from information provided with the 
request for agency records made under Sec. 9.23(b), it can determine 
that disclosure of the information in the agency records is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government 
and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (d) In making a determination regarding a request for a waiver or 
reduction of fees, the NRC shall consider the following factors:
    (1) How the subject of the requested agency records concerns the 
operations or activities of the Government;
    (2) How the disclosure of the information is likely to contribute to 
an understanding of Government operations or activities;
    (3) If disclosure of the requested information is likely to 
contribute to public understanding;
    (4) If disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of Government operations or activities;
    (5) If, and the extent to which, the requester has a commercial 
interest that would be furthered by the disclosure of the requested 
agency records; and
    (6) If the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the 
requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest 
in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest 
of the requester.
    (e) If the written request for a waiver or reduction of fees does 
not meet the requirements of this section, the NRC will inform the 
requester that the request for waiver or reduction of fees is

[[Page 198]]

being denied and set forth the appeal rights under Sec. 9.29 to the 
requester.

by NRC in a system of records subject to the provisions of the Privacy 
Act of 1974, shall be acknowledged in writing by the Director, Office of 
Administration, or his designee, within ten working days after date of 
actual receipt. The acknowledgement shall advise the requestor if any 
additional information is needed to process the request. Wherever 
practicable, the acknowledgement shall notify the individual whether his 
request to obtain access to the record or to correct or amend the record 
has been granted or denied.
    (b) When an individual requests access to records or permission to 
correct or amend records in person, every effort will be made to make an 
immediate determination as to whether access or correction or amendment 
should be granted. If an immediate determination cannot be made, the 
request will be processed in the same manner as a written request. 
Records will be made available for immediate inspection whenever 
possible.

[40 FR 44484, Sept. 26, 1975, as amended at 53 FR 17689, May 18, 1988; 
54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 9.61   Procedures for processing requests for records exempt in whole or in part.

    (a) When an individual requests information concerning the existence 
of, or access to, records about himself which have been compiled in 
reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding in either a 
court or before an administrative tribunal, the NRC shall advise the 
individual only that no record available to him pursuant to the Privacy 
Act of 1974 has been identified.
    (b) General exemptions. Generally, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) allows the 
exemption of any system of records within the NRC from any part of 
section 552a except subsections (b), (c)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through 
(F), (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i) of the act if the system 
of records is maintained by an NRC component that performs as one of its 
principal functions any activity pertaining to the enforcement of 
criminal laws, including police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce 
crimes, or to apprehend criminals, and consists of--
    (1) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual 
criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of 
identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of 
criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release and parole, and 
probation status;
    (2) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal 
investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and 
associated with an identifiable individual; or
    (3) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of 
the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or 
indictment through release from supervision.
    (c) Specific exemptions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k). Individual 
requests for access to records which have been exempted from access 
pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) and Sec. 9.95 shall be 
processed as follows:

[[Page 202]]

    (1) Information classified pursuant to Executive Order 12356 and 
exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). (i) Requested information 
classified by NRC will be reviewed by the responsible official of the 
NRC to determine whether it continues to warrant classification under 
the criteria of section 1.3 of Executive Order 12356.
    (ii) Information which no longer warrants classification under these 
criteria shall be declassified and made available to the individual. If 
the requested information has been classified by another agency, the 
responsible official of the NRC will request the classifying agency to 
review the information to ascertain if classification is still 
warranted. If the information continues to warrant classification, the 
individual shall be advised that the information sought is classified, 
that it has been reviewed and continues to warrant classification, and 
that it has been exempted from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).
    (2) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes 
exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). Requests shall be responded to 
in the manner provided in paragraph (a) of this section unless a review 
of the information indicates that the information has been used or is 
being used to deny the individual any right, privilege or benefit for 
which he is eligible or to which he would otherwise be entitled under 
Federal law. In that event, the individual shall be advised of the 
existence of the information and shall be provided the information 
except to the extent it would reveal the identity of a confidential 
source. Information that would reveal the identity of a confidential 
source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the 
source and the summary or extract shall be provided to the requesting 
individual.
    (3) Material within a system of records required by statute to be 
maintained and used solely as statistical records and exempted pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4). The exempted information requested will be 
reviewed by the responsible official of the NRC to determine whether it 
continues to warrant exemption. Information which no longer warrants 
exemption shall be made available to the individual. If the information 
continues to warrant exemption, the individual shall be advised that the 
information sought is exempt from disclosure, that it has been reviewed 
and continues to warrant exemption, and that it has been exempted from 
access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4).
    (4) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of 
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal 
civilian employment, Federal contracts, or access to classified 
information and exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). Information 
exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) shall be made available to an 
individual upon request except to the extent that the information would 
reveal the identity of a confidential source. Material that would reveal 
the identity of a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized 
in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall 
be provided to the requesting individual.
    (5) Testing or examination material exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k)(6). Testing or examination material used solely to determine 
individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal 
service which has been exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) shall 
not be made available to an individual if disclosure would compromise 
the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process but 
may be made available if no possibility of such compromise exists.

<R05>
Sec. 9.65   Access determinations; appeals.

    (a) Initial determinations. For agency records located in the Office 
of the Inspector General, the Assistant Inspector General for Audits or 
the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations shall determine 
whether access to the record is available under the Privacy Act. For all 
other agency records, the Director, Office of Administration, or the 
Director's designee, with the advice of the system manager having 
control of the record to which access is requested, shall determine 
whether access to the record is available under the Privacy Act. The 
Director, Office of Administration, or the Director's designee, shall 
notify the requesting individual in person or in writing of the 
determination. Unless the request presents unusual difficulties or 
involves extensive numbers of records, individuals shall be notified of 
determinations to grant or deny access within 30 working days after 
receipt of the request.
    (1) Notices granting access shall inform the individual when and 
where the requested record may be seen, how copies may be obtained, and 
of any fees or anticipated charges which may be incurred pursuant to 
Sec. 9.85 of this subpart.
    (2) Notices denying access must state the reasons for the denial, 
and advise the individual that the denial may be appealed to the 
Inspector General, for agency records located in the Office of Inspector 
General, or the Executive Director for Operations, for all other agency 
records, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
    (b) Appeals from denials of access. If an individual has been denied 
access to a record the individual may request a final review and 
determination of that individual's request by the Inspector General or 
the Executive Director for Operations as appropriate. A request for 
final review of an initial determination must be filed within 60 days of 
the receipt of the initial determination. For agency records denied by 
the Assistant Inspector General for Audits or the Assistant Inspector 
General for Investigations, the appeal must be in writing and addressed 
to the Inspector General, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555. For agency records denied by the Director, Office 
of Administration, or the Director's designee, the appeal must be in 
writing addressed to the Executive Director for Operations. The appeal 
should clearly state on the envelope and in the letter ``Privacy Act 
Appeal-Denial of Access.'' The NRC does not consider an appeal that is 
not marked as indicated in this paragraph as received until it is 
actually received by the Inspector General or Executive Director for 
Operations.
    (c) Final determinations. (1) The Inspector General, or the 
Executive Director for Operations or the EDO's designee, shall make a 
final determination within 30 working days of the receipt of the request 
for final review, unless the time is extended for good cause shown such 
as the need to obtain additional information, the volume of records 
involved, or the complexity of the issue. The extension of time may not 
exceed 30 additional working days. The requester shall be advised in 
advance of any extension of time and of the reasons therefor.
    (2) If the Inspector General, or the Executive Director for 
Operations or the EDO's designee, determines that access was properly 
denied because the information requested has been exempted from 
disclosure, the Inspector General, or the Executive Director for 
Operations or the EDO's designee shall undertake a review of the 
exemption to determine whether the information should continue to be 
exempt from disclosure. The Inspector General, or the Executive Director 
for Operations or the EDO's designee, shall notify the individual in 
writing of the final agency determination to grant or deny the request 
for access. Notices denying access must state the reasons therefor and 
must advise the individual of his/

Sec. 9.66   Determinations authorizing or denying correction of records; appeals.

    (a) Initial determinations. (1) For agency records located in the 
Office of the Inspector General, the Assistant Inspector General for 
Audits or the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations shall 
determine whether to authorize or refuse correction or amendment of a 
record. For all other agency records, the Director, Office of 
Administration, or the Director's designee, with the advice of the 
system manager having control of the record, shall determine whether to 
authorize or refuse correction or amendment of a record. The Director, 
Office of Administration, or the Director's designee, shall notify the 
requesting individual. Unless the request presents unusual difficulties 
or involves extensive numbers of records, individuals must be notified 
of determinations to authorize or refuse correction or amendment of a 
record within 30 working days after receipt of the request. In making 
this determination, the NRC official shall be guided by the following 
standards:
    (i) Records shall contain only such information about an individual 
as is relevant and necessary to accomplish an NRC function required to 
be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President;
    (ii) Records used by NRC in making any determination about any 
individual shall be as accurate, relevant, current, and complete as is 
reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the 
determination;
    (iii) No record shall describe how any individual has exercised 
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless such record is expressly 
authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is 
maintained, or is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law 
enforcement activity.
    (2) For agency records located in the Office of Inspector General, 
if correction or amendment of a record is authorized, the Assistant 
Inspector General for Audits or the Assistant Inspector General for 
Investigations shall correct or amend the record. For all other agency 
records, the Director, Office of Administration, or the Director's 
designee, shall correct or amend the record. The Director, Office of 
Administration, or the Director's designee shall notify the requesting 
individual in writing that the correction or amendment has been made and 
provide the individual with a courtesy copy of the corrected record.
    (3) If correction or amendment of a record is refused, the Director, 
Office of Administration or the Director's designee, shall notify the 
requesting individual in writing of the refusal and the reasons 
therefor, and shall advise the individual that the refusal may be 
appealed to the Inspector General or the Executive Director for 
Operations, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in this section.
    (b) Appeals from initial adverse determinations. If an individual's 
request to amend or correct a record has been denied, in whole or in 
part, the individual may request a final review and determination of 
that individual's request by the Inspector General or the Executive 
Director for Operations, as appropriate. A request for final review of 
an initial determination must be filed within 60 days of the receipt of 
the initial determination. For agency records located in the Office of 
the Inspector General, the appeal must be in writing and addressed to 
the Inspector General, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, 
DC 20555. For agency records located in all other offices, the appeal 
must be in writing addressed to the Executive Director for Operations. 
The appeal should clearly state on the envelope and in the letter 
``Privacy Act Correction Appeal.'' The NRC does not consider an appeal 
that is not marked as indicated in this paragraph as received until it 
is actually received by the Inspector General or Executive Director for 
Operations. Requests for final review must set forth the specific item 
of information sought to be corrected or amended and should include, 
where appropriate, documents supporting the correction or amendment.

[[Page 205]]

    (c) Final determinations. (1) The Inspector General, for agency 
records located in the Office of the Inspector General, or the Executive 
Director for Operations or the EDO's designee, for all other agency 
records, shall make a final agency determination within 30 working days 
of receipt of the request for final review, unless the time is extended 
for good cause shown such as the need to obtain additional information, 
the volume of records involved, or the complexity of the issue. The 
extension of time may not exceed 30 additional working days. The 
requester shall be advised in advance of any extension of time and of 
the reasons therefor.
    (2) For agency records located in the Office of the Inspector 
General, if the Inspector General makes a final determination that an 
amendment or correction of the record is warranted on the facts, the 
Inspector General or the IG's designee, shall correct or amend the 
record pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 9.66(a)(2). For all other 
agency records, if the Executive Director for Operations, or the EDO's 
designee, makes a final determination that an amendment or correction of 
the record is warranted on the facts, the EDO or the EDO's designee, 
shall notify the Director, Office of Administration, to correct or amend 
the record to the procedures in Sec. 9.66(a)(2).
    (3) If the Inspector General, or the Executive Director for 
Operations or the EDO's designee, makes a final determination that an 
amendment or correction of the record is not warranted on the facts, the 
individual shall be notified in writing of the refusal to authorize 
correction or amendment of the record in whole or in part, and of the 
reasons therefor, and the individual shall be advised of his/her right 
to provide a ``Statement of Disagreement'' for the record and of his/her 
right to judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).

            disclosure to others of records about individuals


<R05>
Sec. 9.80   Disclosure of record to persons other than the individual to whom it pertains.

    (a) NRC Commissioners and NRC personnel shall not disclose any 
record which is contained in a system of records maintained by NRC by 
any means of communication to any person, or to another Government 
agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior 
written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless 
disclosure of the record is:
    (1) To NRC Commissioners and NRC personnel who have a need for the 
record in the performance of their duties;
    (2) Required under 5 U.S.C. 552;
    (3) For a routine use published in the Federal Register;
    (4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying 
out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of 
Title 13 of the United States Code;
    (5) To a recipient who has provided the agency with advance adequate 
written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical 
research or reporting record and the record is transferred in a form 
that is not individually identifiable. The advance written statement of 
assurance shall (i) state the purpose for which the record is requested, 
and (ii) certify that the record will be used only for statistical 
purposes. Prior to release for statistical purposes in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph, the record shall be stripped of all 
personally identifying information and reviewed to ensure that the 
identity of any individual cannot reasonably be determined by combining 
two or more statistical records;
    (6) To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record 
that has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued 
preservation by the United States Government, or to the Archivist of the 
United States or designee for evaluation to determine whether the record 
has such value;
    (7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental 
jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a 
civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized 
by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a 
written request to the NRC specifying the particular portion of the 
record desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is 
sought. A record may be disclosed to a law enforcement agency at the 
initiative of the NRC if criminal conduct is suspected, provided that 
such disclosure has been established as a routine use by publication in 
the Federal Register, and the instance of misconduct is directly related 
to the purpose for which the record is maintained;
    (8) To any person upon a showing of compelling circumstances 
affecting the health or safety of any individual;
    (9) To either House of Congress or, to the extent of matter within 
its jurisdiction, to any committee or subcommittee thereof or to any 
joint committee of the Congress or to any subcommittee of such joint 
committee;
    (10) To the Comptroller General, or any authorized representatives, 
in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting 
Office;
    (11) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or
    (12) To a consumer reporting agency in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
3711(f).

Sec. 9.81   Notices of subpoenas.

    When records concerning an individual are subpoenaed or otherwise 
disclosed pursuant to court order, the NRC officer or employee served 
with the subpoena shall be responsible for assuring that the individual 
is notified of the disclosure within five days after such subpoena or 
other order becomes a matter of public record. The notice shall be 
mailed to the last known address of the individual and shall contain the 
following information: (a) The date the subpoena is returnable; (b) the

disclosure. The notice shall contain the following information: (a) The 
nature of the information disclosed; (b) the person or agency to whom 
the information was disclosed; (c) the date of the disclosure; and (d)

                                  fees


<R05>
Sec. 9.85  Fees.

    Fees shall not be charged for search for or review of records 
requested pursuant to this subpart or for making copies or extracts of 
records in order to make them available for review. Fees established 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 483c and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5) shall be charged 
according to the schedule contained in Sec. 9.35 of this part for actual 
copies of records requested by individuals, pursuant to the Privacy Act 
of 1974, unless the Director, Division of Freedom of Information and 
Publications Services, waives the fee because of the inability of the 
individual to pay or because making the records available without cost, 
or at a reduction in cost, is otherwise in the public interest.

Sec. 9.90   Violations.

    (a) An injunction or other court order may be obtained pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(g) (1-3) to compel NRC to permit an individual to review, 
amend or copy a record pertaining to him, or to be accompanied by 
someone of his own choosing when he reviews his record. A court order 
may be obtained for the payment of a civil penalty imposed pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(g)(4) if NRC intentionally or willfully fails to maintain a 
record accurately, or fails to comply with any provision of 5 U.S.C. 
552a, or any provision of this subpart, if such failure results in an 
adverse determination or has an adverse effect on an individual. Court 
costs and attorney's fees may be awarded in civil actions.
    (b) Any officer or employee of NRC who willfully maintains a system 
of records without meeting the notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4), or who willfully discloses information knowing such 
disclosure to be prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 552a or by any rules or 
regulations issued thereunder, may be guilty of a criminal misdemeanor 
and upon conviction may be fined up to $5000. Any person who knowingly 
and willfully requests or obtains any record concerning an individual 
from NRC under false pretenses may be convicted of a criminal 
misdemeanor and upon conviction may be fined up to $5,000.

U.S.C. 552b. This subpart does not affect the procedures pursuant to 
which NRC records are made available to the public for inspection and

Sec. 9.101  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    (a) Commission means the collegial body of five Commissioners or a 
quorum thereof as provided by section 201 of the Energy Reorganization 
Act of 1974, or any subdivision of that collegial body authorized to act 
on its behalf, and shall not mean any body not composed of members of 
that collegial body.
    (b) Commissioner means an individual who is a member of the 
Commission.
    (c) Meeting means the deliberations of at least a quorum of 
Commissioners where such deliberations determine or result in the joint 
conduct or disposition of official Commission business, that is, where 
discussions are sufficiently focused on discrete proposals or issues as 
to cause or to be likely to cause the individual participating members 
to form reasonably firm positions regarding matters pending or likely to 
arise before the agency. Deliberations required or permitted by 
Secs. 9.105, 9.106, or 9.108(c) do not constitute ``meetings'' within 
this definition.
    (d) Closed meeting means a meeting of the Commission closed to 
public observation as provided by Sec. 9.104.
    (e) Open meeting means a meeting of the Commission open to public 
observation pursuant to this subpart.
    (f) Secretary means the Secretary to the Commission.
    (g) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the commission as 
provided by section 25(b) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and section 
201(f) of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, and, until such time as 
the offices of that officer are in the same location as those of the 
Commission, any member of his office specially designated in

[[Page 209]]

writing by him pursuant to this subsection to carry out his 
responsibilities under this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 9.102  General requirement.

    Commissioners shall not jointly conduct or dispose of Commission 
business in Commission meetings other than in accordance with this 
subpart. Except as provided in Sec. 9.104, every portion of every 
meeting of the Commission shall be open to public observation.


<R05>
Sec. 9.103  General provisions.

    The Secretary shall ensure that all open Commission meetings are 
held in a location such that there is reasonable space and adequate 
visibility and acoustics, for public observation. No additional right to 
participate in Commission meetings is granted to any person by this 
subpart. An open meeting is not part of the formal or informal record of 
decision of the matters discussed therein except as otherwise required 
by law. Statements of views or expressions of opinion made by 
Commissioners or NRC employees at open meetings are not intended to 
represent final determinations or beliefs. Such statements may not be 
pleaded, cited, or relied upon before the Commission or in any 
proceeding under part 2 of these regulations (10 CFR part 2) except as 
the Commission may direct. Members of the public attending open 
Commission meetings may use small electronic sound recorders to record 
the meeting, but the use of other electronic recording equipment and 
cameras requires the advance written approval of the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 9.104  Closed meetings.

    (a) Except where the Commission finds that the public interest 
requires otherwise, Commission meetings shall be closed, and the 
requirements of Secs. 9.105 and 9.107 shall not apply to any information 
pertaining to such meeting otherwise required by this subpart to be 
disclosed to the public, where the Commission determines in accordance 
with the procedures of Sec. 9.105 that opening such meetings or portions 
thereof or disclosing such information, is likely to:
    (1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under 
criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the 
interests of national defense or foreign policy, and (ii) in fact 
properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;
    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552) provided that such statute (i) 
requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner 
as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) establishes particular 
criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be 
withheld;
    (4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, including such 
information as defined in Sec. 2.790(d) of this title;
    (5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, imposing a civil penalty 
on any person pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2282 or 42 U.S.C. 5846, or any 
revocation of any license pursuant to 42 U.S.C. sec. 2236, or formally 
censuring any person;
    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature where such disclosure 
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose investigatory reports compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, including specifically enforcement of the Atomic Energy Act of 
l1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., and the Energy Reorganization 
Act of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5801 et seq., or information which if 
written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that 
the production of such records or information would: (i) Interfere with 
enforcement proceedings, (ii) deprive a person of a right to a fair 
trial or an impartial adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a 
confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal 
law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or

[[Page 210]]

by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence 
investigation, confidential information furnished only by the 
confidential source, (v) disclose investigative techniques and 
procedures, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law 
enforcement personnel;
    (8) [Reserved]
    (9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed 
Commission action, except that this subparagraph shall not apply in any 
instance where the Commission has already disclosed to the public the 
content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Commission is 
required to make such disclosure on its own initative prior to taking 
final action on such proposal; or
    (10) Specifically concern the Commission's issuance of a subpoena, 
or the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding or an 
action or proceeding before a state or federal administrative agency, an 
action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, 
or the initiation, conduct or disposition by the Commission of a 
particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554 
or otherwise involving a determination on the record after an 
opportunity for a hearing pursuant to part 2 or similar provisions.
    (b) Examples of situations in which Commission action may be deemed 
to be significantly frustrated are: (1) If opening any Commission 
meeting or negotiations would be likely to disclose information provided 
or requests made to the Commission in confidence by persons outside the 
Commission and which would not have been provided or made otherwise; (2) 
if opening a meeting or disclosing any information would reveal legal or 
other policy advice, public knowledge of which could substantially 
affect the outcome or conduct of pending or reasonably anticipated 
litigation or negotiations; or (3) if opening any meeting or disclosing 
any information would reveal information requested by or testimony or 
proposals to be given to other agencies of government, including the 
Congress and the Executive Branch before the requesting agency would 
receive the information, testimony or proposals. The examples in the 
above sentence are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended 
to be exhaustive.


<R05>
Sec. 9.105  Commission procedures.

    (a) Action under Sec. 9.104 shall be taken only when a majority of 
the entire membership of the Commission votes to take such action. A 
separate vote of the Commissioners shall be taken with respect to each 
Commission meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be 
closed to the public pursuant to Sec. 9.104, or which respect to any 
information which is proposed to be withheld under Sec. 9.105(c). A 
single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion 
or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with 
respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long 
as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and 
is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial 
meeting in such series. The vote of each Commissioner participating in 
such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.
    (b) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, Sec. 9.106(a) or Sec. 9.108(c) the Secretary shall make 
publicly available in the Public Document Room a written copy of such 
vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of 
a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Secretary shall, within one 
day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or 
Sec. 9.106(a), make publicly available in the Public Document Room a 
full written explanation of its action closing the portion together with 
a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their 
affiliation.
    (c) The notices and lists required by paragraph (b) of this section 
to be made public may be withheld from the public to the extent that the 
Commission determines that such information itself would be protected 
against disclosure by Sec. 9.104(a). Any such determination shall be 
made independently of the Commission's determination

[[Page 211]]

pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to close a meeting, but in 
accordance with the procedure of that subsection. Any such 
determination, including a written explanation for the action and the 
specific provision or provisions of Sec. 9.104(a) relied upon, must be 
made publicly available to the extent permitted by the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 9.106  Persons affected and motions for reconsideration.

    (a) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by 
a portion of a meeting requests that the Commission close such portion 
to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraphs (a) (5), 
(6), or (7) of Sec. 9.104, the Commission, upon request of any one 
Commissioner, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting.
    (b) Any person may petition the Commission to reconsider its action 
under Sec. 9.105(a) or paragraph (a) of this section by filing a 
petition for reconsideration with the Commission within seven days after 
the date of such action and before the meeting in question is held.
    (c) A petition for reconsideration filed pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section shall state specifically the grounds on which the 
Commission action is claimed to be erroneous, and shall set forth, if 
appropriate, the public interest in the closing or opening of the 
meeting. The filing of such a petition shall not act to stay the 
effectiveness of the Commission action or to postpone or delay the 
meeting in question unless the Commission orders otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 9.107   Public announcement of Commission meetings.

    (a) In the case of each meeting, the Secretary shall make public 
announcement, at least one week before the meeting, of the time, place, 
and subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to 
the public, and the name and phone number of the official designated by 
the Commission to respond to requests for information about the meeting. 
Such announcement shall be made unless a majority of the members of the 
Commission determines by a recorded vote that Commission business 
requires that such meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case 
the Secretary shall make public announcement of the time, place and 
subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or closed to the 
public, at the earliest practical time.
    (b) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the 
public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section only if 
the Secretary publicly announces such changes at the earliest 
practicable time. The subject matter of as meeting, or the determination 
of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, 
to the public, may be changed following the public announcement required 
by this subsection only if: (1) A majority of the entire membership of 
the Commission determines by a recorded vote that Commission business so 
requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, 
and (2) the Secretary publicly announces such change and the vote of 
each member upon such change at the earliest practicable time.
    (c) Immediately following each public announcement required by this 
section, notice of the time, place, and subject matter of a meeting, 
whether the meeting is open or closed, any change in one of the 
preceding, and the name and phone number of the official designated by 
the Commission to respond to requests for information about the meeting, 
shall also be submitted for publication in the Federal Register.
    (d) The public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this 
section shall consist of the Secretary:
    (1) Publicly posting a copy of the document in the Public Document 
Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC; and, to the extent 
appropriate under the circumstances;
    (2) Mailing a copy to all persons whose names are on a mailing list 
maintained for this purpose;
    (3) Submitting a copy for possible publication to at least two 
newspapers of general circulation in the Washington, DC metropolitan 
area;
    (4) Any other means which the Secretary believes will serve to 
further inform any persons who might be interested.

[[Page 212]]

    (e) Action under the second sentence of paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section shall be taken only when the Commission finds that the public 
interest in prompt Commission action or the need to protect the common 
defense or security or to protect the public health or safety overrides 
the public interest in having full prior notice of Commission meetings.

Sec. 9.108  Certification, transcripts, recordings and minutes.

    (a) For every meeting closed pursuant to paragraphs (a) (1) through 
(10) of Sec. 9.104 and for every determination pursuant to 
Sec. 9.105(c), the General Counsel shall publicly certify at the time of 
the public announcement of the meeting, or if there is no public 
announcement at the earliest practical time, that, in his or her 
opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each 
relevant exemptive provision unless the Commission votes pursuant to 
Sec. 9.105(c) that such certification is protected against disclosure by 
Sec. 9.104(a). A copy of such certification, together with a statement 
from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and 
place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the 
Commission. The Commission shall maintain a complete transcript or 
electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each 
meeting, or portion of a meeting closed to the public, except that in 
the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(10) of Sec. 9.104, the Commission shall 
maintain such a transcript, or recording or a set of minutes. Such 
minutes shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall 
provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the 
reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed 
on any item and the record of any rollcall vote (reflecting the vote of 
each Commissioner on the question). All documents considered in 
connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.
    (b) The Commission shall make promptly available to the public, in 
the Public Document Room, the transcript, electronic recording, or 
minutes (as required by paragraph (a) of this section) of the discussion 
of any item on the agenda, or of any item of the testimony of any 
witness received at the meeting, except for such item or items of such 
discussion or testimony as the Commission determines pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section to contain information which may be 
withheld under Sec. 9.104 or Sec. 9.105(c). Copies of such transcript, 
or minutes, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identity 
of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person upon payment of the 
actual cost of duplication or transcription as provided in Sec. 9.14. 
The Secretary shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, 
a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of 
each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a 
period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after 
the conclusion of any Commission proceeding with respect to which the 
meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.
    (c) In the case of any meeting closed pursuant to Sec. 9.104, the 
Secretary of the Commission, upon the advice of the General Counsel and 
after consultation with the Commission, shall determine which, if any, 
portions of the electronic recording, transcript or minutes and which, 
if any, items of information withheld pursuant to Sec. 9.105(c) contain 
information which should be withheld pursuant to Sec. 9.104, in the 
event that a request for the recording, transcript, or minutes is 
received within the period during which the recording, transcript, or 
minutes must be retained, under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) If at some later time the Commission determines that there is no 
further justification for withholding any transcript, recording or other 
item of information from the public which has previously been withheld, 
then such information shall be made available.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed when a 
subpoena, order, or other demand (hereinafter referred to as a 
``demand'') for the production of NRC records or disclosure of NRC 
information, including testimony regarding such records, is issued by a 
court or other judicial or quasi-judicial authority in a proceeding, 
excluding Federal grand jury proceedings, to which the NRC is not a 
party. Information and documents subject to this subpart include:
    (1) Any material contained in the files of the NRC;
    (2) Any information relating to material contained in the files of 
the NRC.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``employee of the NRC'' 
includes all NRC personnel as that term is defined in Sec. 9.3 of this 
part, including NRC contractors.
    (c) This subpart is intended to provide instructions regarding the

<R05>
Sec. 9.201  Production or disclosure prohibited unless approved by appropriate NRC official.

    No employee of the NRC shall, in response to a demand of a court or 
other judicial or quasi-judicial authority, produce any material 
contained in the files of the NRC or disclose, through testimony or 
other means, any information relating to material contained in the files 
of the NRC, or disclose any information or produce any material acquired 
as part of the performance of that employee's official duties or 
official status without prior approval of the appropriate NRC official. 
When the demand is for material contained in the files of the Office of 
the Inspector General or for information acquired by an employee of that 
Office, the Inspector General is the appropriate NRC official. In all 
other cases, the General Counsel is the appropriate NRC official.

[55 FR 33648, Aug. 17, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 9.202  Procedure in the event of a demand for production or disclosure.

    (a) Prior to or simultaneous with a demand upon an employee of the 
NRC for the production of material or the disclosure of information 
described in Sec. 9.200, the party seeking production or disclosure 
shall serve the General Counsel of the NRC with an affidavit or 
statement as described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section. 
Except for employees in the Office of Inspector General, whenever a 
demand is made upon an employee of the NRC for the production of 
material or the disclosure of information described in Sec. 9.200, that 
employee shall immediately notify the General Counsel. If the demand is 
made upon a regional NRC employee, that employee shall immediately 
notify the Regional Counsel who, in turn, shall immediately request 
instructions from the General Counsel. If the demand is made upon an 
employee in the Office of Inspector General, that employee shall 
immediately notify the Inspector General. The Inspector General shall 
immediately provide a copy of the demand to the General Counsel, and as 
deemed necessary, consult with the General Counsel.
    (b)(1) If oral testimony is sought by the demand, a summary of the 
testimony desired must be furnished to the General Counsel by a detailed 
affidavit or, if that is not feasible, a detailed statement by the party 
seeking the testimony or the party's attorney. This

[[Page 214]]

requirement may be waived by the General Counsel in appropriate 
circumstances.
    (2) The General Counsel may request a plan from the party seeking 
discovery of all demands then reasonably foreseeable, including but not 
limited to, names of all NRC personnel from whom discovery is or will be 
sought, areas of inquiry, length of time away from duty involved, and 
identification of documents to be used in each deposition, where 
appropriate.
    (c) The Inspector General or the General Counsel will notify the 
employee and such other persons, as circumstances may warrant, of the 
decision on the matter.

[50 FR 37645, Sept. 17, 1985, as amended at 55 FR 33648, Aug. 17, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 9.203  Procedure where response to demand is required prior to receiving instructions.

    If a response to the demand is required before the instructions from 
the Inspector General or the General Counsel are received, a U.S. 
attorney or NRC attorney designated for the purpose shall appear with 
the employee of the NRC upon whom the demand has been made, and shall 
furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations 
contained in this subpart and inform the court or other authority that 
the demand has been, or is being, as the case may be, referred for the 
prompt consideration of the appropriate NRC official and shall 
respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending 
receipt of the requested instructions. In the event that an immediate 
demand for production or disclosure is made in circumstances which would 
preclude the proper designation or appearance of a U.S. or NRC attorney 
on the employee's behalf, the employee shall respectfully request the 
demanding authority for sufficient time to obtain advice of counsel.

[55 FR 33649, Aug. 17, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 9.204  Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

    If the court or other judicial or quasi-judicial authority declines 
to stay the effect of the demand in response to a request made in 
accordance with Sec. 9.203 pending receipt of instructions, or if the 
court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with 
irrespective of instructions not to produce the material or disclose the 
information sought, the employee upon whom the demand has been made 
shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing these 
regulations and United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 
(1951).

Sec. 10.3  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 10.4  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to carry out 
its responsibility for the security of the nuclear energy program in a 
manner consistent with traditional American concepts of justice. To this 
end, the Commission has established criteria for determining eligibility 
for access authorization and/or employment clearance and will afford 
those individuals described in Sec. 10.2 the opportunity for 
administrative review of questions concerning their eligibility for 
access authorization and/or employment clearance.


<R05>
Sec. 10.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Access authorization means an administrative determination that 
an individual (including a consultant) who is employed by or an 
applicant for employment with the NRC, NRC contractors, agents, and 
licensees of the NRC, or other person designated by the Executive 
Director for Operations, is eligible for a security clearance for access 
to Restricted Data or national security information.
    (b) Hearing Examiner means a qualified attorney appointed by the 
Director, Office of Administration, to conduct a hearing in accordance 
with this part.
    (c) Hearing Counsel means an NRC attorney assigned by the General 
Counsel to prepare and administer hearings in accordance with this part.
    (d) Personnel Security Review Examiners are persons designated by 
the Executive Director for Operations to conduct a review of the record 
in accordance with this part.
    (e) Commission means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of five 
members or a quorum thereof sitting as a body, as provided by section 
201 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, or its designee.
    (f) Employment Clearance means an administrative determination that 
an individual (including a consultant) who is an NRC employee or 
applicant for NRC employment and other persons designated by the 
Executive Director for Operations of the NRC is eligible

[[Page 216]]

for employment or continued employment pursuant to subsection 145 b. of 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (g) Eligible or Eligibility means both initial eligibility and 
continued eligibility of an individual for access authorization and/or 
employment clearance.
    (h) National Security Information means information that is owned 
by, produced for or by, or under the control of the United States 
Government, and that has been determined, pursuant to Executive Order 
12356 or antecedent orders, to require protection against unauthorized 
disclosure, and is so designated.
    (i) Restricted Data means all data concerning design, manufacture, 
or utilization of atomic weapons, the production of special nuclear 
material, or the use of special nuclear material in the production of 
energy, but shall not include data declassified or removed from the 
Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as amended.

[47 FR 38676, Sept. 2, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 35999, Oct. 8, 1986; 52 
FR 31609, Aug. 21, 1987; 54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R04>
Subpart B--Criteria for Determining Eligibility for Access to Restricted 
    Data or National Security Information or an Employment Clearance


<R05>
Sec. 10.10  Application of the criteria.

    (a) The decision as to access authorization and/or employment 
clearance is a comprehensive, common-sense judgment, made after 
consideration of all the information, favorable or unfavorable, relevant 
to whether the granting of access authorization and/or employment 
clearance would not endanger the common defense and security and would 
be clearly consistent with the national interest.
    (b) The criteria in Sec. 10.11 set forth a number of the types of 
derogatory information used to assist in making determinations of 
eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance. These 
criteria are not exhaustive but contain the principal types of 
derogatory information which create a question as to the individual's 
eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance. While 
there must necessarily be adherence to such criteria, the NRC is not 
limited to them, nor precluded from exercising its judgment that 
information or facts in a case under its cognizance are derogatory 
although at variance with, or outside the scope of, the stated 
categories. These criteria are subject to continuing review and may be 
revised from time to time as experience and circumstances may make 
desirable.
    (c) When the reports of investigation of an individual contain 
information reasonably tending to establish the truth of one or more of 
the items in the criteria, such information shall be regarded as 
derogatory and shall create a question as to the individual's 
eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance. A 
question concerning the eligibility of an individual for access 
authorization and/or employment clearance shall be resolved in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 10.20 et seq.
    (d) In resolving a question concerning the eligibility or continued 
eligibility of an individual for access authorization and/or employment 
clearance, the following principles shall be applied by the Director, 
Division of Security, Hearing Examiners, and Personnel Security Review 
Examiners:
    (1) Information reasonably tending to establish the truth of one or 
more of the items in the criteria shall be the basis for recommending 
denial or revocation of access authorization and/or employment clearance 
unless evidence to support faith in the individual's reliability and 
trust-worthiness is affirmatively shown.
    (2) When deemed material to the deliberations, the extent of the 
activity, conduct, or condition, the period in which they occurred or 
existed, the length of time which has since elapsed, and the attitude 
and convictions of the individual shall be considered in determining 
whether the recommendation will be adverse or favorable.


<R05>
Sec. 10.11  Criteria.

    (a) The criteria for determining eligibility for access 
authorization and/or employment clearance shall relate, but

[[Page 217]]

not be limited, to the following where an individual:
    (1) Committed, attempted to commit, aided, or abetted another who 
committed or attempted to commit any act of sabotage, espionage, 
treason, sedition, or terrorism.
    (2) Publicly or privately advocated actions that may be inimical to 
the interest of the United States, or publicly or privately advocated 
the use of force or violence to overthrow the Government of the United 
States or the alteration of the form of government of the United States 
by unconstitutional means.
    (3) Knowingly established or continued a sympathetic association 
with a saboteur, spy, traitor, seditionist, anarchist, terrorist, or 
revolutionist, or with an espionage agent or other secret agent or 
representative of a foreign nation whose interests may be inimical to 
the interests of the United States, or with any person who advocates the 
use of force or violence to overthrow the Government of the United 
States or the alteration of the form of government of the United States 
by unconstitutional means.
    (4) Joined or engaged in any activity knowingly in sympathy with or 
in support of any foreign or domestic organization, association, 
movement, group, or combination of persons which unlawfully advocates or 
practices the commission of acts of force or violence to prevent others 
from exercising their rights under the Constitution or laws of the 
United States or any State or any subdivisions thereof by unlawful 
means, or which advocate the use of force and violence to overthrow the 
Government of the United States or the alteration of the form of 
government of the United States by unconstitutional means. (Ordinarily, 
criteria (3) and (4) will not include chance or casual meetings or 
contacts limited to normal business or official relations.)
    (5) Deliberately misrepresented, falsified or omitted relevant and 
material facts from or in a personnel security questionnaire, a personal 
qualifications statement, a personnel security interview, or any other 
information submitted pursuant this part.
    (6) Willfully violated or disregarded security regulations or was 
grossly negligent with respect thereto to a degree which could endanger 
the common defense and security; or by intention or gross carelessness 
disclosed Restricted Data or national security information to any person 
not authorized to receive it.
    (7) Has any illness or mental condition which in the opinion of 
competent medical authority may cause significant defect in the judgment 
or reliability of the individual.
    (8) Has been convicted of crimes indicating habitual criminal 
tendencies.
    (9) Has been convicted of a crime, or has a background, where the 
facts, circumstances, or conduct are of a nature indicating poor 
judgment, unreliabilty, or untrustworthiness.
    (10) Is a user of alcohol habitually and to excess, or has been such 
without adequate evidence of rehabilitation.
    (11) Has been, or is, a user of a drug or other substance listed in 
the schedules of Controlled Substances established pursuant to the 
Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (such as amphetamines, barbiturates, 
narcotics, etc.), except as prescribed or administered by a physician 
licensed to dispense drugs in the practice of medicine, without adequate 
evidence of rehabilitation.
    (12) Refused, without satisfactory explanation, to answer questions 
before a congressional committee, Federal or state court, or Federal 
administrative body including the NRC regarding charges relevant to the 
individual's eligibility for access authorization and/or employment 
clearance.
    (13) Engaged in any other conduct or is subject to any other 
circumstances which tend to show that the individual is not reliable or 
trustworthy, or which furnishes reason to believe that the individual 
may be subject to coercion, influence, or pressures which may cause the 
individual to act contrary to the national interest.


<R05>
Sec. 10.12  Interview and other investigation.

    (a) The Director, Division of Security, Office of Administration, 
may authorize the granting of access authorization and/or employment 
clearance on the basis of the information in the possession of the NRC 
or may authorize the conduct of an interview with

[[Page 218]]

the individual, if the individual consents to be interviewed, or such 
other investigation as the Director deems appropriate. On the basis of 
such interview and/or investigation, the Director may authorize the 
granting of access authorization and/or employment clearance.
    (b) The individual may elect on constitutional or other grounds not 
to participate in an interview or other investigation; however, such 
refusal or failure to furnish or authorize the furnishing of relevant 
and material information is deemed to be derogatory information pursuant 
to Sec. 10.11(a)(5) and (12).
    (c) If the director, Division of Security, cannot make a favorable 
finding regarding the eligibility of an individual for access 
authorization and/or employment clearance, the question of the 
individual's eligibility shall be resolved in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 10.20 et seq.

[47 FR 38676, Sept. 2, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 31609, Aug. 21, 1987; 
54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R04>
                          Subpart C--Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 10.20  Purpose of the procedures.

    These procedures establish methods for the conduct of hearings and 
administrative review of questions concerning an individual's 
eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance 
pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and Executive 
Orders 10450 and 10865, when a resolution favorable to the individual 
cannot be made on the basis of the interview or other investigation.


<R05>
Sec. 10.21  Suspension of access authorization and/or employment clearance.

    In those cases where information is received which raises a question 
concerning the continued eligibility of an individual for access 
authorization and/or employment clearance, the Director, Division of 
Security, through the Director, Office of Administration, shall forward 
to the Executive Director for Operations or a Deputy Executive Director, 
his or her recommendation as to whether the individual's access 
authorization and/or employment clearance should be suspended pending 
the final determination resulting from the operation of the procedures 
provided in this part. In making this recommendation the Director, 
Division of Security, shall consider such factors as the seriousness of 
the derogatory information developed, the degree of access of the 
individual to classified information, and the individual's opportunity 
by reason of his or her position to commit acts adversely affecting the 
national security. An individual's access authorization and/or 
employment clearance may not be suspended except by the direction of the 
Executive Director for Operations or a Deputy Executive Director.

[55 FR 4, Jan. 2, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 10.22  Notice to individual.

    A notification letter, prepared by the Division of Security, 
approved by the Office of General Counsel, and signed by the Director, 
Office of Administration, shall be presented to each individual whose 
eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance is in 
question. Where practicable, such letter shall be presented to the 
individual in person. The letter will be accompanied by a copy of this 
part and shall state:
    (a) That reliable information in the possession of the NRC has 
created a substantial doubt concerning the individual's eligibility for 
access authorization and/or employment clearance;
    (b) The information that creates a substantial doubt regarding the 
individual's eligibility for access authorization and/or employment 
clearance, which shall be as comprehensive and detailed as the national 
security permits;
    (c) That unless the individual files with the Director, Office of 
Administration, a written request for a hearing within 20 days of the 
individual's receipt of the notification letter, the Director, Division 
of Security, through the Director, Office of Administration, will submit 
a recommendation as to the final action to the Executive Director for 
Operations on the basis of the information in the possession of the NRC;
    (d) That if the individual files a written request for a hearing 
with the Director, Office of Administration, the individual must file 
with that request a

[[Page 219]]

written answer under oath or affirmation which admits or denies 
specifically each allegation and each supporting fact contained in the 
notification letter. A general denial is not sufficient to controvert a 
specific allegation. If the individual is without knowledge, he or she 
shall so state and that statement shall operate as a denial. The answer 
shall also state any additional facts and information that the 
individual desires to have considered in explanation or mitigation of 
allegations in the notification letter. Failure to specifically deny or 
explain or deny knowledge of any allegation or supporting fact shall be 
deemed an admission that the allegation or fact is true;
    (e) That if the individual does not want to exercise his or her 
right to a hearing, but does want to submit an answer to the allegations 
in the notification letter, the individual may do so by filing with the 
Director, Office of Administration, within 20 days of his receipt of the 
notification letter, a written answer in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section;
    (f) That the procedures in Sec. 10.24 et seq. shall apply to any 
hearing and review.

[47 FR 38676, Sept. 2, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 35999, Oct. 8, 1986; 52 
FR 31609, Aug. 21, 1987; 54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 10.23  Failure of individual to request a hearing.

    (a) In the event the individual fails to file a written request for 
a hearing pursuant to Sec. 10.22 within 20 days of his receipt of the 
notification letter, a recommendation as to the final action to be taken 
shall be made by the Director, Division of Security, through the 
Director, Office of Administration, to the Executive Director for 
Operations on the basis of the information in the possession of the NRC, 
including any answer filed by the individual.
    (b) The Director, Office of Administration, may for good cause 
shown, at the request of the individual, extend the time for filing a 
written request for a hearing or for filing a written answer to the 
matters contained in the notification letter.

[47 FR 38676, Sept. 2, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 31609, Aug. 21, 1987; 
54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 10.24  Procedures for hearing and review.

    (a) Upon receipt of a timely filed request for a hearing and answer 
complying with the requirements set forth in Sec. 10.22, the Director, 
Office of Administration, shall forthwith appoint a Hearing Examiner, 
and the General Counsel shall forthwith assign an NRC attorney to act as 
Hearing Counsel. The Director, Office of Administration, shall promptly 
notify the individual of the identity of the Hearing Examiner and 
proposed hearing date, which shall be selected with due regard for the 
convenience of the parties and their representatives.
    (b) Within 72 hours of being notified of the identity of the Hearing 
Examiner, the individual may request that the Hearing Examiner be 
disqualified for cause by filing with the Director, Office of 
Administration, a written statement of the individual's reasons for 
seeking disqualification. The time for filing the request may be 
extended by the Director, Office of Administration, for good cause 
shown. If the Director, Office of Administration, grants the request the 
procedures of paragraph (a) of this section and this paragraph shall be 
followed just as though there had been no prior appointment.
    (c) The individual shall have the right to appear at the hearing 
before the Hearing Examiner, to be represented by counsel or other 
representative, to introduce documentary or other evidence, and to call, 
examine, and cross-examine witnesses, subject to the provisions and 
limitations set forth in this part.

evidence relied upon the Director, Division of Security, in making his 
or her finding that a question exists regarding the eligibility of the 
individual for NRC access authorization and/or employment clearance in 
accordance with the provisions of this part. When the presence of a 
witness and the production of documents and other physical evidence is 
deemed by the Hearing Counsel to be necessary or desirable for a 
determination of the issues, the Director, Division of Security, shall 
make arrangements for the production of such evidence and for such 
witnesses to appear at the hearing by subpoena or otherwise.
    (b) Hearing Counsel is authorized to consult directly with 
individual's counsel or representative or the individual, if the 
individual is not so represented, for purposes of reaching mutual 
agreement upon arrangements for expeditious hearing of the case. Such 
arrangements may include clarification of issues and stipulations with 
respect to testimony and contents of documents and other physical 
evidence. Such stipulations when entered into shall be binding upon the 
individual and the NRC for the purposes of this part. Prior to any 
consultation with the individual, the Hearing Counsel shall advise the 
individual of his or her rights under this part, of his or her right to 
counsel or other representation, and of the possibility that any 
statement made by the individual to the Hearing Counsel may be used in 
subsequent proceedings.
    (c) The individual is responsible for producing witnesses in his or 
her own behalf and/or presenting other evidence before the Hearing 
Examiner to support the individual's answer and defense to the 
allegations contained in the notification letter. When requested, 
however, Hearing Counsel shall assist the individual to the extent 
practicable and necessary. The Hearing Counsel may at his or her 
discretion request the Director, Division of Security, to arrange for 
the issuance of subpoenas for witnesses to attend the hearing in the 
individual's behalf, or for the production of specific documents or 
other physical evidence, provided a showing of the necessity for such 
assistance has been made.

Sec. 10.26  Appointment of Hearing Examiner.

    The appointment of a Hearing Examiner, pursuant to Sec. 10.24 of 
this part, shall be from a list of qualified attorneys possessing the 
highest degree of integrity, ability, and good judgment. To qualify, an 
attorney shall have an NRC ``Q'' access authorization and may be an 
employee of the NRC, its contractors, agents or licensees. However, no 
employee or consultant of the NRC shall serve as Hearing Examiner 
hearing the case of an employee (including a consultant) or applicant 
for employment with the NRC; nor shall any employee or consultant of an 
NRC contractor, agent or licensee serve as Hearing Examiner hearing the 
case of an employee (including a consultant) or an applicant for 
employment of that contractor, agent, or licensee. No Hearing Examiner 
shall be selected who has knowledge of the case or of any information 
relevant to the disposition of it, or who for any reason would be unable 
to issue a fair and unbiased recommendation.


<R05>
Sec. 10.27  Prehearing proceedings.

    (a) After the appointment of the Hearing Examiner, he or she shall 
be furnished the record in the case, which shall consist of the letter 
of notification, the request for hearing and its supporting answer, and 
the notice of hearing, if it has been issued, and any stipulations 
agreed to by the individual and the Hearing Counsel.
    (b) The Hearing Examiner may on his or her own motion, or on that of 
either party, convene a prehearing conference with the Hearing Counsel 
and the individual and his or her counsel or representative, if any, for 
the purpose of clarifying the issues, identifying witnesses who may be 
called, identifying documents and other physical evidence that may be 
offered into evidence, and entering into stipulations of fact.
    (c) The parties will be notified by the Hearing Examiner at least 
ten days in advance of the hearing of the time and place of the hearing. 
For good cause shown, the Hearing Examiner may order postponements or 
continuances from time to time. If, after due notice, the individual 
fails to appear at the hearing, or appears but is not prepared

[[Page 221]]

to proceed, the Hearing Examiner shall, unless good cause is shown, 
return the case to the Director, Division of Security, who shall make a 
recommendation on final action to be taken, through the Director, Office 
of Administration, to the Executive Director for Operations on the basis 
of the information in the possession of the NRC.

54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 10.28  Conduct of hearing.

    (a) The Hearing Examiner shall conduct the hearing in an orderly, 
impartial and decorous manner. Technical rules of evidence may be 
relaxed so that a full evidentiary record may be made based on all 
material and relevant facts. Hearsay evidence may for good cause shown 
be received at the discretion of the Hearing Examiner and accorded such 
weight as the circumstances warrant.
    (b) The proceedings shall be open only to duly authorized 
representatives of the staff of the NRC, the individual, his or her 
counsel or representative, and such persons as may be officially 
authorized by the Hearing Examiner. Witnesses shall not testify in the 
presence of other witnesses except that the Hearing Examiner may, at his 
or her discretion, allow for expert witnesses to be present during 
testimony relevant to their own testimony.
    (c) Witnesses, including the individual, shall be examined under 
oath or affirmation by the party who called them and may be cross-
examined by the other. The Hearing Examiner shall rule on all 
evidentiary matters, may further examine any witness, and may call for 
additional witnesses or the production of documentary or other physical 
evidence if, in the exercise of his or her discretion, such additional 
evidence is deemed necessary to the resolution of an issue.
    (d) If it appears during the hearing that Restricted Data or 
national security information may be disclosed, the Hearing Examiner 
shall assure that disclosure is made only to persons authorized to 
receive it.
    (e) The Hearing Examiner may, at any time during the hearing, permit 
the Hearing Counsel to amend the notification letter to add or modify 
allegations to be considered. In the event of such an amendment to the 
notification letter, the individual shall be given an opportunity to 
answer the amended allegations. If the changes are of such a substantial 
nature that the individual cannot answer the amended allegations without 
additional time, the Hearing Examiner shall grant such additional time 
as he or she deems necessary.
    (f) The Hearing Examiner may receive and consider evidence in the 
form of depositions or responses to interrogatories upon a showing that 
the witness is not available for good reason such as death, serious 
illness or similar cause, or in the form of depositions, 
interrogatories, affidavits or statements with agreement of the parties. 
The Hearing Examiner may take official notice at any stage of the 
proceeding, where appropriate, of any fact not subject to reasonable 
dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the United 
States or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to 
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. A party is 
entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the 
propriety of taking such official notice. In the absence of prior 
notification the request may be made after notice is taken.
    (g) Hearing Counsel shall examine and cross-examine witnesses and 
otherwise assist the Hearing Examiner in such a manner as to bring out a 
full and true disclosure of all facts, both favorable and unfavorable, 
having a bearing on the issues before the Hearing Examiner. In 
performing these duties, the Hearing Counsel shall avoid the attitude of 
a prosecutor and shall always bear in mind that the proceeding is an 
administrative hearing and not a trial.
    (h) Hearing Counsel shall not participate in the deliberations of 
the Hearing Examiner, and shall express no opinion to the Hearing 
Examiner concerning the merits of the case. Hearing Counsel shall also, 
during the course of the hearing, advise the individual of his or her 
rights under these procedures when the individual is not represented by 
counsel or other representative.
    (i) The individual shall be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine 
persons

[[Page 222]]

who have made oral or written statements adverse to the individual 
relating to a controverted issue except that any such statement may be 
received and considered by the Hearing Examiner without affording such 
opportunity in either of the following circumstances:
    (1) The head of the department or agency supplying the statement 
certifies that the person who furnished the information is a 
confidential informant who has been engaged in obtaining intelligence 
information for the Government and that disclosure of the informant's 
identity would substantially harm the national interest or would 
endanger the well-being of the informant.
    (2) The Commission has determined, after considering the information 
furnished by the investigative agency concerning the reliability of the 
person who furnished the information and the accuracy of the statement 
concerned, that the statement appears to be reliable and material, and 
that failure of the Hearing Examiner to receive and consider such 
statement would, in view of the fact that access authorization and/or 
employment clearance is being sought, be substantially harmful to the 
national security and that the person who furnished the information 
cannot appear to testify due to death, serious illness, or similar 
cause.
    (j)(1) Whenever the procedure under paragraph (i)(1) of this section 
is used, the individual shall be given a summary of the information 
which shall be as comprehensive and detailed as the national security 
permits.
    (2) Whenever the procedure under paragraph (i)(2) is used, the 
individual shall be provided the identity of the person and the 
information to be considered.
    (3) In both paragraph (i) (1) and (2) procedures, appropriate 
consideration shall be accorded to the fact that the individual did not 
have an opportunity to cross-examine such informant or person.
    (k) Records provided by investigative agencies that were compiled as 
a regular or routine procedure by the business or agency from which 
obtained, or other physical evidence other than investigative reports, 
may be received and considered subject to rebuttal without 
authenticating witnesses, provided that the investigative agency 
furnished such information to the NRC pursuant to its responsibilities 
in connection with assisting the NRC in determining the individual's 
eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance.
    (l) Records compiled in the regular course of business, or other 
physical evidence other than investigative reports, relating to a 
controverted issue which, because they are classified, may not be 
inspected by the individual, may be received and considered provided 
that:
    (1) The Commission has made a determination that such records or 
other physical evidence appears to be material;
    (2) The Commission has made a determination that failure to receive 
and consider such records or other physical evidence would, in view of 
the fact that access authorization and/or employment clearance is being 
sought, be substantially harmful to the national security; and
    (3) To the extent that national security permits, a summary or 
description of such records or other physical evidence is made available 
to the individual. In every such case, information as to the 
authenticity and accuracy of such physical evidence furnished by the 
investigative agency shall be considered.
    (m) If the Hearing Examiner determines that additional investigation 
of any material information is required, he or she shall request in 
writing that the Director, Office of Administration, arrange for the 
investigation and shall specify those issues upon which more evidence is 
requested and identify, where possible, any persons or sources that 
might provide the evidence sought.
    (n) A written transcript of the entire proceeding shall be made by a 
person possessing appropriate NRC access authorization and/or employment 
clearance and, except for portions containing Restricted Data or 
national security information, or other lawfully withholdable 
information, a copy of

[[Page 223]]

such transcript shall be furnished the individual without cost.

54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 10.29  Recommendation of the Hearing Examiner.

    (a) The Hearing Examiner's findings and recommendation shall be 
based upon the entire record consisting of the transcript of the 
hearing, the documentary and other evidence adduced therein, and the 
letter of notification and answer. The Hearing Examiner shall also 
consider the circumstances of the receipt of evidence pursuant to 
Sec. 10.28, the individual's record of past employment, and the nature 
and sensitivity of the job the individual is or may be expected to 
perform.
    (b) The Hearing Examiner shall make specific findings on each 
allegation in the notification letter including the reasons for his or 
her findings, and shall make a recommendation as to the action which 
should be taken in the case.
    (c) The Hearing Examiner's recommendation shall be predicated upon 
his or her findings. If, after considering all the factors in light of 
the criteria in this part, the Hearing Examiner is of the opinion that 
granting or continuing access authorization and/or employment clearance 
to the individual will not endanger the common defense and security and 
will be clearly consistent with the national interest, a favorable 
recommendation shall be made; otherwise, an adverse recommendation shall 
be made.
    (d) The Hearing Examiner shall submit his or her findings and 
recommendation in a signed report together with the record of the case 
to the Director, Office Administration, with the least practical delay.
    (e) The Hearing Examiner shall not consider the possible impact of 
the loss of the individual's services upon the NRC program.

<R05>
Sec. 10.30  New evidence.

    After the close of the hearing, in the event the individual 
discovers new evidence not previously available or known to him or her, 
the individual may petition the Hearing Examiner if the Hearing 
Examiner's recommendation has not yet been issued, or thereafter, the 
Director, Office of Administration, to reopen the record to receive that 
evidence. If the Hearing Examiner or the Director, respectively, deem it 
material and appropriate, the record may be reopened to accept the 
evidence either by stipulation, with the agreement of the Hearing 
Counsel, or in a reconvened hearing.

[47 FR 38676, Sept. 2, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 31610, Aug. 21, 1987; 
54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 10.31  Actions on the recommendations.

    (a) Upon receipt of the findings and recommendation from the Hearing 
Examiner, and the record, the Director, Office of Administration, shall 
forthwith transmit it to the Executive Director for Operations who at 
his or her discretion may return the record to the Director, Office of 
Administration, for further proceedings by the Hearing Examiner with 
respect to specific matters designated by the Executive Director for 
Operations;
    (b)(1) In the event of a recommendation by the Hearing Examiner that 
an individual's access authorization and/or employment clearance be 
denied or revoked, the Executive Director for Operations shall 
immediately notify the individual in writing of the Hearing Examiner's 
findings with respect to each allegation contained in the notification 
letter, and that the individual has a right to request a review of his 
or her case by NRC Personnel Security Review Examiners and of the right 
to submit a brief in support of his or her contentions. The request for 
a review shall be submitted to the Executive Director for Operations 
within five days after the receipt of the notice. The brief shall be 
forwarded to the Executive Director for Operations, for transmission to 
the NRC Personnel Security Review Examiners, not later than 10 days 
after receipt of such notice.
    (2) In the event the individual fails to request a review by NRC 
Personnel Security Review Examiners of an adverse recommendation within 
the prescribed

[[Page 224]]

time, the Executive Director for Operations may at his or her discretion 
request a review of the record of the case by NRC Personnel Security 
Review Examiners. The request shall set forth those matters at issue in 
the hearing on which the Executive Director for Operations desires a 
review by the NRC Personnel Security Review Examiners.
    (c) Where the Hearing Examiner has made a recommendation favorable 
to the individual, the Executive Director for Operations may at his or 
her discretion request a review of the record of the case by NRC 
Personnel Security Review Examiners. If such a request is made, the 
Executive Director for Operations shall immediately cause the individual 
to be notified of that fact and of those matters at issue in the hearing 
on which the Executive Director for Operations desires a review by the 
NRC Personnel Security Review Examiners. The Executive Director for 
Operations shall further inform the individual that within 10 days of 
receipt of this notice, the individual may submit a brief concerning 
those matters at issue for the consideration of the NRC Personnel 
Security Review Examiners. The brief shall be forwarded to the Executive 
Director for Operations for transmission to the NRC Personnel Security 
Review Examiners.
    (d) In the event of a request for a review pursuant to paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section, the Hearing Counsel may file a brief within 
10 days of being notified by the Executive Director for Operations that 
a review has been requested. The brief shall be forwarded to the 
Executive Director for Operations for transmission to the NRC Personnel 
Security Review Examiners.
    (e) The Hearing Counsel may also request a review of the case by NRC 
Personnel Security Review Examiners. The request for review, which shall 
set forth those matters at issue in the hearing on which the Hearing 
Counsel desires a review, shall be submitted to the Executive Director 
for Operations within five days after receipt of the Hearing Examiner's 
findings and recommendation. Within 10 days of the request for review, 
the Hearing Counsel may file a brief which shall be forwarded to the 
Executive Director for Operations for transmission to the NRC Personnel 
Security Review Examiners. A copy of the request for review, and a copy 
of any brief filed, shall be immediately sent to the individual. If the 
Hearing Counsel's request is for a review of a recommendation favorable 
to the individual, the individual may, within 10 days of receipt of a 
copy of the request for review, submit a brief concerning those matters 
at issue for consideration of the NRC Personnel Security Review 
Examiners. The brief shall be forwarded to the Executive Director for 
Operations for transmission to the NRC Personnel Security Review 
Examiners.
    (f) The time limits imposed by this section for requesting reviews 
and the filing of briefs may be extended by the Executive Director for 
Operations for good cause shown.

Personnel Security Review Examiners, the Executive Director for 
Operations shall forthwith send the record, with all findings and 
recommendations and any briefs filed by the individual and the Hearing 
Counsel, to the NRC Personnel Security Review Examiners. If neither the 
individual, the Executive Director for Operations, nor the Hearing 
Counsel requests such a review, the final determination shall be made by 
the Executive Director for Operations on the basis of the record with 
all findings and recommendations.

<R05>
Sec. 10.32  Recommendation of the NRC Personnel Security Review Examiners.

    (a) The Executive Director for Operations shall designate three NRC 
Personnel Security Review Examiners to conduct a review of the record of 
the case. To qualify as a Review Examiner, the person designated shall 
have an NRC ``Q'' access authorization and may be an employee of the 
NRC, its contractors, agents, or licensees. However, no employee or 
consultant of the NRC shall serve as Review Examiner reviewing the case 
of an employee (including

[[Page 225]]

a consultant) or applicant for employment with the NRC; nor shall any 
employee or consultant of an NRC contractor, agent or licensee serve as 
Review Examiner reviewing the case of an employee (including a 
consultant) or an applicant for employment of that contractor, agent, or 
licensee. No Review Examiner shall be selected who has knowledge of the 
case or of any information relevant to the disposition of it, or who for 
any reason would be unable to issue a fair and unbiased recommenation.
    (b) The designated Review Examiners shall individually and 
independently, without consulting or otherwise communicating with one 
another, consider the matter under review based upon the record 
supplemented by any brief submitted by the individual or the Hearing 
Counsel. Review Examiners may request such additional briefs as any of 
them deems appropriate, which will be obtained by the Executive Director 
for Operations and provided to each Review Examiner. When a Review 
Examiner determines that additional evidence or further proceedings are 
necessary, the record may be returned to the Executive Director for 
Operations with a recommendation that the case be remanded to the 
Director, Office of Administration, for appropriate action, which may 
include returning the case to the Hearing Examiner and reconvening the 
hearing to obtain additional testimony.
    (c) In conducting the review, Review Examiners shall make individual 
findings and recommendations as to the eligibility or continued 
eligibility of an individual for access authorization and/or employment 
clearance on the record supplemented by additional testimony or briefs 
as have previously been determined by a Review Examiner(s) as 
appropriate. When additional testimony is taken by the Hearing Examiner, 
a written transcript of such testimony shall be made by a person 
possessing appropriate NRC access authorization and/or employment 
clearance and, except for portions containing Restricted Data or 
national security information, or other lawfully withholdable 
information, a copy of such transcript shall be furnished the individual 
without cost.
    (d) The Review Examiners shall not consider the possible impact of 
the loss of the individual's services upon the NRC program.
    (e) If, after considering all the factors in light of the criteria 
set forth in this part, a Review Examiner is of the opinion that 
granting or continuing access authorization and/or employment clearance 
to the individual will not endanger the common defense and security and 
will be clearly consistent with the national interest, the Review 
Examiner shall make a favorable recommendation; otherwise, the Review 
Examiner shall make an adverse recommendation. Each Review Examiner 
shall individually prepare a report of his or her findings and 
recommendations and submit the report in writing to the Executive 
Director for Operations, who shall furnish a copy to the individual. The 
findings and recommendations shall be fully supported by stated reasons 
supporting the findings and recommendations.

<R05>
Sec. 10.33  Action by the Executive Director for Operations.

    (a) The Executive Director for Operations, on the basis of the 
record accompanied by all findings and recommendations, shall make a 
final determination whether access authorization and/or employment 
clearance shall be granted, denied, or revoked, except when the 
provisions of Sec. 10.28 (i), (j), or (l) have been used and the 
Executive Director for Operation's determination is adverse, the 
Commission shall make the final agency determination.
    (b) In making the determination as to whether access authorization 
and/or employment clearance shall be granted, denied, or revoked, the 
Executive Director for Operations or the Commission shall give due 
recognition to the favorable as well as the unfavorable information 
concerning the individual and shall take into account the value of the 
individual's services to the NRC's program and the consequences of 
denying or revoking access authorization and/or employment clearance.

[[Page 226]]

    (c) In the event of an adverse determination, the Executive Director 
for Operations shall promptly notify the individual through the 
Director, Office of Administration, of his or her decision that access 
authorization and/or employment clearance is being denied or revoked and 
of his or her findings with respect to each allegation contained in the 
notification letter for transmittal to the individual.
    (d) In the event of a favorable determination, the Executive 
Director for Operations shall promptly notify the individual through the 
Director, Office of Administration.

[47 FR 38676, Sept. 2, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 31610, Aug. 21, 1987; 
54 FR 53316, Dec. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 10.34  Action by the Commission.

    (a) Whenever, under the provisions of Sec. 10.28(i), (j), or (l) an 
individual has not been afforded an opportunity to confront and cross-
examine witnesses who have furnished information adverse to the 
individual and an adverse recommendation has been made by the Executive 
Director for Operations, the Commission shall review the record and 
determine whether access authorization and/or employment clearance shall 
be granted, denied, or revoked, based upon the record.
    (b) When the Commission determines to deny or revoke access 
authorization and/or employment clearance, the individual shall promptly 
be notified through the Director, Office of Administration, of its 
decision that access authorization and/or employment clearance is being 
denied or revoked and of its findings and conclusions with respect to 
each allegation contained in the notification letter for transmittal to 
the individual.
    (c) Nothing contained in these procedures shall be deemed to limit 
or affect the responsibility and powers of the Commission to deny or 
revoke access to Restricted Data or national security information if the 
security of the nation so requires. Such authority may not be delegated 
and may be exercised when the Commission determines that invocation of 
the procedures prescribed in this part is inconsistent with the national 
security. Such determination shall be conclusive.

[47 FR 38676, Sept. 2, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 31610, Aug. 21, 1987;

<R05>
Sec. 10.35  Reconsideration of cases.

    (a) Where, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Secs. 10.20 
through 10.34, the Executive Director for Operations or the Commission 
has made a determination granting access authorization and/or employment 
clearance to an individual, the individual's eligibility for access 
authorization and/or employment clearance shall be reconsidered only 
when subsequent to the time of that determination, new derogatory 
information has been received or the scope or sensitivity of the 
Restricted Data or national security information to which the individual 
has or will have access has significantly increased. All new derogatory 
information, whether resulting from the NRC's reinvestigation program or 
other sources, will be evaluated relative to an individual's continued 
eligibility in accordance with the procedures of this part.
    (b) Where, pursuant to these procedures, the Commission or Executive 
Director for Operations has made a determination denying or revoking 
access authorization and/or employment clearance to an individual, the 
individual's eligibility for access authorization and/or employment 
clearance may be reconsidered when there is a bona fide offer of 
employment and/or a bona fide need for access to Restricted Data or 
national security information and either material and relevant new 
evidence is presented, which the individual and his or her 
representatives are without fault in failing to present before, or there 
is convincing evidence of reformation or rehabilitation. Requests for 
reconsideration shall be submitted in writing to the Executive Director 
for Operations through the Director, Office of Administration. Such 
requests shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth in detail 
the information referred to above. The Executive Director for Operations 
shall cause the individual to be notified as to whether his or her 
eligibility for access authorization and/or employment clearance will be 
reconsidered and if so, the method

[[Page 227]]

by which such reconsideration will be accomplished.
    (c) Where access authorization and/or employment clearance has been 
granted to an individual by the Director, Division of Security, without 
recourse to the procedures set forth in Secs. 10.20 through 10.34, the 
individual's eligibility for access authorization and/or employment 
clearance shall be reconsidered only in a case where, subsequent to the 
granting of the access authorization and/or employment clearance, new 
derogatory information has been received or the scope or sensitivity of 
the Restricted Data or national security information, to which the 
individual has or will have access, has significantly increased. All new 
derogatory information, whether resulting from the NRC's reinvestigation 
program or other sources, will be evaluated relative to an individual's 
continued eligibility in accordance with the procedures of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 11.15  Application for special nuclear material access authorization.

    (a)(1) Application for special nuclear material access 
authorization, renewal, or change in level shall be filed by the 
licensee on behalf of the applicant with the Director, Division of 
Security, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. 
Applications for affected individuals employed on October 28, 1985, 
shall be submitted within 60 days of notification of Commission approval 
of the amended security plan.

[[Page 231]]

    (2) Licensees who wish to secure NRC-U or NRC-R special nuclear 
material access authorizations for individuals in possession of an 
active NRC Q or L access authorization or other security clearance 
granted by another Federal agency based on an equivalent investigation 
shall submit a ``Security Acknowledgement'' (NRC Form 176) and a 
``Request for Access Authorization'' (NRC Form 237). NRC will process 
these requests by verifying the data on an NRC cleared individual, or by 
contacting the Federal agency which granted the clearance, requesting 
certification of the security clearance, and determining the 
investigative basis and level of the clearance. Licensees may directly 
request the Federal agency which administered the security clearance, if 
other than NRC, to certify to the NRC that it has on file an active 
security clearance for an individual and to specify the investigative 
basis and level of the clearance.
    (b) Applications for special nuclear material access authorization 
for individuals, other than those qualifying under the provisions of 
Sec. 11.15(a)(2), must be made on forms supplied by the Commission, 
including:
    (1) Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86, Parts 1 and 2);
    (2) Two completed standard fingerprint cards (FD-258);
    (3) Security Acknowledgement (NRC Form 176);
    (4) Other related forms where specified in accompanying instruction 
(NRC-254); and
    (5) A statement by the employer, prospective employer, or contractor 
identifying the job to be assigned to or assumed by the individual and 
the level of authorization needed, justified by appropriate reference to 
the licensee's security plan.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this 
section, NRC-U and NRC-R special nuclear material access authorizations 
must be renewed every five years from the date of issuance. An 
application for renewal must be submitted at least 120 days before the 
expiration of the five year period and must include:
    (i) A statement by the licensee that at the time of application for 
renewal the individual's assigned or assumed job requires an NRC-U 
special nuclear material access authorization, justified by appropriate 
reference to the licensee's security plan;
    (ii) The questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86, Parts 1 and 
2);
    (iii) Two completed standard fingerprint cards (FD-258); and
    (iv) Other related forms specified in accompanying NRC instructions 
(NRC Form 254).
    (2) An exception to the time for submission of NRC-U special nuclear 
material access authorization renewal applications and the paperwork 
required is provided for those individuals who have a current and active 
DOE-Q access authorization and who are subject to DOE Reinvestigation 
Program requirements. For these individuals, the submission to DOE of 
the SF-86 pursuant to DOE Reinvestigation Program requirements 
(generally every five years) will satisfy the NRC renewal submission and 
paperwork requirements even if less than five years has passed since the 
date of issuance or renewal of the NRC-U access authorization. Any NRC-U 
special nuclear material access authorization renewed in response to 
provisions of this paragraph will not be due for renewal until the date 
set by DOE for the next reinvestigation of the individual pursuant to 
DOE's Reinvestigation Program.
    (3) An exception to the time for submission of NRC-R special nuclear 
material access authorization renewal applications and the paperwork 
required is provided for those individuals who have a current and active 
DOE-L or DOE-Q access authorization and who are subject to DOE 
Reinvestigation Program requirements. For these individuals, the 
submission to DOE of the SF-86 pursuant to DOE Reinvestigation Program 
requirements (generally every five years) will satisfy the NRC renewal 
submission and paperwork requirements even if less than five years has 
passed since the date of issuance or renewal of the NRC-R access 
authorization. Any NRC-R special nuclear material access authorization 
renewed pursuant to this paragraph will not be due for renewal until the 
date set by DOE for the next reinvestigation of the individual pursuant 
to DOE's Reinvestigation Program.

[[Page 232]]

    (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of 
this section, the period of time for the initial and each subsequent 
NRC-U or NRC-R renewal application to NRC may not exceed seven years. 
Any individual who is subject to the DOE Reinvestigation Program 
requirements but, for administrative or other reasons, does not submit 
reinvestigation forms to DOE within seven years of the previous 
submission, shall submit a renewal application to NRC using the forms 
prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section before the expiration of 
the seven year period.
    (d) If at any time, due to new assignment or assumption of duties, a 
change in special nuclear material access authorization level from NRC 
``R'' to ``U'' is required, the individual shall apply for a change of 
level of special nuclear material access authorization. The application 
must include a description of the new duties to be assigned or assumed, 
justified by appropriate reference to the licensee's security plan.
    (e)(1) Each application for special nuclear material access 
authorization, renewal, or change in level must be accompanied by the 
licensee's remittance, payable to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, according to the following schedule:


i. NRC-U requiring full field investigation.......................$3,800
ii. NRC-U requiring full field investigation (expedited processing) 
                                                                  $4,300
iii. NRC-U based on certification of comparable full field background 
investigation.....................................................\1\ $0
iv. NRC-U or R renewal...........................................\1\ $67
v. NRC-R........................................................\1\ $67.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ If the NRC determines, based on its review of available data, 
that a full field investigation is necessary, a fee of $3,800 will be 
assessed prior to the conduct of the investigation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

vi. NRC-R based on certification of comparable investigation.....\2\ $0.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ If the NRC determines, based on its review of available data, 
that a National Agency Check and Credit investigation is necessary, a 
fee of $67.00 will be assessed prior to the conduct of the 
investigation; however, if a full field investigation is deemed 
necessary by the NRC, based on its review of available data, a fee of 
$3,800 will be assessed prior to the conduct of the investigation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Material access authorization fees will be published each time 
the Office of Personnel Management notifies NRC of a change in the 
background investigation rate it charges NRC for conducting the 
investigation. Any such changed access authorization fees will be 
applicable to each access authorization request received upon or after 
the date of publication. Applications from individuals having current 
Federal access authorizations may be processed expeditiously at no cost, 
since the Commission may accept the certification of access 
authorizations and investigative data from other Federal government 
agencies which grant personnel access authorizations.
    (f)(1) Any Federal employee, employee of a contractor of a Federal 
agency, licensee, or other person visiting an affected facility for the 
purpose of conducting official business, who possesses an active NRC or 
DOE-Q access authorization or an equivalent Federal security clearance 
granted by another Federal agency (``Top Secret'') based on a comparable 
full field background investigation may be permitted, in accordance with 
Sec. 11.11, the same level of unescorted access that an NRC-U special 
nuclear material access authorization would afford.
    (2) Any Federal employee, employee of a contractor of a Federal 
agency, licensee, or other person visiting an affected facility for the 
purpose of conducting official business, who possesses an active NRC or 
DOE-L access authorization or an equivalent security clearance granted 
by another Federal agency (``Secret'') based on a background 
investigation or national agency check and credit investigation may be 
permitted, in accordance with Sec. 11.11, the same level of unescorted 
access that an NRC-R special nuclear material access authorization would 
afford. An NRC or DOE-L access authorization or an equivalent security 
clearance (``Secret''), based on a background investigation or national 
agency check, which was granted or being processed by another Federal 
agency prior to

Sec. 11.16  Cancellation of request for special nuclear material access authorization.

    When a request for an individual's access authorization is withdrawn 
or cancelled, the licensee shall notify the Chief, Personnel Security 
Branch, NRC Division of Security immediately, by telephone, so that the 
full field investigation or national agency check and credit 
investigation may be discontinued. The caller shall provide the full 
name and date of birth of the individual, the date of request, and the 
type of access authorization originally requested (``U'' or ``R''). The 
licensee shall promptly submit written confirmation of the telephone 
notification to the Personnel Security Branch, NRC Division of Security. 
A portion of the fee for the ``U'' special nuclear material access 
authorization may be refunded depending upon the status of the full 
field investigation at the time of withdrawal or cancellation.

  Criteria for Determining Eligibility for Access to, or Control Over, 
                        Special Nuclear Material


<R05>
Sec. 11.21  Application of the criteria.

    (a) The decision to grant or deny special nuclear material access 
authorization is a comprehensive, common-sense judgment, made after 
consideration of all the relevant information, favorable or unfavorable, 
that to grant or deny special nuclear material access authorization is 
or is not inimical to the common defense and security and is or is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest.
    (b) To assist in making these determinations, on the basis of all 
the information in a particular case, there are set forth in Sec. 10.11 
of this chapter a number of specific types of derogatory information. 
These criteria are not exhaustive but contain the principal types of 
derogatory information which in the opinion of the Commission create a 
question as to the individual's eligibility for special nuclear material 
access authorization. These criteria are subject to continuing review 
and may be revised from time to time as experience and circumstances may 
make desirable.
    (c) When the reports of investigation of an individual contain 
information reasonably falling within one or more of the classes of 
derogatory information listed in Sec. 10.11, it shall create a question 
as to the individual's eligibility for special nuclear material access 
authorization. In such cases, the application of the criteria shall be 
made in light of and with specific regard to whether the existence of 
such information supports a reasonable belief that the granting of a 
special nuclear material access authorization would be inimical to the 
common defense and security. The Director, Division of Security, may 
authorize the granting of special nuclear material access authorization 
on the basis of the information in the case or may authorize the conduct 
of an interview with the individual and, on the basis of such interview 
and such other investigation as the Director deems appropriate, may 
authorize the granting of special nuclear material access authorization. 
Otherwise, a question concerning the eligibility of an individual for 
special nuclear material access authorization shall be resolved in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in Secs. 10.20 through 10.38 of 
this chapter.
    (d) In resolving a question concerning the eligibility or continued 
eligibility of an individual for special nuclear material access 
authorization by action of the Hearing Examiner,<SUP>4 the following 
principle shall be applied by the Examiner: Where there are grounds 
sufficient to establish a reasonable belief as to the truth of the 
information regarded as substantially derogatory and when the existence 
of such information supports a reasonable belief that granting access 
would be inimical to the common defense and security, this shall be the 
basis for a recommendation for denying or revoking special

[[Page 234]]

nuclear material access authorization if not satisfactorily rebutted by 
the individual or shown to be mitigated by circumstance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>4 The function of the Hearing Examiner is described in Part 10 
of this chapter.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 12.101  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to state the regulatory requirements for 
award of attorney fees to eligible individuals and entities in certain 
administrative proceedings before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in 
implementation of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (EAJA), 
which provides for the award of attorney fees and other

[[Page 235]]

expenses to parties to ``adversary adjudications'', as defined in 5 
U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(C). In general, an ``adversary adjudication'' is an 
adjudication that is required by statute to be determined on the record 
after opportunity for hearing before an agency of the United States and 
in which the position of the agency, or any component of the agency, is 
presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an 
appearance and participates in the proceeding. However, some agency 
adjudications are expressly excluded from coverage by 5 U.S.C. 504 
(e.g., an adjudication for the purpose of granting or renewing a 
license) even though they fall within this general definition, and 
certain appeals before an agency board of contract appeals and Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act hearings conducted under 31 U.S.C. ch. 38 are 
expressly covered.
    An eligible party may receive an award in an adversary adjudication 
when the party prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's 
position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an 
award unjust. The regulations in this part describe the parties eligible 
for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how 
to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the 
Commission will use to make them.


<R05>
Sec. 12.102  When the EAJA applies.

    The EAJA applies to any covered adversary adjudication pending or 
commenced before the Commission on or after August 5, 1985.


<R05>
Sec. 12.103  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The EAJA applies to the following proceedings:
    (1) Hearings under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C. 
3801-12);
    (2) Any appeal of a decision made pursuant to section 6 of the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before an agency board of 
contract appeals as provided in section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607); 
and
    (3) Adversary adjudications conducted by the Commission pursuant to 
any other statutory provision that requires a proceeding before the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be so conducted as to fall within the 
meaning of ``adversary adjudication'' under 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(C).
    (b) The Commission's failure to identify a type of proceeding as an 
adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application 
by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the EAJA. Whether 
the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in 
proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the EAJA and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.


<R05>
Sec. 12.104  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the EAJA, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term ``party'' is defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions 
of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million 
and not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole

[[Page 236]]

owner of an unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the 
applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather 
than to business interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interests of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the 
applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.


<R05>
Sec. 12.105  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or a significant and 
discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of 
the Commission over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially 
justified. The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the 
position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the 
action or failure to act by the Commission upon which the adversary 
adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be 
made to a prevailing applicant because the Commission's position was 
substantially justified is on the Commission counsel.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 12.106  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this part may 
exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert witnesses. 
However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the 
attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, 
or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for these expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his 
or her customary fees for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated costs of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Other factors that bear on the value of the services provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the services does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of applicant's case.

[[Page 237]]


<R05>
Sec. 12.107  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special 
circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to 
handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt 
regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher 
than $75 per hour in some, or all of the types of proceedings covered by 
this part. The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for 
this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for 
rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees, in accordance 
with the requirements of 10 CFR 2.802. The petition should identify the 
rate the petitioner believes the Commission should establish and the 
types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also 
explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. Within 90 
days after the petition is filed, the Commission will determine whether 
it will initiate a rulemaking proceeding, deny the petition, or take 
other appropriate action on the petition. The Commission will act on the 
petition in accordance with 10 CFR 2.803.


<R05>
Sec. 12.108  Awards against other agencies.

    If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over 
another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding 
before the Commission and takes a position that is not substantially 
justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be 
made against that agency.


<R05>
Sec. 12.109  Decisionmaking authority.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission in a particular 
proceeding, each application under this part shall be assigned for 
decision to the official or decisionmaking body that entered the 
decision in the adversary adjudication. That official or decisionmaking 
body is referred to in this part as the ``adjudicative officer.''


<R04>
             Subpart B--Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 12.201  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the EAJA 
shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and 
identify the position of the Commission or other agency that the 
applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant 
is an individual, the application shall also state the number of 
employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of 
its organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) The applicant attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal 
Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, 
in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling 
from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
this section; or
    (2) The applicant states that it is a cooperative association as 
defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 
1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether, and 
in what amount, an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

[[Page 238]]


<R05>
Sec. 12.202  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 12.104(f) of this part) when the proceeding was 
initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative 
officer may require an applicant to file additional information to 
determine its eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a 
sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the 
information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is 
not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be 
served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant 
seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the 
proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information 
should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public 
record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the 
exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's 
established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act, 10 CFR part 
9, subpart A.


<R05>
Sec. 12.203  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project, or similar matter for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rates at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The adjudicative officer may require the 
applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, logs, or other substantiation 
for any fees or expenses claimed, pursuant to Sec. 12.306 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 12.204  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the date on 
which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or 
any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or 
voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable, both within the NRC 
and to the courts.
    (b) If after the filing of an application for an award, review or 
reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an 
applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees 
shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy. 
When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary 
adjudication to a court, no decision on an application for fees and 
other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be 
made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on 
the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally 
determined pursuant to the appeal.

[[Page 239]]


<R04>
           Subpart C--Procedures for Considering Applications


<R05>
Sec. 12.301  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, 
except as provided in Sec. 12.202(b) for confidential financial 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 12.302  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel 
representing the NRC against which an award is sought may file an answer 
to the application. Unless the NRC counsel requests an extension of time 
for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph 
(b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period 
may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
    (b) If the NRC counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon 
request by the NRC counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the NRC 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, the NRC counsel shall include 
with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 12.306.


<R05>
Sec. 12.303  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 12.306.


<R05>
Sec. 12.304  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and the NRC 
counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is 
served, or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not participate further in proceedings on the application 
unless the adjudicative officer determines that the public interest 
requires participation in order to permit full exploration of matters 
raised in the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 12.305  Settlement.

    The applicant and the NRC counsel may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the 
underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with the NRC's 
standard settlement procedure. If a prevailing party and the NRC's 
counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application 
has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed 
settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 12.306  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or the NRC counsel, or on the adjudicative officer's own initiative, the 
adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal 
conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to 
issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's 
eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery 
or an evidentiary hearing. Further proceedings shall be held only when 
necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the 
application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or 
not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be 
determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which 
is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses 
are sought.
    (b) A request that the adjudicative officer order further 
proceedings under this section shall specifically identify

[[Page 240]]

the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the 
additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.


<R05>
Sec. 12.307  Decision.

    (a) The adjudicative officer shall issue an initial decision on the 
application within 90 days after completion of proceedings on the 
application. If the adjudicative officer fails to issue an initial 
decision within 90 days, he or she shall notify the parties of the 
reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline.
    (b) The initial decision shall include written findings and 
conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing 
party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the 
amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also 
include, if at issue, findings on whether the NRC's position was 
substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the 
proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If 
the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the 
decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made 
among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 12.308  Agency review.

    (a) Either the applicant or the NRC counsel may seek review of the 
initial decision on the fee application, or the Commission may decide to 
review the decision on its own initiative, in accordance with the 
Commission's review procedures set out in 10 CFR 2.786. The filing of a 
petition for review is mandatory for a party to exhaust its 
administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. If neither the 
applicant nor NRC counsel seeks review and the Commission does not take 
review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application 
shall become a final decision of the NRC forty (40) days after it is 
issued.
    (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other part of 
the Commission's regulations, the initial decision shall be inoperative 
(i.e., the decision shall not be final and any award made shall not be 
paid) until the later of--
    (1) The expiration of the forty-day period provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section; or
    (2) If within the forty-day period provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section the Commission elects to review the decision, the Commission's 
issuance of a final decision on review of the initial decision.
    (c) Whether to review a decision on its own motion is a matter 
within the discretion of the Commission. If review is taken, the 
Commission will issue a final decision on the application or remand the 
application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 12.309  Judicial review.

    Judicial review of final agency decisions on awards may be sought as 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 12.310  Payment of award.

    An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the 
appropriate official of the paying agency a copy of the Commission's 
final decision granting the award, accompanied by a certification that 
the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States 
courts. Where the award is granted against the Commission, the applicant 
shall make the submission to the Director, Division of Accounting and 
Finance, Office of the Controller, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555. The NRC will pay the amount awarded to the 
applicant within 60 days.

Sec. 13.1  Basis and purpose.

such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or 
mitigating factors.

    (c) The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any

<R05>
Sec. 13.31  Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

    (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and 
assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should 
evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and 
should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the 
penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible

[[Page 252]]

costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need 
to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double 
damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.
    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those 
that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the 
amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the 
misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or 
statements) charged in the complaint:
    (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or 
statements;
    (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;
    (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the 
misconduct;
    (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or 
benefit falsely claimed;
    (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the 
misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of 
investigation;
    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the 
amount of the Government's loss;
    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national 
defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management 
of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact 
on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;
    (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or 
similar misconduct;
    (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
    (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the 
misconduct or in concealing it;
    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the 
defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or 
attempted to preclude such misconduct;
    (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an 
investigation of the misconduct;
    (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting 
other wrongdoers;
    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of 
the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent 
of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar 
transactions;
    (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, 
or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to 
have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a 
State, directly or indirectly; and
    (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the 
same or similar misconduct.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or 
the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given 
case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and 
assessments are imposed.


<R05>

    (a) The hearing may be held--
    (1) In any judicial district of the United States in which the

the ALJ.

respect to the location of the hearing.

Sec. 13.33  Witnesses.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony 
at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or 
affirmation.
    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the 
form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement 
must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address 
of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other 
parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. 
Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing 
and deposition transcripts

[[Page 253]]

shall be exchanged as provided in Sec. 13.22(a).
    (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and 
order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to--

ascertainment of the truth;
    (2) Avoid needless consumption of time; and
    (3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
    (d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-
examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the 
facts.
    (e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on 
matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or 
her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-
examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be 
conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading 
questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or 
a witness identified with an adverse party.
    (f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded 
so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule 
does not authorize exclusion of--
    (1) A party who is an individual;
    (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or 
employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated by 
the party's representative; or

to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the

Rules of Evidence where appropriate, e.g., to exclude unreliable 
evidence.
    (c) The ALJ shall exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.
    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, 
confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged 
under Federal law.
    (f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement shall be 
inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of

obtained following the hearing from the ALJ at a cost not to exceed the 
actual cost of duplication.
    (b) The transcript of testimony, exhibits and other evidence 
admitted at the hearing, and all papers and requests filed in the 
proceeding constitute the record for the decision by the ALJ and the 
authority head.
    (c) The record may be inspected and copied (upon payment of a 
reasonable fee) by anyone, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ pursuant 
to Sec. 13.24.


<R05>
Sec. 13.36  Post-hearing briefs.

    The ALJ may require the parties to file post-hearing briefs. In any

of fact and conclusions of law. The ALJ may permit the parties to file 
reply briefs.


<R05>

determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file a 
motion for reconsideration with the ALJ or a notice of appeal with the 
authority head. If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this 
paragraph, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the 
delay and shall set a new deadline.
    (d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the 
authority head, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision 
is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final 
decision of the authority head and shall be final and binding on the

    (f) If the ALJ denies a motion for reconsideration, the initial

the motion, unless the initial decision is timely appealed to the 
authority head in accordance with Sec. 13.39.
    (g) If the ALJ issues a revised initial decision, that decision 
shall constitute the final decision of the authority head and shall be 
final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued, unless it 
is timely appealed to the authority head in accordance with Sec. 13.39.


<R05>
Sec. 13.39  Appeal to authority head.

    (a) Any defendant who has filed a timely answer and who is

to raise the objection.
    (i) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the authority 
head that additional evidence not presented at each hearing is material

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 14.1  Scope of regulations.

    (a) The terms ``Nuclear Regulatory Commission'' and ``NRC'' as used

    (b) The regulations in this part supplement the Department of 
Justice's regulations in 28 CFR parts 14 and 15.

caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of 
the NRC while acting within the scope of his or her office or 
employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private 
person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of 
the place where the act or omission occurred.
    (d) These regulations also set forth the procedures when lawsuits 
are commenced against an employee of the NRC resulting from the

<R04>
              Subpart B--Filing Procedures and Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 14.11  Who may file a claim.

    (a) A claim for damage to or loss of property may be presented by 
the owner of the property interest which is the subject of the claim, 
his or her duly authorized agent, or his or her legal representative.
    (b) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured 
person, his or her duly authorized agent, or his or her legal 
representative.
    (c) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or 
administrator of the decedent's estate, or by any other person legally 
entitled to assert the claim under applicable State law.
    (d) A claim for loss wholly compensated by an insurer with the 
rights of a subrogee may be presented by the insurer. A claim for loss 
partially compensated by an insurer with the rights of a subrogee may be 
presented by the insurer or the insured individually, to the extent of 
their respective interests, or jointly. Whenever an insurer presents a 
claim asserting the rights of a subrogee, the insurer shall present with 
the claim appropriate evidence that the insurer has the rights of a 
subrogee.
    (e) If a claim is presented by an agent or legal representative that 
person shall:
    (1) Present the claim in the name of the claimant;
    (2) Sign the claim;
    (3) Show the title or legal capacity of the person signing the 
claim; and
    (4) Include with the claim evidence of his or her authority to 
present a claim on behalf of the claimant as agent, executor, 
administrator, parent, guardian, or other representative.


<R05>
Sec. 14.13  When is a claim presented to NRC.

    For purposes of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2672, a claim is 
presented when NRC receives from a claimant, or the claimant's duly 
authorized agent or legal representative, an executed Standard Form 95 
or other written notification of an incident. An executed Standard Form 
95 or written notification must be accompanied by a claim for money 
damages in a sum certain for damage to or loss of property, personal 
injury, or death alleged to have occurred by reason of the incident.


<R05>
Sec. 14.15  Where to present a claim to NRC.

    A claimant shall mail or deliver the claim to the office of 
employment of the NRC employee whose negligent or wrongful act or 
omission is alleged to have caused the loss or injury. If the office of 
employment is not known, the claimant shall file the claim with the 
Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555.

[47 FR 8983, Mar. 3, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 35999, Oct. 8, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 14.17  A claim must be presented to the appropriate agency.

    A claimant shall present the claim to the Federal agency whose 
activities

[[Page 258]]

gave rise to the claim. If a claim is erroneously presented to the NRC, 
the NRC shall transfer it to the appropriate agency, if the proper 
agency can be identified from the claim, and shall advise the claimant 
of the transfer. If transfer is not feasible, the NRC shall return the 
claim to the claimant. The fact of transfer does not, in itself, 
preclude further transfer, return of the claim to the claimant, or other 
appropriate disposition of the claim. A claim shall be presented, as 
required by 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), as of the date it is received by the 
appropriate agency.


<R05>
Sec. 14.19  When a claim is filed with more than one agency.

    (a) If the NRC and one or more other Federal agencies is or may be 
involved in the events giving rise to the claim, and if the claim is 
filed with the NRC, the NRC shall contact all other affected agencies in 
order to designate the single agency which will investigate and decide 
the merits of the claim.
    (1) In the event that an agreed upon designation cannot be made by 
the affected agencies, the Department of Justice will be consulted and 
will designate a primary agency to investigate and decide the merits of 
the claim. If the NRC is designated as the primary agency, it shall 
notify the claimant that all future correspondence concerning the claim 
shall be directed to the NRC.
    (2) All involved Federal agencies can agree either to conduct their 
own administrative reviews and to coordinate the results or to have the 
investigations conducted by the primary agency. In either event, the 
primary agency is responsible for the final determination of the claim.
    (b) A claimant presenting a claim arising from an incident to more 
than one agency should identify each agency to which the claim is 
submitted at the time each claim is presented. If a claim arising from 
an incident is presented to more than one Federal agency without any 
indication that more than one agency is involved, and any one of the 
concerned Federal agencies takes final action on that claim, the final 
action is conclusive on the claims presented to the other agencies in 
regard to the time required for filing suit set forth in 28 U.S.C. 
2401(b). However, if NRC, as a subsequently involved Federal agency, 
desires to take further action with a view towards settling the claim, 
the NRC may treat the matter as a request for reconsideration of the 
final denial under 10 CFR 14.39, unless suit has been filed in the 
interim, and advise the claimant of the action.


<R05>
Sec. 14.21  Filing a claim after an agency final denial.

    If, after a final denial by another agency, the claimant files with 
the NRC a claim arising out of the same incident on which the claim 
filed with the other agency was based, the submission of the claim to 
NRC will not toll the requirement of 28 U.S.C. 2401(b) that suit must be 
filed within six months of the final denial by the other agency, unless 
the other agency specifically and explicitly treats the submission to 
NRC as a request for reconsideration under 10 CFR 14.39 and advises the 
claimant of the action.


<R05>
Sec. 14.23  Evidence and information to be submitted.

    (a) Death. In support of a claim based on death, the claimant may be 
required to submit the following evidence or information:
    (1) An authenticated death certificate or other competent evidence 
showing cause of death, date of death, and age of decedent.
    (2) Decedent's employment or occupation at time of death, including 
his or her monthly or yearly salary or earnings (if any), and the 
duration of his or her last employment or occupation.
    (3) Full names, addresses, birth dates, kinship, and marital status 
of the decedent's survivors, including identification of those survivors 
who were dependent for support upon the decedent at the time of death.
    (4) Degree of support afforded by the decedent to each survivor 
dependent upon him or her for support at the time of death.
    (5) Decedent's general physical and mental condition before death.
    (6) Itemized bills for medical and burial expenses incurred by 
reason of the

[[Page 259]]

incident causing death, or itemized receipts of payment for these 
expenses.
    (7) If damages for pain and suffering prior to death are claimed, a 
physician's detailed statement specifying the injuries suffered, 
duration of pain and suffering, any drugs administered for pain, and the 
decedent's physical condition in the interval between injury and death.
    (8) Any other evidence or information which may have a bearing on 
either the responsibility of the United States for the death or the 
amount of damages claimed.
    (b) Personal injury. In support of a claim for personal injury, 
including pain and suffering, the claimant may be required to submit the 
following evidence or information:
    (1) A written report by the attending physician or dentist setting 
forth the nature and extent of the injury, nature and extent of 
treatment, any degree of temporary or permanent disability and 
prognosis, period of hospitalization, and any diminished earning 
capacity. In addition, the claimant may be required to submit to a 
physical or mental examination by a physician employed by the NRC or 
another Federal agency. The claimant may request in writing a copy of 
the report of the examining physician if the claimant has:
    (i) Furnished the report referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section on request; and
    (ii) Made or agrees to make available to the NRC all other reports 
of the claimant's physical or mental condition which have been or are 
made by any physician.
    (2) Itemized bills for medical, dental, and hospital expenses 
incurred, or itemized receipts of payment for these expenses.
    (3) If the prognosis reveals the necessity for future treatment, a 
statement of expected expenses for the treatment.
    (4) If a claim is made for loss of time from employment, a written 
statement from his or her employer showing actual time lost from 
employment, whether he or she is a full- or part-time employee, and 
wages or salary actually lost.
    (5) If a claim is made for loss of income and the claimant is self-
employed, documentary evidence showing the amount of earnings actually 
lost.
    (6) Any other evidence or information which may have a bearing on 
either the responsibility of the United States for the personal injury 
or the damages claimed.
    (c) Property damage. In support of a claim for damage to or loss of 
property, real or personal, the claimant may be required to submit the 
following evidence or information:
    (1) Proof of ownership of the property interest which is the subject 
of the claim.
    (2) A detailed statement of the amount claimed with respect to each 
item of property.
    (3) An itemized receipt of payment for necessary repairs or itemized 
written estimates of the cost of these repairs.
    (4) A statement listing date of purchase, purchase price, and 
salvage value, where repair is not economical.
    (5) Any other evidence or information which may have a bearing on 
either the responsibility of the United States for the injury to or loss 
of property or the damages claimed.


<R05>
Sec. 14.25  Amending a claim.

    The claimant may amend a claim presented in compliance with 10 CFR 
14.13 at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise 
of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). The claimant or his or 
her duly authorized agent or legal representative shall sign each 
amendment and submit it in writing. Upon the timely filing of an 
amendment to a pending claim, the agency shall have six months in which 
to make a final disposition of the claim as amended and the claimant's 
option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) does not accrue until six months after 
the filing of an amendment.


<R05>
Sec. 14.27  Time limit.

    The claimant shall furnish evidence and information of the types 
described in 10 CFR 14.23, to the extent reasonably practicable, when 
the claim is initially presented. If the claimant fails to furnish

<R05>
Sec. 14.35  Limitation on NRC's authority.

    (a) The NRC shall effect an award, compromise, or settlement of a 
claim hereunder in excess of $25,000 only with the prior written 
approval of the Attorney General or his designee. For the purposes of 
this paragraph, a principal claim and any derivative or subrogated claim 
are treated as a single claim.
    (b) The NRC may adjust, determine, compromise, or settle a claim

contribution from a third party and the NRC is unable to adjust the 
third party claim; or

will or may control the disposition of a related claim in which the 
amount to be paid may exceed $25,000.
    (c) The NRC may adjust, determine, compromise, or settle a claim 
under this part only after consultation with the Department of Justice 
if the NRC is informed or is otherwise aware that the United States, or 
an employee, agent, or cost-plus contractor of the United States, is 
involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of the same incident 
or transaction.
    (d) When Department of Justice approval or consultation is required

Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Department of Justice, in 
writing. The NRC shall ensure that the referral or request contains:
    (1) A short and concise statement of the facts and the reasons for 
the referral or request;

<R05>
Sec. 14.41  Payment of approved claims.

                   Subpart A--Application and Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 15.1  Application.

    (a) This part applies to claims for the payment of debts owed to the 
United States Government in the form of money or property and; unless a 
different procedure is specified in a statute, regulation, or contract; 
prescribes procedures by which the NRC--
    (1) Collects, compromises, suspends, and terminates collection 
actions for claims;
    (2) Determines and collects interest and other charges on these 
claims; and
    (3) Refers unpaid claims to the General Accounting Office (GAO) and 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation.
    (b) The following are examples of kinds of debts to which special 
statutory and administrative procedures apply:
    (1) A claim against an employee for erroneous payment of pay and 
allowances subject to waiver under 5 U.S.C. 5584 are covered by the 
provisions of 10 CFR part 16.
    (2) A claim against an applicant for, or a holder or former holder 
of, an NRC

[[Page 263]]

license involving the payment of civil penalties imposed by the NRC 
under 10 CFR 2.205.
    (3) A claim involved in a case pending before any Federal Contract 
Appeals Board or Grant Appeals Board. However, nothing in this part 
prevents negotiation and settlement of a claim pending before a Board.

<R05>
Sec. 15.2  Definitions.

    Administrative offset means withholding money payable by the United 
States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy 
a debt the person owes the United States Government.
    Claim and debt are used synonymously and interchangeably for the 
purposes of this part. These terms refer to money or property which has 
been determined by an appropriate NRC official to be owed to the United 
States by any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal 
agency.
    Delinquent. A debt is considered delinquent if it has not been paid 
by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment or 
applicable contractual agreement with the NRC unless other satisfactory 
payment arrangements have been made by that date. If the debtor fails to 
satisfy obligations under a payment agreement with the NRC after other 
payment arrangements have been made, the debt becomes a delinquent debt.
    License means any license, permit, or other approval issued by the 
Commission.
    Payment in full means payment of the total debt due the United 
States, including any interest, penalty, and administrative costs of 
collection assessed against the debtor.
    Salary offset means an administrative offset to collect a debt under 
5 U.S.C. 5514 by deduction(s) at one or more officially established pay 
intervals from the current pay account of an employee without his/her 
consent.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington DC 20555, ATTN: Docketing and 
Service Branch. Communications may be delivered in person to the 
Commission's offices located at 11555 Rockville Pike, One White Flint 
North, Rockville, Maryland 20852.


[55 FR 32377, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.5  Claims that are covered.

    (a) These procedures generally apply to any claim for payment of a 
debt which:
    (1) Results from activities of the NRC, including fees imposed under 
part 170 and part 171; or
    (2) Is referred to the NRC for collection.
    (b) These procedures do not apply to:
    (1) A claim based on a civil monetary penalty for violation of a 
licensing requirement unless Sec. 2.205 of this chapter provides 
otherwise;
    (2) A claim as to which there is an indication of fraud, the 
presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the 
debtor or any other party having an interest in the claim;
    (3) A claim based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the 
antitrust laws;
    (4) A tax claim, as to which differing exemptions, administrative 
considerations, enforcement considerations, and statutes apply.
    (5) A claim between Federal agencies; and
    (6) A claim once it becomes subject to salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 
5514. These claims are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 16.

<R05>
Sec. 15.7  Monetary limitation on NRC's authority.

    The NRC's authority to compromise a claim, or to terminate or 
suspend collection action on a claim covered by these procedures, is 
limited by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a) to claims that--

[[Page 264]]

    (a) Have not been referred to another Federal Agency, including the 
GAO, for further collection action; and
    (b) Do not exceed $20,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs (the monetary limitation).

[47 FR 7616, Feb. 22, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 32378, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.9  Omissions not a defense.

    (a) The failure of the NRC to include in this part any provision of 
the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR parts 101-105, does not 
prevent the NRC from applying these provisions.
    (b) A debtor may not use the failure of the NRC to comply with any 
provision of this part or of the Federal Claims Collections Standards as 
a defense.

[47 FR 7616, Feb. 22, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 32378, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.11  Conversion claims.

    These procedures are directed primarily to the recovery of money on 
behalf of the Government. The NRC may demand:
    (a) The return of specific property; or
    (b) Either the return of property or the payment of its value.


<R05>
Sec. 15.13  Subdivision of claims.

    The NRC shall consider a debtor's liability arising from a 
particular transaction or contract as a single claim in determining 
whether the claim is less than the monetary limitation for the purpose 
of compromising or suspending or terminating collection action. A claim 
may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary limitation established by 31 
U.S.C. 3711(a)(2) and Sec. 15.7.


[55 FR 32378, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R04>
             Subpart B--Administrative Collection of Claims


<R05>
Sec. 15.21  Written demands for payment.

    (a) The NRC shall make appropriate written demands upon the debtor 
for payment of money or the return of specific property in terms which 
specify:
    (1) The basis of the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to 
seek review within the NRC;
    (2) The amount claimed;
    (3) A description of any property which is to be returned by a date 
certain;
    (4) The date on which payment is to be made (which is normally the 
date the initial written demand letter statement was mailed or hand 
delivered, unless otherwise specified by contractual agreement, 
established by Federal statute or regulation, or agreed to under a 
payment agreement);
    (5) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs under 4 CFR 102.13;
    (6) The applicable policy for reporting the delinquent debt to 
consumer reporting agencies.
    (b) Unless a debtor is a current NRC employee, the NRC shall 
normally send three progressively stronger written demands at not more 
than 30-day intervals, unless circumstances indicate that alternative 
remedies better protect the Government's interest, that the debtor has 
explicitly refused to pay, or that sending a further demand is futile. 
Depending upon the circumstances of the particular case, the second and 
third demands may--
    (1) Offer or seek to confer with the debtor;
    (2) State the amount of the interest and penalties that will be 
added on a daily basis as well as the administrative costs that will be 
added to the debt until the debt is paid; and
    (3) State that the authorized collection procedures include any 
procedure authorized in this part including:
    (i) Contacts with the debtor's employer when the debtor is employed 
by the Federal Government or is a member of the military establishment 
or the Coast Guard;
    (ii) Possible referral of the debt to a private agency for 
collection;
    (iii) Possible reporting of the delinquent debt to consumer 
reporting agencies in accordance with the guidance and standards 
contained in 4 CFR 102.5 and the NRC procedures set forth in Sec. 15.26;
    (iv) The suspension or revocation of a license or other remedy under 
Sec. 15.29;
    (v) Installment payments possibly requiring security; and
    (vi) The right to refer the claim to the GAO or the DOJ for 
litigation.

[[Page 265]]

    (c) The NRC shall normally send only one written demand to a debtor 
who is a current NRC employee. The procedure described in Sec. 15.33 and 
10 CFR part 16 will be followed if full payment is not received either 
30 days from the date the initial written demand was mailed or hand 
delivered. If the NRC cannot obtain full payment by following the 
procedures described in Sec. 15.33 and 10 CFR part 16, the NRC may 
follow other collection procedures described in this subpart.
    (d) The failure to state in a letter of demand a matter described in 
Sec. 15.21 is not a defense for a debtor and does not prevent the NRC 
from proceeding with respect to that matter.

[47 FR 7616, Feb. 22, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 32378, Aug. 9, 1990; 56 
FR 51830, Oct. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 15.23  Telephone inquiries and investigations.

    (a) If a debtor has not responded to one or more written demands, 
the NRC shall make reasonable efforts by telephone to determine the 
debtor's intentions. If the debtor cannot be reached by telephone at the 
debtor's place of employment, the NRC may telephone the debtor at his or 
her residence between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
    (b) The NRC may undertake an investigation to locate a debtor if the 
whereabouts of a debtor is a problem, or if a debtor cannot be contacted 
by telephone.
    (c) The NRC, under 15 U.S.C. 1681(f), may obtain consumer credit 
information from private firms, including the name, address, former 
addresses, place of employment, and former places of employment of a 
debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 15.25  Personal interviews.

    (a) The NRC may seek an interview with the debtor at the offices of 
the NRC when--
    (1) A matter involved in the claim needs clarification;
    (2) Information is needed concerning the debtor's circumstances; or
    (3) An agreement for payment might be negotiated.
    (b) The NRC shall grant an interview with a debtor upon the debtor's 
request. The NRC will not reimburse a debtor's interview expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 15.26  Use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) In addition to assessing interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs under Sec. 15.37, the NRC may report a debt that has been 
delinquent for 90 days to a consumer reporting agency if all the 
conditions of this paragraph are met.
    (1) The debtor has not--
    (i) Paid or agreed to pay the debt under a written payment plan that 
has been signed by the debtor and agreed to by the NRC; or
    (ii) Filed for review of the debt under Sec. 15.26 (a)(2)(iv).
    (2) The NRC has included a notification in the third written demand 
(see Sec. 15.21(b)) to the individual debtor stating--
    (i) That the payment of the debt is delinquent;
    (ii) That, within not less than 60 days after the date of the 
notification, the NRC intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency 
that the individual debtor is responsible for the debt;
    (iii) The specific information to be disclosed to the consumer 
reporting agency; and
    (iv) That the debtor has a right to a complete explanation of the 
debt (if that has not already been given), to dispute information in NRC 
records about the debt, and to request reconsideration of the debt by 
administrative appeal or review of the debt.
    (3) The NRC has sent at least one written demand by either 
registered or certified mail with the notification described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) The NRC has reconsidered its initial decision on the debt when 
the debtor has requested a review under Sec. 15.26(a)(2)(iv).
    (5) The NRC has taken reasonable action to locate a debtor for whom 
the NRC does not have a current address to send the notification 
provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) If there is a substantial change in the condition or amount of 
the debt, the NRC shall--

[[Page 266]]

    (1) Promptly disclose that fact(s) to each consumer reporting agency 
to which the original disclosure was made;
    (2) Promptly verify or correct information about a debt on request 
of a consumer reporting agency for verification of information disclosed 
by the NRC; and,
    (3) Obtain assurances from the consumer reporting agency that the 
agency is complying with all applicable Federal, state and local laws 
relating to its use of consumer credit information.
    (c) The information the NRC discloses to the consumer reporting 
agency is limited to--
    (1) Information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual debtor, including name, address, and taxpayer identification 
number;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
    (3) The NRC activity under which the debt arose.

[55 FR 32378, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.27  Contact with debtor's employing agency.

    If the debtor is employed by the Federal government or is a member 
of the military establishment or the Coast Guard, collection by offset 
must be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and the provisions 
of 10 CFR part 16.

[56 FR 51830, Oct. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 15.29  Suspension or revocation of license.

    The NRC may suspend or revoke any license or approval which the NRC 
has granted to the debtor for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated 
failure of the debtor to pay a delinquent debt. Before suspending or 
revoking any license or approval for failure to pay a debt, the NRC 
shall issue to the debtor (by either registered or certified mail) an 
order or a demand for information as to why the license or other 
privilege should not be suspended or revoked. The NRC shall allow the 
debtor no more than 30 days to pay the debt in full, including 
applicable interest, penalties, and administrative costs of collection 
of the delinquent debt. The NRC may suspend or revoke the license or 
approval at the end of this period. If a license is revoked under 
authority of this part, a new application, with appropriate fees, must 
be made to the NRC. The NRC may not consider an application unless all 
previous delinquent debts of the debtor to the NRC have been paid in 
full.

[57 FR 4153, Feb. 4, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 15.31  Disputed debts.

    (a) A debtor who disputes a debt shall explain why the debt is 
incorrect in fact or in law within 30 days from the date that the 
initial demand letter was mailed or hand-delivered. The debtor may 
support the explanation by affidavits, cancelled checks, or other 
relevant evidence.
    (b) If the debtor's arguments appear to have merit, the NRC may 
extend the interest waiver period as described in Sec. 15.37(j) pending 
a final determination of the existence or amount of the debt.
    (c) The NRC may investigate the facts involved in the dispute and, 
if it considers it necessary, arrange for a conference at which the 
debtor may present evidence and any arguments in support of the debtor's 
position.

[47 FR 76716, Feb. 22, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 32379, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.32  Contracting for collection services.

    The NRC may contract for collection services in order to recover 
delinquent debts. However, the NRC retains the authority to resolve 
disputes, compromise claims, suspend or terminate collection action, and 
initiate enforced collection through litigation. When appropriate, the 
NRC shall contract for collection services in accordance with the 
guidance and standards contained in 4 CFR 102.6.

[55 FR 32379, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.33  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) The NRC may administratively undertake collection by offset on 
each claim which is liquidated or certain in amount in accordance with 
the guidance and standards contained in 4 CFR 102.2, 102.3, and 102.4 
and 5 U.S.C. 5514,

[[Page 267]]

as applicable. The NRC may not initiate administrative offset to collect 
a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to the debt first 
accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the 
debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known to the NRC 
or collection of ``approval'' fees has been deferred under 10 CFR part 
170. If the collection of ``approval'' fees has been deferred, the ten-
year period begins to run at the end of the deferral period.
    (b) Collection by administrative offset of amounts payable from the 
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Federal Employees 
Retirement System or other similar funds is made pursuant to 4 CFR 102.4 
and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Salary offset is governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and the provisions of 
10 CFR part 16.
    (d) The following procedures apply when the NRC seeks to collect a 
debt by offset against any payment to be made to a debtor or against the 
assets of a licensee.
    (1) Before the offset is made, the NRC shall provide the debtor with 
a written notice of the nature and amount of the debt and--
    (i) Notice of the NRC's intent to collect the debt by offset;
    (ii) An opportunity to inspect and copy NRC records pertaining to 
the debt;
    (iii) An opportunity to request reconsideration of the debt by the 
NRC or, if provided for by statute, waiver of the debt;
    (iv) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the NRC 
to repay or pay the debt, as the case may be;
    (v) An explanation of the debtor's rights under this subpart; and
    (vi) An opportunity for a hearing when required under the provisions 
of 4 CFR 102.3(c).
    (2) If the NRC learns that other agencies of the Federal government 
are holding funds payable to the debtor, the NRC shall provide the other 
agencies with written certification that the debt is owed to the NRC and 
that the NRC has complied with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.3. The NRC 
shall request that funds due the debtor which are necessary to offset 
the debt to the NRC be transferred to the NRC.
    (3) The NRC may accept a repayment or payment agreement, as 
appropriate, in lieu of offset, but will do so only after balancing the 
Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the 
debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its 
existence or amount, the NRC may accept a repayment or payment agreement 
in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish under sworn 
affidavit that offset would result in undue financial hardship or would 
be against equity and good conscience.
    (4) Administrative offset is not authorized with respect to--
    (i) Debts owed by any State or local government;
    (ii) Debts once they become subject to the salary offset provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 10 CFR part 16; or
    (iii) Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by 
administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by 
another statute.
    (5) The NRC reserves the right to take any other action in respect 
to offset as is permitted under 4 CFR 102.3.
    (e) The NRC shall make appropriate use of the cooperative efforts of 
other agencies, including use of the Army Holdup List, in effecting 
collections by offset. The Army Holdup List is a list of contractors 
indebted to the United States.

FR 51830, Oct. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 15.35  Payments.

    (a) Payment in full. The NRC shall make every effort to collect a 
claim in full before it becomes delinquent. If a claim is paid in one 
lump sum after it becomes delinquent, the NRC shall impose charges for 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs as specified in 
Sec. 15.37.
    (b) Payment in installments. If a debtor furnishes satisfactory 
evidence of inability to pay a claim in one lump sum, payment in regular 
installments may be arranged. Evidence may consist of a financial 
statement or a signed statement that the debtor's application for a loan 
to enable the debtor to pay the

[[Page 268]]

claim in full was rejected. Except for a claim described in 5 U.S.C. 
5514 and codified in 10 CFR part 16, all installment payment 
arrangements must be in writing and require the payment of interest, and 
administrative charges.
    (1) Installment note forms, including confess-judgment notes, may be 
used. The written installment agreement must contain a provision 
accelerating the debt payment in the event the debtor defaults. If the 
debtor's financial statement discloses the ownership of assets which are 
free and clear of liens or security interests, or assets in which the 
debtor owns an equity, the debtor may be asked to secure the payment of 
an installment note by executing a Security Agreement and Financing 
Statement transferring to the United States a security interest in the 
assets until the debt is discharged.
    (2) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a 
voluntary installment payment is to be applied among those debts, the 
NRC shall follow that designation. If the debtor does not designate the 
application of the payment, the NRC shall apply the payment to the 
various debts in accordance with the best interests of the United 
States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular 
case.
    (c) To whom payment is made. Payment of a debt is made by check, 
electronic transfer, draft, or money order payable to the United States 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and mailed or delivered to the Division of 
Accounting and Finance, Office of the Controller, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, unless payment is--
    (1) Made pursuant to arrangements with GAO or DOJ;
    (2) Ordered by a Court of the United States; or
    (3) Otherwise directed in any other part of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 15.37  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) The NRC shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs on debts owed to the United States Government in accordance with 
the guidance provided under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 
CFR 102.13 unless otherwise directed by statute, regulation, or 
contract.
    (b) Before assessing any charges on delinquent debts, the NRC shall 
mail or hand-deliver a written notice to the debtor explaining its 
requirements concerning these charges under 4 CFR 102.2 and 102.13.
    (c) Interest begins to accrue from the date on which the initial 
written demand, advising the debtor of the interest requirements, is 
first mailed or hand delivered to the debtor unless a different date is 
specified in a statute, regulation, or contract.
    (d) The NRC shall assess interest based upon the rate of the current 
value of funds to the United States Treasury (the Treasury tax and loan 
account rate) prescribed for the current quarter and published in the 
Federal Register and the Treasury Financial Manual Bulletins, unless a 
different rate is prescribed by statute, regulation, or contract.
    (e) Interest is computed only on the principal of the debt and the 
interest rate remains fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, unless 
a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new 
agreement.
    (f) The NRC shall assess against a debtor charges to cover 
administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt. 
Administrative costs may include costs incurred in obtaining a credit 
report or in using a private debt collector, to the extent they are 
attributable to the delinquency.
    (g) The NRC shall assess a penalty charge of 6 percent a year on any 
portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. The charge 
accrues retroactively to the date that the debt became delinquent.
    (h) Amounts received by the NRC as partial or installment payments 
are applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost 
charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.
    (i) The NRC shall waive collection of interest on the debt or any 
portion of the debt which is paid in full within 30

[[Page 269]]

days after the date on which interest began to accrue.
    (j) The NRC may waive interest during the period a debt disputed 
under Sec. 15.31 is under investigation or review by the NRC. However, 
this additional waiver is not automatic and must be requested before the 
expiration of the initial 30-day waiver period. The NRC may grant the 
additional waiver only when it finds merit in the explanation the debtor 
has submitted under Sec. 15.31.
    (k) The NRC may waive the collection of interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs if it finds that one or more of the following 
conditions exist:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the debt 
within a reasonable period of time;
    (2) Collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs will 
jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt;
    (3) The NRC is unable to enforce collection in full within a 
reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings; or
    (4) Collection would be against equity and good conscience or not in 
the best interests of the United States, including the situation in 
which an administrative offset or installment payment agreement is in 
effect.

Sec. 15.38  Use of credit reports.

    The NRC may institute a credit investigation of the debtor at any 
time following receipt of knowledge of the debt in order to aid NRC in 
making appropriate determinations as to:
    (a) The collection and compromise of a debt;
    (b) The collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs;
    (c) The use of administrative offset;
    (d) The use of other collection methods; and
    (e) The likelihood of collecting the debt.

[55 FR 32380, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.39  Bankruptcy claims.

    When the NRC receives information that a debtor has filed a petition 
in bankruptcy or is the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, it shall 
furnish information concerning the debt owed the United States to the 
appropriate United States Attorney to permit the filing of a claim.


<R04>
                    Subpart C--Compromise of a Claim


<R05>
Sec. 15.41  When a claim may be compromised.

    The NRC may compromise a claim not in excess of the monetary 
limitation if it has not been referred to GAO or to DOJ for litigation. 
Only the Comptroller General of the United States or designee may effect 
the compromise of a claim that arises out of an exception made by the 
GAO in the account of an accountable officer, including a claim against 
the payee, prior to its referral by GAO for litigation.

[55 FR 32380, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.43  Reasons for compromising a claim.

    A claim may be compromised for one or more of the reasons set forth 
below:
    (a) The full amount cannot be collected because:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable 
time; or
    (2) The debtor refuses to pay the claim in full and the Government 
is unable to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time by 
enforced collection proceedings.
    (b) There is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to 
prove its case in Court for the full amount claimed, either because of 
the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts.
    (c) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify the enforced 
collection of the full amount. The NRC shall apply this reason for 
compromise in accordance with the guidance in 4 CFR 103.4.
    (d) The NRC shall determine the debtor's inability to pay, the 
Government's ability to enforce collection, and the amounts which are 
acceptable in compromise in accordance with the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards, 4 CFR part 103.
    (e) Compromises payable in installments are discouraged, but, if 
necessary, must be in the form of a legally

[[Page 270]]

enforceable agreement for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness 
less sums paid thereon. The agreement also must provide that in the 
event of default--
    (1) The entire balance of the debt becomes immediately due and 
payable; and
    (2) The Government has the right to enforce any security interest.

[47 FR 7616, Feb. 22, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 32380, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.45  Restrictions on the compromise of a claim.

    (a) The NRC may not accept a percentage of a debtor's profits nor 
stock in a debtor corporation in compromise of a claim. In negotiating a 
compromise with a business concern, consideration is given to requiring 
a waiver of the tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights of 
the debtor.
    (b) If two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, 
collection action is not withheld against one debtor until the other or 
others pay their proportionate share. The amount of a compromise with 
one debtor is not considered a precedent or as morally binding in 
determining the amount which will be required from other debtors jointly 
and severally liable on the claim.

[47 FR 7616, Feb. 22, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 32380, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.47  Finality of a compromise.

    An offer of compromise must be in writing and signed by the debtor. 
An offer of compromise which is accepted by the NRC is final and 
conclusive on the debtor and on all officials, agencies, and courts of 
the United States, unless obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, the 
presentation of a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact.


<R04>
        Subpart D--Suspension or Termination of Collection Action


<R05>
Sec. 15.51  When collection action may be suspended or terminated.

    The NRC may suspend or terminate collection action on a claim not in 
excess of the monetary limitation, exclusive of interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments, if 
any, if it has not been referred to GAO or to DOJ for litigation.

[55 FR 32380, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.53  Reasons for suspending collection action.

    Collection action may be suspended temporarily:
    (a) When the debtor cannot be located after diligent efforts and 
there is reason to believe that future collection action may be 
sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the 
claim considering the size of the claim and the amount which may be 
realized on it; or
    (b) When the debtor owns no substantial equity in realty and is 
unable to make payments on the Government's claim or effect a compromise 
on it at the time but the debtor's future prospects justify retention of 
the claim for periodic review and action and:
    (1) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started 
anew; or
    (2) Future collection can be effected by offset notwithstanding the 
statute of limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 15.55  Reasons for terminating collection action.

    Collection action may be terminated:
    (a) When it becomes clear that the Government cannot collect or 
enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor having due 
regard for the judicial remedies available to the Government, the 
debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the 
debtor under State and Federal law;
    (b) When the debtor cannot be located, there is no security 
remaining to be liquidated, the applicable statute of limitations has 
run, and the prospects of collecting by offset notwithstanding the bar 
of the statute of limitations is too remote to justify retention of the 
claim; or
    (c) When it is likely that the cost of collection action will exceed 
the amount recoverable.

[[Page 271]]


<R05>
Sec. 15.57  Termination of collection action.

    Collection action shall be terminated:
    (a) Whenever it is determined that the claim is legally without 
merit; or
    (b) When it is determined that the evidence necessary to prove the 
claim cannot be produced or the necessary witnesses are unavailable and 
efforts to induce voluntary payments have been unavailing.


<R05>
Sec. 15.59  Transfer of a claim.

    The NRC may transfer a claim to the GAO for advice when there is 
doubt whether collection action should be suspended or terminated.


<R04>
                     Subpart E--Referral of a Claim


<R05>
Sec. 15.61  Prompt referral.

    (a) A claim which requires enforced collection action is referred to 
GAO or to DOJ for litigation. A referral is made as early as possible 
consistent with aggressive collection action and in any event well 
within the time required to bring a timely suit against the debtor. 
Ordinarily, referrals are made within one year of the NRC's final 
determination of the fact and the amount of the debt.
    (b) When the merits of the NRC's claim, the amount owed on the 
claim, or the propriety of acceptance of a proposed compromise, 
suspension, or termination of collection actions is in doubt, the NRC 
shall refer the matter to the GAO for resolution and instructions prior 
to proceeding with collection action and/or referral to DOJ for 
litigation.
    (c) The NRC may refer a claim to the GAO or the DOJ even though the 
termination of collection activity might otherwise be given 
consideration under Sec. 15.55(a) or (c) if:
    (1) A significant enforcement policy is involved in reducing a 
statutory penalty or forfeiture to judgment; or
    (2) Recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of 
administrative sanctions, such as suspension or revocation of a license 
or the privilege of participating in a Government sponsored program.
    (d) Once a claim has been referred to GAO or to DOJ under this 
subpart, the NRC shall refrain from having any contact with the debtor 
and shall direct the debtor to GAO or DOJ, as appropriate, when 
questions concerning the claim are raised by the debtor. The NRC shall 
immediately advise GAO or DOJ, as appropriate, of any payments by the 
debtor.

[47 FR 7616, Feb. 22, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 32380, Aug. 9, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15.65  Referral of a compromise offer.

    The NRC may refer a debtor's firm written offer of compromise which 
is substantial in amount to the GAO or to the DOJ if the NRC is 
uncertain whether the offer should be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 15.67  Referral to the Department of Justice.

    (a) Claims for which the gross original amount is over $100,000 must 
be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Claims for which the gross 
original amount is $100,000 or less must be referred to the United 
States Attorney in whose district the debtor can be found.
    (b) A claim of less than $600, exclusive of interest, is not 
referred for litigation unless:
    (1) Referral is important to a significant enforcement policy; or
    (2) The debtor not only has the clear ability to pay the claim but 
the Government can effectively enforce payment.
    (c) A claim on which the NRC holds a judgment is referred to the DOJ 
for further action if renewal of the judgment lien or enforced 
collection proceedings are justified under the criteria discussed in 
this part.
    (d) Claims must be referred to the Department of Justice in the 
manner prescribed by 4 CFR 105.2. Care must be taken to preserve all 
files, records, and exhibits on claims referred under paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section.

    (a) This part provides procedures for the collection by 
administrative offset of a Federal employee's salary without his/her 
consent to satisfy certain debts owed to the Federal Government. This 
part applies to all Federal employees who owe debts to the Nuclear

explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.
    (c) These procedures do not apply to any adjustment to pay arising 
out of an employee's selection of coverage or a change in coverage under 
a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the 
amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.
    (d) These procedures do not preclude the compromise, suspension, or 
termination of collection action where appropriate under the standards 
implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., 
4 CFR parts 101-105.
    (e) This part does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver 
of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716 
or in any way questioning the amount or validity of the debt by 
submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office. This 
part does not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to 
other statutory provisions applicable to the particular debt being 
collected.

agreeable to the NRC) to establish a schedule for the voluntary 
repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish 
a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset (4 CFR 102.2(e)). 
The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the 
NRC, and documented in the NRC's files;
    (7) The employee's right to a hearing conducted by an official

by the NRC (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, a hearing 
official not under the control of the head of the agency) if a petition 
is filed as prescribed in Sec. 16.9;
    (8) The methods and time period for petitioning for hearings;
    (9) A statement that the timely filing of a petition for a hearing 
will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;
    (10) A statement that a final decision on the hearing will be issued 
not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the 
hearing unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a 
delay in the proceedings;
    (11) A statement that knowingly false or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the employee to appropriate 
disciplinary procedures under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code

3731 of title 31, United States Code or other applicable statutory

<R05>
Sec. 16.9  Hearing.

    (a) Request for hearing. (1) An employee shall file a petition for a 
hearing in accordance with the instructions outlined in the creditor 
agency's notice of offset.
    (2) If the NRC is the creditor agency, a hearing may be requested by 
filing a written petition stating why the employee disputes the 
existence or amount of the debt or the repayment schedule if it was not 
established by written agreement between the employee and the NRC. The 
employee shall sign the petition and fully identify and explain with 
reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, 
which the employee believes support his or her position. The petition 
for a hearing must be received no later than fifteen (15) calendar days 
after receipt of the notice of offset unless the employee can show that 
the delay in meeting the deadline date was because of circumstances 
beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice of the 
time limit (unless otherwise aware of it).
    (b) Hearing procedures. (1) The hearing will be presided over by a 
hearing official arranged by NRC (an administrative law judge or, 
alternatively, a hearing official not under the supervision or control 
of the head of the agency.)
    (2) The hearing must conform to procedures contained in the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards 4 CFR 102.3(c). The burden is on the 
employee to demonstrate either that the existence or the amount of the 
debt is in error or that the terms of the repayment schedule would 
result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good 
conscience.
    (3) An employee is entitled to representation of his or her choice 
at any stage of the proceeding. NRC attorneys may not be provided as 
representatives for the debtor. The NRC will not compensate the debtor 
for representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel 
expenses, and costs for reproducing documents.


<R05>
Sec. 16.11  Written decision.

    (a) The hearing official will issue a written opinion no later than 
60 days after the hearing.
    (b) The written opinion must include:
    (1) A statement of the facts presented to demonstrate the nature and 
origin of the alleged debt;
    (2) The hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions;
    (3) The amount and validity of the debt; and
    (4) The repayment schedule, where appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 16.13  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    (a) The NRC as the creditor agency. When the NRC determines that an 
employee of another Federal agency owes

[[Page 275]]

a delinquent debt to the NRC, the NRC will, as appropriate:
    (1) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the 
employee;
    (2) Certify in writing that the employee owes the debt, the amount 
and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date the 
Government's right to collect the debt accrued, and that NRC procedures 
for salary offset implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the 
Office of Personnel Management;
    (3) If collection must be made in installments, the NRC must advise 
the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be 
collected in each installment;
    (4) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 
5514(a) and provide the dates on which action was taken unless the 
employee has consented to salary offset in writing or signed a statement 
acknowledging receipt of procedures required by law. The written consent 
or acknowledgment must be sent to the paying agency;
    (5) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the NRC must 
submit a debt claim containing the information specified in paragraphs 
(a) (2) through (4) of this section and an installment agreement (or 
other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable, to the 
employee's paying agency.
    (6) Upon receipt of notification that the employee has transferred 
to another agency before the debt is collected in full, the NRC will 
submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency so that 
collection can be resumed;
    (7) If the employee is in the process of separating, the NRC will 
submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in paragraphs (a) 
(2) through (5) of this section. The paying agency will certify any 
amounts already collected, notify the employee, and send a copy of the 
certification and notice of the employee's separation to the NRC. If the 
paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund or similar payments, it will certify to 
the agency responsible for making the payments that the employee owes a 
debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this part have 
been followed. The NRC will submit a properly certified claim to the 
agency responsible for making such payments so collection can be made.
    (8) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from 
the paying agency have been paid, the NRC may request, unless otherwise 
prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by 
administrative offset.
    (b) The NRC as the paying agency. (1) Upon receipt of a properly 
certified debt claim from another agency, the NRC will schedule 
deductions to begin at the next established pay interval. The employee 
must receive written notice indicating that the NRC has received a 
certified debt claim from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt, 
the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). 
The NRC may not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination 
of the validity or the amount of the certified claim.
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete debt claim from a creditor agency, 
the NRC will return the debt claim to the creditor agency with a notice 
that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, must 
be followed and a properly certified debt claim received before action 
will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.
    (3) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor 
agency has submitted its debt claim to the NRC and before the debt is 
collected completely, the NRC will certify the total amount collected. 
The NRC will furnish one copy of the certification to the employee. The 
NRC will furnish a copy to the creditor agency with notice of the 
employee's transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 16.15  Procedures for salary offset.

    (a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method 
and in the amount stated in the NRC's notice of intention to offset as 
provided in Sec. 16.7. Debts will be collected in one lump sum where 
possible. If the employee is financially unable to pay in

[[Page 276]]

one lump sum, collection must be made in installments.
    (b) Debts will be collected by deduction at officially established 
pay intervals from an employee's current pay account unless alternative 
arrangements for repayment are made.
    (c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment 
deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt 
and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction for the pay intervals 
for any period may not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee 
has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.
    (d) Offset against any subsequent payment due an employee who 
retires or resigns or whose employment or period of active duty ends 
before collection of the debt is completed is provided for in accordance 
with 31 U.S.C. 3716. These payments include but are not limited to final 
salary payment or lump-sum leave due the employee from the paying agency 
as of the date of separation to the extent necessary to liquidate the 
debt.


<R05>
Sec. 16.17  Refunds.

    (a) The NRC will refund promptly any amounts deducted to satisfy 
debts owed to the NRC when the debt is waived, found not owed to the 
NRC, or when directed by an administrative or Judicial order.
    (b) The creditor agency will promptly return any amounts deducted by 
NRC to satisfy debts owed to the creditor agency when the debt is 
waived, found not owed, or when directed by an administrative or 
judicial order.
    (c) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under 
this section may not bear interest.

Sec. 19.14   Presence of representatives of licensees and workers during inspections.

    (a) Each licensee shall afford to the Commission at all reasonable 
times opportunity to inspect materials, activities, facilities, 
premises, and records pursuant to the regulations in this chapter.
    (b) During an inspection, Commission inspectors may consult 
privately with workers as specified in Sec. 19.15. The licensee or 
licensee's representative may accompany Commission inspectors during 
other phrases of an inspection.
    (c) If, at the time of inspection, an individual has been authorized 
by the workers to represent them during Commission inspections, the 
licensee shall notify the inspectors of such authorization and shall 
give the workers' representative an opportunity to accompany the 
inspectors during the inspection of physical working conditions.
    (d) Each workers' representative shall be routinely engaged in 
licensed activities under control of the licensee and shall have 
received instructions as specified in Sec. 19.12.
    (e) Different representatives of licensees and workers may accompany 
the inspectors during different phases of an inspection if there is no 
resulting interference with the conduct of the inspection. However, only 
one workers' representative at a time may accompany the inspectors.
    (f) With the approval of the licensee and the workers' 
representative an individual who is not routinely engaged in licensed 
activities under control of the license, for example, a consultant to 
the licensee or to the workers' representative, shall be afforded the 
opportunity to accompany Commission inspectors during the inspection of 
physical working conditions.
    (g) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, Commission 
inspectors are authorized to refuse to permit accompaniment by any 
individual who deliberately interferes with a fair and orderly 
inspection. With regard to areas containing information classified by an 
agency of the U.S. Government in the interest of national security, an 
individual who accompanies an inspector may have access to such 
information only if authorized to do so. With regard to any area 
containing proprietary information, the workers' representative for that 
area shall be an individual previously authorized by the licensee to 
enter that area.


<R05>
Sec. 19.15   Consultation with workers during inspections.

    (a) Commission inspectors may consult privately with workers 
concerning matters of occupational radiation protection and other 
matters related to applicable provisions of Commission regulations and 
licenses to the extent the inspectors deem necessary for the conduct of 
an effective and thorough inspection.
    (b) During the course of an inspection any worker may bring 
privately to the attention of the inspectors, either orally or in 
writing, any past or present condition which he has reason to believe 
may have contributed to or caused any violation of the act, the 
regulations in this chapter, or license condition, or any unnecessary 
exposure of an individual to radiation from licensed radioactive 
material under the licensee's control. Any such notice in writing shall 
comply with the requirements of Sec. 19.16(a).
    (c) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall not be 
interpreted as authorization to disregard instructions pursuant to 
Sec. 19.12.


<R05>
Sec. 19.16   Requests by workers for inspections.

    (a) Any worker or representative of workers who believes that a 
violation of the Act, the regulations in this chapter, or license 
conditions exists or has occurred in license activities with regard to 
radiological working conditions in which the worker is engaged, may 
request an inspection by giving notice of the alleged violation to the 
Administrator of the appropriate Commission Regional Office, or to 
Commission inspectors. Any such notice shall

[[Page 281]]

be in writing, shall set forth the specific grounds for the notice, and 
shall be signed by the worker or representative of workers. A copy shall 
be provided the licensee by the Regional Office Administrator, or the 
inspector no later than at the time of inspection except that, upon the 
request of the worker giving such notice, his name and the name of 
individuals referred to therein shall not appear in such copy or on any 
record published, released or made available by the Commission, except 
for good cause shown.
    (b) If, upon receipt of such notice, the Regional Office 
Administrator determines that the complaint meets the requirements set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and that there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the alleged violation exists or has occurred, he 
shall cause an inspection to be made as soon as practicable, to 
determine if such alleged violation exists or has occurred. Inspections 
pursuant to this section need not be limited to matters referred to in 
the complaint.

[38 FR 22217, Aug. 17, 1973, as amended at 40 FR 8783, Mar. 3, 1975; 47

<R05>
Sec. 19.17   Inspections not warranted; informal review.

    (a) If the Administrator of the appropriate Regional Office 
determines, with respect to a complaint under Sec. 19.16, that an 
inspection is not warranted because there are no reasonable grounds to 
believe that a violation exists or has occurred, he shall notify the 
complainant in writing of such determination. The complainant may obtain 
review of such determination by submitting a written statement of 
position with the Executive Director for Operation, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, who will provide the 
licensee with a copy of such statement by certified mail, excluding, at 
the request of the complainant, the name of the complainant. The 
licensee may submit an opposing written statement of position with the 
Executive Director for Operations who will provide the complainant with 
a copy of such statement by certified mail. Upon the request of the 
complainant, the Executive Director for Operations or his designee may 
hold an informal conference in which the complainant and the licensee 
may orally present their views. An informal conference may also be held 
at the request of the licensee, but disclosure of the identity of the 
complainant will be made only following receipt of written authorization 
from the complainant. After considering all written and oral views 
presented, the Executive Director for Operations shall affirm, 
modifying, or reverse the determination of the Administrator of the 
appropriate Regional Office and furnish the complainant and the licensee 
a written notification of his decision and the reason therefor.
    (b) If the Administrator of the appropriate Regional Office 
determines that an inspection is not warranted because the requirements 
of Sec. 19.16(a) have not been met, he shall notify the complainant in 
writing of such determination. Such determination shall be without 
prejudice to the filing of a new complaint meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 19.16(a).

[38 FR 22217, Aug. 17, 1973, as amended at 40 FR 8783, Mar. 3, 1975; 52

Sec. 19.18  Sequestration of witnesses and exclusion of counsel in interviews conducted under subpoena.

    (a) All witnesses compelled by subpoena to submit to agency 
interviews shall be sequestered unless the official conducting the 
interviews permits otherwise.
    (b) Any witness compelled by subpoena to appear at an interview 
during an agency inquiry may be accompanied, represented, and advised by 
counsel of his or her choice. However, when the agency official 
conducting the inquiry determines, after consultation with the Office of 
the General Counsel, that the agency has concrete evidence that the 
presence of an attorney representing multiple interests would obstruct 
and impede the investigation or inspection, the agency official may 
prohibit that counsel from being present during the interview.
    (c) The interviewing official is to provide a witness whose counsel 
has been excluded under paragraph (b) of this section and the witness's 
counsel a written statement of the reasons supporting the decision to 
exclude. This

[[Page 282]]

statement, which must be provided no later than five working days after 
exclusion, must explain the basis for the counsel's exclusion. This 
statement must also advise the witness of the witness' right to appeal 
the exclusion decision and obtain an automatic stay of the effectiveness 
of the subpoena by filing a motion to quash the subpoena with the 
Commission within five days of receipt of this written statement.
    (d) Within five days after receipt of the written notification 
required in paragraph (c) of this section, a witness whose counsel has 
been excluded may appeal the exclusion decision by filing a motion to 
quash the subpoena with the Commission. The filing of the motion to 
quash will stay the effectiveness of the subpoena pending the 
Commission's decision on the motion.
    (e) If a witness' counsel is excluded under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the interview may, at the witness' request, either proceed 
without counsel or be delayed for a reasonable period of time to permit 
the retention of new counsel. The interview may also be rescheduled to a 
subsequent date established by the NRC, although the interview shall not 
be rescheduled by the NRC to a date that precedes the expiration of the 
time provided under Sec. 19.18(d) for appeal of the exclusion of 
counsel, unless the witness consents to an earlier date.

<R05>
Sec. 20.1001  Purpose.

    (a) The regulations in this part establish standards for protection 
against ionizing radiation resulting from activities conducted under 
licenses issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These regulations 
are issued under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the 
Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended.
    (b) It is the purpose of the regulations in this part to control the 
receipt, possession, use, transfer, and disposal of licensed material by 
any licensee in such a manner that the total dose to an individual 
(including doses resulting from licensed and unlicensed radioactive 
material and from radiation sources other than background radiation) 
does not exceed the standards for protection against radiation 
prescribed in the regulations in this part. However, nothing in this 
part shall be construed as limiting actions that may be necessary to 
protect health and safety.


<R05>
Sec. 20.1002  Scope.

    The regulations in this part apply to persons licensed by the 
Commission to receive, possess, use, transfer, or dispose of byproduct, 
source, or special nuclear material or to operate a production or 
utilization facility under parts 30 through 36, 39, 40, 50, 60, 61, 70, 
or 72 of this chapter, and in accordance with 10 CFR 76.60 to persons 
required to obtain a certificate of compliance or an approved compliance 
plan under part 76 of this chapter. The limits in this part do not apply 
to doses due to background radiation, due to any medical administration 
the individual has received, or due to voluntary participation in 
medical research programs.

radionuclide in air which, if breathed by the reference man for a 
working year of 2,000 hours under conditions of light work (inhalation 
rate 1.2 cubic meters of air per hour), results in an intake of one ALI. 
DAC values are given in Table 1, Column 3, of appendix B to

absorbed dose (e.g., rads and grays) are appropriate, rather than units 
of dose equivalent (e.g., rems and sieverts)).

Sec. 20.1004  Units of radiation dose.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this part, the units of radiation dose 
are:
    Gray (Gy) is the SI unit of absorbed dose. One gray is equal to an 
absorbed dose of 1 Joule/kilogram (100 rads).
    Rad is the special unit of absorbed dose. One rad is equal to an 
absorbed dose of 100 ergs/gram or 0.01 joule/kilogram (0.01 gray).
    Rem is the special unit of any of the quantities expressed as dose 
equivalent. The dose equivalent in rems is equal to the absorbed dose in 
rads multiplied by the quality factor (1 rem=0.01 sievert).
    Sievert is the SI unit of any of the quantities expressed as dose 
equivalent. The dose equivalent in sieverts is equal to the absorbed 
dose in grays multiplied by the quality factor (1 Sv=100 rems).
    (b) As used in this part, the quality factors for converting 
absorbed dose to dose equivalent are shown in table 1004(b).1.

    (c) If it is more convenient to measure the neutron fluence rate 
than to determine the neutron dose equivalent rate in rems per hour or 
sieverts per hour, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 1 rem 
(0.01 Sv) of neutron radiation of unknown energies may, for purposes of 
the regulations in this part, be assumed to result from a total fluence 
of 25 million neutrons per square centimeter incident upon the body. If 
sufficient information exists to estimate the approximate energy 
distribution of the neutrons, the licensee may use the fluence rate per 
unit dose equivalent or the appropriate Q value from table 1004(b).2 to 
convert a measured tissue dose in rads to dose equivalent in rems.

Sec. 20.1101  Radiation protection programs.

    (a) Each licensee shall develop, document, and implement a radiation 
protection program commensurate with the scope and extent of licensed 
activities and sufficient to ensure compliance with the provisions of 
this part. (See Sec. 20.2102 for recordkeeping requirements relating to 
these programs.)
    (b) The licensee shall use, to the extent practicable, procedures 
and engineering controls based upon sound radiation protection 
principles to achieve occupational doses and doses to members of the 
public that are as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA).
    (c) The licensee shall periodically (at least annually) review the 
radiation protection program content and implementation.
    (d) To implement the ALARA requirements of Sec. 20.1101 (b), and 
notwithstanding the requirements in Sec. 20.1301 of this part, a 
constraint on air emissions of radioactive material to the environment, 
excluding Radon-222 and its daughters, shall be established by licensees 
other than those subject to Sec. 50.34a, such that the individual member 
of the public likely to receive the highest dose will not be expected to 
receive a total effective dose equivalent in excess of 10 mrem (0.1 mSv) 
per year from these emissions. If a licensee subject to this requirement 
exceeds this dose constraint, the licensee shall report the exceedance 
as provided in Sec. 20.2203 and promptly take appropriate corrective 
action to ensure against recurrence.

Sec. 20.1201  Occupational dose limits for adults.

    (a) The licensee shall control the occupational dose to individual 
adults, except for planned special exposures under Sec. 20.1206, to the 
following dose limits.
    (1) An annual limit, which is the more limiting of--
    (i) The total effective dose equivalent being equal to 5 rems (0.05 
Sv); or
    (ii) The sum of the deep-dose equivalent and the committed dose 
equivalent to any individual organ or tissue other than the lens of the 
eye being equal to 50 rems (0.5 Sv).
    (2) The annual limits to the lens of the eye, to the skin, and to 
the extremities, which are:
    (i) An eye dose equivalent of 15 rems (0.15 Sv), and
    (ii) A shallow-dose equivalent of 50 rems (0.50 Sv) to the skin or 
to any extremity.
    (b) Doses received in excess of the annual limits, including doses 
received during accidents, emergencies, and planned special exposures, 
must be subtracted from the limits for planned special exposures that 
the individual may receive during the current year (see 
Sec. 20.1206(e)(1)) and during the individual's lifetime (see 
Sec. 20.1206(e)(2)).
    (c) The assigned deep-dose equivalent and shallow-dose equivalent 
must be for the part of the body receiving the highest exposure. The 
deep-dose equivalent, eye dose equivalent and shallow-dose equivalent 
may be assessed from surveys or other radiation measurements for the 
purpose of demonstrating compliance with the occupational dose limits, 
if the individual monitoring device was not in the region of highest 
potential exposure, or the results of individual monitoring are 
unavailable.
    (d) Derived air concentration (DAC) and annual limit on intake (ALI) 
values are presented in table 1 of appendix B to part 20 and may be used 
to determine the individual's dose (see Sec. 20.2106) and to demonstrate 
compliance with the occupational dose limits.
    (e) In addition to the annual dose limits, the licensee shall limit 
the soluble uranium intake by an individual to 10 milligrams in a week 
in consideration of chemical toxicity (see footnote 3 of appendix B to 
part 20).
    (f) The licensee shall reduce the dose that an individual may be 
allowed to receive in the current year by the amount of occupational 
dose received while employed by any other person (see Sec. 20.2104(e)).

Sec. 20.1202  Compliance with requirements for summation of external and internal doses.

    (a) If the licensee is required to monitor under both 
Secs. 20.1502(a) and (b), the licensee shall demonstrate compliance with 
the dose limits by summing external and internal doses. If the licensee 
is required to monitor only under Sec. 20.1502(a) or only under 
Sec. 20.1502(b), then summation is not required to demonstrate 
compliance with the dose limits. The licensee may demonstrate compliance 
with the requirements for summation of external and internal doses by 
meeting one of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section 
and the conditions in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

    (Note: The dose equivalents for the lens of the eye, the skin, and 
the extremities are not included in the summation, but are subject to 
separate limits.)

    (b) Intake by inhalation. If the only intake of radionuclides is by 
inhalation, the total effective dose equivalent limit is not exceeded if 
the sum of the deep-dose equivalent divided by the total effective dose 
equivalent limit, and one of the following, does not exceed unity:
    (1) The sum of the fractions of the inhalation ALI for each 
radionuclide, or
    (2) The total number of derived air concentration-hours (DAC-hours) 
for all radionuclides divided by 2,000, or
    (3) The sum of the calculated committed effective dose equivalents 
to all significantly irradiated\1\ organs or tissues (T) calculated from 
bioassay data using appropriate biological models

[[Page 294]]

and expressed as a fraction of the annual limit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ An organ or tissue is deemed to be significantly irradiated if, 
for that organ or tissue, the product of the weighting factor, w<INF>T, 
and the committed dose equivalent, H<INF>T,50, per unit intake is 
greater than 10 percent of the maximum weighted value of H<INF>T,50, 
(i.e., W<INF>T H<INF>T,50) per unit intake for any organ or tissue.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Intake by oral ingestion. If the occupationally exposed 
individual also receives an intake of radionuclides by oral ingestion 
greater than 10 percent of the applicable oral ALI, the licensee shall 
account for this intake and include it in demonstrating compliance with 
the limits.
    (d) Intake through wounds or absorption through skin. The licensee 
shall evaluate and, to the extent practical, account for intakes through 
wounds or skin absorption.

    Note: The intake through intact skin has been included in the 
calculation of DAC for hydrogen-3 and does not need to be further 
evaluated.

Sec. 20.1203  Determination of external dose from airborne radioactive material.

    Licensees shall, when determining the dose from airborne radioactive 
material, include the contribution to the deep-dose equivalent, eye dose 
equivalent, and shallow-dose equivalent from external exposure to the 
radioactive cloud (see appendix B to part 20, footnotes 1 and 2).

    Note: Airborne radioactivity measurements and DAC values should not 
be used as the primary means to assess the deep-dose equivalent when the 
airborne radioactive material includes radionuclides other than noble 
gases or if the cloud of airborne radioactive material is not relatively 
uniform. The determination of the deep-dose equivalent to an individual 
should be based upon measurements using instruments or individual 
monitoring devices.

[56 FR 23396, May 21, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 20185, Apr. 25, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 20.1204  Determination of internal exposure.

    (a) For purposes of assessing dose used to determine compliance with 
occupational dose equivalent limits, the licensee shall, when required 
under Sec. 20.1502, take suitable and timely measurements of--
    (1) Concentrations of radioactive materials in air in work areas; or
    (2) Quantities of radionuclides in the body; or
    (3) Quantities of radionuclides excreted from the body; or
    (4) Combinations of these measurements.
    (b) Unless respiratory protective equipment is used, as provided in 
Sec. 20.1703, or the assessment of intake is based on bioassays, the 
licensee shall assume that an individual inhales radioactive material at 
the airborne concentration in which the individual is present.
    (c) When specific information on the physical and biochemical 
properties of the radionuclides taken into the body or the behavior or 
the material in an individual is known, the licensee may--
    (1) Use that information to calculate the committed effective dose 
equivalent, and, if used, the licensee shall document that information 
in the individual's record; and
    (2) Upon prior approval of the Commission, adjust the DAC or ALI 
values to reflect the actual physical and chemical characteristics of 
airborne radioactive material (e.g., aerosol size distribution or 
density); and
    (3) Separately assess the contribution of fractional intakes of 
Class D, W, or Y compounds of a given radionuclide (see appendix B to 
part 20) to the committed effective dose equivalent.
    (d) If the licensee chooses to assess intakes of Class Y material 
using the measurements given in Sec. 20.1204(a)(2) or (3), the licensee 
may delay the recording and reporting of the assessments for periods up 
to 7 months, unless otherwise required by Secs. 20.2202 or 20.2203, in 
order to permit the licensee to make additional measurements basic to 
the assessments.
    (e) If the identity and concentration of each radionuclide in a 
mixture are known, the fraction of the DAC applicable to the mixture for 
use in calculating DAC-hours must be either--
    (1) The sum of the ratios of the concentration to the appropriate 
DAC value (e.g., D, W, Y) from appendix B to part 20 for each radio-
nuclide in the mixture; or
    (2) The ratio of the total concentration for all radionuclides in 
the mixture to the most restrictive DAC value for any radionuclide in 
the mixture.
    (f) If the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture is known, but 
the

[[Page 295]]

concentration of one or more of the radionuclides in the mixture is not 
known, the DAC for the mixture must be the most restrictive DAC of any 
radionuclide in the mixture.
    (g) When a mixture of radionuclides in air exists, licensees may 
disregard certain radionuclides in the mixture if--
    (1) The licensee uses the total activity of the mixture in 
demonstrating compliance with the dose limits in Sec. 20.1201 and in 
complying with the monitoring requirements in Sec. 20.1502(b), and
    (2) The concentration of any radionuclide disregarded is less than 
10 percent of its DAC, and
    (3) The sum of these percentages for all of the radionuclides 
disregarded in the mixture does not exceed 30 percent.
    (h)(1) In order to calculate the committed effective dose 
equivalent, the licensee may assume that the inhalation of one ALI, or 
an exposure of 2,000 DAC-hours, results in a committed effective dose 
equivalent of 5 rems (0.05 Sv) for radionuclides that have their ALIs or 
DACs based on the committed effective dose equivalent.
    (2) When the ALI (and the associated DAC) is determined by the 
nonstochastic organ dose limit of 50 rems (0.5 Sv), the intake of 
radionuclides that would result in a committed effective dose equivalent 
of 5 rems (0.05 Sv) (the stochastic ALI) is listed in parentheses in 
table 1 of appendix B to part 20. In this case, the licensee may, as a 
simplifying assumption, use the stochastic ALIs to determine committed 
effective dose equivalent. However, if the licensee uses the stochastic 
ALIs, the licensee must also demonstrate that the limit in 
Sec. 20.1201(a)(1)(ii) is met.

conditions is satisfied--
    (a) The licensee authorizes a planned special exposure only in an 
exceptional situation when alternatives that might avoid the higher 
exposure are unavailable or impractical.
    (b) The licensee (and employer if the employer is not the licensee) 
specifically authorizes the planned special exposure, in writing, before 
the exposure occurs.
    (c) Before a planned special exposure, the licensee ensures that the 
individuals involved are--
    (1) Informed of the purpose of the planned operation;
    (2) Informed of the estimated doses and associated potential risks 
and specific radiation levels or other conditions that might be involved 
in performing the task; and
    (3) Instructed in the measures to be taken to keep the dose ALARA

    (d) Prior to permitting an individual to participate in a planned 
special exposure, the licensee ascertains prior doses as required by 
Sec. 20.2104(b) during the lifetime of the individual for each 
individual involved.
    (e) Subject to Sec. 20.1201(b), the licensee does not authorize a 
planned special exposure that would cause an individual to receive a 
dose from all planned special exposures and all doses in excess of the 
limits to exceed--
    (1) The numerical values of any of the dose limits in 
Sec. 20.1201(a) in any year; and
    (2) Five times the annual dose limits in Sec. 20.1201(a) during the 
individual's lifetime.
    (f) The licensee maintains records of the conduct of a planned 
special exposure in accordance with Sec. 20.2105 and submits a written 
report in accordance with Sec. 20.2204.
    (g) The licensee records the best estimate of the dose resulting 
from the planned special exposure in the individual's record and informs 
the individual, in writing, of the dose within 30 days from the date of 
the planned special exposure. The dose from planned special exposures is 
not to be considered in controlling future occupational dose of the 
individual under Sec. 20.1201(a) but is to be included in evaluations 
required by Sec. 20.1206 (d) and (e).

during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared 
pregnant woman, does not exceed 0.5 rem (5 mSv). (For recordkeeping 
requirements, see Sec. 20.2106.)
    (b) The licensee shall make efforts to avoid substantial variation 
above a uniform monthly exposure rate to a declared pregnant woman so as 
to satisfy the limit in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The dose to an embryo/fetus shall be taken as the sum of--
    (1) The deep-dose equivalent to the declared pregnant woman; and
    (2) The dose to the embryo/fetus from radionuclides in the embryo/
fetus and radionuclides in the declared pregnant woman.
    (d) If the dose to the embryo/fetus is found to have exceeded 0.5 
rem (5 mSv), or is within 0.05 rem (0.5 mSv) of this dose, by the time 
the woman declares the pregnancy to the licensee, the licensee shall be 
deemed to be in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section if the

    (a) The licensee shall ensure that each entrance or access point to 
a high radiation area has one or more of the following features--
    (1) A control device that, upon entry into the area, causes the 
level of radiation to be reduced below that level at which an individual 
might receive a deep-dose equivalent of 0.1 rem (1 mSv) in 1 hour at 30 
centimeters from the radiation source or from any surface that the

    (2) A control device that energizes a conspicuous visible or audible 
alarm signal so that the individual entering the high radiation area and 
the supervisor of the activity are made aware of the entry; or
    (3) Entryways that are locked, except during periods when access to 
the areas is required, with positive control over each individual entry.
    (b) In place of the controls required by paragraph (a) of this 
section for a high radiation area, the licensee may substitute 
continuous direct or electronic surveillance that is capable of 
preventing unauthorized entry.
    (c) A licensee may apply to the Commission for approval of 
alternative methods for controlling access to high radiation areas.
    (d) The licensee shall establish the controls required by paragraphs 
(a) and (c) of this section in a way that does not prevent individuals 
from leaving a high radiation area.
    (e) Control is not required for each entrance or access point to a 
room or other area that is a high radiation area solely because of the 
presence of radioactive materials prepared for transport and packaged 
and labeled in accordance with the regulations of the Department of 
Transportation provided that--
    (1) The packages do not remain in the area longer than 3 days; and
    (2) The dose rate at 1 meter from the external surface of any 
package does not exceed 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per hour.
    (f) Control of entrance or access to rooms or other areas in 
hospitals is not required solely because of the presence of patients 
containing radioactive material, provided that there are personnel in

Sec. 20.1703  Use of individual respiratory protection equipment.

    (a) If the licensee uses respiratory protection equipment to limit 
intakes pursuant to Sec. 20.1702--
    (1) The licensee shall use only respiratory protection equipment 
that is tested and certified or had certification extended by the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health/Mine Safety and 
Health Administration (NIOSH/MSHA).
    (2) If the licensee wishes to use equipment that has not been tested 
or certified by NIOSH/MSHA, has not had certification extended by NIOSH/
MSHA, or for which there is no schedule for testing or certification, 
the licensee shall submit an application for authorized use of that 
equipment, including a demonstration by testing, or a demonstration on 
the basis of reliable test information, that the material and 
performance characteristics of the equipment are capable of providing 
the proposed degree of protection under anticipated conditions of use.
    (3) The licensee shall implement and maintain a respiratory 
protection program that includes--
    (i) Air sampling sufficient to identify the potential hazard, permit 
proper equipment selection, and estimate exposures;
    (ii) Surveys and bioassays, as appropriate, to evaluate actual 
intakes;
    (iii) Testing of respirators for operability immediately prior to 
each use;
    (iv) Written procedures regarding selection, fitting, issuance, 
maintenance, and testing of respirators, including testing for 
operability immediately prior to each use; supervision and training of 
personnel; monitoring, including air sampling and bioassays; and 
recordkeeping; and
    (v) Determination by a physician prior to the initial fitting of 
respirators, and either every 12 months thereafter or periodically at a 
frequency determined by a physician, that the individual user is 
medically fit to use the respiratory protection equipment.
    (4) The licensee shall issue a written policy statement on 
respirator usage covering--
    (i) The use of process or other engineering controls, instead of 
respirators;
    (ii) The routine, nonroutine, and emergency use of respirators; and
    (iii) The periods of respirator use and relief from respirator use.
    (5) The licensee shall advise each respirator user that the user may 
leave the area at any time for relief from respirator use in the event 
of equipment malfunction, physical or psychological distress, procedural 
or communication failure, significant deterioration of operating 
conditions, or any other conditions that might require such relief.
    (6) The licensee shall use equipment within limitations for type and 
mode of use and shall provide proper visual, communication, and other 
special capabilities (such as adequate skin protection) when needed.
    (b) In estimating exposure of individuals to airborne radioactive 
materials, the licensee may make allowance for respiratory protection 
equipment used to limit intakes pursuant to Sec. 20.1702, provided that 
the following conditions, in addition to those in Sec. 20.1703(a), are 
satisfied:
    (1) The licensee selects respiratory protection equipment that 
provides a protection factor (see appendix A, part 20) greater than the 
multiple by which peak concentrations of airborne radioactive materials 
in the working area are expected to exceed the values specified in 
appendix B to part 20, Table 1, column 3. If the selection of a 
respiratory protection device with a protection factor greater than the 
multiple defined in the preceding sentence is inconsistent with the goal 
specified in Sec. 20.1702 of keeping the total effective dose equivalent 
ALARA, the licensee may select respiratory protection equipment with a 
lower protection

[[Page 300]]

factor only if such a selection would result in keeping the total 
effective dose equivalent ALARA. The concentration of radioactive 
material in the air that is inhaled when respirators are worn may be 
initially estimated by dividing the average concentration in air, during 
each period of uninterrupted use, by the protection factor. If the 
exposure is later found to be greater than estimated, the corrected 
value must be used; if the exposure is later found to be less than 
estimated, the corrected value may be used.
    (2) The licensee shall obtain authorization from the Commission

required by NRC Form 4 \4\. The form or record must show each period in 
which the individual received occupational exposure to radiation or 
radioactive material and must be signed by the individual who received 
the exposure. For each period for which the licensee obtains reports, 
the licensee shall use the dose shown in the report in preparing the NRC 
Form 4. For any period in which the licensee does not obtain a report, 
the licensee shall place a notation on the NRC Form 4 indicating the 
periods of time for which data are not available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Licensees are not required to partition historical dose between 
external dose equivalent(s) and internal committed dose equivalent(s). 
Further, occupational exposure histories obtained and recorded on NRC 
Form 4 before January 1, 1994, might not have included effective dose 
equivalent, but may be used in the absence of specific information on 
the intake of radionuclides by the individual.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) If the licensee is unable to obtain a complete record of an 
individual's current and previously accumulated occupational dose, the 
licensee shall assume--
    (1) In establishing administrative controls under Sec. 20.1201(f) 
for the current year, that the allowable dose limit for the individual 
is reduced by 1.25 rems (12.5 mSv) for each quarter for which records 
were unavailable and the individual was engaged in activities that could 
have resulted in occupational radiation exposure; and
    (2) That the individual is not available for planned special 
exposures.
    (f) The licensee shall retain the records on NRC Form 4 or 
equivalent until the Commission terminates each pertinent license 
requiring this record.

[[Page 308]]

The licensee shall retain records used in preparing NRC Form 4 for 3 
years after the record is made. This includes records required under the 
standards for protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 
1994.

  d.1. The protection factor is a measure of the degree of protection afforded by a respirator, defined as the  
  ratio of the concentration of airborne radioactive material outside the respiratory protective equipment to   
  that inside the equipment (usually inside the facepiece) under conditions of use. It is applied to the ambient
  airborne concentration to estimate the concentrations inhaled by the wearer according to the following        
  formula:                                                                                                      

  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02OC91.001
  
    2. The protection factors apply:
    (a) Only for individuals trained in using respirators and wearing 
properly fitted respirators that are used and maintained under 
supervision in a well-planned respiratory protective program.
    (b) For air-purifying respirators only when high efficiency 
particulate filters (above 99.97% removal efficiency by thermally 
generated 0.3 <greek-m>m dioctyl phthalate (DOP) test or equivalent) are 
used in atmospheres not deficient in oxygen and not containing 
radioactive gas or vapor respiratory hazards.
    (c) No adjustment is to be made for the use of sorbents against 
radioactive material in the form of gases or vapors.
    (d) For atmosphere-supplying respirators only when supplied with 
adequate respirable air. Respirable air shall be provided of the quality 
and quantity required in accordance with NIOSH/MSHA certification 
(described in 30 CFR part 11). Oxygen and air shall not be used in the 
same apparatus.
    (e) Excluding radioactive contaminants that present an absorption or 
submersion hazard. For tritium oxide, approximately one-third of the 
intake occurs by absorption through the skin so that an overall 
protection factor of less than 2 is appropriate when atmosphere-
supplying respirators are used to

[[Page 315]]

protect against tritium oxide. If the protection factor for a device is 
5 the effective protection factor for tritium is about 1.4; for devices 
with protection factors of 10 the effective factor for tritium oxide is 
about 1.7, and for devices with protection factors of 100 or more the 
effective factor for tritium oxide is about 1.9. Air-purifying 
respirators are not suitable for protection against tritium oxide. See 
also footnote i concerning supplied-air suits.
    (f) Canisters and cartridges shall not be used beyond service-life 
limitations.
    (g) Under-chin type only. This type of respirator is not 
satisfactory for use where it might be possible (e.g., if an accident or 
emergency were to occur) for the ambient airborne concentrations to 
reach instantaneous values greater than 10 times the pertinent values in 
table 1, column 3 of appendix B to Secs. 20.1001--20.2401 of this part. 
This type of respirator is not suitable for protection against plutonium 
or other high-toxicity materials. The mask is to be tested for fit prior 
to use, each time it is donned.
    (h)(1) Equipment shall be operated in a manner that ensures that 
proper air flow-rates are maintained. A protection factor of no more 
than 1000 may be utilized for tested-and-certified supplied-air hoods 
when a minimum air flow of 6 cubic feet (0.17 cubic meters) per minute 
is maintained and calibrated air-line pressure gauges or flow measuring 
devices are used. A protection factor of up to 2000 may be used for 
tested and certified hoods only when the air flow is maintained at the 
manufacturer's recommended maximum rate for the equipment, this rate is 
greater than 6 cubic feet (0.17 cubic meters) per minute, and calibrated 
air-line pressure gauges or flow measuring devices are used.
    (2) The design of the supplied-air hood or helmet (with a minimum 
flow of 6 cfm (0.17 m<SUP>3 per minute) of air) may determine its 
overall efficiency and the protection it provides. For example, some 
hoods aspirate contaminated air into the breathing zone when the wearer 
works with hands-over-head. This aspiration may be overcome if a short 
cape-like extension to the hood is worn under a coat or overalls. Other 
limitations specified by the approval agency shall be considered before 
using a hood in certain types of atmospheres (see footnote i).
    (i) Appropriate protection factors shall be determined, taking into 
account the design of the suit and its permeability to the contaminant 
under conditions of use. There shall be a standby rescue person equipped 
with a respirator or other apparatus appropriate for the potential 
hazards and communications equipment whenever supplied-air suits are 
used.
    (j) No approval schedules are currently available for this 
equipment. Equipment is to be evaluated by testing or on the basis of 
reliable test information.
    (k) This type of respirator may provide greater protection and be 
used as an emergency device in unknown concentrations for protection 
against inhalation hazards. External radiation hazards and other 
limitations to permitted exposure, such as skin absorption, must be 
taken into account in such circumstances.
    (l) Quantitative fit testing shall be performed on each individual 
and no more than 0.02% leakage is allowed with this type of apparatus. 
Perceptible outward leakage of gas from this or any positive pressure 
self-contained breathing apparatus is unacceptable because service life 
will be reduced substantially. Special training in the use of this type 
of apparatus shall be provided to the wearer.

    Note 1: Protection factors for respirators as may be approved by the 
U.S. Bureau of Mines/National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH), according to applicable approvals for respirators for 
type and mode of use to protect against airborne radionuclides, may be 
used to the extent that they do not exceed the protection factors listed 
in this table. The protection factors listed in this table may not be 
appropriate to circumstances where chemical or other respiratory hazards 
exist in addition to radioactive hazards. The selection and use of 
respirators for such circumstances should take into account applicable 
approvals of the U.S. Bureau of Mines/NIOSH.

    Note 2: Radioactive contaminants for which the concentration values 
in Table 1, Column 3 of Appendix B to Secs. 20.1001-20.2401 of this part 
are based on internal dose due to inhalation may, in addition, present 
external exposure hazards at higher concentrations. Under these 
circumstances, limitations on occupancy may have to be governed by 
external dose limits.

 Appendix B to Part 20--Annual Limits on Intake (ALIs) and Derived Air 
   Concentrations (DACs) of Radionuclides for Occupational Exposure; 
     Effluent Concentrations; Concentrations for Release to Sewerage

                              Introduction

    For each radionuclide Table 1 indicates the chemical form which is 
to be used for selecting the appropriate ALI or DAC value. The ALIs and 
DACs for inhalation are given for an aerosol with an activity median 
aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) of 1 <greek-m>m and for

[[Page 316]]

three classes (D,W,Y) of radioactive material, which refer to their 
retention (approximately days, weeks or years) in the pulmonary region 
of the lung. This classification applies to a range of clearance half-
times of less than 10 days for D, for W from 10 to 100 days, and for Y 
greater than 100 days. The class (D, W, or Y) given in the column headed 
``Class'' applies only to the inhalation ALIs and DACs given in Table 1, 
columns 2 and 3. Table 2 provides concentration limits for airborne and 
liquid effluents released to the general environment. Table 3 provides 
concentration limits for discharges to sanitary sewer systems.

                                Notation

    The values in Tables 1, 2, and 3 are presented in the computer ``E'' 
notation. In this notation a value of 6E-02 represents a value of 
6 x 10<SUP>-2 or 0.06, 6E+2 represents 6 x 10<SUP>2 or 600, and 6E+0 
represents 6 x 10<SUP>0 or 6.

                        Table 1 ``Occupational''

    Note that the columns in Table 1, of this appendix captioned ``Oral 
Ingestion ALI,'' ``Inhalation ALI,'' and ``DAC,'' are applicable to 
occupational exposure to radioactive material.
    The ALIs in this appendix are the annual intakes of a given 
radionuclide by ``Reference Man'' which would result in either (1) a 
committed effective dose equivalent of 5 rems (stochastic ALI) or (2) a 
committed dose equivalent of 50 rems to an organ or tissue (non-
stochastic ALI). The stochastic ALIs were derived to result in a risk, 
due to irradiation of organs and tissues, comparable to the risk 
associated with deep dose equivalent to the whole body of 5 rems. The 
derivation includes multiplying the committed dose equivalent to an 
organ or tissue by a weighting factor, w<INF>T. This weighting factor is 
the proportion of the risk of stochastic effects resulting from 
irradiation of the organ or tissue, T, to the total risk of stochastic 
effects when the whole body is irradiated uniformly. The values of 
w<INF>T are listed under the definition of weighting factor in 
Sec. 20.1003. The non-stochastic ALIs were derived to avoid non-
stochastic effects, such as prompt damage to tissue or reduction in 
organ function.
    A value of w<INF>T=0.06 is applicable to each of the five organs or 
tissues in the ``remainder'' category receiving the highest dose 
equivalents, and the dose equivalents of all other remaining tissues may 
be disregarded. The following parts of the GI tract--stomach, small 
intestine, upper large intestine, and lower large intestine--are to be 
treated as four separate organs.
    Note that the dose equivalents for extremities (hands and forearms, 
feet and lower legs), skin, and lens of the eye are not considered in 
computing the committed effective dose equivalent, but are subject to 
limits that must be met separately.
    When an ALI is defined by the stochastic dose limit, this value 
alone, is given. When an ALI is determined by the non-stochastic dose 
limit to an organ, the organ or tissue to which the limit applies is 
shown, and the ALI for the stochastic limit is shown in parentheses. 
(Abbreviated organ or tissue designations are used: LLI wall = lower 
large intestine wall; St. wall = stomach wall; Blad wall = bladder wall; 
and Bone surf = bone surface.)
    The use of the ALIs listed first, the more limiting of the 
stochastic and non-stochastic ALIs, will ensure that non-stochastic 
effects are avoided and that the risk of stochastic effects is limited 
to an acceptably low value. If, in a particular situation involving a 
radionuclide for which the non-stochastic ALI is limiting, use of that 
non-stochastic ALI is considered unduly conservative, the licensee may 
use the stochastic ALI to determine the committed effective dose 
equivalent. However, the licensee shall also ensure that the 50-rem dose 
equivalent limit for any organ or tissue is not exceeded by the sum of 
the external deep dose equivalent plus the internal committed dose to 
that organ (not the effective dose). For the case where there is no 
external dose contribution, this would be demonstrated if the sum of the 
fractions of the nonstochastic ALIs (ALI<INF>ns) that contribute to the 
committed dose equivalent to the organ receiving the highest dose does 
not exceed unity (i.e., <greek-S> (intake (in <greek-m>Ci) of each 
radionuclide/ALI<INF>ns) <1.0). If there is an external deep dose 
equivalent contribution of H<INF>d then this sum must be less than 
l-(H<INF>d/50) instead of being <1.0.
    The derived air concentration (DAC) values are derived limits 
intended to control chronic occupational exposures. The relationship 
between the DAC and the ALI is given by: DAC=ALI(in <greek-m>Ci)/(2000 
hours per working year x 60 minutes/hour x 2 x 10<SUP>4 ml per 
minute)=[ALI/2.4 x 10<SUP>9] <greek-m>Ci/ml, where 2 x 10<SUP>4 ml is 
the volume of air breathed per minute at work by ``Reference Man'' under 
working conditions of ``light work.''
    The DAC values relate to one of two modes of exposure: either 
external submersion or the internal committed dose equivalents resulting 
from inhalation of radioactive materials. Derived air concentrations 
based upon submersion are for immersion in a semi-infinite cloud of 
uniform concentration and apply to each radionuclide separately.
    The ALI and DAC values relate to exposure to the single radionuclide 
named, but also include contributions from the in-growth of any daughter 
radionuclide produced in the body by the decay of the parent. However, 
intakes that include both the parent and daughter radionuclides should 
be treated by the general method appropriate for mixtures.

[[Page 317]]

    The value of ALI and DAC do not apply directly when the individual 
both ingests and inhales a radionuclide, when the individual is exposed 
to a mixture of radionuclides by either inhalation or ingestion or both, 
or when the individual is exposed to both internal and external 
radiation (see Sec. 20.1202). When an individual is exposed to 
radioactive materials which fall under several of the translocation 
classifications (i.e., Class D, Class W, or Class Y) of the same 
radionuclide, the exposure may be evaluated as if it were a mixture of 
different radionuclides.
    It should be noted that the classification of a compound as Class D, 
W, or Y is based on the chemical form of the compound and does not take 
into account the radiological half-life of different radioisotopes. For 
this reason, values are given for Class D, W, and Y compounds, even for 
very short-lived radionuclides.

                                 Table 2

    The columns in Table 2 of this appendix captioned ``Effluents,'' 
``Air,'' and ``Water,'' are applicable to the assessment and control of 
dose to the public, particularly in the implementation of the provisions 
of Sec. 20.1302. The concentration values given in Columns 1 and 2 of 
Table 2 are equivalent to the radionuclide concentrations which, if 
inhaled or ingested continuously over the course of a year, would 
produce a total effective dose equivalent of 0.05 rem (50 millirem or 
0.5 millisieverts).
    Consideration of non-stochastic limits has not been included in 
deriving the air and water effluent concentration limits because non-
stochastic effects are presumed not to occur at the dose levels 
established for individual members of the public. For radionuclides, 
where the non-stochastic limit was governing in deriving the 
occupational DAC, the stochastic ALI was used in deriving the 
corresponding airborne effluent limit in Table 2. For this reason, the 
DAC and airborne effluent limits are not always proportional as was the 
case in appendix B to Secs. 20.1-20.601.
    The air concentration values listed in Table 2, Column 1, were 
derived by one of two methods. For those radionuclides for which the 
stochastic limit is governing, the occupational stochastic inhalation 
ALI was divided by 2.4 x 10<SUP>9 ml, relating the inhalation ALI to the 
DAC, as explained above, and then divided by a factor of 300. The factor 
of 300 includes the following components: a factor of 50 to relate the 
5-rem annual occupational dose limit to the 0.1-rem limit for members of 
the public, a factor of 3 to adjust for the difference in exposure time 
and the inhalation rate for a worker and that for members of the public; 
and a factor of 2 to adjust the occupational values (derived for adults) 
so that they are applicable to other age groups.
    For those radionuclides for which submersion (external dose) is 
limiting, the occupational DAC in Table 1, Column 3, was divided by 219. 
The factor of 219 is composed of a factor of 50, as described above, and 
a factor of 4.38 relating occupational exposure for 2,000 hours per year 
to full-time exposure (8,760 hours per year). Note that an additional 
factor of 2 for age considerations is not warranted in the submersion 
case.
    The water concentrations were derived by taking the most restrictive 
occupational stochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3 x 
10<SUP>7. The factor of 7.3 x 10<SUP>7 (ml) includes the following 
components: the factors of 50 and 2 described above and a factor of 7.3 
x 10<SUP>5 (ml) which is the annual water intake of ``Reference Man.''
    Note 2 of this appendix provides groupings of radionuclides which 
are applicable to unknown mixtures of radionuclides. These groupings 
(including occupational inhalation ALIs and DACs, air and water effluent 
concentrations and sewerage) require demonstrating that the most 
limiting radionuclides in successive classes are absent. The limit for 
the unknown mixture is defined when the presence of one of the listed 
radionuclides cannot be definitely excluded either from knowledge of the 
radionuclide composition of the source or from actual measurements.

                       Table 3 ``Sewer Disposal''

    The monthly average concentrations for release to sanitary sewers 
are applicable to the provisions in Sec. 20.2003. The concentration 
values were derived by taking the most restrictive occupational 
stochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3 x 10<SUP>6(ml). The 
factor of 7.3 x 10<SUP>6(ml) is composed of a factor of 7.3 x 
10<SUP>5(ml), the annual water intake by ``Reference Man,'' and a factor 
of 10, such that the concentrations, if the sewage released by the 
licensee were the only source of water ingested by a reference man 
during a year, would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 
0.5 rem.

\1\ The quantities listed above were derived by taking \1/10\th of the  
  most restrictive ALI listed in table 1, columns 1 and 2, of appendix B
  to Secs.  20.1001-20.2401 of this part, rounding to the nearest factor
  of 10, and arbitrarily constraining the values listed between 0.001   
  and 1,000 <greek-m>Ci. Values of 100 <greek-m>Ci have been assigned   
  for radionuclides having a radioactive half-life in excess of 10<SUP>9     
  years (except rhenium, 1000 <greek-m>Ci) to take into account their   
  low specific activity.                                                
Note: For purposes of Secs.  20.1902(e), 20.1905(a), and 20.2201(a)     
  where there is involved a combination of radionuclides in known       
  amounts, the limit for the combination should be derived as follows:  
  determine, for each radionuclide in the combination, the ratio between
  the quantity present in the combination and the limit otherwise       
  established for the specific radionuclide when not in combination. The
  sum of such ratios for all radionuclides in the combination may not   
  exceed ``1'' (i.e., ``unity'').

                    Appendix E to Part 20 [Reserved]

  Appendix F to Part 20--Requirements for Low-Level-Waste Transfer for 
           Disposal at Land Disposal Facilities and Manifests

                               I. Manifest

    The shipment manifest shall contain the name, address, and telephone 
number of the person generating the waste. The manifest shall also 
include the name, address, and telephone number or the name and EPA 
hazardous waste identification number of the person transporting the 
waste to the land disposal facility. The manifest must also indicate as 
completely as practical: a physical description of the waste, the 
volume, radionuclide identity and quantity, the total radioactivity, and 
the principal chemical form. The solidification agent must be specified. 
Waste containing more than 0.1% chelating agents by weight must be 
identified and the weight percentage of the chelating agent estimated. 
Wastes classified as Class A, Class B, or Class C in Sec. 61.55 of this 
chapter must be clearly identified as such in the manifest. The total 
quantity of the radionuclides \3\H, \14\C, \99\Tc, and \129\I must be 
shown. The manifest required by this paragraph may be shipping papers 
used to meet Department of Transportation or Environmental Protection 
Agency regulations or requirements of the receiver, provided all the 
required information is included. Copies of manifests required by this 
section may be legible carbon copies or legible photocopies.

                            II. Certification

    The waste generator shall include in the shipment manifest a 
certification that the transported materials are properly classified, 
described, packaged, marked, and labeled and are in proper condition for 
transportation according to the applicable regulations of the Department 
of Transportation and the Commission. An authorized representative of 
the waste generator shall sign and date the manifest.

                        III. Control and Tracking

    A. Any generating licensee who transfers radioactive waste to a land 
disposal facility or a licensed waste collector shall comply with the 
requirements in paragraphs A.1 through 8 of this section. Any generating 
licensee who transfers waste to a licensed waste processor who treats or 
repackages waste shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs A.4 
through 8 of this section. A licensee shall:
    1. Prepare all wastes so that the waste is classified according to 
Sec. 61.55 of this chapter and meets the waste characteristics 
requirements in Sec. 61.56 of this chapter;
    2. Label each package of waste to identify whether it is Class A 
waste, Class B waste, or Class C waste, in accordance with Sec. 61.55 of 
this chapter;
    3. Conduct a quality control program to ensure compliance with 
Secs. 61.55 and 61.56 of this chapter; the program must include 
management evaluation of audits;
    4. Prepare shipping manifests to meet the requirements of sections I 
and II of this appendix;
    5. Forward a copy of the manifest to the intended recipient, at the 
time of shipment, or deliver to a collector at the time the waste is 
collected, obtaining acknowledgment of receipt in the form of a signed 
copy of the manifest or equivalent documentation from the collector;
    6. Include one copy of the manifest with the shipment;
    7. Retain a copy of the manifest and documentation of 
acknowledgement of receipt as the record of transfer of licensed 
material as required by parts 30, 40, and 70 of this chapter. This 
includes those manifests and documents required under the standards for 
protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994; and
    8. For any shipments or any part of a shipment for which 
acknowledgment of receipt has not been received within the times set 
forth in this section, conduct an investigation in accordance with 
paragraph E of this appendix.
    B. Any waste collector licensee who handles only prepackaged waste 
shall:

[[Page 379]]

    1. Acknowledge receipt of the waste from the generator within 1 week 
of receipt by returning a signed copy of the manifest or equivalent 
documentation;
    2. Prepare a new manifest to reflect consolidated shipments; the new 
manifest shall serve as a listing or index for the detailed generator 
manifests. Copies of the generator manifests shall be a part of the new 
manifest. The waste collector may prepare a new manifest without 
attaching the generator manifests, provided the new manifest contains 
for each package the information specified in section I of this 
appendix. The collector licensee shall certify that nothing has been 
done to the waste that would invalidate the generator's certification;
    3. Forward a copy of the new manifest to the land disposal facility 
operator at the time of shipment;
    4. Include the new manifest with the shipment to the disposal site;
    5. Retain a copy of the manifest and documentation of 
acknowledgement of receipt as the record of transfer of licensed 
material as required by parts 30, 40, and 70 of this chapter, and retain 
information from generator manifest until the license is terminated. 
This includes those manifests and documents of acknowledgement of 
receipt required under the standards for protection against radiation in 
effect prior to January 1, 1994; and
    6. For any shipments or any part of a shipment for which 
acknowledgment of receipt is not received within the times set forth in 
this section, conduct an investigation in accordance with section III, E 
of this appendix.
    C. Any licensed waste processor who treats or repackages wastes 
shall:
    1. Acknowledge receipt of the waste from the generator within 1 week 
of receipt by returning a signed copy of the manifest or equivalent 
documentation;
    2. Prepare a new manifest that meets the requirements of sections I 
and II of this appendix. Preparation of the new manifest reflects that 
the processor is responsible for the waste;
    3. Prepare all wastes so that the waste is classified according to 
Sec. 61.55 of this chapter and meets the waste characteristics 
requirements in Sec. 61.56 of this chapter;
    4. Label each package of waste to identify whether it is Class A 
waste, Class B waste, or Class C waste, in accordance with Secs. 61.55 
and 61.57 of this chapter;
    5. Conduct a quality control program to ensure compliance with 
Secs. 61.55 and 61.56 of this chapter. The program shall include 
management evaluation of audits;
    6. Forward a copy of the new manifest to the disposal site operator 
or waste collector at the time of shipment, or deliver to a collector at 
the time the waste is collected, obtaining acknowledgment of receipt in 
the form of a signed copy of the manifest or equivalent documentation by 
the collector;
    7. Include the new manifest with the shipment;
    8. Retain copies of original manifests and new manifests and 
documentation of acknowledgement of receipt as the record of transfer of 
licensed material as required by parts 30, 40, and 70 of this chapter. 
This includes those manifests and documents of acknowledgement of 
receipt required under the standards for protection against radiation in 
effect prior to January 1, 1994; and
    9. For any shipment or part of a shipment for which acknowledgment 
is not received within the times set forth in this section, conduct an 
investigation in accordance with section III. E of this appendix.
    D. The land disposal facility operator shall:
    1. Acknowledge receipt of the waste within 1 week of receipt by 
returning a signed copy of the manifest or equivalent documentation to 
the shipper. The shipper to be notified is the licensee who last 
possessed the waste and transferred the waste to the operator. The 
returned copy of the manifest or equivalent documentation shall indicate 
any discrepancies between materials listed on the manifest and materials 
received;
    2. Maintain copies of all completed manifests or equivalent 
documentation until the license is terminated. This includes those 
manifests or equivalent documents required under the standards for 
protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994; and
    3. Notify the shipper (i.e., the generator, the collector, or 
processor) and the Administrator of the nearest Commission Regional 
Office listed in appendix D to this part when any shipment or part of a 
shipment has not arrived within 60 days after the advance manifest was 
received.
    E. Any shipment or part of a shipment for which acknowledgment is 
not received within the times set forth in this section must:
    1. Be investigated by the shipper if the shipper has not received 
notification or receipt within 20 days after transfer; and
    2. Be traced and reported. The investigation shall include tracing 
the shipment and filing a report with the nearest Commission Regional

     Appendix G to Part 20--Requirements for Transfers of Low-Level 
   Radioactive Waste Intended for Disposal at Licensed Land Disposal 
                        Facilities and Manifests

                               I. Manifest

    A waste generator, collector, or processor who transports, or offers 
for transportation, low-level radioactive waste intended for ultimate 
disposal at a licensed low-level radioactive waste land disposal 
facility must prepare a Manifest (OMB Control Numbers 3150-0164, -0165, 
and -0166) reflecting information requested on applicable NRC Forms 540 
(Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest (Shipping Paper)) and 541 
(Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest (Container and Waste 
Description)) and, if necessary, on an applicable NRC Form 542 (Uniform 
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest (Manifest Index and Regional 
Compact Tabulation)). NRC Forms 540 and 540A must be completed and must 
physically accompany the pertinent low-level waste shipment. Upon 
agreement between shipper and consignee, NRC Forms 541 and 541A and 542 
and 542A may be completed, transmitted, and stored in electronic media 
with the capability for producing legible, accurate, and complete 
records on the respective forms. Licensees are not required by NRC to 
comply with the manifesting requirements of this part when they ship:
    (a) LLW for processing and expect its return (i.e., for storage 
under their license) prior to disposal at a licensed land disposal 
facility;
    (b) LLW that is being returned to the licensee who is the ``waste 
generator'' or ``generator,'' as defined in this part; or
    (c) Radioactively contaminated material to a ``waste processor'' 
that becomes the processor's ``residual waste.''
    For guidance in completing these forms, refer to the instructions 
that accompany the forms. Copies of manifests required by this appendix 
may be legible carbon copies, photocopies, or computer printouts that 
reproduce the data in the format of the uniform manifest.
    NRC Forms 540, 540A, 541, 541A, 542 and 542A, and the accompanying 
instructions, in hard copy, may be obtained from the Information and 
Records Management Branch, Office of Information Resources Management, 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone 
(301) 415-7232.
    This appendix includes information requirements of the Department of 
Transportation, as codified in 49 CFR part 172. Information on 
hazardous, medical, or other waste, required to meet Environmental 
Protection Agency regulations, as codified in 40 CFR parts 259, 261 or 
elsewhere, is not addressed in this section, and must be provided on the 
required EPA forms. However, the required EPA forms must accompany the 
Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest required by this chapter.
    As used in this appendix, the following definitions apply:
    Chelating agent has the same meaning as that given in Sec. 61.2 of 
this chapter.
    Chemical description means a description of the principal chemical 
characteristics of a low-level radioactive waste.
    Computer-readable medium means that the regulatory agency's computer 
can transfer the information from the medium into its memory.
    Consignee means the designated receiver of the shipment of low-level 
radioactive waste.
    Decontamination facility means a facility operating under a 
Commission or Agreement State license whose principal purpose is 
decontamination of equipment or materials to accomplish recycle, reuse, 
or other waste management objectives, and, for purposes of this part, is 
not considered to be a consignee for LLW shipments.
    Disposal container means a container principally used to confine 
low-level radioactive waste during disposal operations at a land 
disposal facility (also see ``high integrity container''). Note that for 
some shipments, the disposal container may be the transport package.
    EPA identification number means the number received by a transporter 
following application to the Administrator of EPA as required by 40 CFR 
part 263.
    Generator means a licensee operating under a Commission or Agreement 
State license who (1) is a waste generator as defined in this part, or 
(2) is the licensee to whom waste can be attributed within the context 
of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (e.g., 
waste generated as a result of decontamination or recycle activities).
    High integrity container (HIC) means a container commonly designed 
to meet the structural stability requirements of Sec. 61.56 of this 
chapter, and to meet Department of Transportation requirements for a 
Type A package.
    Land disposal facility has the same meaning as that given in 
Sec. 61.2 of this chapter.
    NRC Forms 540, 540A, 541, 541A, 542, and 542A are official NRC Forms 
referenced in this appendix. Licensees need not use originals of these 
NRC Forms as long as any substitute forms are equivalent to the original 
documentation in respect to content, clarity, size, and location of 
information. Upon agreement between the shipper and consignee, NRC Forms 
541 (and 541A) and NRC Forms 542 (and 542A) may be completed, 
transmitted, and stored in electronic media.

[[Page 381]]

The electronic media must have the capability for producing legible, 
accurate, and complete records in the format of the uniform manifest.
    Package means the assembly of components necessary to ensure 
compliance with the packaging requirements of DOT regulations, together 
with its radioactive contents, as presented for transport.
    Physical description means the items called for on NRC Form 541 to 
describe a low-level radioactive waste.
    Residual waste means low-level radioactive waste resulting from 
processing or decontamination activities that cannot be easily separated 
into distinct batches attributable to specific waste generators. This 
waste is attributable to the processor or decontamination facility, as 
applicable.
    Shipper means the licensed entity (i.e., the waste generator, waste 
collector, or waste processor) who offers low-level radioactive waste 
for transportation, typically consigning this type of waste to a 
licensed waste collector, waste processor, or land disposal facility 
operator.
    Shipping paper means NRC Form 540 and, if required, NRC Form 540A 
which includes the information required by DOT in 49 CFR part 172.
    Source material has the same meaning as that given in Sec. 40.4 of 
this chapter.
    Special nuclear material has the same meaning as that given in 
Sec. 70.4 of this chapter.
    Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest or uniform manifest 
means the combination of NRC Forms 540, 541, and, if necessary, 542, and 
their respective continuation sheets as needed, or equivalent.
    Waste collector means an entity, operating under a Commission or 
Agreement State license, whose principal purpose is to collect and 
consolidate waste generated by others, and to transfer this waste, 
without processing or repackaging the collected waste, to another 
licensed waste collector, licensed waste processor, or licensed land 
disposal facility.
    Waste description means the physical, chemical and radiological 
description of a low-level radioactive waste as called for on NRC Form 
541.
    Waste generator means an entity, operating under a Commission or 
Agreement State license, who (1) possesses any material or component 
that contains radioactivity or is radioactively contaminated for which 
the licensee foresees no further use, and (2) transfers this material or 
component to a licensed land disposal facility or to a licensed waste 
collector or processor for handling or treatment prior to disposal. A 
licensee performing processing or decontamination services may be a 
``waste generator'' if the transfer of low-level radioactive waste from 
its facility is defined as ``residual waste.''
    Waste processor means an entity, operating under a Commission or 
Agreement State license, whose principal purpose is to process, 
repackage, or otherwise treat low-level radioactive material or waste 
generated by others prior to eventual transfer of waste to a licensed 
low-level radioactive waste land disposal facility.
    Waste type means a waste within a disposal container having a unique 
physical description (i.e., a specific waste descriptor code or 
description; or a waste sorbed on or solidified in a specifically 
defined media).

            E. Multi-Generator Disposal Container Information

    This section applies to disposal containers enclosing mixtures of 
waste originating from different generators. (Note: The origin of the 
LLW resulting from a processor's activities may be attributable to one 
or more ``generators'' (including ``waste generators'') as defined in 
this part). It also applies to mixtures of wastes shipped in an 
uncontainerized form, for which portions of the mixture within the 
shipment originate from different generators.
    1. For homogeneous mixtures of waste, such as incinerator ash, 
provide the waste description applicable to the mixture and the volume 
of the waste attributed to each generator.
    2. For heterogeneous mixtures of waste, such as the combined 
products from a large compactor, identify each generator contributing 
waste to the disposal container, and, for discrete waste types (i.e., 
activated materials, contaminated equipment, mechanical filters, sealed 
source/devices, and wastes in solidification/stabilization media), the 
identities and activities of individual radionuclides contained on these 
waste types within the disposal container. For each generator, provide 
the following:
    (a) The volume of waste within the disposal container;
    (b) A physical and chemical description of the waste, including the 
solidification agent, if any;

    An authorized representative of the waste generator, processor, or 
collector shall certify by signing and dating the shipment manifest that 
the transported materials are properly classified, described, packaged, 
marked, and labeled and are in proper condition for transportation 
according to the applicable regulations of the Department of 
Transportation and the Commission. A collector in signing the 
certification is certifying that nothing has been done to the collected 
waste which would invalidate the waste generator's certification.

its safety function necessary to assure:
    (A) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary;
    (B) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition; or
    (C) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents which could result in potential offsite exposures comparable 
to those referred to in Sec. 50.34(a)(1) or Sec. 100.11 of this chapter, 
as applicable.
    (ii) Basic components are items designed and manufactured under a 
quality assurance program complying with 10 CFR Part 50, appendix B, or 
commercial grade items which have successfully completed the dedication 
process.
    (2) When applied to other facilities and when applied to other 
activities licensed pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 50 (other than 
nuclear power plants), 60, 61, 70, 71, or 72 of this chapter, basic 
component means a structure, system, or component, or part thereof that 
affects their safety function, that is directly procured by the licensee 
of a facility or activity subject to the regulations in this part and in 
which a defect or failure to comply with any applicable regulation in 
this chapter, order, or license issued by the Commission could create a 
substantial safety hazard.
    (3) In all cases, basic component includes safety-related design, 
analysis, inspection, testing, fabrication, replacement of parts, or 
consulting services that are associated with the component hardware 
whether these services are performed by the component supplier or 
others.
    Commercial grade item. (1) When applied to nuclear power plants 
licensed pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, commercial grade item means a 
structure, system, or component, or part thereof that affects its safety 
function, that was not designed and manufactured as a basic component.

and evaluating deviations, reporting defects and failures to comply for 
the dedicated item, and maintaining auditable records of the dedication 
process.
    Dedication. (1) When applied to nuclear power plants licensed 
pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, dedication is an acceptance process 
undertaken to provide reasonable assurance that a commercial grade item 
to be used as a basic component will perform its intended safety 
function and, in this respect, is deemed equivalent to an item designed 
and manufactured under a 10 CFR Part 50, appendix B, quality assurance 
program. This assurance is achieved by identifying the critical 
characteristics of the item and verifying their acceptability by 
inspections, tests, or analyses performed by the purchaser or third-
party dedicating entity after delivery, supplemented as necessary by one 
or more of the following: commercial grade surveys; product inspections 
or witness at holdpoints at the manufacturer's facility, and analysis of 
historical records for acceptable performance. In all cases, the 
dedication process must be conducted in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of 10 CFR Part 50, appendix B. The process is considered 
complete when the item is designated for use as a basic component.

                          Access Authorizations


<R05>
Sec. 25.15  Access permitted under ``Q'' or ``L'' access authorization.

    (a) A ``Q'' access authorization permits an individual access on a 
need-to-know basis to (1) Secret and Confidential Restricted Data and 
(2) Secret and Confidential National Security Information including 
intelligence information, CRYPTO (i.e., cryptographic information) or 
other classified communications security (COMSEC) information.
    (b) An ``L'' access authorization permits an individual access on a 
need-to-know basis to Confidential Restricted Data and Secret and 
Confidential National Security Information other than the categories 
specifically included in paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, 
access to certain Confidential COMSEC information is permitted as 
authorized by a National Communications Security Committee waiver dated 
February 14, 1985.
    (c) Each employee of the Commission is processed for one of the two 
levels of access authorization. Licensees and other persons will furnish 
National Security Information and/or Restricted Data to a Commission 
employee on official business when the employee has the appropriate 
level of NRC access authorization and need-to-know. Some individuals are 
permitted to begin NRC employment without an access authorization. 
However, no NRC employee shall be permitted access to any classified 
information until the appropriate level of access authorization has been 
granted to that employee by NRC.

[45 FR 14481, Mar. 5, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 9195, Mar. 4, 1982; 50 
FR 36984, Sept. 11, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 25.17  Approval for processing applicants for access authorization.

    (a) Access authorizations shall be requested for licensee employees 
or other persons (e.g., 10 CFR part 2, subpart I) who need access to 
National Security Information and/or Restricted Data in connection with 
activities under parts 50, 70, or 72.
    (b) The request must include a completed personnel security packet 
(see Sec. 25.17(c)) and request form (NRC-237) signed by a licensee or 
licensee contractor official.
    (c)(1) Each personnel security packet submitted, must include the 
following completed forms:
    (i) Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86, parts 1 and 2);
    (ii) Two Standard fingerprint cards (FD-258);
    (iii) Security Acknowledgment (NRC Form 176); and
    (iv) Other related forms where specified in accompanying 
instructions (NRC-254).
    (2) Only a Security Acknowledgment (NRC Form 176) need be completed 
by any person possessing an active access authorization, or who is being 
processed for an access authorization, by another Federal agency. The 
active or pending access authorization must be at an equivalent level to 
that required by the NRC and be based on an adequate investigation not 
more than five years old.
    (d) To avoid delays in processing requests for access 
authorizations, each security packet should be reviewed for completeness 
and correctness (including legibility of response on the forms) prior to 
submittal.
    (e) Applications for access authorization or access authorization 
renewal processing must be accompanied by a check or money order, 
payable to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, representing 
the current cost for the processing of each ``Q'' and ``L'' access 
authorization, or renewal request. Access authorization and access 
authorization renewal fees will be published each time the Office of 
Personnel Management notifies NRC of a change in the rates it charges 
NRC for the conduct of investigations. Any such changed access 
authorization or access authorization renewal fees will

[[Page 395]]

be applicable to each access authorization or access authorization 
renewal request received upon or after the date of publication. 
Applications from individuals having current Federal access 
authorizations may be processed more expeditiously and at less cost, 
since the Commission may accept the certification of access 
authorization and investigative data from other Federal Government 
agencies that grant personnel access authorizations.

[45 FR 14481, Mar. 5, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 9195, Mar. 4, 1982; 48 
FR 24320, June 1, 1983; 53 FR 30830, Aug. 16, 1988; 57 FR 3720, Jan. 31, 
1992]


<R05>
Sec. 25.19  Processing applications.

    Each application for access authorization or access authorization 
renewal, together with its accompanying fee, must be submitted to the 
NRC Division of Security. If necessary, the NRC Division of Security may 
obtain approval from the appropriate Commission office exercising 
licensing or regulatory authority before processing the access 
authorization or access authorization renewal request. If the applicant 
is disapproved for processing, the NRC Division of Security shall notify 
the submitter in writing and return the original application (security 
packet) and its accompanying fee.

[57 FR 3720, Jan. 31, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 25.21  Determination of initial and continued eligibility for access authorization.

    (a) Following receipt by the NRC Division of Security of the reports 
of the personnel security investigations, the record will be reviewed to 
determine that granting an access authorization or renewal of access 
authorization will not endanger the common defense and security and is 
clearly consistent with the national interest. If such a determination 
is made, access authorization will be granted or renewed. Questions as 
to initial or continued eligibility will be determined in accordance 
with part 10 of chapter I.
    (b) The NRC Division of Security must be promptly notified of 
developments that bear on continued eligibility for access authorization 
throughout the period for which the authorization is active (e.g., 
persons who marry subsequent to the completion of a personnel security 
packet must report this change by submitting a completed NRC Form 354, 
``Data Report on Spouse'').
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, NRC 
``Q'' and ``L'' access authorizations must be renewed every five years 
from the date of issuance. An application for renewal must be submitted 
at least 120 days before the expiration of the five year period, and 
must include:
    (i) A statement by the licensee or other person that the individual 
continues to require access to classified National Security Information 
or Restricted Data; and
    (ii) A personnel security packet as described in Sec. 25.17(c).
    (2) Renewal applications and the paperwork required for renewal 
applications are not required for individuals who have a current and 
active access authorization from another Federal agency and who are 
subject to a reinvestigation program by that agency that is determined 
by NRC to meet NRC's requirements (the DOE Reinvestigation Program has 
been determined to meet NRC's requirements). For such individuals, the 
submission of the SF-86 by the licensee or other person to the other 
government agency pursuant to their reinvestigation requirements will 
satisfy the NRC renewal submission and paperwork requirements, even if 
less than five years has passed since the date of issuance or renewal of 
the NRC ``Q'' or ``L'' access authorization. Any NRC access 
authorization continued in response to the provisions of this paragraph 
will, thereafter, not be due for renewal until the date set by the other 
government agency for the next reinvestigation of the individual 
pursuant to the other agency's reinvestigation program. However, the 
period of time for the initial and each subsequent NRC ``Q'' or NRC 
``L'' renewal application to NRC may not exceed seven years. Any 
individual who is subject to the reinvestigation program requirements of 
another Federal agency but, for administrative or other reasons, does 
not submit reinvestigation forms to that agency within seven years of 
the previous submission, shall submit a renewal application to NRC

[[Page 396]]

using the forms prescribed in Sec. 25.17(c) before the expiration of the 
seven year period.

<R05>
Sec. 25.23  Notification of grant of access authorization.

    The determination to grant or renew access authorization will be 
furnished in writing to the licensee or organization that initiated the 
request. Upon receipt of the notification of original grant of access 
authorization, the licensee or organization shall obtain, as a condition 
for grant of access authorization and access to classified information, 
an executed ``Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement'' (SF-312) 
from the affected individual. The individual shall also be given a 
security orientation briefing in accordance with Sec. 95.33 of this 
chapter. The signed SF-312 must be promptly forwarded to the NRC 
Division of Security. Records of access authorization grant and renewal 
notification must be maintained by the licensee or other organization 
for three years after the access authorization has been terminated by 
the NRC Division of Security. This information may also be furnished to 
other representatives of the Commission, to licensees, contractors, or 
other Federal agencies. Notifications of access authorization will not 
be given in writing to the affected individual except:
    (a) In those cases in which the determination was made as a result 
of a Personnel Security Hearing or by Personnel Security Review 
Examiners, or
    (b) When the individual also is the official designated by the 
licensee to whom written NRC notifications are forwarded.

[57 FR 3721, Jan. 31, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 25.25  Cancellation of requests for access authorization.

    When a request for an individual's access authorization or renewal 
of access authorization is withdrawn or cancelled, the requestor shall 
notify the NRC Division of Security immediately by telephone so that the 
full field investigation, National Agency Check with Credit 
Investigation or other personnel security action may be discontinued. 
The requestor shall identify the full name and date of birth of the 
individual, the date of request, and the type of access authorization 
(``Q'' or ``L'') or access authorization renewal requested. The 
requestor shall confirm each telephone notification promptly in writing.

[57 FR 3721, Jan. 31, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 25.27  Reopening of cases in which requests for access authorizations are cancelled.

    (a) In conjunction with a new request for access authorization (NRC 
Form 237) for individuals whose cases were previously cancelled, new 
fingerprint cards (FD-257) in duplicate and a new Security 
Acknowledgment (NRC Form 176) must be furnished to the NRC Division of 
Security along with the request.
    (b) Additionally, if 90 days or more have elapsed since the date of 
the last Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86), the individual 
must complete a personnel security packet (see Sec. 25.17(c)). The NRC 
Division of Security, based on investigative or other needs, may require 
a complete personnel security packet in other cases as well. A fee, 
equal to the amount paid for an initial request, will be charged only if 
a new or updating investigation is required.

[57 FR 41376, Sept. 10, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 25.29  Reinstatement of access authorization.

    An up-to-date personnel security packet will be furnished with a 
request for reinstatement of an access authorization if 6 months or more 
have elapsed since termination of access authorization and a year or 
more has elapsed since the date of the previous Questionnaire for 
Sensitive Positions, or if any significant changes are known to have 
occurred since the termination. A new Security Acknowledgment will be 
obtained in all cases. Where personnel security packets are not 
required, a request for reinstatement shall state the level of access 
authorization to be reinstated and the full name and date of birth of 
the individual in order to establish positive identification. A fee,

[[Page 397]]

equal to the amount paid for an initial request, will be charged only if 
a new or updating investigation is required.

[45 FR 14481, Mar. 5, 1980, as amended at 53 FR 30830, Aug. 16, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 25.31  Extensions and transfers of access authorizations.

    (a) The NRC Division of Security may, on request, extend the 
authorization of an individual who possesses an access authorization in 
connection with a particular employer or activity, to permit access to 
National Security Information and/or Restricted Data in connection with 
an assignment with another employer or activity.
    (b) The NRC Division of Security may, on request, transfer an access 
authorization when an individual's access authorization under one 
employer or activity is terminated, simultaneously with the individual 
being granted access authorization for another employer or activity.
    (c) Requests for extension or transfer of access authorization shall 
state the full name of the person, his date of birth and level of access 
authorization. The Director, Division of Security, may require a new 
personnel security packet (see Sec. 25.17(c)) to be completed by the 
applicant. A fee, equal to the amount paid for an initial request, will 
be charged only if a new or updating investigation is required.
    (d) The date of an extension or transfer of access authorization may 
not be used to determine when a request for renewal of access 
authorization is required. Access authorization renewal requests must be 
timely submitted, in accordance with Sec. 25.21(c).

[45 FR 14481, Mar. 5, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 24320, June 1, 1983; 57

    (1) Access authorization is no longer required, or
    (2) An individual is separated from the employment or the activity 
for which he obtained an access authorization for a period of 90 days or 
more, or
    (3) An individual, pursuant to 10 CFR part 10, is no longer eligible 
for access authorization.
    (b) A representative of the licensee or other organization which 
employs the individual whose access authorization will be terminated 
shall immediately notify the NRC Division of Security when the 
circumstances noted in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section exist; 
inform the individual that his access authorization is being terminated, 
and the reason; and that he will be considered for reinstatement of 
access authorization if he resumes work requiring it.
    (c) When an access authorization is to be terminated, a 
representative of the licensee or other organization shall conduct a 
security termination briefing of the individual involved, explain the 
Security Termination Statement (NRC Form 136) and have the individual 
complete the form. The representative shall promptly forward the 
original copy of the completed Security Termination Statement to the NRC 
Division of Security, Office of Administration, Washington, DC 20555.

NRC access authorization. Individuals planning these visits shall 
complete NRC Form 277, ``Request for Visit or Access Approval,'' with 
the ``need-to-know'' certified by the appropriate NRC office exercising 
licensing or regulatory authority. This NRC office shall then forward 
the request to the NRC Division of Security at least 15 days in advance 
of the date of the visit for appropriate verification of NRC access 
authorization. The Division of Security shall forward the form to the 
facility to be visited. Records related to these

[[Page 398]]

visits must be maintained by the facility for three years following the 
expiration date of the visit authorization.

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 26.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes requirements and standards for the 
establishment and maintenance of certain aspects of fitness-for-duty 
programs and procedures by the licensed nuclear power industry, and by 
licensees authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of 
strategic special nuclear material (SSNM).

[58 FR 31469, June 3, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 26.2  Scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part apply to licensees authorized to 
operate a nuclear power reactor, to possess or use formula quantities of 
SSNM, or to transport formula quantities of SSNM. Each licensee shall 
implement a fitness-for-duty program which complies with this part. The 
provisions of the fitness-for-duty program must apply to all persons 
granted unescorted access to nuclear power plant protected areas, to 
licensee, vendor, or contractor personnel required to physically report 
to a licensee's Technical Support Center (TSC) or Emergency Operations 
Facility (EOF) in accordance with licensee emergency plans and 
procedures, and to SSNM licensee and transporter personnel who:
    (1) Are granted unescorted access to Category IA Material;
    (2) Create or have access to procedures or records for safeguarding 
SSNM;
    (3) Make measurements of Category IA Material;
    (4) Transport or escort Category IA Material; or
    (5) Guard Category IA Material.
    (b) The regulations in this part do not apply to NRC employees, to 
law enforcement personnel, or offsite emergency fire and medical 
response personnel while responding onsite, or SSNM transporters who are 
subject to U.S. Department of Transportation drug or alcohol fitness 
programs that require random testing for drugs and alcohol. The 
regulations in this part also do not apply to spent fuel storage 
facility licensees or non-power reactor licensees who possess, use, or 
transport formula quantities of irradiated SSNM as these materials are 
exempt from the Category I physical protection requirements as set forth 
in 10 CFR 73.6.
    (c) Certain regulations in this part apply to licensees holding 
permits to construct a nuclear power plant. Each construction permit 
holder, with a plant under active construction, shall comply with 
Secs. 26.10, 26.20, 26.23, 26.70, and 26.73 of this part; shall 
implement a chemical testing program, including random tests; and shall 
make provisions for employee assistance programs, imposition of 
sanctions, appeals procedures, the protection of information, and 
recordkeeping.
    (d) The regulations in this part apply to the Corporation required 
to obtain a certificate of compliance or an approved compliance plan 
under part 76 of this chapter only if the Corporation elects to engage 
in activities involving formula quantities of strategic special nuclear 
material. When applicable, the requirements apply only to the 
Corporation and personnel carrying out the activities specified in 
Sec. 26.2(a)(1) through (5).

[58 FR 31469, June 3, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 48959, Sept. 23, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 26.3  Definitions.

    Aliquot means a portion of a specimen used for testing.
    Category IA Material means strategic special nuclear material (SSNM) 
directly useable in the manufacture of a nuclear explosive device, 
except if:
    (1) The dimensions are large enough (at least 2 meters in one 
dimension, greater than 1 meter in each of two dimensions, or greater 
than 25 cm in each of three dimensions) to preclude hiding the item on 
an individual;
    (2) The total weight of 5 formula kilograms of SSNM plus its matrix 
(at least 50 kilograms) cannot be carried inconspicuously by one person; 
or
    (3) The quantity of SSNM (less than 0.05 formula kilogram) in each 
container requires protracted diversions in order to accumulate 5 
formula kilograms.
    Commission means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly 
authorized representatives.
    Confirmatory test means a second analytical procedure to identify 
the presence of a specific drug or drug metabolite which is independent 
of the

[[Page 400]]

initial screening test and which uses a different technique and chemical 
principle from that of the initial screening test in order to ensure 
reliability and accuracy. For determining blood alcohol levels, a 
``confirmatory test'' means a second test using another breath alcohol 
analysis device. Further confirmation upon demand will be by gas 
chromatography analysis of blood.
    Confirmed positive test means the result of a confirmatory test that 
has established the presence of drugs, drug metabolites, or alcohol in a 
specimen at or above the cut-off level, and that has been deemed 
positive by the Medical Review Officer (MRO) after evaluation. A 
``confirmed positive test'' for alcohol can also be obtained as a result 
of a confirmation of blood alcohol levels with a second breath analysis 
without MRO evaluation.
    Contractor means any company or individual with which the licensee 
has contracted for work or service to be performed inside the protected 
area boundary, either by contract, purchase order, or verbal agreement.
    Cut-off level means the value set for designating a test result as 
positive.
    Follow-up testing means chemical testing at unannounced intervals, 
to ensure that an employee is maintaining abstinence from the abuse of 
drugs or alcohol.
    Illegal drugs means those drugs included in Schedules I through V of 
the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), but not when used pursuant to a 
valid prescription or when used as otherwise authorized by law.
    Initial or screening tests means an immunoassay screen for drugs or 
drug metabolites to eliminate ``negative'' urine specimens from further 
consideration or the first breathalyzer test for alcohol. Initial 
screening may be performed at the licensee's testing facility; a second 
screen and confirmation testing for drugs or drug metabolites must be 
conducted by a HHS-certified laboratory.
    Medical Review Officer means a licensed physician responsible for 
receiving laboratory results generated by an employer's drug testing 
program who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and has 
appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an individual's 
positive test result together with his or her medical history and any 
other relevant biomedical information.
    Protected area has the same meaning as in Sec. 73.2(g) of this 
chapter, an area encompassed by physical barriers and to which access is 
controlled.
    Random test means a system of unannounced drug testing administered 
in a statistically random manner to a group so that all persons within 
that group have an equal probability of selection.
    Suitable inquiry means best-effort verification of employment 
history for the past five years, but in no case less than three years, 
obtained through contacts with previous employers to determine if a 
person was, in the past, tested positive for illegal drugs, subject to a 
plan for treating substance abuse, removed from, or made ineligible for 
activities within the scope of 10 CFR part 26, or denied unescorted 
access at any other nuclear power plant or other employment in 
accordance with a fitness-for-duty policy.
    Transporter means a general licensee pursuant to 10 CFR 70.20a, who 
is authorized to possess formula quantities of SSNM in the regular 
course of carriage for another or storage incident thereto, and includes 
the driver or operator of any conveyance, and the accompanying guards or 
escorts.
    Vendor means any company or individual, not under contract to a 
licensee, providing services in protected areas.

[54 FR 24494, June 7, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 31469, June 3, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 26.4  Interpretations.

    Except as specifically authorized by the Commission in writing, no 
interpretation of the meaning of the regulations in this part by any 
officer or employee of the Commission other than a written 
interpretation by the General Counsel will be recognized to be binding 
upon the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 26.6  Exemptions.

    The Commission may, upon application of any interested person or 
upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of 
the regulations in this part as it determines

[[Page 401]]

are authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security and are otherwise in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 26.8  Information collection requirements: OMB approval.

    (a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has submitted the information 
collection requirements contained in this part to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for approval as required by the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). OMB has approved the 
information collection requirements contained in this part under control 
number 3150-0146.
    (b) The approved information collection requirements contained in 
this part appear in Secs.  26.20, 26.21, 26.22, 26.23, 26.24, 26.27, 
26.29, 26.70, 26.71, 26.73, 26.80 and appendix A.
    (c) The total burden for these recordkeeping requirements is 
estimated to be 313 hours per site per year. In implementing the 
recordkeeping requirements the affected licensee shall report to the 
Commission any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimate and any 
suggestions for reducing the burden.

                     General Performance Objectives


<R05>
Sec. 26.10  General performance objectives.

    Fitness-for-duty programs must:
    (a) Provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plant personnel, 
transporter personnel, and personnel of licensees authorized to possess 
or use formula quantities of SSNM, will perform their tasks in a 
reliable and trustworthy manner and are not under the influence of any 
substance, legal or illegal, or mentally or physically impaired from any 
cause, which in any way adversely affects their ability to safely and 
competently perform their duties;
    (b) Provide reasonable measures for the early detection of persons 
who are not fit to perform activities within the scope of this part; and
    (c) Have a goal of achieving a drug-free workplace and a workplace 
free of the effects of such substances.

[54 FR 24494, June 7, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 31469, June 3, 1993]

                     Program Elements and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 26.20  Written policy and procedures.

    Each licensee subject to this part shall establish and implement 
written policies and procedures designed to meet the general performance 
objectives and specific requirements of this part. Each licensee shall 
retain a copy of the current written policy and procedures as a record 
until the Commission terminates each license for which the policy and 
procedures were developed and, if any portion of the policies and 
procedures are superseded, retain the superseded material for three 
years after each change. As a minimum, written policies and procedures 
must address fitness for duty through the following:
    (a) An overall description of licensee policy on fitness for duty. 
The policy must address use of illegal drugs and abuse of legal drugs 
(e.g., alcohol, prescription and over-the-counter drugs). Written policy 
documents must be in sufficient detail to provide affected individuals 
with information on what is expected of them, and what consequences may 
result from lack of adherence to the policy. As a minimum, the written 
policy must prohibit the consumption of alcohol--
    (1) Within an abstinence period of at least 5 hours preceding any 
scheduled working tour, and
    (2) During the period of any working tour.

 Licensee policy should also address other factors that could affect 
fitness for duty such as mental stress, fatigue and illness.
    (b) A description of programs which are available to personnel 
desiring assistance in dealing with drug, alcohol, or other problems 
that could adversely affect the performance of activities within the 
scope of this part.
    (c) Procedures to be utilized in testing for drugs and alcohol, 
including procedures for protecting the employee and the integrity of 
the specimen, and the quality controls used to ensure the test results 
are valid and attributable to the correct individual.
    (d) A description of immediate and follow-on actions which will be 
taken, and the procedures to be utilized, in those cases where 
employees, vendors,

[[Page 402]]

or contractors assigned to duties within the scope of this part are 
determined to have been involved in the use, sale, or possession of 
illegal drugs; or to have consumed alcohol during the mandatory pre-work 
abstinence period, while on duty, or to excess prior to reporting to 
duty as demonstrated with a test that can be used to determine blood 
alcohol concentration.
    (e) A procedure that will ensure that persons called in to perform 
an unscheduled working tour are fit to perform the task assigned. As a 
minimum, this procedure must--
    (1) Require a statement to be made by a called-in person as to 
whether he or she has consumed alcohol within the length of time stated 
in the pre-duty abstinence policy;
    (2) If alcohol has been consumed within this period, require a 
determination of fitness for duty by breath analysis or other means; and
    (3) Require the establishment of controls and conditions under which 
a person who has been called-in can perform work, if necessary, although 
alcohol has been consumed. Consumption of alcohol during the abstinence 
period shall not by itself preclude a licensee from using individuals 
needed to respond to an emergency.
    (f) The Commission may at any time review the licensee's written 
policy and procedures to assure that they meet the performance 
objectives of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 26.21  Policy communications and awareness training.

    (a) Persons assigned to activities within the scope of this part 
shall be provided with appropriate training to ensure they understand--
    (1) Licensee policy and procedures, including the methods that will 
be used to implement the policy;
    (2) The personal and public health and safety hazards associated 
with abuse of drugs and misuse of alcohol;
    (3) The effect of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and 
dietary conditions on job performance and on chemical test results, and 
the role of the Medical Review Officer;
    (4) Employee assistance programs provided by the licensee; and
    (5) What is expected of them and what consequences may result from 
lack of adherence to the policy,
    (b) Initial training must be completed prior to assignment to 
activities within the scope of this part. Refresher training must be 
completed on a nominal 12 month frequency or more frequently where the 
need is indicated. A record of the training must be retained for a 
period of at least three years.


<R05>
Sec. 26.22   Training of supervisors and escorts.

    (a) Managers and supervisors of activities within the scope of this 
Part must be provided appropriate training to ensure they understand--
    (1) Their role and responsibilities in implementing the program;
    (2) The roles and responsibilities of others, such as the personnel, 
medical, and employee assistance program staffs;
    (3) Techniques for recognizing drugs and indications of the use, 
sale, or possession of drugs;
    (4) Behavioral observation techniques for detecting degradation in 
performance, impairment, or changes in employee behavior; and
    (5) Procedures for initiating appropriate corrective action, to 
include referral to the employee assistance program.
    (b) Persons assigned to escort duties shall be provided appropriate 
training in techniques for recognizing drugs and indications of the use, 
sale, or possession of drugs, techniques for recognizing aberrant 
behavior, and the procedures for reporting problems to supervisory or 
security personnel.
    (c) Initial training must be completed prior to assignment of duties 
within the scope of this part and within 3 months after initial 
supervisory assignment, as applicable. Refresher training must be 
completed on a nominal 12 month frequency, or more frequently where the 
need is indicated. A record of the training must be retained for a 
period of at least three years.


<R05>
Sec. 26.23   Contractors and vendors.

    (a) All contractor and vendor personnel performing activities within 
the scope of this part for a licensee must be subject to either the 
licensee's program

[[Page 403]]

relating to fitness for duty, or to a program, formally reviewed and 
approved by the licensee, which meets the requirements of this part. 
Written agreements between licensees and contractors or vendors for 
activities within the scope of this part must be retained for the life 
of the contract and will clearly show that--
    (1) The contractor or vendor is responsible to the licensee for 
adhering to the licensee's fitness-for-duty policy, or maintaining and 
adhering to an effective fitness-for-duty program; which meets the 
standards of this part; and
    (2) Personnel having been denied access or removed from activities 
within the scope of this part at any nuclear power plant for violations 
of a fitness-for-duty policy will not be assigned to work within the 
scope of this part without the knowledge and consent of the licensee.
    (b) Each licensee subject to this part shall assure that contractors 
whose own fitness-for-duty programs are relied on by the licensee adhere 
to an effective program, which meets the requirements of this part, and 
shall conduct audits pursuant to Sec. 26.80 for this purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 26.24  Chemical and alcohol testing.

    (a) To provide a means to deter and detect substance abuse, the 
licensee shall implement the following chemical testing programs for 
persons subject to this part:
    (1) Testing within 60 days prior to the initial granting of 
unescorted access to protected areas or assignment to activities within 
the scope of this part.
    (2) Unannounced drug and alcohol tests imposed in a statistically 
random and unpredictable manner so that all persons in the population 
subject to testing have an equal probability of being selected and 
tested. The tests must be administered so that a person completing a 
test is immediately eligible for another unannounced test. As a minimum, 
tests must be administered on a nominal weekly frequency and at various 
times during the day. Random testing must be conducted at an annual rate 
equal to at least 50 percent of the workforce.
    (3) Testing for-cause, i.e., as soon as possible following any 
observed behavior indicating possible substance abuse; after accidents 
involving a failure in individual performance resulting in personal 
injury, in a radiation exposure or release of radioactivity in excess of 
regulatory limits, or actual or potential substantial degradations of 
the level of safety of the plant if there is reasonable suspicion that 
the worker's behavior contributed to the event; or after receiving 
credible information that an individual is abusing drugs or alcohol.
    (4) Follow-up testing on an unannounced basis to verify continued 
abstention from the use of substances covered under this part.
    (b) Testing for drugs and alcohol, at a minimum, must conform to the 
``Guidelines for Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs,'' issued by the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and appearing in appendix A to this part, 
hereinafter referred to as the NRC Guidelines. Licensees, at their 
discretion, may implement programs with more stringent standards (e.g., 
lower cutoff levels, broader panel of drugs). All requirements in this 
part still apply to persons who fail a more stringent standard, but do 
not test positive under the NRC Guidelines. Management actions must be 
the same with the more stringent standards as if the individual had 
failed the NRC standards.
    (c) Licensees shall test for all substances described in paragraph 
2.1(a) of the NRC Guidelines. In addition, licensees may consult with 
local law enforcement authorities, hospitals, and drug counseling 
services to determine whether other substances with abuse potential are 
being used in the geographical locale of the facility and the local 
workforce. When appropriate, other substances so identified may be added 
to the panel of substances for testing. Appropriate cutoff limits must 
be established by the licensee for these substances.
    (d)(1) Licensees may conduct initial screening tests of an aliquot 
before forwarding selected specimens to a laboratory certified by the 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provided the licensee's 
staff possesses the necessary training and skills for the

[[Page 404]]

tasks assigned, the staff's qualifications are documented, and adequate 
quality controls for the testing are implemented. Quality control 
procedures for initial screening tests by a licensee's testing facility 
must include the processing of blind performance test specimens and the 
submission to the HHS-certified laboratory of a sampling of specimens 
initially tested as negative. Except for the purposes discussed below, 
access to the results of preliminary tests must be limited to the 
licensee's testing staff, the Medical Review Officer (MRO), the Fitness-
for-Duty Program Manager, and the employee assistance program staff, 
when appropriate.
    (2) No individual may be removed or temporarily suspended from 
unescorted access or be subjected to other administrative action based 
solely on an unconfirmed positive result from any drug test, other than 
for marijuana (THC) or cocaine, unless other evidence indicates that the 
individual is impaired or might otherwise pose a safety hazard. With 
respect to onsite initial screening tests for marijuana (THC) and 
cocaine, licensee management may be informed and licensees may 
temporarily suspend individuals from unescorted access or from normal 
duties or take lesser administrative actions against the individual 
based on an unconfirmed presumptive positive result provided the 
licensee complies with the following conditions:
    (i) For the drug for which action will be taken, at least 85 percent 
of the specimens which were determined to be presumptively positive as a 
result of preliminary onsite screening tests during the last 6-month 
data reporting period submitted to the Commission under Sec. 26.71(d) 
were subsequently reported as positive by the HHS-certified laboratory 
as the result of a GC/MS confirmatory test.
    (ii) There is no loss of compensation or benefits to the tested 
person during the period of temporary administrative action.
    (iii) Immediately upon receipt of a negative report from the HHS-
certified laboratory, any matter which could link the individual to a 
temporary suspension is eliminated from the tested individual's 
personnel record or other records.
    (iv) No disclosure of the temporary removal or suspension of, or 
other administrative action against, an individual whose test is not 
subsequently confirmed as positive by the MRO may be made in response to 
a suitable inquiry conducted under the provisions of Sec. 26.27(a), a 
background investigation conducted under the provisions of Sec. 73.56, 
or to any other inquiry or investigation. For the purpose of assuring 
that no records have been retained, access to the system of files and 
records must be provided to licensee personnel conducting appeal 
reviews, inquiries into an allegation, or audits under the provisions of 
Sec. 26.80, or to an NRC inspector or other Federal officials. The 
tested individual must be provided a statement that the records in 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section have not been retained and must be 
informed in writing that the temporary removal or suspension or other 
administrative action that was taken will not be disclosed, and need not 
be disclosed by the individual, in response to requests for information 
concerning removals, suspensions, administrative actions or history of 
substance abuse.
    (e) The Medical Review Officer's review of the test results must be 
completed and licensee management notified within 10 days of the initial 
presumptive positive screening test.
    (f) All testing of specimens for urine drug testing, except onsite 
testing under paragraph (d) above, must be performed in a laboratory 
certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for that 
purpose consistent with its standards and procedures for certification. 
Except for suspect specimens submitted for special processing (Section 
2.7(d) of appendix A), all specimens sent to certified laboratories 
shall be subject to initial screening by the laboratory and all 
specimens screened as presumptively positive shall be subject to 
confirmation testing by the laboratory. Licensees shall submit blind 
performance test specimens to certified laboratories in accordance with 
the NRC Guidelines (appendix A).
    (g) Tests for alcohol must be administered by breath analysis using 
breath

[[Page 405]]

alcohol analyses devices meeting evidential standards described in 
section 2.7(O)(3) of appendix A. A breath alcohol content indicating a 
blood alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent or greater must be a 
positive test result. The confirmatory test for alcohol shall be done 
with another breath measurement instrument. Should the person demand 
further confirmation, the test must be a gas chromatography analysis of 
blood.

<R05>
Sec. 26.25  Employee assistance programs (EAP).

    Each licensee subject to this part shall maintain an employee 
assistance program to strengthen fitness-for-duty programs by offering 
assessment, short-term counseling, referral services, and treatment 
monitoring to employees with problems that could adversely affect the 
performance of activities within the scope of this part. Employee 
assistance programs should be designed to achieve early intervention and 
provide for confidential assistance. The employee assistance program 
staff shall inform licensee management when a determination has been 
made that any individual's condition constitutes a hazard to himself or 
herself or others (including those who have self-referred).


<R05>
Sec. 26.27  Management actions and sanctions to be imposed.

    (a)(1) The licensee shall obtain a written statement from the 
individual as to whether activities within the scope of this part were 
ever denied the individual before the initial--

    (3) If a record of the type described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section is established, the new assignment to activities within the 
scope of this part or granting of unescorted access must be based upon a 
management and medical determination of fitness for duty and the 
establishment of an appropriate follow-up testing program, provided the 
restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section are observed. To meet this 
requirement, the identity of persons denied unescorted access or removed 
under the provisions of this part and the circumstances for the denial 
or removal, including test results, will be made available in response 
to a licensee's, contractor's or vendor's inquiry supported by a signed 
release from the individual.
    (4) Failure to list reasons for removal or revocation of unescorted 
access is sufficient cause for denial of unescorted access. Temporary 
access provisions are not affected by this part if the prospective 
worker passes a chemical test conducted according to the requirements of 
Sec. 26.24(a)(1).

[[Page 406]]

    (b) Each licensee subject to this part shall, as a minimum, take the 
following actions. Nothing herein shall prohibit the licensee from 
taking more stringent action.
    (1) Impaired workers, or those whose fitness may be questionable, 
shall be removed from activities within the scope of this part, and may 
be returned only after determined to be fit to safely and competently 
perform activities within the scope of this part.
    (2) Lacking any other evidence to indicate the use, sale, or 
possession of illegal drugs onsite, a confirmed positive test result 
must be presumed to be an indication of offsite drug use. The first 
confirmed positive test must, as a minimum, result in immediate removal 
from activities within the scope of this part for at least 14 days and 
referral to the EAP for assessment and counseling during any suspension 
period. Plans for treatment, follow-up, and future employment must be 
developed, and any rehabilitation program deemed appropriate must be 
initiated during such suspension period. Satisfactory management and 
medical assurance of the individual's fitness to adequately perform 
activities within the scope of this part must be obtained before 
permitting the individual to be returned to these activities. Any 
subsequent confirmed positive test must result in, as applicable--
    (i) Removal from unescorted access to nuclear power plant protected 
areas;
    (ii) Removal from unescorted access to Category IA Material;
    (iii) Removal from responsibilities to create or have access to 
records or procedures for safeguarding SSNM;
    (iv) Removal from responsibilities to measure Category IA Material;
    (v) Removal from the responsibilities of transporting or escorting 
Category IA Material;
    (vi) Removal from the responsibilities of guarding Category IA 
Material at any other licensee facility; and
    (vii) Removal from activities within the scope of this part for a 
minimum of 3 years from the date of removal.
    (3) Any individual determined to have been involved in the sale, 
use, or possession of illegal drugs, while, as applicable, within a 
protected area of any nuclear power plant, within a facility that is 
licensed to possess or use SSNM, or within a transporter's facility or 
vehicle, must be removed from activities within the scope of this part. 
The individual may not--
    (i) Be granted unescorted access to nuclear power plant protected 
areas;
    (ii) Be granted unescorted access to Category IA Material;
    (iii) Be given responsibilities to create or have access to 
safeguards records or procedures for SSNM;
    (iv) Be given responsibilities to measure Category IA Material;
    (v) Be given responsibilities to transport or escort Category IA 
Material;
    (vi) Be given responsibilities to guard Category IA Material; or
    (vii) Be assigned to activities within the scope of this part for a 
minimum of 5 years from the date of removal.
    (4) Persons removed for periods of three years or more under the 
provisions of paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section for the illegal 
sale, use or possession of drugs and who would have been removed under 
the current standards of a hiring licensee, may be granted unescorted 
access and assigned duties within the scope of this part by a licensee 
subject to this part only when the hiring licensee receives satisfactory 
medical assurance that the person has abstained from drugs for at least 
three years. Satisfactory management and medical assurance of the 
individual's fitness to adequately perform activities within the scope 
of this part must be obtained before permitting the individual to 
perform activities within the scope of this part. Any person granted 
unescorted access or whose access is reinstated under these provisions 
must be given unannounced follow-up tests at least once every month for 
four months and at least once every three months for the next two years 
and eight months after unescorted access is reinstated to verify 
continued abstinence from proscribed substances. Any confirmed use of 
drugs through this process or any other determination of subsequent 
involvement in the sale, use or possession of illegal substances must 
result in permanent denial of unescorted access.
    (5) Paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) of this section do not apply to 
alcohol, valid prescriptions, or over-the-counter

[[Page 407]]

drugs. Licensee sanctions for confirmed misuse of alcohol, valid 
prescription, and over-the-counter drugs shall be sufficient to deter 
abuse of legally obtainable substances as a substitute for abuse of 
proscribed drugs.
    (c) Refusal to provide a specimen for testing and resignation prior 
to removal for violation of company fitness-for-duty policy concerning 
drugs must be recorded as removals for cause. These records must be 
retained for the purpose of meeting the requirements of Sec. 26.27(a).
    (d) If a licensee has a reasonable belief that an NRC employee may 
be under the influence of any substance, or otherwise unfit for duty, 
the licensee may not deny access but shall escort the individual. In any 
instance of this occurrence, the appropriate Regional Administrator must 
be notified immediately by telephone. During other than normal working 
hours, the NRC Operations Center must be notified.

<R05>
Sec. 26.28  Appeals.

    Each licensee subject to this part, and each contractor or vendor 
implementing a fitness-for-duty program under the provisions of 
Sec. 26.23, shall establish a procedure for licensee and contractor or 
vendor employees to appeal a positive alcohol or drug determination. The 
procedure must provide notice and an opportunity to respond and may be 
an impartial internal management review. A licensee review procedure 
need not be provided to employees of contractors or vendors when the 
contractor or vendor is administering his own alcohol and drug testing.


<R05>
Sec. 26.29  Protection of information.

    (a) Each licensee subject to this part, who collects personal 
information on an individual for the purpose of complying with this 
part, shall establish and maintain a system of files and procedures for 
the protection of the personal information. This system must be 
maintained until the Commission terminates each license for which the 
system was developed.
    (b) Licensees, contractors, and vendors shall not disclose the 
personal information collected and maintained to persons other than 
assigned Medical Review Officers, other licensees or their authorized 
representatives legitimately seeking the information as required by this 
part for unescorted access decisions and who have obtained a release 
from current or prospective employees or contractor personnel, NRC 
representatives, appropriate law enforcement officials under court 
order, the subject individual or his or her representative, or to those 
licensee representatives who have a need to have access to the 
information in performing assigned duties, including audits of 
licensee's, contractor's, and vendor's programs, to persons deciding 
matters on review or appeal, and to other persons pursuant to court 
order. This section does not authorize the licensee, contractor, or 
vendor to withhold evidence of criminal conduct from law enforcement 
officials.

                    Inspections, Records, and Reports


<R05>
Sec. 26.70  Inspections.

    (a) Each licensee subject to this part shall permit duly authorized 
representatives of the Commission to inspect, copy, or take away copies 
of its records and inspect its premises, activities, and personnel as 
may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this part.
    (b) Written agreements between licensees and their contractors and 
vendors must clearly show that the--
    (1) Licensee is responsible to the Commission for maintaining an 
effective fitness-for-duty program in accordance with this part; and
    (2) Duly authorized representatives of the Commission may inspect, 
copy, or take away copies of any licensee, contractor, or vendor's 
documents, records, and reports related to implementation of the 
licensee's, contractor's, or vendor's fitness-for-duty program under the 
scope of the contracted activities.


<R05>
Sec. 26.71  Recordkeeping requirements.

    Each licensee subject to this part and each contractor and vendor 
implementing a licensee approved program under the provisions of 
Sec. 26.23 shall--
    (a) Retain records of inquiries conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 26.27(a),

[[Page 408]]

that result in the granting of unescorted access to protected areas, 
until five years following termination of such access authorizations;
    (b) Retain records of confirmed positive test results which are 
concurred in by the Medical Review Officer, and the related personnel 
actions for a period of at least five years;
    (c) Retain records of persons made ineligible for three years or 
longer for assignment to activities within the scope of this part under 
the provisions of Sec. 26.27(b) (2), (3), (4) or (c), until the 
Commission terminates each license under which the records were created; 
and
    (d) Collect and compile fitness-for-duty program performance data on 
a standard form and submit this data to the Commission within 60 days of 
the end of each 6-month reporting period (January-June and July-
December). The data for each site (corporate and other support staff 
locations may be separately consolidated) must include: random testing 
rate; drugs tested for and cut-off levels, including results of tests 
using lower cut-off levels and tests for other drugs; workforce 
populations tested; numbers of tests and results by population, and type 
of test (i.e., pre-access, random, for-cause, etc.); substances 
identified; summary of management actions; and a list of events 
reported. The data must be analyzed and appropriate actions taken to 
correct program weaknesses. The data and analysis must be retained for 
three years. Any licensee choosing to temporarily suspend individuals 
under the provisions of Sec. 26.24(d) must report test results by 
process stage (i.e., onsite screening, laboratory screening, 
confirmatory tests, and MRO determinations) and the number of temporary 
suspensions or other administrative actions taken against individuals 
based on onsite unconfirmed screening positives for marijuana (THC) and 
for cocaine.

<R05>
Sec. 26.73  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Each licensee subject to this part shall inform the Commission 
of significant fitness-for-duty events including:
    (1) Sale, use, or possession of illegal drugs within the protected 
area and,
    (2) Any acts by any person licensed under 10 CFR part 55 to operate 
a power reactor or by any supervisory personnel assigned to perform 
duties within the scope of this part--
    (i) Involving the sale, use, or possession of a controlled 
substance,
    (ii) Resulting in confirmed positive tests on such persons,
    (iii) Involving use of alcohol within the protected area, or
    (iv) Resulting in a determination of unfitness for scheduled work 
due to the consumption of alcohol.
    (b) Notifications must be made to the NRC Operations Center by 
telephone within 24 hours of the discovery of the event by the licensee.
    (c) Fitness-for-duty events shall be reported under this section 
rather than reported under the provisions of Sec. 73.71.
    (d) By November 30, 1993 each licensee who is authorized to possess, 
use, or transport formula quantities of SSNM shall certify to the NRC 
that it has implemented a fitness-for-duty program that meets the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 26. The certification shall describe any 
licensee cut-off levels more stringent than those imposed by this part.

[54 FR 24494, June 7, 1989; 54 FR 47451, Nov. 14, 1989, as amended at 58 
FR 31470, June 3, 1993]

                                 Audits


<R05>
Sec. 26.80  Audits.

    (a) Each licensee subject to this part shall audit the fitness-for-
duty program nominally every 12 months. In addition, audits must be 
conducted, nominally every 12 months, of those portions of fitness-for-
duty programs implemented by contractors and vendors. Licensees may 
accept audits of contractors and vendors conducted by other licensees 
and need not re-audit the same contractor or vendor for the same period 
of time. Each sharing utility shall maintain a copy of the audit report, 
to include findings, recommendations and corrective actions. Licensees 
retain responsibility for the effectiveness of contractor and vendor 
programs and the implementation of appropriate corrective action.

[[Page 409]]

    (b) Audits must focus on the effectiveness of the program and be 
conducted by individuals qualified in the subject(s) being audited, and 
independent of both fitness-for-duty program management and personnel 
directly responsible for implementation of the fitness-for-duty program.
    (c) The result of the audit, along with recommendations, if any, 
must be documented and reported to senior corporate and site management. 
The resolution of the audit findings and corrective actions must be 
documented. These documents must be retained for three years. NRC 
Guidelines require licensee audits of HHS-certified laboratories as 
described in appendix A.

                           1.1  Applicability.

    (1) These guidelines apply to licensees authorized to operate 
nuclear power reactors and licensees who are authorized to possess, use, 
or transport formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material 
(SSNM).
    (2) Licensees may set more stringent cut-off levels than specified 
herein or test for substances other than specified herein and shall 
inform the Commission of such deviation within 60 days of implementing 
such change. Licensees may not deviate from the provisions of these 
guidelines without the written approval of the Commission.

perform urine drug testing for NRC licensees, vendors, and licensee 
contractors.

                            1.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:

[[Page 410]]

    ``Aliquot.'' A portion of a specimen used for testing.
    ``BAC.'' Blood alcohol concentration (BAC), which can be measured 
directly from blood or derived from a measure of the concentration of 
alcohol in a breath specimen, is a measure of the mass of alcohol in a 
volume of blood such that an individual with 100 mg of alcohol per 100 
ml of blood has a BAC of 0.10 percent.
    ``Commission.'' The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly 
authorized representatives.
    ``Chain-of-custody.'' Procedures to account for the integrity of 
each specimen by tracking its handling and storage from the point of 
specimen collection to final disposition of the specimen.
    ``Collection site.'' A place designated by the licensee where 
individuals present themselves for the purpose of providing a specimen 
of their urine, breath, and/or blood to be analyzed for the presence of 
drugs or alcohol.
    ``Collection site person.'' A person who instructs and assists 
individuals at a collection site and who receives and makes an initial 
examination of the specimen(s) provided by those individuals. A 
collection site person shall have successfully completed training to 
carry out this function or shall be a licensed medical professional or 
technician who is provided instructions for collection under this part 
and certifies completion as required herein. In any case where: (a) a 
collection is observed or (b) collection is monitored by nonmedical 
personnel, the collection site person must be a person of the same 
gender as the donor.
    ``Confirmatory test.'' A second analytical procedure to identify the 
presence of a specific drug or drug metabolite which is independent of 
the initial screening test and which uses a different technique and 
chemical principle from that of the initial test in order to ensure 
reliability and accuracy. (At this time gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry [GC/MS] is the only authorized confirmation method for 
cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine). For 
determining blood alcohol levels, a ``confirmatory test'' means a second 
test using another breath alcohol analysis device. Further confirmation 
upon demand will be by gas chromatography analysis of blood.
    ``Confirmed positive test.'' The result of a confirmatory test that 
has established the presence of drugs, drug metabolites, or alcohol in a 
specimen at or above the cut-off level, and that has been deemed 
positive by the Medical Review Officer (MRO) after evaluation. A 
``confirmed positive test'' for alcohol can also be obtained as a result 
of a confirmation of blood alcohol levels with a second breath analysis 
without MRO evaluation.
    ``HHS-certified laboratory.'' A urine and blood testing laboratory 
that maintains certification to perform drug testing under the 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ``Mandatory Guidelines for 
Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (53 FR 11970).
    ``Illegal drugs.'' Those drugs included in Schedules I through V of 
the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), but not when used pursuant to a 
valid prescription or when used as otherwise authorized by law.
    ``Initial or screening test.'' An immunoassay screen for drugs or 
drug metabolites to eliminate ``negative'' urine specimens from further 
consideration or the first breathalyzer test for alcohol.
    ``Licensee's testing facility.'' A drug testing facility operated by 
the licensee or one of its vendors or contractors to perform the initial 
testing of urine samples and to perform initial breath tests for 
alcohol. Such a testing facility is optional and not required to 
maintain HHS certification under this part.
    ``Medical Review Officer.'' A licensed physician responsible for 
receiving laboratory results generated by an employer's drug testing 
program who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and has 
appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an individual's 
positive test result together with his or her medical history and any 
other relevant biomedical information.
    ``Permanent record book.'' A permanently bound book in which 
identifying data on each specimen collected at a collection site are 
permanently recorded in the sequence of collection.
    ``Reason to believe.'' Reason to believe that a particular 
individual may alter or substitute the urine specimen.
    ``Split sample.'' A portion of a urine specimen that may be stored 
by the licensee to be tested in the event of appeal.

            Subpart B--Scientific and Technical Requirements

                          2.1  The Substances.

    (a) Licensees shall, as a minimum, test for marijuana, cocaine, 
opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine, and alcohol for pre-access, for-
cause, random, and follow-up tests.
    (b) Licensees may test for any illegal drugs during a for-cause 
test, or analysis of any specimen suspected of being adulterated or 
diluted through hydration or other means.
    (c) Licensees shall establish rigorous testing procedures that are 
consistent with the intent of these guidelines for any other drugs not 
specified in these guidelines for which testing is authorized under 10 
CFR 26, so that the appropriateness of the use of these substances can 
be evaluated by the Medical Review Officer to ensure that individuals 
granted unescorted access are fit for maintaining access to and for 
performing duties in protected areas.

[[Page 411]]

    (d) Specimens collected under NRC regulations requiring compliance 
with this part may only be designated or approved for testing as 
described in this part and shall not be used to conduct any other 
analysis or test without the permission of the tested individual.
    (e) This section does not prohibit procedures reasonably incident to 
analysis of a specimen for controlled substances (e.g., determination of 
pH on tests for specific gravity, creatinine concentration, or presence 
of adulterants).

                 2.2  General Administration of Testing.

    The licensee testing facilities and HHS-certified laboratories 
described in this part shall develop and maintain clear and well-
documented procedures for collection, shipment, and accession of urine 
and blood specimens under this part. Such procedures shall include, as a 
minimum, the following:
    (a) Use of a chain-of-custody form. The original shall accompany the 
specimen to the HHS-certified laboratory. A copy shall accompany any 
split sample. The form shall be a permanent record on which is retained 
identity data (or codes) on the employee and information on the specimen 
collection process and transfers of custody of the specimen.
    (b) Use of a tamperevident sealing system designed in a manner such 
that the specimen container top can be sealed against undetected 
opening, the container can be identified with a unique identifying 
number identical to that appearing on the chain-of-custody form, and 
space has been provided to initial the container affirming its identity. 
For purposes of clarity, this requirement assumes use of a system made 
up of one or more pre-printed labels and seals (or a unitary label/
seal), but use of other, equally effective technologies is authorized.
    (c) Use of a shipping container in which one or more specimens and 
associated paperwork may be transferred and which can be sealed and 
initialled to prevent undetected tampering.
    (d) Written procedures, instructions, and training shall be provided 
as follows:
    (1) Licensee collection site procedures and training of collection 
site personnel shall clearly emphasize that the collection site person 
is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the specimen collection 
and transfer process, carefully ensuring the modesty and privacy of the 
individual tested, and is to avoid any conduct or remarks that might be 
construed as accusatorial or otherwise offensive or inappropriate.
    (2) A non-medical collection site person shall receive training in 
compliance with this appendix and shall demonstrate proficiency in the 
application of this appendix prior to serving as a collection site 
person. A medical professional, technologist, or technician licensed or 
otherwise approved to practice in the jurisdiction in which collection 
occurs may serve as a collection site person if that person is provided 
the instructions described in 2.2(3) and performs collections in 
accordance with those instructions.
    (3) Collection site persons shall be provided with detailed, 
clearly-illustrated, written instructions on the collection of specimens 
in compliance with this part. Individuals subject to testing shall also 
be provided standard written instructions setting forth their 
responsibilities.
    (4) The option to provide a blood specimen for confirmatory analysis 
following a positive breath test shall be specified in the written 
instructions provided to individuals tested. The instructions shall also 
state that failure to request a confirmatory blood test indicates that 
the individual accepts the breath test results.

                 2.3  Preventing Subversion of Testing.

    Licensees shall carefully select and monitor persons responsible for 
administering the testing program (e.g., collection site persons, 
laboratory technicians, specimen couriers, and those selecting and 
notifying personnel to be tested), based upon the highest standards for 
honesty and integrity, and shall implement measures to ensure that these 
standards are maintained. As a minimum, these measures shall ensure that 
the integrity of such persons is not compromised or subject to efforts 
to compromise due to personal relationships with any individuals subject 
to testing.
    As a minimum:
    (1) Supervisors, co-workers, and relatives of the individual being 
tested shall not perform any collection, assessment, or evaluation 
procedures.
    (2) Appropriate background checks and psychological evaluations 
shall be completed prior to assignment of any tasks associated with the 
administration of the program, and shall be conducted at least once 
every three years.
    (3) Persons responsible for administering the testing program shall 
be subjected to a behavioral observation program designed to assure that 
they continue to meet the highest standards for honesty and integrity.

                  2.4  Specimen Collection Procedures.

    (a) ``Designation of Collection Site.'' Each drug testing program 
shall have one or more designated collection sites which have all 
necessary personnel, materials, equipment, facilities, and supervision 
to provide for the collection, security, temporary storage, and shipping 
or transportation of urine or blood specimens to a drug testing 
laboratory. A properly equipped mobile facility that meets the 
requirements of this part is an acceptable collection site.

[[Page 412]]

    (b) ``Collection Site Person.'' A collection site person shall have 
successfully completed training to carry out this function. In any case 
where the collection of urine is observed, the collection site person 
must be a person of the same gender as the donor. Persons drawing blood 
shall be qualified to perform that task.
    (c) ``Security.'' The purpose of this paragraph is to prevent 
unauthorized access which could compromise the integrity of the 
collection process or the specimen. Security procedures shall provide 
for the designated collection site to be secure. If a collection site 
facility cannot be dedicated solely to drug and alcohol testing, the 
portion of the facility used for testing shall be secured during that 
testing.
    (1) A facility normally used for other purposes, such as a public 
rest room or hospital examining room, may be secured by visual 
inspection to ensure other persons are not present, and that undetected 
access (e.g., through a rear door not in the view of the collection site 
person) is impossible. Security during collection may be maintained by 
effective restriction of access to collection materials and specimens. 
In the case of a public rest room, the facility must be posted against 
access during the entire collection procedure to avoid embarrassment to 
the individual or distraction of the collection site person.
    (2) If it is impractical to maintain continuous physical security of 
a collection site from the time the specimen is presented until the 
sealed container is transferred for shipment, the following minimum 
procedures shall apply: The specimen shall remain under the direct 
control of the collection site person from delivery to its being sealed 
in a mailer or secured for shipment. The mailer shall be immediately 
mailed, maintained in secure storage, or remain until mailed under the 
personal control of the collection site person. These minimum procedures 
shall apply to the mailing of specimens to licensee testing facilities 
from collection sites (except where co-located) as well as to the 
mailing of specimens to HHS-certified laboratories. As an option, 
licensees may ship several specimens via courier in a locked or sealed 
shipping container.
    (d) ``Chain-of-Custody.'' Licensee chain-of-custody forms shall be 
properly executed by authorized collection site personnel upon receipt 
of specimens. Handling and transportation of urine and blood specimens 
from one authorized individual or place to another shall always be 
accomplished through chain-of-custody procedures. Every effort shall be 
made to minimize the number of persons handling the specimens.
    (e) ``Access to Authorized Personnel Only.'' No unauthorized 
personnel shall be permitted in any part of the designated collection 
site where specimens are collected or stored. Only the collection site 
person may handle specimens prior to their securement in the mailing or 
shipping container or monitor or observe specimen collection (under the 
conditions specified in this part). In order to promote security of 
specimens, avoid distraction of the collection site person, and ensure 
against any confusion in the identification of specimens, a collection 
site person shall conduct only one collection procedure at any given 
time. For this purpose, a collection procedure is complete when the 
specimen container has been sealed and initialed, the chain-of-custody 
form has been executed, and the individual has departed the collection 
site.
    (f) ``Privacy.'' Procedures for collecting urine specimens shall 
allow individual privacy unless there is reason to believe that a 
particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be 
provided. For purposes of this appendix the following circumstances are 
the exclusive grounds constituting a reason to believe that the 
individual may alter or substitute a urine specimen:
    (1) The individual has presented a urine specimen that falls outside 
the normal temperature range, and the individual declines to provide a 
measurement of oral body temperature by sterile thermometer, as provided 
in paragraph (g)(14) of this appendix, or the oral temperature does not 
equal or exceed that of the specimen.
    (2) The last urine specimen provided by the individual (i.e., on a 
previous occasion) was determined by the laboratory to have a specific 
gravity of less than 1.003 or a creatinine concentration below .2 g/L.
    (3) The collection site person observes conduct clearly and 
unequivocally indicating an attempt to substitute or adulterate the 
sample (e.g., substitute urine in plain view, blue dye in specimen 
presented, etc.).
    (4) The individual has previously been determined to have used a 
substance inappropriately or without medical authorization and the 
particular test is being conducted as a part of a rehabilitation program 
or on return to service after evaluation and/or treatment for a 
confirmed positive test result.
    (g) ``Integrity and Identity of Specimens.'' Licensees shall take 
precautions to ensure that a urine specimen is not adulterated or 
diluted during the collection procedure, that a blood sample or breath 
exhalent tube cannot be substituted or tampered with, and that the 
information on the specimen container and in the record book can 
identify the individual from whom the specimen was collected. The 
following minimum precautions shall be taken to ensure that authentic 
specimens are obtained and correctly identified:
    (1) To deter the dilution of urine specimens at the collection site, 
toilet bluing agents shall be placed in toilet tanks wherever possible, 
so the reservoir of water in the toilet

[[Page 413]]

bowl always remains blue. There shall be no other source of water (e.g., 
no shower or sink) in the enclosure where urination occurs. If there is 
another source of water in the enclosure, it shall be effectively 
secured or monitored to ensure it is not used (undetected) as a source 
for diluting the specimen.
    (2) When an individual arrives at the collection site for a urine or 
breath test, the collection site person shall ensure that the individual 
is positively identified as the person selected for testing (e.g., 
through presentation of photo identification or identification by the 
employer's representative). If the individual's identity cannot be 
established, the collection site person shall not proceed with the 
collection.
    (3) If the individual fails to arrive for a urine or breath test at 
the assigned time, the collection site person shall contact the 
appropriate authority to obtain guidance on the action to be taken.
    (4) After the individual has been positively identified, the 
collection site person shall ask the individual to sign a consent-to-
testing form and to list all of the prescription medications and over-
the-counter preparations that he or she can remember using within the 
past 30 days.
    (5) The collection site person shall ask the individual to remove 
any unnecessary outer garments such as a coat or jacket that might 
conceal items or substances that could be used to tamper with or 
adulterate the individual's urine, breath, or blood specimen. The 
collection site person shall ensure that all personal belongings such as 
a purse or briefcase remain with the outer garments outside of the room 
in which the blood, breath, or urine sample is collected. The individual 
may retain his or her wallet.
    (6) The individual shall be instructed to wash and dry his or her 
hands prior to urination.
    (7) After washing hands prior to urination, the individual shall 
remain in the presence of the collection site person and shall not have 
access to any water fountain, faucet, soap dispenser, cleaning agent or 
any other materials which could be used to adulterate the urine 
specimen.
    (8) The individual may provide his/her urine specimen in the privacy 
of a stall or otherwise partitioned areas that allows for individual 
privacy.
    (9) The collection site person shall note any unusual behavior or 
appearance in the permanent record book and on the chain-of-custody 
form.
    (10) In the exceptional event that a designated collection site is 
inaccessible and there is an immediate requirement for urine specimen 
collection (e.g., an accident investigation), a public or on-site rest 
room may be used according to the following procedures. A collection 
site person of the same gender as the individual shall accompany the 
individual into the rest room which shall be made secure during the 
collection procedure. If possible, a toilet bluing agent shall be placed 
in the bowl and any accessible toilet tank. The collection site person 
shall remain in the rest room, but outside the stall, until the specimen 
is collected. If no bluing agent is available to deter specimen 
dilution, the collection site person shall instruct the individual not 
to flush the toilet until the specimen is delivered to the collection 
site person. After the collection site person has possession of the 
specimen, the individual will be instructed to flush the toilet and to 
participate with the collection site person in completing the chain-of-
custody procedures.
    (11) Upon receiving a urine specimen from the individual, the 
collection site person shall determine that it contains at least 60 
milliliters of urine. If there is less than 60 milliliters of urine in 
the container, additional urine shall be collected in a separate 
container to reach a total of 60 milliliters. (The temperature of the 
partial specimen in each separate container shall be measured in 
accordance with paragraph (f)(13) of this section, and the partial 
specimens shall be combined in one container.) The individual may be 
given a reasonable amount of liquid to drink for this purpose (e.g., a 
glass of water). If the individual fails for any reason to provide 60 
milliliters of urine, the collection site person shall contact the 
appropriate authority to obtain guidance on the action to be taken.
    (12) After the urine specimen has been provided and submitted to the 
collection site person, the individual shall be allowed to wash his or 
her hands.
    (13) Immediately after the urine specimen is collected, the 
collection site person shall measure the temperature of the specimen. 
The temperature measuring device used must accurately reflect the 
temperature of the specimen and not contaminate the specimen. The time 
from urination to temperature measurement is critical and in no case 
shall exceed 4 minutes.
    (14) If the temperature of a urine specimen is outside the range of 
32.5 deg.- 37.7  deg.C/90.5 deg.-99.8  deg.F, that is a reason to 
believe that the individual may have altered or substituted the 
specimen, and another specimen shall be collected under direct 
observation of a same gender collection site person and both specimens 
shall be forwarded to the laboratory for testing. An individual may 
volunteer to have his or her oral temperature taken to provide evidence 
to counter the reason to believe the individual may have altered or 
substituted the specimen caused by the specimen's temperature falling 
outside the prescribed range.
    (15) Immediately after a urine specimen is collected, the collection 
site person shall also inspect the specimen to determine its

[[Page 414]]

color and look for any signs of contaminants. Any unusual findings shall 
be noted in the permanent record book.
    (16) All urine specimens suspected of being adulterated or found to 
be diluted shall be forwarded to the laboratory for testing.
    (17) Whenever there is reason to believe that a particular 
individual may alter or substitute the urine specimen to be provided, a 
second specimen shall be obtained as soon as possible under the direct 
observation of a same gender collection site person. Where appropriate, 
measures will be taken to prevent additional hydration.
    (18) Alcohol breath tests shall be delayed at least 15 minutes if 
any source of mouth alcohol (e.g., breath fresheners) or any other 
substances are ingested (e.g., eating, smoking, regurgitation of stomach 
contents from vomiting or burping). The collection site person shall 
ensure that each breath specimen taken comes from the end, rather than 
the beginning, of the breath expiration. For each screening test, two 
breath specimens shall be collected from each individual no less than 
two minutes apart and no more than 10 minutes apart. The test results 
shall be considered accurate if the result of each measurement is within 
plus or minus 10 percent of the average of the two measurements. If the 
two tests do not agree, the breath tests shall be repeated on another 
evidential-grade breath analysis device. Confirmatory testing is 
accomplished by repeating the above procedure on another evidential-
grade breath analysis device.
    (19) If the alcohol breath tests indicates that the individual is 
positive for a BAC at or above the 0.04 percent cut-off level, the 
individual may request a confirmatory blood test, at his or her 
discretion. All vacuum tube and needle assemblies used for blood 
collection shall be factory-sterilized. The collection site person shall 
ensure that they remain properly sealed until used. Antiseptic swabbing 
of the skin shall be performed with a nonethanol antiseptic. Sterile 
procedures shall be followed when drawing blood and transferring the 
blood to a storage container; in addition, the container must be sterile 
and sealed.
    (20) Both the individual being tested and the collection site person 
shall keep urine and blood specimens in view at all times prior to their 
being sealed and labeled. If a urine specimen is split (as described in 
Section 2.7(j)) and if any specimen is transferred to a second 
container, the collection site person shall request the individual to 
observe the splitting of the urine sample or the transfer of the 
specimen and the placement of the tamperevident seal over the container 
caps and down the sides of the containers.
    (21) The collection site person and the individual shall be present 
at the same time during procedures outlined in paragraphs (h) through 
(j) of this section.
    (22) The collection site person shall place securely on each 
container an identification label which contains the date, the 
individual's specimen number, and any other identification information 
provided or required by the drug testing program. If separate from the 
labels, the tamperevident seals shall also be applied.
    (23) The individual shall initial the identification labels on the 
specimen containers for the purpose of certifying that it is the 
specimen collected from him or her.
    (i) The individual shall be asked to read and sign a statement on 
either the chain-of-custody form or in the permanent record book 
certifying that the specimens identified as having been collected from 
him or her are in fact the specimen he or she provided.
    (ii) The individual shall be provided an opportunity to set forth on 
the urine chain-of-custody form information concerning medications taken 
or administered in the past 30 days.
    (24) The collection site person shall enter in the permanent record 
book all information identifying the specimens. The collection site 
person shall sign the permanent record book next to the identifying 
information.
    (25) A higher level supervisor in the drug testing program shall 
review and concur in advance with any decision by a collection site 
person to obtain a urine specimen under the direct observation of a same 
gender collection site person based on a reason to believe that the 
individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided.
    (26) The collection site person shall complete the chain-of-custody 
forms for both the aliquot and the split sample, if collected, and shall 
certify proper completion of the collection.
    (27) The specimens and chain-of-custody forms are now ready for 
transfer to the laboratory or the licensee's testing facility. If the 
specimens are not immediately prepared for shipment, they shall be 
appropriately safeguarded during temporary storage.
    (28) While any part of the above chain-of-custody procedures is 
being performed, it is essential that the specimens and custody 
documents be under the control of the involved collection site person. 
The collection site person shall not leave the collection site in the 
interval between presentation of the specimen by the individual and 
securement of the samples with identifying labels bearing the 
individual's specimen identification numbers and seals initialled by the 
individual. If the involved collection site person leaves his or her 
work station momentarily, the specimens and chain-of-custody forms shall 
be taken with him or her or shall be secured. If the collection site 
person is leaving for an extended period of time, the specimens shall be 
packaged for transfer to the laboratory before he or she leaves the 
site.

[[Page 415]]

    (h) ``Collection Control.'' To the maximum extent possible, 
collection site personnel shall keep the individual's specimen 
containers within sight both before and after the individual has 
urinated or provided a breath or blood sample. After the specimen is 
collected and whenever urine specimens are split, they shall be properly 
sealed and labeled. A chain-of-custody form shall be used for 
maintaining control and accountability of each specimen from the point 
of collection to final disposition of the specimen. The date and purpose 
shall be documented on the chain-of-custody form each time a specimen is 
handled or transferred, and every individual in the chain of custody 
shall be identified. Every effort shall be made to minimize the number 
of persons handling specimens.
    (i) ``Transportation to Laboratory or Testing Facility.'' Collection 
site personnel shall arrange to transfer the collected specimens to the 
drug testing laboratory or licensee testing facility. To transfer 
specimens off-site for initial screening and for a second screen and 
confirmatory analysis of presumptive positive specimens and for 
transferring suspect specimens to a laboratory for analysis under 
special processing [Section 2.7(d)], the specimens shall be placed in 
containers designed to minimize the possibility of damage during 
shipment (e.g., specimen boxes, padded mailers, or bulk shipping 
containers with that capability) and those containers shall be securely 
sealed to eliminate the possibility of undetected tampering. On the tape 
sealing the container, the collection site person shall sign and enter 
the date specimens were sealed in the containers for shipment. The 
collection site personnel shall ensure that the chain-of-custody 
documentation is attached to each container sealed for shipment to the 
drug testing laboratory.
    (j) ``Failure to Cooperate.'' If the individual refuses to cooperate 
with the urine collection or breath analysis process (e.g., refusal to 
provide a complete specimen, complete paperwork, initial specimen), then 
the collection site person shall inform the Medical Review Officer and 
shall document the non-cooperation in the permanent record book and on 
the specimen custody and control form. The Medical Review Officer shall 
report the failure to cooperate to the appropriate management. The 
provision of blood specimens for use to confirm a positive breath test 
for alcohol shall be entirely voluntary, at the individual's discretion. 
In the absence of a voluntary blood test the second positive breath test 
shall be considered a confirmed positive.

                2.5.  HHS-certified Laboratory Personnel.

    (a) ``Day-to-Day Management of the HHS-certified Laboratories.''
    (1) The HHS-certified laboratory shall have a qualified individual

blindness, if appropriate.

                2.6  Licensee Testing Facility Personnel.

    (a) ``Day-to-Day Management of Operations.'' Any licensee testing 
facility shall have an individual to be responsible for day-to-day 
operations and to supervise the testing technicians. This individual(s) 
shall have at least a bachelor's degree in the chemical or biological 
sciences or medical technology or equivalent. He or she shall have 
training and experience in the theory and practice of the procedures 
used in the licensee testing facility, resulting in his or her thorough 
understanding of quality control practices and procedures; the review, 
interpretation, and reporting of test results; and proper remedial 
actions to be taken in response to detecting aberrant test or quality 
control results.
    (b) ``Other Personnel.'' Other technicians or nontechnical staff 
shall have the necessary training and skills for the tasks assigned.
    (c) ``Files.'' Licensees' testing facility personnel files shall 
include: resume of training and experience; certification or license, if 
any; references; job descriptions; records of performance evaluation and 
advancement; incident reports; results of tests which establish employee 
competency for the position he or she holds, such as a test for color 
blindness, if appropriate and appropriate data to support determinations 
of honesty and integrity conducted in accordance with Section 2.3 of 
this appendix.

        2.7  Laboratory and Testing Facility Analysis Procedures.

    (a) ``Security and Chain-of-Custody.''
    (1) HHS-certified drug testing laboratories and any licensee testing 
facility shall be secure at all times. They shall have in place 
sufficient security measures to control access to the premises and to 
ensure that no unauthorized personnel handle specimens or gain access to 
the laboratory processes or to areas where records and split samples are 
stored. Access to these secured areas shall be limited to specifically 
authorized individuals whose authorization is documented. All authorized 
visitors and maintenance and service personnel shall be escorted at all 
times in the HHS-certified laboratory and in the licensee's testing 
facility. Documentation of individuals accessing these areas, dates, and 
times of entry and purpose of entry must be maintained.
    (2) Laboratories and testing facilities shall use chain-of-custody 
procedures to maintain control and accountability of specimens from 
receipt through completion of testing, reporting of results, during 
storage, and continuing until final disposition of specimens. The date 
and purpose shall be documented on an appropriate chain-of-custody form 
each time a specimen is handled or transferred, and every individual in 
the chain shall be

[[Page 417]]

identified. Accordingly, authorized technicians shall be responsible for 
each urine specimen or aliquot in their possession and shall sign and 
complete chain-of-custody forms for those specimens or aliquots as they 
are received.
    (b) ``Receiving.''
    (1) When a shipment of specimens is received, laboratory and 
licensee's testing facility personnel shall inspect each package for 
evidence of possible tampering and compare information on specimen 
containers within each package to the information on the accompanying 
chain-of-custody forms. Any direct evidence of tampering or 
discrepancies in the information on specimen containers and the 
licensee's chain-of-custody forms attached to the shipment shall be 
reported within 24 hours to the licensee, in the case of HHS-certified 
laboratories, and shall be noted on the laboratory's chain-of-custody 
form which shall accompany the specimens while they are in the 
laboratory's possession. Indications of tampering with specimens at a 
testing facility operated by a licensee shall be reported within 8 hours 
to senior licensee management.
    (2) Specimen containers will normally be retained within the 
laboratory's or testing facility's accession area until all analyses 
have been completed. Aliquots and the chain-of-custody forms shall be 
used by laboratory or testing facility personnel for conducting initial 
and confirmatory tests, as appropriate.
    (c) ``Short-Term Refrigerated Storage.'' Specimens that do not 
receive an initial test within 7 days of arrival at the laboratory or 
are not shipped within 6 hours from the licensee's testing facility and 
any retained split samples shall be placed in secure refrigeration 
units. Temperatures shall not exceed 6  deg.C. Emergency power equipment 
shall be available in case of prolonged power failure.
    (d) ``Specimen Processing.'' Urine specimens identified as 
presumptive positive by a licensee's testing facility shall be shipped 
to an HHS-certified laboratory for testing. Laboratory facilities for 
drug testing will normally process urine specimens by grouping them into 
batches. The number of specimens in each batch may vary significantly 
depending on the size of the laboratory and its workload. When 
conducting either initial or confirmatory tests at either the licensee's 
testing facility or an HHS-certified laboratory, every batch shall 
contain an appropriate number of standards for calibrating the 
instrumentation and a minimum of 10 percent controls. Both quality 
control and blind performance test samples shall appear as ordinary 
samples to laboratory analysts. Special processing may be conducted to 
analyze specimens suspected of being adulterated or diluted (including 
hydration). Any evidence of adulteration or dilution, and any detected 
trace amounts of drugs or metabolites, shall be reported to the Medical 
Review Officer.
    (e) ``Preliminary Initial Test.''
    (1) For the analysis of urine specimens, any preliminary test 
performed by a licensee's testing facility and the initial screening 
test performed by a HHS-certified laboratory shall use an immunoassay 
which meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for 
commercial distribution. The initial test of breath for alcohol 
performed at the collection site shall use a breath measurement device 
which meets the requirements of Section 2.7(o)(3). The following initial 
cut-off levels shall be used when screening specimens to determine 
whether they are negative for the indicated substances:

    Initial test cut-off level (ng/ml)

 Marijuana metabolites...............................................100
Cocaine metabolites..................................................300
Opiate metabolites..................................................300*
Phencyclidine.........................................................25
Amphetamines.......................................................1,000
Alcohol........................................................0.04% BAC

    *25 ng/ml is immunoassay specific for free morphine.

    In addition, licensees may specify more stringent cutoff levels. 
Results shall be reported for both levels in such cases.

    (2) The list of substances to be tested and the cut-off levels are 
subject to change by the NRC in response to industry experience and 
changes to the HHS Guidelines made by the Department of Health and Human 
Services as advances in technology, additional experience, or other 
considerations warrant the inclusion of additional substances and other 
concentration levels.
    (f) ``Confirmatory Test.''
    (1) Specimens which test negative as a result of this second 
screening shall be reported as negative to the licensee and will not be 
subject to any further testing unless special processing of the specimen 
is desired because adulteration or dilution is suspected.
    (2) All urine samples identified as presumptive positive on the 
screening test performed by a HHS-certified laboratory shall be 
confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques 
at the cut-off values listed in this paragraph for each drug, and at the 
cut-off values required by the licensee's unique program, where 
differences exist. All confirmations shall be by quantitative analysis. 
Concentrations which exceed the linear region of the standard curve 
shall be documented in the laboratory record as ``greater than highest 
standard curve value.''

    Confirmatory test cut-off level (ng/ml)

Marijuana metabolite.................................................15*
Cocaine metabolite.................................................150**
Opiates:
  Morphine...........................................................300

[[Page 418]]

  Codeine............................................................300
Phencyclidine.........................................................25
Amphetamines:
  Amphetamine........................................................500
  Methamphetamine....................................................500
Alcohol........................................................0.04% BAC

    *Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid.
    **Benzoylecgonine.

    In addition, licensees may specify more stringent cut-off levels. 
Results shall be reported for both levels in such cases.
    (3) The analytic procedure for confirmatory analysis of blood 
specimens voluntarily provided by individuals testing positive for 
alcohol on a breath test shall be gas chromatography analysis.
    (4) The list of substances to be tested and the cut-off levels are 
subject to change by the NRC in response to industry experience and 
changes to the HHS Guidelines made by the Department of Health and Human 
Services as advances in technology, additional experience, or other 
considerations warrant the inclusion of additional substances and other 
concentration levels.
    (5) Confirmatory tests for opiates shall include a test for 6-
monoacetylmorphine (MAM) if the screening test is presumptive positive 
for morphine.
    (g) ``Reporting Results.''
    (1) The HHS-certified laboratory shall report test results to the 
licensee's Medical Review Officer within 5 working days after receipt of 
the specimen by the laboratory. Before any test result is reported (the 
results of initial tests, confirmatory tests, or quality control data), 
it shall be reviewed and the test certified as an accurate report by the 
responsible individual at the laboratory. The report shall identify the 
substances tested for, whether positive or negative, the cut-off(s) for 
each, the specimen number assigned by the licensee, and the drug testing 
laboratory specimen identification number. The results (positive and 
negative) for all specimens submitted at the same time to the laboratory 
shall be reported back to the Medical Review Officer at the same time 
when possible.
    (2) The HHS-certified laboratory and any licensee testing facility 
shall report as negative all specimens, except suspect specimens being 
analyzed under special processing, which are negative on the initial 
test or negative on the confirmatory test. Specimens testing positive on 
the confirmatory analysis shall be reported positive for a specific 
substance. Except as provided in Sec. 26.24(d), presumptive positive 
results of preliminary testing at the licensee's testing facility will 
not be reported to licensee management.
    (3) The Medical Review Officer may routinely obtain from the HHS-
certified laboratory, and the laboratory shall provide, quantitation of 
test results. The Medical Review Officer may only disclose quantitation 
of test results for an individual to licensee management, if required in 
an appeals process, or to the individual under the provisions of Section 
3.2. (This does not preclude the provision of program performance data 
under the provisions of 10 CFR 26.71(d).) Quantitation of negative tests 
for urine specimens shall not be disclosed, except where deemed 
appropriate by the Medical Review Officer for proper disposition of the 
results of tests of suspect specimens. Alcohol quantitation for a blood 
specimen shall be provided to licensee management with the Medical 
Review Officer's evaluation.
    (4) The laboratory may transmit results to the Medical Review 
Officer by various electronic means (e.g., teleprinters, facsimile, or 
computer) in a manner designed to ensure confidentiality of the 
information. Results may not be provided verbally by telephone from HHS-
certified laboratory personnel to the Medical Review Officer. The HHS-
certified laboratory must ensure the security of the data transmission 
and limit access to any data transmission, storage, and retrieval 
system.
    (5) The laboratory shall send only to the Medical Review Officer a 
certified copy of the original chain-of-custody form signed by the 
individual responsible for day-to-day management of the drug testing 
laboratory or the individual responsible for attesting to the validity 
of the test reports and attached to which shall be a copy of the test 
report.
    (6) The HHS-certified laboratory and the licensee's testing facility 
shall provide to the licensee official responsible for coordination of 
the fitness-for-duty program a monthly statistical summary of urinalysis 
and blood testing and shall not include in the summary any personal 
identifying information. Initial test data from the licensee's testing 
facility and the HHS-certified laboratory, and confirmation data from 
HHS-certified laboratories shall be included for test results reported 
within that month. Normally this summary shall be forwarded from HHS-
certified laboratories by registered or certified mail and from the 
licensee's testing facility not more than 14 calendar days after the end 
of the month covered by the summary. The summary shall contain the 
following information:
    (i) Initial Testing:
    (A) Number of specimens received;
    (B) Number of specimens reported out; and
    (C) Number of specimens screened
positive for:

Marijuana metabolites
Cocaine metabolites
Opiate metabolites
Phencyclidine
Amphetamines
Alcohol

    (ii) Confirmatory Testing:

[[Page 419]]

    (A) Number of specimens received for confirmation;
    (B) Number of specimens confirmed positive for:

Marijuana metabolite
Cocaine metabolite
Morphine, codeine
Phencyclidine
Amphetamine
Methamphetamine
Alcohol

    (7) The statistics shall be presented for both the cut-off levels in 
these guidelines and any more stringent cut-off levels which licensees 
may specify. The HHS-certified laboratory and the licensee's testing 
facility shall make available quantitative results for all samples 
tested when requested by the NRC or the licensee for which the 
laboratory is performing drug testing services.
    (8) Unless otherwise instructed by the licensee in writing, all 
records pertaining to a given urine or blood specimen shall be retained 
by the HHS-certified drug testing laboratory and the licensee's testing 
facility for a minimum of 2 years.
    (h) ``Long-Term Storage.'' Long-term frozen storage (-20  deg.C or 
less) ensures that positive urine specimens will be available for any 
necessary retest during administrative or disciplinary proceedings. 
Unless otherwise authorized in writing by the licensee, HHS-certified 
laboratories shall retain and place in properly secured long-term frozen 
storage for a minimum of 1 year all specimens confirmed positive. Within 
this 1-year period a licensee or the NRC may request the laboratory to 
retain the specimen for an additional period of time, but if no such 
request is received, the laboratory may discard the specimen after the 
end of 1 year, except that the laboratory shall be required to maintain 
any specimens under legal challenge for an indefinite period. Any split 
samples retained by the licensee shall be transferred into long-term 
storage upon determination by the Medical Review Officer that the 
specimen has a confirmed positive test.
    (i) ``Retesting Specimens.'' Because some analytes deteriorate or 
are lost during freezing and/or storage, quantitation for a retest is 
not subject to a specific cut-off requirement but must provide data 
sufficient to confirm the presence of the drug or metabolite.
    (j) ``Split Samples.'' Urine specimens may be split, at the 
licensee's discretion, into two parts at the collection site. One half 
of such samples (hereafter called the aliquot) shall be analyzed by the 
licensee's testing facility or the HHS-certified laboratory for the 
licensee's purposes as described in this appendix. The other half of the 
sample (hereafter called the split sample) may be withheld from transfer 
to the laboratory, sealed, and stored in a secure manner by the licensee 
until the aliquot has been determined to be negative or until the 
positive result of a screening test has been confirmed. As soon as the 
aliquot has tested negative, the split sample in storage may be 
destroyed. If the aliquot tests positive by confirmatory testing, then, 
at the tested individual's request, the split sample may be forwarded on 
that day to another HHS-certified laboratory that did not test the 
aliquot. The chain-of-custody and testing procedures to which the split 
sample is subject, shall be the same as those used to test the initial 
aliquot and shall meet the standards for retesting specimens [Section 
2.7(i)]. The quantitative results of any second testing process shall be 
made available to the Medical Review Officer and to the individual 
tested.
    (k) ``Subcontracting.'' HHS-certified laboratories shall not 
subcontract and shall perform all work with their own personnel and 
equipment unless otherwise authorized by the licensee. The laboratory 
must be capable of performing testing of the five classes of drugs 
(marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and amphetamines) and of 
whole blood and confirmatory GC/MS methods specified in these 
guidelines.
    (l) ``Laboratory Facilities.''
    (1) HHS-certified laboratories shall comply with applicable 
provisions of any State licensure requirements.
    (2) HHS-certified laboratories shall have the capability, at the 
same laboratory premises, of performing initial tests for each drug and 
drug metabolite for which service is offered, and for performing 
confirmatory tests for alcohol and for each drug and drug metabolite for 
which service is offered. Any licensee testing facilities shall have the 
capability, at the same premises, of performing initial screening tests 
for each drug and drug metabolite for which testing is conducted. Breath 
tests for alcohol may be performed at the collection site.
    (m) ``Inspections.'' The NRC and any licensee utilizing an HHS-
certified laboratory shall reserve the right to inspect the laboratory 
at any time. Licensee contracts with HHS-certified laboratories for drug 
testing and alcohol confirmatory testing, as well as contracts for 
collection site services, shall permit the NRC and the licensee to 
conduct unannounced inspections. In addition, prior to the award of a 
contract, the licensee shall carry out pre-award inspections and 
evaluation of the procedural aspects of the laboratory's drug testing 
operation. The NRC shall reserve the right to inspect a licensee's 
testing facility at any time.
    (n) ``Documentation.'' HHS-certified laboratories and the licensee's 
testing facility shall maintain and make available for at least 2 years 
documentation of all aspects of the testing process. This 2-year period 
may be extended upon written notification by the NRC or by any licensee 
for which laboratory

[[Page 420]]

services are being provided. The required documentation shall include 
personnel files on all individuals authorized to have access to 
specimens; chain-of-custody documents; quality assurance/quality control 
records; procedure manuals; all test data (including calibration curves 
and any calculations used in determining test results); reports; 
performance records on performance testing; performance on certification 
inspections; and hard copies of computer-generated data. The HHS-
certified laboratory and the licensee's testing facility shall be 
required to maintain documents for any specimen under legal challenge 
for an indefinite period.
    (o) ``Additional Requirements for HHS-certified Laboratories and 
Licensee's Testing Facilities.''
    (1) ``Procedure manual.'' Each laboratory and licensee's testing 
facility shall have a procedure manual which includes the principles of 
each test, preparation of reagents, standards and controls, calibration 
procedures, derivation of results, linearity of methods, sensitivity of 
the methods, cutoff values, mechanisms for reporting results, controls, 
criteria for unacceptable specimens and results, remedial actions to be 
taken when the test systems are outside of acceptable limits, reagents 
and expiration dates, and references. Copies of all procedures and dates 
on which they are in effect shall be maintained as part of the manual. 
Superseded material must be retained for three years.
    (2) ``Standards and controls.'' HHS-certified laboratory standards 
shall be prepared with pure drug standards which are properly labeled as 
to content and concentration. The standards shall be labeled with the 
following dates: when received; when prepared or opened; when placed in 
service; and expiration date.
    (3) ``Instruments and equipment.''
    (i) Volumetric pipettes and measuring devices shall be certified for 
accuracy or be checked by gravimetric, colorimetric, or other 
verification procedure. Automatic pipettes and dilutors shall be checked 
for accuracy and reproducibility before being placed in service and 
checked periodically thereafter.
    (ii) Alcohol breath analysis equipment shall be an evidental-grade 
breath alcohol analysis device of a brand and model that conforms to 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards (49 FR 
48855) and to any applicable State statutes.
    (iii) There shall be written procedures for instrument set-up and 
normal operation, a schedule for checking critical operating 
characteristics for all instruments, tolerance limits for acceptable 
function checks, and instructions for major troubleshooting and repair. 
Records shall be available on preventive maintenance.
    (4) ``Remedial actions.'' There shall be written procedures for the 
actions to be taken when systems are out of acceptable limits or errors 
are detected. There shall be documentation that these procedures are 
followed and that all necessary corrective actions are taken. There 
shall also be in place systems to verify all stages of testing and 
reporting and documentation that these procedures are followed.
    (5) ``Personnel available to testify at proceedings.'' The 
licensee's testing facility and HHS-certified laboratory shall have 
qualified personnel available to testify in an administrative or 
disciplinary proceeding against an individual when that proceeding is 
based on positive breath analysis or urinalysis results reported by the 
licensee's testing facility or the HHS-certified laboratory.

               2.8  Quality Assurance and Quality Control.

    (a) ``General.'' HHS-certified laboratories and the licensee's 
testing facility shall have a quality assurance program which 
encompasses all aspects of the testing process including but not limited 
to specimen acquisition, chain-of-custody, security, reporting of 
results, initial and confirmatory testing, and validation of analytical 
procedures. Quality assurance procedures shall be designed, implemented, 
and reviewed to monitor the conduct of each step of the process of 
testing for drugs.
    (b) ``Licensee's Testing Facility Quality Control Requirements for 
Initial Tests.'' Because all positive preliminary tests for drugs are 
forwarded to an HHS-certified laboratory for screening and confirmatory 
testing when appropriate, the NRC does not require licensees to assess 
their testing facility's false positive rates for drugs. To ensure that 
the rate of false negative tests is kept to the minimum that the 
immunoassay technology supports, licensees shall process blind 
performance test specimens and submit a sampling of specimens screened 
as negative from every test run to the HHS-certified laboratory. In 
addition, the manufacturer-required performance tests of the breath 
analysis equipment used by the licensee shall be conducted as set forth 
in the manufacturer's specifications.
    (c) ``Laboratory Quality Control Requirements for Initial Tests at 
HHS-Certified Laboratories.'' Each analytical run of specimens to be 
screened shall include:
    (1) Urine specimens certified to contain no drug;
    (2) Urine specimens fortified with known standards; and
    (3) Positive controls with the drug or metabolite at or near the 
threshold (cut-off).
    In addition, with each batch of samples, a sufficient number of 
standards shall be included to ensure and document the linearity

[[Page 421]]

of the assay method over time in the concentration area of the cut-off. 
After acceptable values are obtained for the known standards, those 
values will be used to calculate sample data. Implementation of 
procedures to ensure that carryover does not contaminate the testing of 
an individual's specimen shall be documented. A minimum of 10 percent of 
all test samples shall be quality control specimens. Laboratory quality 
control samples, prepared from spiked urine samples of determined 
concentration, shall be included in the run and should appear as normal 
samples to laboratory analysts. One percent of each run, with a minimum 
of at least one sample, shall be the laboratory's own quality control 
samples.
    (d) ``Laboratory Quality Control Requirements for Confirmation 
Tests.'' Each analytical run of specimens to be confirmed shall include:
    (1) Urine specimens certified to contain no drug;
    (2) Urine specimens fortified with known standards; and
    (3) Positive controls with the drug or metabolite at or near the 
threshold (cut-off).
    The linearity and precision of the method shall be periodically 
documented. Implementation of procedures to ensure that carryover does 
not contaminate the testing of an individual's specimen shall also be 
documented.
    (e) ``Licensee Blind Performance Test Procedures.''
    (1) Licensees shall purchase chemical testing services only from 
laboratories certified by DHHS or a DHHS-recognized certification 
program in accordance with the HHS Guidelines. Laboratory participation 
is encouraged in other performance testing surveys by which the 
laboratory's performance is compared with peers and reference 
laboratories.
    (2) During the initial 90-day period of any new drug testing 
program, each licensee shall submit blind performance test specimens to 
each HHS-certified laboratory it contracts within the amount of at least 
50 percent of the total number of samples submitted (up to a maximum of 
500 samples) and thereafter a minimum of 10 percent of all samples (to a 
maximum of 250) submitted per quarter.
    (3) Approximately 80 percent of the blind performance test samples 
shall be blank (i.e., certified to contain no drug) and the remaining 
samples shall be positive for one or more drugs per sample in a 
distribution such that all the drugs to be tested are included in 
approximately equal frequencies of challenge. The positive samples shall 
be spiked only with those drugs for which the licensee is testing.
    (4) The licensee shall investigate, or shall refer to DHHS for 
investigation, any unsatisfactory performance testing result, and based 
on this investigation, the laboratory shall take action to correct the 
cause of the unsatisfactory performance test result. A record shall be 
made of the investigative findings and the corrective action taken by 
the laboratory, and that record shall be dated and signed by the 
individuals responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of 
the HHS-certified laboratory. Then the licensee shall send the document 
to the NRC as a report of the unsatisfactory performance testing 
incident within 30 days. The NRC shall ensure notification of the 
finding to DHHS.
    (5) Should a false positive error occur on a blind performance test 
specimen and the error is determined to be an administrative error 
(clerical, sample mixup, etc.), the licensee shall promptly notify the 
NRC. The licensees shall require the laboratory to take corrective 
action to minimize the occurrence of the particular error in the future; 
and, if there is reason to believe the error could have been systematic, 
the licensee may also require review and reanalysis of previously run 
specimens.
    (6) Should a false positive error occur on a blind performance test 
specimen and the error is determined to be a technical or methodological 
error, the licensee shall instruct the laboratory to submit to them all 
quality control data from the batch of specimens which included the 
false positive specimen. In addition, the licensee shall require the 
laboratory to retest all specimens analyzed positive for that drug or 
metabolite from the time of final resolution of the error back to the 
time of the last satisfactory performance test cycle. This retesting 
shall be documented by a statement signed by the individual responsible 
for day-to-day management of the laboratory's substance testing program. 
The licensee and the NRC may require an on-site review of the laboratory 
which may be conducted unannounced during any hours of operation of the 
laboratory. Based on information provided by the NRC, DHHS has the 
option of revoking or suspending the laboratory's certification or 
recommending that no further action be taken if the case is one of less 
serious error in which corrective action has already been taken, thus 
reasonably assuring that the error will not occur again.

                  2.9  Reporting and Review of Results

    (a) ``Medical Review Officer shall review results.'' An essential 
part of the licensees' testing programs is the final review of results. 
A positive test result does not automatically identify a nuclear power 
plant worker as having used substances in violation of the NRC's 
regulations or the licensee's company policies. An individual with a 
detailed knowledge of possible alternate medical explanations is 
essential to the review of results. This review shall be performed by 
the Medical Review Officer prior

[[Page 422]]

to the transmission of results to licensee management officials.
    (b) ``Medical Review Officer--qualifications and responsibilities.'' 
The Medical Review Officer shall be a licensed physician with knowledge 
of substance abuse disorders and may be a licensee or contract employee. 
The role of the Medical Review Officer is to review and interpret 
positive test results obtained through the licensee's testing program. 
In carrying out this responsibility, the Medical Review Officer shall 
examine alternate medical explanations for any positive test result 
(this does not include confirmation of blood alcohol levels obtained 
through the use of a breath alcohol anaylsis device). This action could 
include conducting a medical interview with the individual, review of 
the individual's medical history, or review of any other relevant 
biomedical factors. The Medical Review Officer shall review all medical 
records made available by the tested individual when a confirmed 
positive test could have resulted from legally prescribed medication. 
The Medical Review Officer shall not consider the results of tests that 
are not obtained or processed in accordance with these Guidelines, 
although he or she may consider the results of tests on split samples in 
making his or her determination, as long as those split samples have 
been stored and tested in accordance with the procedures described in 
these Guidelines.
    (c) ``Positive Test Results.'' Prior to making a final decision to 
verify a positive test result, the Medical Review Officer shall give the 
individual an opportunity to discuss the test result with him or her. 
Following verification of a positive test result, the Medical Review 
Officer shall, as provided in the licensee's policy, notify the 
applicable employee assistance program and the licensee's management 
official empowered to recommend or take administrative action (or the 
official's designated agent).
    (d) ``Verification for opiates; review for prescription 
medication.'' Before the Medical Review Officer verifies a confirmed 
positive result and the licensee takes action for opiates, he or she 
shall determine that there is clinical evidence--in addition to the 
urine test--of unauthorized use of any opium, opiate, or opium 
derivative (e.g., morphine/codeine). Clinical signs of abuse include 
recent needle tracks or behavioral and psychological signs of acute 
opiate intoxication or withdrawal. This requirement does not apply if 
the GC/MS confirmation testing for opiates confirms the presence of 6-
monoacetylmorphine. For other drugs that are commonly prescribed or 
commonly included in over-the-counter preparations (e.g., 
benzodiazepines in the first case, barbiturates in the second) and that 
are listed in the licensee's panel of substances to be tested, the 
Medical Review Officer shall also determine whether there is clinical 
evidence--in addition to the urine test--of unauthorized use of any of 
these substances or their derivatives.
    (e) ``Reanalysis authorized.'' Should any question arise as to the 
accuracy or validity of a positive test result, only the Medical Review 
Officer is authorized to order a reanalysis of the original sample and 
such retests are authorized only at laboratories certified by DHHS. The 
Medical Review Officer shall authorize a reanalysis of the original 
aliquot on timely request of the individual tested, and shall also 
authorize an analysis of any sample stored by the licensee.
    (f) ``Results consistent with responsible substance use.'' If the 
Medical Review Officer determines that there is a legitimate medical 
explanation for the positive test result and that use of the substance 
identified through testing in the manner and at the dosage prescribed 
does not reflect a lack of reliability and is unlikely to create on-the-
job impairment, the Medical Review Officer shall report the test result 
to the licensee as negative.
    (g) ``Result scientifically insufficient.'' Additionally, the 
Medical Review Officer, based on review of inspection reports, quality 
control data, multiple samples, and other pertinent results, may 
determine that the result is scientifically insufficient for further 
action and declare the test specimen negative. In this situation, the 
Medical Review Officer may request reanalysis of the original sample 
before making this decision. (The Medical Review Officer may request 
that reanalysis be performed by the same laboratory or, that an aliquot 
of the original specimen be sent for reanalysis to an alternate 
laboratory which is certified in accordance with the HHS Guidelines.) 
The licensee's testing facility and the HHS-certified laboratory shall 
assist in this review process as requested by the Medical Review Officer 
by making available the individual(s) responsible for day-to-day 
management of the licensee's test facility, of the HHS-certified 
laboratory or other individuals who are forensic toxicologists or who 
have equivalent forensic experience in urine drug testing, to provide 
specific consultation as required by the licensee. The licensee shall 
maintain records that summarize any negative findings based on 
scientific insufficiency and shall make them available to the NRC on 
request, but shall not include any personal identifying information in 
such reports.

                     Subpart C--Employee Protection

                   3.1  Protection of Employee Records

    Licensee contracts with HHS certified laboratories and procedures 
for the licensee's testing facility shall require that test

[[Page 423]]

records be maintained in confidence, as provided in 10 CFR 26.29. 
Records shall be maintained and used with the highest regard for 
individual privacy.

   3.2  Individual Access to Test and Laboratory Certification Results

    Any individual who is the subject of a drug or alcohol test under 
this part shall, upon written request, have access to any records 
relating to his or her tests and any records relating to the results of 
any relevant laboratory certification, review, or revocation-of-
certification proceedings.

  Subpart D--Certification of Laboratories Engaged in Chemical Testing

                 4.1  Use of DHHS-certified laboratories

    (a) Licensees subject to this part and their contractors shall use 
only laboratories certified under the DHHS ``Mandatory Guidelines for 
Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'', Subpart C--``Certification of 
Laboratories Engaged in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' (53 
FR 11970, 11986-11989) dated April 11, 1988, and subsequent amendments 
thereto for screening and confirmatory testing except for initial 
screening tests at a licensee's testing facility conducted in accordance 
with 10 CFR 26.24(d). Information concerning the current certification 
status of laboratories is available from: The Office of Workplace 
Initiatives, National Institute on Drug Abuse, 5600 Fishers Lane, 
Rockville, Maryland 20857.
    (b) Licensees or their contractors may use only HHS-certified 
laboratories that agree to follow the same rigorous chemical testing, 
quality control, and chain-of-custody procedures when testing for more 
stringent cut-off levels as may be specified by licensees for the 
classes of drugs identified in this Part, for analysis of blood 
specimens for alcohol, and for any other substances included in 
licensees' drug panels.

Sec. 30.7  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a 
Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission 
licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain 
protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of 
requirements imposed under either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory 
text.
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraphs (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be 
grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee or applicant.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each specific licensee, each applicant for a specific 
license, and each general licensee subject to part 19 shall prominently 
post the revision of NRC

[[Page 429]]

Form 3, ``Notice to Employees,'' referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(c).
    (2) The posting of NRC Form 3 must be at locations sufficient to 
permit employees protected by this section to observe a copy on the way 
to or from their place of work. Premises must be posted not later than 
30 days after an application is docketed and remain posted while the 
application is pending before the Commission, during the term of the 
license, and for 30 days following license termination.
    (3) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in Appendix D to Part 20 of this chapter or by 
calling the NRC Information and Records Management Branch at (301) 415-
7230.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

economic, technical, and other benefits against environmental costs and 
considering available alternatives, that the action called for is the 
issuance of the proposed license, with any appropriate conditions to 
protect environmental values. Commencement of construction prior to such 
conclusion shall be grounds for denial of a license to receive and 
possess byproduct material in such plant or facility. As used in this 
paragraph the term ``commencement of construction'' means any clearing 
of land, excavation, or other substantial action that would adversely 
affect the environment of a site. The term does not mean site 
exploration, necessary roads for site exploration, borings to determine 
foundation conditions, or other preconstruction monitoring or testing to 
establish background information related to the suitability of the site 
or the protection of environmental values.
    (b) Upon a determination that an application meets the requirements 
of the Act, and the regulations of the Commission, the Commission will 
issue a specific license authorizing the possession and use of byproduct 
material (Form NRC 374, ``Byproduct Material License'').

Sec. 30.35  Financial assurance and recordkeeping for decommissioning.

    (a) Each applicant for a specific license authorizing the possession 
and use of unsealed byproduct material of half-life greater than 120 
days and in quantities exceeding 10 \5\ times the applicable quantities 
set forth in appendix B to part 30 shall submit a decommissioning 
funding plan as described in paragraph (e) of this section. The 
decommissioning funding plan must also be submitted when a combination 
of isotopes is involved if R divided by 10 \5\ is greater than 1 (unity 
rule), where R is defined here as the sum of the ratios of the quantity 
of each isotope to the applicable value in appendix B to part 30.
    (b) Each applicant for a specific license authorizing possession and 
use of byproduct material of half-life greater than 120 days and in 
quantities specified in paragraph (d) of this section shall either--
    (1) Submit a decommissioning funding plan as described in paragraph 
(e) of this section; or
    (2) Submit a certification that financial assurance for 
decommissioning has been provided in the amount prescribed by paragraph 
(d) of this section using one of the methods described in paragraph (f) 
of this section. For an applicant, this certification may state that the 
appropriate assurance will be obtained after the application has been 
approved and the license issued but before the receipt of licensed 
material. If the applicant defers execution of the financial instrument 
until after the license has been issued, a signed original of the 
financial instrument obtained to

[[Page 439]]

satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section must be 
submitted to NRC before receipt of licensed material. If the applicant 
does not defer execution of the financial instrument, the applicant 
shall submit to NRC, as part of the certification, a signed original of 
the financial instrument obtained to satisfy the requirements of 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (c)(1) Each holder of a specific license issued on or after July 27, 
1990, which is of a type described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, shall provide financial assurance for decommissioning in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.
    (2) Each holder of a specific license issued before July 27, 1990, 
and of a type described in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit, 
on or before July 27, 1990, a decommissioning funding plan as described 
in paragraph (e) of this section or a certification of financial 
assurance for decommissioning in an amount at least equal to $750,000 in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. If the licensee 
submits the certification of financial assurance rather than a 
decommissioning funding plan, the licensee shall include a 
decommissioning funding plan in any application for license renewal.
    (3) Each holder of a specific license issued before July 27, 1990, 
and of a type described in paragraph (b) of this section shall submit, 
on or before July 27, 1990, a decommissioning funding plan as described, 
in paragraph (e) of this section, or a certification of financial 
assurance for decommissioning in accordance with the criteria set forth 
in this section.
    (4) Any licensee who has submitted an application before July 27, 
1990, for renewal of license in accordance with Sec. 30.37 shall provide 
financial assurance for decommissioning in accordance with paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section. This assurance must be submitted when this 
rule becomes effective November 24, 1995.
    (d) Table of required amounts of financial assurance for 
decommissioning by quantity of material.


greater than 10 \4\ but less than or equal to 10 \5\ times              
 the applicable quantities of appendix B to part 30 in                  
 unsealed form. (For a combination of isotopes, if R, as                
 defined in Sec.  30.35(a), divided by 10 \4\ is greater than           
 1 but R divided by 10 \5\ is less than or equal to 1.)......   $750,000
                                                                        
greater than 10 \3\ but less than or equal to 10 \4\ times              
 the applicable quantities of appendix B to part 30 in                  
 unsealed form. (For a combination of isotopes, if R, as                
 defined in Sec.  30.35(a), divided by 10 \3\ is greater than           
 1 but R divided by 10 \4\ is less than or equal to 1.)......   $150,000
                                                                        
greater than 10 \10\ times the applicable quantities of                 
 appendix B to part 30 in sealed sources or plated foils.               
 (For a combination of isotopes, if R, as defined in Sec.               
 30.35(a), divided by 10 \10\ is greater than 1).............    $75,000
                                                                        


    (e) Each decommissioning funding plan must contain a cost estimate 
for decommissioning and a description of the method of assuring funds 
for decommissioning from paragraph (f) of this section, including means 
for adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels periodically 
over the life of the facility. The decommissioning funding plan must 
also contain a certification by the licensee that financial assurance 
for decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate 
for decommissioning and a signed original of the financial instrument 
obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Financial assurance for decommissioning must be provided by one 
or more of the following methods:
    (1) Prepayment. Prepayment is the deposit prior to the start of 
operation into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside 
the licensee's administrative control of cash or liquid assets such that 
the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs. 
Prepayment may be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government 
fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government securities.
    (2) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These 
methods guarantee that decommissioning costs will be paid. A surety 
method

[[Page 440]]

may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of 
credit. A parent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs 
based on a financial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as 
contained in appendix A of this part. A parent company guarantee may not 
be used in combination with other financial methods to satisfy the 
requirements of this section. A guarantee of funds by the applicant or 
licensee for decommissioning costs based on a financial test may be used 
if the guarantee and test are as contained in appendix C of this part. A 
guarantee by the applicant or licensee may not be used in combination 
with any other financial methods to satisfy the requirements of this 
section or in any situation where the applicant or licensee has a parent 
company holding majority control of the voting stock of the company. Any 
surety method or insurance used to provide financial assurance for 
decommissioning must contain the following conditions:
    (i) The surety method or insurance must be open-ended or, if written 
for a specified term, such as five years, must be renewed automatically 
unless 90 days or more prior to the renewal date, the issuer notifies 
the Commission, the beneficiary, and the licensee of its intention not 
to renew. The surety method or insurance must also provide that the full 
face amount be paid to the beneficiary automatically prior to the 
expiration without proof of forfeiture if the licensee fails to provide 
a replacement acceptable to the Commission within 30 days after receipt 
of notification of cancellation.
    (ii) The surety method or insurance must be payable to a trust 
established for decommissioning costs. The trustee and trust must be 
acceptable to the Commission. An acceptable trustee includes an 
appropriate State or Federal government agency or an entity which has 
the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are 
regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.
    (iii) The surety method or insurance must remain in effect until the 
Commission has terminated the license.
    (3) An external sinking fund in which deposits are made at least 
annually, coupled with a surety method or insurance, the value of which 
may decrease by the amount being accumulated in the sinking fund. An 
external sinking fund is a fund established and maintained by setting 
aside funds periodically in an account segregated from licensee assets 
and outside the licensee's administrative control in which the total 
amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs at the 
time termination of operation is expected. An external sinking fund may 
be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government fund, certificate 
of deposit, or deposit of government securities. The surety or insurance 
provisions must be as stated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (4) In the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, a 
statement of intent containing a cost estimate for decommissioning or an 
amount based on the Table in paragraph (d) of this section, and 
indicating that funds for decommissioning will be obtained when 
necessary.
    (g) Each person licensed under this part or parts 32 through 36 and 
39 of this chapter shall keep records of information important to the 
decommissioning of a facility in an identified location until the site 
is released for unrestricted use. Before licensed activities are 
transferred or assigned in accordance with Sec. 30.34(b), licensees 
shall transfer all records described in this paragraph to the new 
licensee. In this case, the new licensee will be responsible for 
maintaining these records until the license is terminated. If records 
important to the decommissioning of a facility are kept for other 
purposes, reference to these records and their locations may be used. 
Information the Commission considers important to decommissioning 
consists of--
    (1) Records of spills or other unusual occurrences involving the 
spread of contamination in and around the facility, equipment, or site. 
These records may be limited to instances when contamination remains 
after any cleanup procedures or when there is reasonable likelihood that 
contaminants may have spread to inaccessible areas as in the case of 
possible seepage into porous materials such as concrete. These

[[Page 441]]

records must include any known information on identification of involved 
nuclides, quantities, forms, and concentrations.
    (2) As-built drawings and modifications of structures and equipment 
in restricted areas where radioactive materials are used and/or stored, 
and of locations of possible inaccessible contamination such as buried 
pipes which may be subject to contamination. If required drawings are 
referenced, each relevant document need not be indexed individually. If 
drawings are not available, the licensee shall substitute appropriate 
records of available information concerning these areas and locations.
    (3) Except for areas containing only sealed sources (provided the 
sources have not leaked or no contamination remains after any leak) or 
byproduct materials having only half-lives of less than 65 days, a list 
contained in a single document and updated every 2 years, of the 
following:
    (i) All areas designated and formerly designated restricted areas as 
defined in 10 CFR 20.1003 (For requirements prior to January 1, 1994, 
see 10 CFR 20.3 as contained in the CFR edition revised as of January 1, 
1993.);
    (ii) All areas outside of restricted areas that require 
documentation under Sec. 30.35(g)(1).
    (iii) All areas outside of restricted areas where current and 
previous wastes have been buried as documented under 10 CFR 20.2108; and
    (iv) All areas outside of restricted areas which contain material 
such that, if the license expired, the licensee would be required to 
either decontaminate the area to unrestricted release levels or apply 
for approval for disposal under 10 CFR 20.2002.
    (4) Records of the cost estimate performed for the decommissioning 
funding plan or of the amount certified for decommissioning, and records 
of the funding method used for assuring funds if either a funding plan 
or certification is used.

Sec. 30.36  Expiration and termination of licenses and decommissioning of sites and separate buildings or outdoor areas.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each 
specific license expires at the end of the day on the expiration date 
stated in the license unless the licensee has filed an application for 
renewal under Sec. 30.37 not less than 30 days before the expiration 
date stated in the existing license (or, for those licenses subject to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 30 days before the deemed expiration 
date in that paragraph). If an application for renewal has been filed at 
least 30 days before the expiration date stated in the existing license 
(or, for those licenses subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 30 
days before the deemed expiration date in that paragraph), the existing 
license expires at the end of the day on which the Commission makes a 
final determination to deny the renewal application or, if the 
determination states an expiration date, the expiration date stated in 
the determination.
    (2) Each specific license that has an expiration date after July 1, 
1995, and is not one of the licenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, shall be deemed to have an expiration date that is five 
years after the expiration date stated in the current license.
    (3) The following specific licenses are not subject to, or otherwise 
affected by, the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (i) Specific licenses for which, on February 15, 1996, an evaluation 
or an emergency plan is required in accordance with Sec. 30.32(i);
    (ii) Specific licenses whose holders are subject to the financial 
assurance requirements specified in 10 CFR 30.35, and on February 15, 
1996, the holders either:
    (A) Have not submitted a decommissioning funding plan or 
certification of financial assurance for decommissioning; or
    (B) Have not received written notice that the decommissioning 
funding plan or certification of financial assurance for decommissioning 
is acceptable;
    (iii) Specific licenses whose holders are listed in the SDMP List 
published

[[Page 442]]

in NUREG 1444, Supplement 1 (November 1995);
    (iv) Specific licenses whose issuance, amendment, or renewal, as of 
February 15, 1996, is not a categorical exclusion under 10 CFR 
51.22(c)(14) and, therefore, need an environmental assessment or 
environmental impact statement pursuant to Subpart A of Part 51 of this 
chapter;
    (v) Specific licenses whose holders have not had at least one NRC 
inspection of licensed activities before February 15, 1996;
    (vi) Specific licenses whose holders, as the result of the most 
recent NRC inspection of licensed activities conducted before February 
15, 1996, have been:
    (A) Cited for a Severity Level I, II, or III violation in a Notice 
of Violation;
    (B) Subject to an Order issued by the NRC; or
    (C) Subject to a Confirmatory Action Letter issued by the NRC.
    (vii) Specific licenses with expiration dates before July 1, 1995, 
for which the holders have submitted applications for renewal under 10 
CFR 30.37 of this part.
    (b) Each specific license revoked by the Commission expires at the 
end of the day on the date of the Commission's final determination to 
revoke the license, or on the expiration date stated in the 
determination, or as otherwise provided by Commission Order.
    (c) Each specific license continues in effect, beyond the expiration 
date if necessary, with respect to possession of byproduct material 
until the Commission notifies the licensee in writing that the license 
is terminated. During this time, the licensee shall--
    (1) Limit actions involving byproduct material to those related to 
decommissioning; and
    (2) Continue to control entry to restricted areas until they are 
suitable for release in accordance with NRC requirements.
    (d) Within 60 days of the occurrence of any of the following, 
consistent with the administrative directions in Sec. 30.6, each 
licensee shall provide notification to the NRC in writing of such 
occurrence, and either begin decommissioning its site, or any separate 
building or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity so that 
the building or outdoor area is suitable for release in accordance with 
NRC requirements, or submit within 12 months of notification a 
decommissioning plan, if required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, 
and begin decommissioning upon approval of that plan if--
    (1) The license has expired pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section; or
    (2) The licensee has decided to permanently cease principal 
activities, as defined in this part, at the entire site or in any 
separate building or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity 
such that the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for release in 
accordance with NRC requirements; or
    (3) No principal activities under the license have been conducted 
for a period of 24 months; or
    (4) No principal activities have been conducted for a period of 24 
months in any separate building or outdoor area that contains residual 
radioactivity such that the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for 
release in accordance with NRC requirements.
    (e) Coincident with the notification required by paragraph (d) of 
this section, the licensee shall maintain in effect all decommissioning 
financial assurances established by the licensee pursuant to Sec. 30.35 
in conjunction with a license issuance or renewal or as required by this 
section. The amount of the financial assurance must be increased, or may 
be decreased, as appropriate, to cover the detailed cost estimate for 
decommissioning established pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(v) of this 
section.
    (1) Any licensee who has not provided financial assurance to cover 
the detailed cost estimate submitted with the decommissioning plan shall 
do so when this rule becomes effective November 24, 1995.
    (2) Following approval of the decommissioning plan, a licensee may 
reduce the amount of the financial assurance as decommissioning proceeds 
and radiological contamination is reduced at the site with the approval 
of the Commission.

[[Page 443]]

    (f) The Commission may grant a request to extend the time periods 
established in paragraph (d) if the Commission determines that this 
relief is not detrimental to the public health and safety and is 
otherwise in the public interest. The request must be submitted no later 
than 30 days before notification pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section. The schedule for decommissioning set forth in paragraph (d) of 
this section may not commence until the Commission has made a 
determination on the request.
    (g)(1) A decommissioning plan must be submitted if required by 
license condition or if the procedures and activities necessary to carry 
out decommissioning of the site or separate building or outdoor area 
have not been previously approved by the Commission and these procedures 
could increase potential health and safety impacts to workers or to the 
public, such as in any of the following cases:
    (i) Procedures would involve techniques not applied routinely during 
cleanup or maintenance operations;
    (ii) Workers would be entering areas not normally occupied where 
surface contamination and radiation levels are significantly higher than 
routinely encountered during operation;
    (iii) Procedures could result in significantly greater airborne 
concentrations of radioactive materials than are present during 
operation; or
    (iv) Procedures could result in significantly greater releases of 
radioactive material to the environment than those associated with 
operation.
    (2) The Commission may approve an alternate schedule for submittal 
of a decommissioning plan required pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section if the Commission determines that the alternative schedule is 
necessary to the effective conduct of decommissioning operations and 
presents no undue risk from radiation to the public health and safety 
and is otherwise in the public interest.
    (3) Procedures such as those listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section with potential health and safety impacts may not be carried out 
prior to approval of the decommissioning plan.
    (4) The proposed decommissioning plan for the site or separate 
building or outdoor area must include:
    (i) A description of the conditions of the site or separate building 
or outdoor area sufficient to evaluate the acceptability of the plan;
    (ii) A description of planned decommissioning activities;
    (iii) A description of methods used to ensure protection of workers 
and the environment against radiation hazards during decommissioning;
    (iv) A description of the planned final radiation survey; and
    (v) An updated detailed cost estimate for decommissioning, 
comparison of that estimate with present funds set aside for 
decommissioning, and a plan for assuring the availability of adequate 
funds for completion of decommissioning.
    (vi) For decommissioning plans calling for completion of 
decommissioning later than 24 months after plan approval, the plan shall 
include a justification for the delay based on the criteria in paragraph 
(i) of this section.
    (5) The proposed decommissioning plan will be approved by the 
Commission if the information therein demonstrates that the 
decommissioning will be completed as soon as practicable and that the 
health and safety of workers and the public will be adequately 
protected.
    (h)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, 
licensees shall complete decommissioning of the site or separate 
building or outdoor area as soon as practicable but no later than 24 
months following the initiation of decommissioning.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when 
decommissioning involves the entire site, the licensee shall request 
license termination as soon as practicable but no later than 24 months 
following the initiation of decommissioning.
    (i) The Commission may approve a request for an alternative schedule 
for completion of decommissioning of the site or separate building or 
outdoor area, and license termination if appropriate, if the Commission 
determines that the alternative is warranted by consideration of the 
following:

[[Page 444]]

    (1) Whether it is technically feasible to complete decommissioning 
within the allotted 24-month period;
    (2) Whether sufficient waste disposal capacity is available to allow 
completion of decommissioning within the allotted 24-month period;
    (3) Whether a significant volume reduction in wastes requiring 
disposal will be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to 
decay;
    (4) Whether a significant reduction in radiation exposure to workers 
can be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to decay; and
    (5) Other site-specific factors which the Commission may consider 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis, such as the regulatory requirements 
of other government agencies, lawsuits, ground-water treatment 
activities, monitored natural ground-water restoration, actions that 
could result in more environmental harm than deferred cleanup, and other 
factors beyond the control of the licensee.
    (j) As the final step in decommissioning, the licensee shall--
    (1) Certify the disposition of all licensed material, including 
accumulated wastes, by submitting a completed NRC Form 314 or equivalent 
information; and
    (2) Conduct a radiation survey of the premises where the licensed 
activities were carried out and submit a report of the results of this 
survey unless the licensee demonstrates that the premises are suitable 
for release in some other manner. The licensee shall, as appropriate--
    (i) Report levels of gamma radiation in units of millisieverts 
(microroentgen) per hour at one meter from surfaces, and report levels 
of radioactivity, including alpha and beta, in units of megabecquerels 
(disintegrations per minute or microcuries) per 100 square centimeters--
removable and fixed--for surfaces, megabecquerels (microcuries) per 
milliliter for water, and becquerels (picocuries) per gram for solids 
such as soils or concrete; and
    (ii) Specify the survey instrument(s) used and certify that each 
instrument is properly calibrated and tested.
    (k) Specific licenses, including expired licenses, will be 
terminated by written notice to the licensee when the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) Byproduct material has been properly disposed;
    (2) Reasonable effort has been made to eliminate residual 
radioactive contamination, if present; and
    (3)(i) A radiation survey has been performed which demonstrates that 
the premises are suitable for release in accordance with NRC 
requirements; or (ii) Other information submitted by the licensee is 
sufficient to demonstrate that the premises are suitable for release in 
accordance with NRC requirements.
    (4) Records required by Sec. 30.51 (d) and (f) have been received.

    Note 1: Many radioisotopes disintegrate into isotopes which are also 
radioactive. In expressing the concentrations in Schedule A, the 
activity stated is that of the parent isotope and takes into account the 
daughters.
    Note 2: For purposes of Sec. 30.14 where there is involved a 
combination of isotopes, the limit for the combination should be derived 
as follows:
    Determine for each isotope in the product the ratio between the 
concentration present in the product and the exempt concentration 
established in Schedule A for the specific isotope when not in 
combination. The sum of such ratios may not exceed ``1'' (i.e., unity).

Example: 


       Concentration of Isotope A in Product                   Concentration of Isotope B in Product            
                      ------                         +                       --------                       <ls-

 Appendix A to Part 30--Criteria Relating to Use of Financial Tests and 
 Parent Company Guarantees for Providing Reasonable Assurance of Funds 
                           for Decommissioning

                             I. Introduction

    An applicant or licensee may provide reasonable assurance of the 
availability of funds for decommissioning based on obtaining a parent 
company guarantee that funds will be available for decommissioning costs 
and on a demonstration that the parent company passes a financial test. 
This appendix establishes criteria for passing the financial test and 
for obtaining the parent company guarantee.

                           II. Financial Test

    A. To pass the financial test, the parent company must meet the 
criteria of either paragraph A.1 or A.2 of this section:
    1. The parent company must have:
    (i) Two of the following three ratios: A ratio of total liabilities 
to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus 
depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater 
than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater 
than 1.5; and
    (ii) Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six 
times the current decommissioning cost estimates (or prescribed amount 
if a certification is used); and
    (iii) Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and
    (iv) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 
percent of total assets or at least six times the current 
decommissioning cost estimates (or prescribed amount if a certification 
is used).

[[Page 455]]

    2. The parent company must have:
    (i) A current rating for its most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, 
A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa as 
issued by Moody's; and
    (ii) Tangible net worth at least six times the current 
decommissioning cost estimate (or prescribed amount if a certification 
is used); and
    (iii) Tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and
    (iv) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 
percent of total assets or at least six times the current 
decommissioning cost estimates (or prescribed amount if certification is 
used).
    B. The parent company's independent certified public accountant must 
have compared the data used by the parent company in the financial test, 
which is derived from the independently audited, year end financial 
statements for the latest fiscal year, with the amounts in such 
financial statement. In connection with that procedure the licensee 
shall inform NRC within 90 days of any matters coming to the auditor's 
attention which cause the auditor to believe that the data specified in 
the financial test should be adjusted and that the company no longer 
passes the test.
    C. 1. After the initial financial test, the parent company must 
repeat the passage of the test within 90 days after the close of each 
succeeding fiscal year.
    2. If the parent company no longer meets the requirements of 
paragraph A of this section, the licensee must send notice to the 
Commission of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as 
specified in the Commission's regulations. The notice must be sent by 
certified mail within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which 
the year end financial data show that the parent company no longer meets 
the financial test requirements. The licensee must provide alternate 
financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.

                      III. Parent Company Guarantee

    The terms of a parent company guarantee which an applicant or 
licensee obtains must provide that:
    A. The parent company guarantee will remain in force unless the 
guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the licensee 
and the Commission. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 
days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by 
both the licensee and the Commission, as evidenced by the return 
receipts.
    B. If the licensee fails to provide alternate financial assurance as 
specified in the Commission's regulations within 90 days after receipt 
by the licensee and Commission of a notice of cancellation of the parent 
company guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will provide such 
alternative financial assurance in the name of the licensee.
    C. The parent company guarantee and financial test provisions must 
remain in effect until the Commission has terminated the license.
    D. If a trust is established for decommissioning costs, the trustee 
and trust must be acceptable to the Commission. An acceptable trustee 
includes an appropriate State or Federal Government agency or an entity 
which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations 
are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.

    Note: For purposes of Sec. 20.303, where there is involved a 
combination of isotopes in known amounts, the limit for the combination 
should be derived as follows: Determine, for each isotope in the 
combination, the ratio between the quantity present in the combination 
and the limit otherwise established for the specific isotope when not in 
combination. The sum of such ratios for all the isotopes in the 
combination may not exceed ``1'' (i.e., ``unity'').

 Appendix C to Part 30--Criteria Relating to Use of Financial Tests and 
    Self Guarantees for Providing Reasonable Assurance of Funds for 
                             Decommissioning

                             I. Introduction

    An applicant or licensee may provide reasonable assurance of the 
availability of funds for decommissioning based on furnishing its own 
guarantee that funds will be available for decommissioning costs and on 
a demonstration that the company passes the financial test of Section II 
of this appendix. The terms of the self-guarantee are in Section III of 
this appendix. This appendix establishes criteria for passing the 
financial test for the self guarantee and establishes the terms for a 
self-guarantee.

                           II. Financial Test

    A. To pass the financial test, a company must meet all of the 
following criteria:
    (1) Tangible net worth at least 10 times the total current 
decommissioning cost estimate (or the current amount required if 
certification is used) for all decommissioning activities for which the 
company is responsible as self-guaranteeing licensee and as parent-
guarantor.
    (2) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 
percent of total assets or at least 10 times the total current 
decommissioning cost estimate (or the current amount required if 
certification is used) for all decommissioning activities for which the 
company is responsible as self-guaranteeing licensee and as parent-
guarantor.
    (3) A current rating for its most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, 
or A as issued by Standard and Poors (S&P), or Aaa, Aa, or A as issued 
by Moodys.
    B. To pass the financial test, a company must meet all of the 
following additional requirements:
    (1) The company must have at least one class of equity securities 
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (2) The company's independent certified public accountant must have 
compared the data used by the company in the financial test which is 
derived from the independently audited, yearend financial statements for 
the latest fiscal year, with the amounts in such financial statement. In 
connection with that procedure, the licensee shall inform NRC within 90 
days of any matters coming to the attention of the auditor that cause 
the auditor to believe that the data specified in the financial test 
should be adjusted and that the company no longer passes the test.
    (3) After the initial financial test, the company must repeat 
passage of the test within 90 days after the close of each succeeding 
fiscal year.
    C. If the licensee no longer meets the requirements of Section II.A. 
of this appendix, the licensee must send immediate notice to the 
Commission of its intent to establish alternate financial assurance as 
specified in the Commission's regulations within 120 days of such 
notice.

                       III. Company Self-Guarantee

    The terms of a self-guarantee which an applicant or licensee 
furnishes must provide that:
    A. The guarantee will remain in force unless the licensee sends 
notice of cancellation by certified mail to the Commission. Cancellation 
may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of 
receipt of the notice of cancellation by the Commission, as evidenced by 
the return receipt.
    B. The licensee shall provide alternative financial assurance as 
specified in the Commission's regulations within 90 days following 
receipt by the Commission of a notice of cancellation of the guarantee.
    C. The guarantee and financial test provisions must remain in effect 
until the Commission has terminated the license or until another 
financial assurance method acceptable to the Commission has been put in 
effect by the licensee.
    D. The licensee will promptly forward to the Commission and the 
licensee's independent auditor all reports covering the latest fiscal 
year filed by the licensee with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
pursuant to the requirements of section 13 of the Securities and 
Exchange Act of 1934.
    E. If, at any time, the licensee's most recent bond issuance ceases 
to be rated in any category of ``A'' or above by either Standard and 
Poors or Moodys, the licensee will provide notice in writing of such 
fact to the Commission within 20 days after publication of the change by 
the rating service. If the licensee's most recent bond issuance ceases 
to be rated in any category of A or above by

[[Page 458]]

both Standard and Poors and Moodys, the licensee no longer meets the 
requirements of Section II.A. of this appendix.
    F. The applicant or licensee must provide to the Commission a 
written guarantee (a written commitment by a corporate officer) which 
states that the licensee will fund and carry out the required 
decommissioning activities or, upon issuance of an order by the 
Commission, the licensee will set up and fund a trust in the amount of 
the current cost estimates for decommissioning.

<R05>
Sec. 32.23   Same: Safety criteria.

    An applicant for a license under Sec. 32.22 shall demonstrate that 
the product is designed and will be manufactured so that:
    (a) In normal use and disposal of a single exempt unit, it is 
unlikely that the external radiation dose in any one year, or the dose 
commitment resulting from the intake of radioactive material in any one 
year, to a suitable sample of the group of individuals expected to be 
most highly exposed to radiation or radioactive material from the 
product will exceed the dose to the appropriate organ as specified in 
Column I of the table in Sec. 32.24 of this part.
    (b) In normal handling and storage of the quantities of exempt units 
likely to accumulate in one location during marketing, distribution, 
installation, and servicing of the product, it is unlikely that the 
external radiation dose in any one year, or the dose commitment 
resulting from the intake of radioactive material in any one year, to a 
suitable sample of the group of individuals expected to be most highly 
exposed to radiation or radioactive material from the product will 
exceed the dose to the appropriate organ as specified in Column II of 
the table in Sec. 32.24.
    (c) It is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in the 
effectiveness of the containment, shielding, or other safety features of 
the product from wear and abuse likely to occur in normal handling and 
use of the product during its useful life.
    (d)<SUP>1 In use and disposal of a single exempt unit, or in 
handling and storage of the quantities of exempt units likely to 
accumulate in one location during marketing, distribution, installation, 
and servicing of the product, the probability is low that the 
containment, shielding, or other safety features of the product would 
fail under such circumstances that a person would receive an external 
radiation dose or dose commitment in excess of the dose to the 
appropriate organ as specified in Column III of the table in Sec. 32.24, 
and the probability is negligible that a person would receive an 
external radiation dose or dose commitment in excess of the dose to the 
appropriate organ as specified in Column IV of the table in Sec. 32.24.

    <SUP>1 It is the intent of this paragraph that as the magnitude of 
the potential dose increases above that permitted under normal 
conditions, the probability that any individual will receive such a dose 
must decrease. The probabilities have been expressed in general terms to 
emphasize the approximate nature of the estimates which are to be made. 
The following values may be used as guides in estimating compliance with 
the criteria:
    Low--not more than one such failure per year for each 10,000 exempt 
units distributed.
    Negligible--not more than one such failure per year for each 1 
million exempt units distributed.

<R05>
Sec. 32.27   Same: Safety criteria.

    An applicant for a license under Sec. 32.26 shall demonstrate that 
the product is designed and will be manufactured so that:
    (a) In normal use and disposal of a single exempt unit, and in 
normal handling and storage of the quantities of exempt units likely to 
accumulate in one location during marketing, distribution, installation, 
and servicing of the product, it is unlikely that the external radiation 
dose in any one year, or the dose commitment resulting from the intake 
of radioactive material in any one year, to a suitable sample of the 
group of individuals expected to be most highly exposed to radiation or 
radioactive material from the product will exceed the dose to the 
appropriate organ as specified in Column I of the table in Sec. 32.28.
    (b) It is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in the 
effectiveness of the containment, shielding, or other safety features of 
the product from wear and abuse likely to occur in normal handling and 
use of the product during its useful life.
    (c) In use and disposal of a single exempt unit and in handling and 
storage of the quantities of exempt units likely to accumulate in one 
location during marketing, distribution, installation, and servicing of 
the product, the probability is low that the containment, shielding, or 
other safety features of the product would fail under such circumstances 
that a person would receive an external radiation dose or dose 
commitment in excess of the dose to the appropriate organ as specified 
in Column II of the table in Sec. 32.28, and the probability is 
negligible that a person would receive an external radiation dose or 
dose commitment in excess of the dose to the appropriate organ as 
specified in Column III of the table in Sec. 32.28.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1It is the intent of this paragraph that as the magnitude of the 
potential dose increases above that permitted under normal conditions, 
the probability that any individual will receive such a dose must 
decrease. The probabilities have been expressed in general terms to 
emphasize the approximate nature of the estimates which are to be made. 
The following values may be used as guides in estimating compliance with 
the criteria:
    Low--not more than one such failure per year for each 10,000 exempt 
units distributed.
    Negligible--not more than one such failure per year for each one 
million exempt units distributed.

    An applicant for a license pursuant to Sec. 32.14 to install lock 
illuminators into automobile locks, or to initially transfer lock 
illuminators in automobile locks for use pursuant to Sec. 30.15 of this 
chapter shall conduct the following prototype tests on each of five 
prototype devices, consisting of the automobile lock with the installed 
illuminator in the following order:
    (a) The device shall be subjected to 100 hours of accelerated 
weathering in a suitable weathering machine which simulates the most 
severe conditions of normal use;

[[Page 477]]

    (b) The device shall be dropped upon a concrete or iron surface in a 
3-foot free gravitational fall, or shall be subjected to an equivalent 
treatment in a test device simulating such a fall. The drop test shall 
be repeated 100 times from random orientations;
    (c) The device shall be attached to a vibratory fixture and vibrated 
at a rate of not less than 26 cycles per second and a vibration 
acceleration of not less than 2 G for a period of not less than 1 hour;
    (d) On completion of the foregoing tests, the device shall be 
immersed in 30 inches of water for 24 hours and shall show no visible 
evidence of water entry into the lock illuminator. Absolute pressure of 
the air above the water shall then be reduced to 1 inch of mercury. 
Lowered pressure shall be maintained for 1 minute or until air bubbles 
cease to be given off by the water, whichever is the longer. Pressure 
shall then be increased to normal atmospheric pressure. Any evidence of 
bubbles emanating from within the lock illuminator, or water entering 
the lock illuminator, shall be considered leakage;
    (e) After each of the tests prescribed by this section, each device 
shall be examined for evidence of physical damage and for loss of 
tritium or promethium-147. Any evidence of damage to or failure of any 
device which could affect the containment of the tritium or promethium-
147 in such devices shall be cause for rejection of the design on which 
such prototype devices were constructed or manufactured if the damage or 
failure is attributable to design defect. Loss of tritium or promethium-
147 from each tested device shall be measured both by sampling the 
immersion test water used in paragraph (d) of this section and by wiping 
with filter paper the entire accessible area of the lock illuminator. 
Measurements of tritium or promethium-147 shall be made in an apparatus 
calibrated to measure tritium or promethium-147, as appropriate. If more 
than 0.1 percent of the original amount of tritium or promethium-147 in 
the device is found in the immersion test water of the test in paragraph 
(d) of this section, or if more than 2,200 disintegrations per minute of 
tritium or promethium-147 on the filter paper is measured after any of 
the tests in paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section the device shall be 
rejected.

    (b) In the event the applicant desires that the device be required 
to be tested at intervals longer than six months, either for proper 
operation of the on-off mechanism and indicator, if any, or for leakage 
of radioactive material or for both, he shall include in this 
application sufficient information to demonstrate that such longer 
interval is justified by performance characteristics of the device or 
similar devices, and by design features which have a significant bearing 
on the probability or consequences of leakage of radioactive material 
from the device or failure of the on-off mechanism and indicator. In 
determining the acceptable interval for the test for leakage of 
radioactive material, the Commission will consider information which 
includes, but is not limited to:
    (1) Primary containment (source capsule);
    (2) Protection of primary containment;
    (3) Method of sealing containment;
    (4) Containment construction materials;
    (5) Form of contained radioactive material;
    (6) Maximum temperature withstood during prototype tests;
    (7) Maximum pressure withstood during prototype tests;
    (8) Maximum quantity of contained radioactive material;
    (9) Radiotoxicity of contained radioactive material; and
    (10) Operating experience with identical devices or similarly 
designed and constructed devices.
    (c) In the event the applicant desires that the general licensee 
under Sec. 31.5 of this chapter, or under equivalent regulations of an 
Agreement State, be authorized to install the device, collect the sample 
to be analyzed by a specific licensee for leakage of radioactive 
material, service the device, test the on-off mechanism and indicator, 
or remove the device from installation, the applicant shall include in 
the application written instructions to be followed by the general 
licensee, estimated calendar quarter doses associated with such activity 
or activities, and the bases for these estimates. The submitted 
information must demonstrate that performance of this activity or 
activities by an individual untrained in radiological protection, in 
addition to other handling, storage, and use of devices under the 
general license, is unlikely to cause that individual to receive a dose 
in excess of 10 percent of the annual limits specified in 
Sec. 20.1201(a) of this chapter.

Sec. 32.101   Schedule B--prototype tests for luminous safety devices for use in aircraft.

    An applicant for a license pursuant to Sec. 32.53 shall conduct 
prototype tests on each of five prototype luminous safety devices for 
use in aircraft as follows:
    (a) Temperature-altitude test. The device shall be placed in a test 
chamber as it would be used in service. A temperature-altitude condition 
schedule shall be followed as outlined in the following steps:

    Step 1. The internal temperature of the test chamber shall be 
reduced to -62 deg. C. (-80 deg. F.) and the device shall be maintained 
for at least 1 hour at this temperature at atmospheric pressure.
    Step 2. The internal temperature of the test chamber shall be raised 
to -54 deg. C. (-65 deg. F.) and maintained until the temperature of the 
device has stabilized at -54 deg. C. at atmospheric pressure.
    Step 3. The atmospheric pressure of the chamber shall be reduced to 
83 millimeters of mercury absolute pressure while the chamber 
temperature is maintained at -54 deg. C.
    Step 4. The internal temperature of the chamber shall be raised to 
-10 deg. C. (+14 deg. F.) and maintained until the temperature of the 
device has stabilized at -10 deg. C., and the internal pressure of the 
chamber shall then be adjusted to atmospheric pressure. The test chamber 
door shall then be opened in order that frost will form on the device, 
and shall remain open until the frost has melted but not long enough to 
allow the moisture to evaporate. The door shall then be closed.
    Step 5. The internal temperature of the chamber shall be raised to 
+85 deg. C. (185 deg. F.) at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of 
the device shall be stabilized at +85 deg. C. and maintained for 2 
hours. The device shall then be visually inspected to determine the 
extent of any deterioration.
    Step 6. The chamber temperature shall be reduced to +71 deg. C. 
(160 deg. F.) at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the device 
shall be stabilized at +71 deg. C. for a period of 30 minutes.
    Step 7. The chamber temperature shall be reduced to +55 deg. C. 
(130 deg. F.) at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the device 
shall be stabilized at this temperature for a period of 4 hours.
    Step 8. The internal temperature of the chamber shall be reduced to 
+30 deg. C. (86 deg. F.) and the pressure to 138 millimeters of mercury 
absolute pressure and stabilized. The device shall be maintained under 
these conditions for a period of 4 hours.
    Step 9. The temperature of the test chamber shall be raised to 
+35 deg. C. (95 deg. F.) and the pressure reduced to 83 millimeters of 
mercury absolute pressure and stabilized. The device shall be maintained 
under these conditions for a period of 30 minutes.
    Step 10. The internal pressure of the chamber shall be maintained at 
83 millimeters of mercury absolute pressure and the temperature reduced 
to +20 deg. C. (68 deg. F.) and stabilized. The device shall be 
maintained under these conditions for a period of 4 hours.

    (b) Vibration tests. This procedure applies to items of equipment 
(including vibration isolating assemblies) intended to be mounted 
directly on the structure of aircraft powered by reciprocating, 
turbojet, or turbo-propeller engines or to be mounted directly on gas-
turbine engines. The device shall be mounted on an apparatus dynamically 
similar to the most severe conditions likely to be encountered in normal 
use. At the end of the test period, the device shall be inspected 
thoroughly for possible damage. Vibration tests shall be conducted under 
both resonant and cycling conditions according to the following 
Vibration Test Schedule (Table I):

    (1) Determination of resonance frequency. Individual resonance 
frequency surveys shall be conducted by applying vibration to each 
device along each of any set of three mutually perpendicular axes and 
varying the frequency of applied vibration slowly through a range of 
frequencies from 5 cycles per second to 500 cycles per second with the 
double amplitude of the vibration not exceeding that shown in Figure 1 
for the related frequency.
    (2) Resonance tests. The device shall be vibrated at the determined 
resonance frequency for each axis of vibration for the periods and 
temperature conditions shown in Table I and with the applied double 
amplitude specified in Figure 1 for that resonance frequency. When more 
than one resonant

[[Page 489]]

frequency is encountered with vibration applied along any one axis, the 
test period may be accomplished at the most severe resonance or the 
period may be divided among the resonant frequencies, whichever is 
considered most likely to produce failure. When resonant frequencies are 
not apparent within the specified frequency range, the specimen shall be 
vibrated for periods twice as long as those shown for resonance in Table 
I at a frequency of 55 cycles per second and an applied double amplitude 
of 0.060 inch.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02OC91.056

    (3) Cycling. Devices to be mounted only on vibration isolators shall 
be tested by applying vibration along each of three mutually 
perpendicular axes of

[[Page 490]]

the device with an applied double amplitude of 0.060 inch and the 
frequency cycling between 10 and 55 cycles per second in 1-minute cycles 
for the periods and temperature conditions shown in Table I. Devices to 
be installed in aircraft without vibration isolators shall be tested by 
applying vibration along each of three mutually perpendicular axes of 
the device with an applied double amplitude of 0.036 inch or an applied 
acceleration of 10G, whichever is the limiting value, and the frequency 
cycling between 10 and 500 cycles per second in 15-minute cycles for the 
periods and temperature conditions shown in Table I.
    (c) Accelerated weathering tests. The device shall be subjected to 
100 hours of accelerated weathering in a suitable weathering machine. 
Panels of Corex D glass shall surround the arc to cut off the 
ultraviolet radiation below a wave-length of 2,700 angstroms. The light 
of the carbon arcs shall fall directly on the face of the device. The 
temperature at the sample shall be maintained at 50 deg.C. plus or minus 
3 deg.C. Temperature measurements shall be made with a black panel 
thermometer.
    (d) Shock test. The device shall be dropped upon a concrete or iron 
surface in a 3-foot free gravitational fall, or shall be subjected to 
equivalent treatment in a test device simulating such a free fall. The 
drop test shall be repeated 100 times from random orientations.
    (e) Hermetic seal and waterproof test. On completion of all other 
tests prescribed by this section, the device shall be immersed in 30 
inches of water for 24 hours and shall show no visible evidence of water 
entry. Absolute pressure of the air above the water shall then be 
reduced to 1 inch of mercury. Lowered pressure shall be maintained for 1 
minute or until air bubbles cease to be given off by the water, 
whichever is the longer. Pressure shall then be increased to normal 
atmospheric pressure. Any evidence of bubbles emanating from within the 
device, or water entering the device, shall be considered leakage.
    (f) Observations. After each of the tests prescribed by this 
section, each device shall be examined for evidence of physical damage 
and for loss of tritium or promethium-147. Any evidence of damage to or 
failure of any device which could affect containment of the tritium or 
promethium-147 shall be cause for rejection of the design if the damage 
or failure is attributable to a design defect. Loss of tritium or 
promethium-147 from each tested device shall be measured by wiping with 
filter paper an area of at least 100 square centimeters on the outside 
surface of the device, or by wiping the entire surface area if it is 
less than 100 square centimeters. The amount of tritium or promethium-
147 in the water used in the hermetic seal and waterproof test 
prescribed by test paragraph (e) of this section shall also be measured. 
Measurements shall be made in an apparatus calibrated to measure tritium 
or promethium-147, as appropriate. The detection on the filter paper of 
more than 2,200 disintegrations per minute of tritium or promethium-147 
per 100 square centimeters of surface wiped or in the water of more than 
0.1 percent of the original amount of tritium or promethium-147 in any 
device shall be cause for rejection of the tested device.

Sec. 32.102   Schedule C--prototype tests for calibration or reference sources containing americium-241.

    An applicant for a license pursuant to Sec. 32.57 shall, for any 
type of source which is designed to contain more than 0.005 microcurie 
of americium-241, conduct prototype tests, in the order listed, on each 
of five prototypes of such source, which contains more than 0.005 
microcurie of americium-241, as follows:
    (a) Initial measurement. The quantity of radioactive material 
deposited on the source shall be measured by direct counting of the 
source.
    (b) Dry wipe test. The entire radioactive surface of the source 
shall be wiped with filter paper with the application of moderate finger 
pressure. Removal of radioactive material from the source shall be 
determined by measuring the radioactivity on the filter paper or by 
direct measurement of the radioactivity on the source following the dry 
wipe.
    (c) Wet wipe test. The entire radioactive surface of the source 
shall be

[[Page 491]]

wiped with filter paper, moistened with water, with the application of 
moderate finger pressure. Removal of radioactive material from the 
source shall be determined by measuring the radioactivity on the filter 
paper after it has dried or by direct measurement of the radioactivity 
on the source following the wet wipe.
    (d) Water soak test. The source shall be immersed in water at room 
temperature for a period of 24 consecutive hours. The source shall then 
be removed from the water. Removal of radioactive material from the 
source shall be determined by direct measurement of the radioactivity on 
the source after it has dried or by measuring the radioactivity in the 
residue obtained by evaporation of the water in which the source was 
immersed.
    (e) Dry wipe test. On completion of the preceding test in this 
section, the dry wipe test described in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall be repeated.
    (f) Observations. Removal of more than 0.005 microcurie of 
radioactivity in any test prescribed by this section shall be cause for 
rejection of the source design. Results of prototype tests submitted to 
the Commission shall be given in terms of radioactivity in microcuries 
and percent of removal from the total amount of radioactive material 
deposited on the source.

follows:
    (a) Temperature-altitude test. The device shall be placed in a test 
chamber as it would be used in service. A temperature-altitude condition 
schedule shall be followed as outlined in Step 1 through Step 10 of 
Sec. 32.101(a).
    (b) Vibration tests. The device shall be subjected to vibration 
tests as set forth in Sec. 32.101(b).
    (c) Shock test. The device shall be subjected to shock test as set 
forth in Sec. 32.101(d).
    (d) Hermetic seal and waterproof test. On completion of all other 
tests prescribed by this section, the device shall be immersed in 30 
inches of water for 24 hours and shall show no visible evidence of 
physical contact between the water and the strontium-90. Absolute 
pressure of the air above the water shall then be reduced to 1 inch of 
mercury. Lowered pressure shall be maintained for 1 minute or until air 
bubbles cease to be given off by the water, whichever is the longer. 
Pressure shall then be increased to normal atmospheric pressure. Any 
visible evidence of physical contact between the water and the 
strontium-90 shall be considered leakage.
    (e) Observations. After each of the tests prescribed by this 
section, each device shall be examined for evidence of physical damage 
and for loss of strontium-90. Any evidence of leakage or damage to or 
failure of any device which could affect containment of the strontium-90 
shall be cause for rejection of the design if the damage or failure is 
attributable to a design defect. Loss of strontium-90 from each tested 
device shall be measured by wiping with filter paper an area of at least 
100 square centimeters on the outside surface of the device, or by 
wiping the entire surface area if it is less than 100 square 
centimeters. The amount of strontium-90 in the water used in the 
hermetic seal and waterproof test prescribed in paragraph (d) of this 
section shall also be measured. The detection on the filter paper of 
more than 2,200 disintegrations per minute of strontium-90 per 100 
square centimeters of surface wiped or in the water of more than 0.1 
percent of the original amount of strontium-90 in any device, shall be 
cause for rejection of the tested device.

<R05>
Sec. 32.210  Registration of product information.

    (a) Any manufacturer or initial distributor of a sealed source or 
device containing a sealed source whose product is intended for use 
under a specific license may submit a request to NRC for evaluation of 
radiation safety information about its product and for its registration.
    (b) The request for review must be made in duplicate and sent to the 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Division of Industrial and Medical 
Nuclear Safety; Medical, Academic, and Commercial Use Safety Branch; 
Washington, DC 20555.
    (c) The request for review of a sealed source or a device must 
include sufficient information about the design, manufacture, prototype 
testing, quality control program, labeling, proposed uses and leak 
testing and, for a device, the request must also include sufficient 
information about installation, service and maintenance, operating and 
safety instructions, and its potential hazards, to provide reasonable 
assurance that the radiation safety properties of the source or device 
are adequate to protect health and minimize danger to life and property.
    (d) The NRC normally evaluates a sealed source or a device using 
radiation safety criteria in accepted industry standards. If these 
standards and criteria do not readily apply to a particular case, the 
NRC formulates reasonable standards and criteria with the help of the 
manufacturer or distributor. The NRC shall use criteria and standards 
sufficient to ensure that the radiation safety properties of the device 
or sealed source are adequate to protect health and minimize danger to 
life and property.
    (e) After completion of the evaluation, the Commission issues a 
certificate of registration to the person making the request. The 
certificate of registration acknowledges the availability of the 
submitted information for inclusion in an application for a specific 
license proposing use of the product.
    (f) The person submitting the request for evaluation and 
registration of safety information about the product shall manufacture 
and distribute the product in accordance with--
    (1) The statements and representations, including quality control 
program, contained in the request; and
    (2) The provisions of the registration certificate.

license authorizing receipt, acquisition, ownership, possession, use, 
and transfer of any chemical or physical form of byproduct material 
specified in Sec. 33.100, Schedule A, of this part for purposes 
authorized by the Act. The possession limit for a Type B broad license, 
if only one radionuclide is possessed thereunder, is the quantity 
specified for that radionuclide in Sec. 33.100, Schedule A, Column I. If 
two or more radionuclides are possessed thereunder, the possession limit 
for each is determined as follows: For each radionuclide, determine the 
ratio of the quantity possessed to the applicable quantity specified in 
Sec. 33.100, Schedule A, Column I, for that radionuclide. The sum of the 
ratios for all radionuclides possessed under the license shall not 
exceed unity.
    (c) A ``Type C specific license of broad scope'' is a specific 
license authorizing receipt, acquisition, ownership, possession, use, 
and transfer of any chemical or physical form of byproduct material 
specified in Sec. 33.100, Schedule A, for purposes authorized by the 
Act. The possession limit for a Type C broad license, if only one 
radionuclide is possessed thereunder, is the quantity specified for that 
radionuclide in Sec. 33.100, Schedule A, Column II. If two or more 
radionuclides are possessed thereunder, the possession limit is 
determined for each as follows: For each radionuclide determine the 
ratio of the quantity possessed to the applicable quantity specified in 
Sec. 33.100, Schedule A, Column II, for that radionuclide. The sum of 
the ratios for all radionuclides possessed under the license shall not 
exceed unity.

Sec. 34.2   Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Permanent radiographic installation means a shielded installation or 
structure designed or intended for radiography and in which radiography 
is regularly performed.
    Radiographer means any individual who performs or who, in attendance 
at the site where the sealed source or sources are being used, 
personally supervises radiographic operations and who is responsible to 
the licensee for assuring compliance with the requirements of the 
Commission's regulations and the conditions of the license;
    Radiographer's assistant means any individual who under the personal 
supervision of a radiographer, uses radiographic exposure devices, 
sealed sources or related handling tools, or radiation survey 
instruments in radiography;
    Radiographic exposure device means any instrument containing a 
sealed source fastened or contained therein, in which the sealed source 
or shielding thereof may be moved, or otherwise changed, from a shielded 
to unshielded position for purposes of making a radiographic exposure;
    Radiography means the examination of the structure of materials by 
nondestructive methods, utilizing sealed sources of byproduct materials;
    Sealed source means any byproduct material that is encased in a 
capsule designed to prevent leakage or escape of the byproduct material;
    Source changer means a device designed and used for replacement of 
sealed sources in radiographic exposure devices, including those also 
used for transporting and storage of sealed sources;
    Storage area means any location, facility, or vehicle which is used 
to store,

[[Page 500]]

to transport, or to secure a radiographic exposure device, a storage 
container, or a sealed source when it is not in use and which is locked 
or has a physical barrier to prevent accidental exposure, tampering 
with, or unauthorized removal of the device, container, or source.
    Storage container means a device in which sealed sources are 
transported or stored.

<R05>
Sec. 35.999  Resolution of conflicting requirements during transition period.

    If the rules in this part conflict with the licensee's radiation 
safety program as identified in its license, and if that license was 
approved by the Commission before April 1, 1987 and has not been renewed 
since April 1, 1987, then the requirements in the license will apply. 
However, if that licensee exercises its privilege to make minor changes 
in its radiation safety procedures that are not potentially important to 
safety under Sec. 35.31 of this chapter, the portion changed must comply 
with the requirements of this part. At the time of license renewal and 
thereafter, these admendments to this part shall apply.

<R05>
Sec. 36.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part contains requirements for the issuance of a license 
authorizing the use of sealed sources containing radioactive materials 
in irradiators used to irradiate objects or materials using gamma 
radiation. This part also contains radiation safety requirements for 
operating irradiators. The requirements of this part are in addition to 
other requirements of this chapter. In particular, the provisions of 
parts 19, 20, 21, 30, 71, 170, and 171 of this chapter apply to 
applications and licenses subject to this part. Nothing in this part 
relieves the licensee from complying with other applicable Federal, 
State and local regulations governing the siting, zoning, land use, and 
building code requirements for industrial facilities.

[[Page 544]]

    (b) The regulations in this part apply to panoramic irradiators that 
have either dry or wet storage of the radioactive sealed sources and to 
underwater irradiators in which both the source and the product being 
irradiated are under water. Irradiators whose dose rates exceed 5 grays 
(500 rads) per hour at 1 meter from the radioactive sealed sources in 
air or in water, as applicable for the irradiator type, are covered by 
this part.
    (c) The regulations in this part do not apply to self-contained dry-
source-storage irradiators (those in which both the source and the area 
subject to irradiation are contained within a device and are not 
accessible by personnel), medical radiology or teletherapy, radiography 
(the irradiation of materials for nondestructive testing purposes), 
gauging, or open-field (agricultural) irradiations.

once per year, at about the same time each year (plus or minus 1 month).
    Doubly encapsulated sealed source means a sealed source in which the 
radioactive material is sealed within a capsule and that capsule is 
sealed within another capsule.
    Irradiator means a facility that uses radioactive sealed sources for 
the irradiation of objects or materials and in which radiation dose 
rates exceeding 5 grays (500 rads) per hour exist at 1 meter from the 
sealed radioactive sources in air or water, as applicable for the 
irradiator type, but does not include irradiators in which both the 
sealed source and the area subject to irradiation are contained within a 
device and are not accessible to personnel.
    Irradiator operator means an individual who has successfully 
completed the training and testing described in Sec. 36.51 and is 
authorized by the terms of the license to operate the irradiator without 
a supervisor present.

the irradiations occur in air in areas potentially accessible to 
personnel and in which the sources are stored in shields made of solid 
materials. The term includes beam-type dry-source-storage irradiators in 
which only a narrow beam of radiation is produced for performing 
irradiations.
    Panoramic irradiator means an irradiator in which the irradiations 
are done in air in areas potentially accessible to personnel. The term 
includes beam-type irradiators.
    Panoramic wet-source-storage irradiator means an irradiator in which 
the irradiations occur in air in areas potentially accessible to 
personnel and in which the sources are stored under water in a storage 
pool.
    Pool irradiator means any irradiator at which the sources are stored 
or used in a pool of water including panoramic wet-source-storage 
irradiators and underwater irradiators.
    Product conveyor system means a system for moving the product to be 
irradiated to, from, and within the area where irradiation takes place.
    Radiation room means a shielded room in which irradiations take 
place. Underwater irradiators do not have radiation rooms.
    Radiation safety officer means an individual with responsibility for 
the overall radiation safety program at the facility.
    Sealed source means any byproduct material that is used as a source 
of radiation and is encased in a capsule designed to prevent leakage or 
escape of the byproduct material.
    Seismic area means any area where the probability of a horizontal 
acceleration in rock of more than 0.3 times the acceleration of gravity 
in 250 years is greater than 10 percent, as designated by the U.S. 
Geological Survey.
    Underwater irradiator means an irradiator in which the sources 
always remain shielded under water and humans do not have access to the 
sealed sources or the space subject to irradiation without entering the 
pool.


<R05>
Sec. 36.5  Interpretations.

    Except as specifically authorized by the Commission in writing, no 
interpretation of the meaning of the regulations in this part by any 
officer or employee of the Commission, other than a written 
interpretation by the General Counsel, will be recognized to be binding 
upon the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 36.11  Application for a specific license.

    A person, as defined in Sec. 30.4 of this chapter, may file an 
application for a specific license authorizing the use of sealed sources 
in an irradiator on Form NRC 313, ``Application for Material License.'' 
Each application for a license, other than a license exempted from part 
170 of this chapter, must be accompanied by the fee prescribed in 
Sec. 170.31 of this chapter. The application and one copy must be sent 
to the appropriate NRC Regional Office listed in appendix D to part 20 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 36.13  Specific licenses for irradiators.

    The Commission will approve an application for a specific license 
for the use of licensed material in an irradiator if the applicant meets 
the requirements contained in this section.
    (a) The applicant shall satisfy the general requirements specified 
in Sec. 30.33 of this chapter and the requirements contained in this 
part.
     (b) The application must describe the training provided to 
irradiator operators including--
    (1) Classroom training;
    (2) On-the-job or simulator training;
    (3) Safety reviews;

the Commission or an Agreement State to load or unload irradiator 
sources.
    (h) The applicant shall describe the inspection and maintenance 
checks, including the frequency of the checks required by Sec. 36.61.


<R05>
Sec. 36.15  Start of construction.

    The applicant may not begin construction of a new irradiator prior 
to the submission to NRC of both an application for a license for the 
irradiator and the fee required by Sec. 170.31. As used in this section, 
the term ``construction'' includes the construction of any portion of 
the permanent irradiator structure on the site but does not include: 
Engineering and design work, purchase of a site, site surveys or soil 
testing, site preparation, site excavation, construction of warehouse or 
auxiliary structures, and other similar tasks. Any activities undertaken 
prior to the issuance of a license are entirely at the risk of the 
applicant and have no bearing on the issuance of a license with respect 
to the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 
rules, regulations, and orders issued under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 36.17  Applications for exemptions.

    (a) The Commission may, upon application of any interested person or 
upon its own initiative, grant any exemptions from the requirements in

the public interest.
    (b) Any application for a license or for amendment of a license 
authorizing use of a teletherapy-type unit for irradiation of materials 
or objects may include proposed alternatives for the requirements of 
this part. The Commission will approve the proposed alternatives if the 
applicant provides adequate rationale for the proposed alternatives and 
demonstrates that they are likely to provide an adequate level of safety 
for workers and the public.


<R05>
Sec. 36.19  Request for written statements.

    (a) After the filing of the original application, the Commission may 
request further information necessary to enable the Commission to 
determine whether the application should be granted or denied.
    (b) Each license is issued with the condition that the licensee 
will, at any time before expiration of the license, upon the 
Commission's request, submit written statements to enable the Commission 
to determine whether the license should be modified, suspended, or 
revoked.


<R04>
     Subpart C--Design and Performance Requirements for Irradiators


<R05>
Sec. 36.21  Performance criteria for sealed sources.

    (a) Requirements. Sealed sources installed after July 1, 1993:
    (1) Must have a certificate of registration issued under 10 CFR 
32.210;
    (2) Must be doubly encapsulated;
    (3) Must use radioactive material that is as nondispersible as 
practical and that is as insoluble as practical if the source is used in 
a wet-source-storage or wet-source-change irradiator;
    (4) Must be encapsulated in a material resistant to general 
corrosion and to localized corrosion, such as 316L stainless steel or 
other material with equivalent resistance if the sources are for use in 
irradiator pools; and
    (5) In prototype testing of the sealed source, must have been leak 
tested and found leak-free after each of the tests described in 
paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
    (b) Temperature. The test source must be held at -40 deg.C for 20 
minutes, 600 deg.C for 1 hour, and then be subjected to a thermal shock 
test with a temperature drop from 600 deg.C to 20 deg.C within 15 
seconds.
    (c) Pressure. The test source must be twice subjected for at least 5 
minutes to an external pressure (absolute) of 2 million newtons per 
square meter.
     (d) Impact. A 2-kilogram steel weight, 2.5 centimeters in diameter, 
must be

[[Page 547]]

dropped from a height of 1 meter onto the test source.
    (e) Vibration. The test source must be subjected 3 times for 10 
minutes each to vibrations sweeping from 25 hertz to 500 hertz with a 
peak amplitude of 5 times the acceleration of gravity. In addition, each 
test source must be vibrated for 30 minutes at each resonant frequency 
found.
    (f) Puncture. A 50-gram weight and pin, 0.3-centimeter pin diameter, 
must be dropped from a height of 1 meter onto the test source.
    (g) Bend. If the length of the source is more than 15 times larger 
than the minimum cross-sectional dimension, the test source must be 
subjected to a force of 2000 newtons at its center equidistant from two 
support cylinders, the distance between which is 10 times the minimum 
cross-sectional dimension of the source.


<R05>
Sec. 36.23  Access control.

    (a) Each entrance to a radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must 
have a door or other physical barrier to prevent inadvertent entry of 
personnel if the sources are not in the shielded position. Product 
conveyor systems may serve as barriers as long as they reliably and 
consistently function as a barrier. It must not be possible to move the 
sources out of their shielded position if the door or barrier is open. 
Opening the door or barrier while the sources are exposed must cause the 
sources to return promptly to their shielded position. The personnel 
entrance door or barrier must have a lock that is operated by the same 
key used to move the sources. The doors and barriers must not prevent 
any individual in the radiation room from leaving.
    (b) In addition, each entrance to a radiation room at a panoramic 
irradiator must have an independent backup access control to detect 
personnel entry while the sources are exposed. Detection of entry while 
the sources are exposed must cause the sources to return to their fully 
shielded position and must also activate a visible and audible alarm to 
make the individual entering the room aware of the hazard. The alarm 
must also alert at least one other individual who is onsite of the 
entry. That individual shall be trained on how to respond to the alarm 
and prepared to promptly render or summon assistance.
    (c) A radiation monitor must be provided to detect the presence of 
high radiation levels in the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator 
before personnel entry. The monitor must be integrated with personnel 
access door locks to prevent room access when radiation levels are high. 
Attempted personnel entry while the monitor measures high radiation 
levels, must activate the alarm described in paragraph (b) of this 
section. The monitor may be located in the entrance (normally referred 
to as the maze) but not in the direct radiation beam.
    (d) Before the sources move from their shielded position in a 
panoramic irradiator, the source control must automatically activate 
conspicuous visible and audible alarms to alert people in the radiation 
room that the sources will be moved from their shielded position. The 
alarms must give individuals enough time to leave the room before the 
sources leave the shielded position.
    (e) Each radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must have a 
clearly visible and readily accessible control that would allow an 
individual in the room to make the sources return to their fully 
shielded position.
    (f) Each radiation room of a panoramic irradiator must contain a 
control that prevents the sources from moving from the shielded position 
unless the control has been activated and the door or barrier to the 
radiation room has been closed within a preset time after activation of 
the control.
    (g) Each entrance to the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator 
and each entrance to the area within the personnel access barrier of an 
underwater irradiator must have a sign bearing the radiation symbol and 
the words, ``Caution (or danger) radioactive material.'' Panoramic 
irradiators must also have a sign stating ``High radiation area,'' but 
the sign may be removed, covered, or otherwise made inoperative when the 
sources are fully shielded.
    (h) If the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator has roof plugs 
or other

[[Page 548]]

movable shielding, it must not be possible to operate the irradiator 
unless the shielding is in its proper location. This requirement may be 
met by interlocks that prevent operation if shielding is not placed 
properly or by an operating procedure requiring inspection of shielding 
before operating.
    (i) Underwater irradiators must have a personnel access barrier 
around the pool which must be locked to prevent access when the 
irradiator is not attended. Only operators and facility management may 
have access to keys to the personnel access barrier. There must be an 
intrusion alarm to detect unauthorized entry when the personnel access 
barrier is locked. Activation of the intrusion alarm must alert an 
individual (not necessarily onsite) who is prepared to respond or summon 
assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 36.25  Shielding.

    (a) The radiation dose rate in areas that are normally occupied 
during operation of a panoramic irradiator may not exceed 0.02 
millisievert (2 millirems) per hour at any location 30 centimeters or 
more from the wall of the room when the sources are exposed. The dose 
rate must be averaged over an area not to exceed 100 square centimeters 
having no linear dimension greater than 20 cm. Areas where the radiation 
dose rate exceeds 0.02 millisievert (2 millirems) per hour must be 
locked, roped off, or posted.
    (b) The radiation dose at 30 centimeters over the edge of the pool 
of a pool irradiator may not exceed 0.02 millisievert (2 millirems) per 
hour when the sources are in the fully shielded position.
    (c) The radiation dose rate at 1 meter from the shield of a dry-
source-storage panoramic irradiator when the source is shielded may not 
exceed 0.02 millisievert (2 millirems) per hour and at 5 centimeters 
from the shield may not exceed 0.2 millisievert (20 millirems) per hour.


<R05>
Sec. 36.27  Fire protection.

    (a) The radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must have heat and 
smoke detectors. The detectors must activate an audible alarm. The alarm 
must be capable of alerting a person who is prepared to summon 
assistance promptly. The sources must automatically become fully 
shielded if a fire is detected.
    (b) The radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must be equipped 
with a fire extinguishing system capable of extinguishing a fire without 
the entry of personnel into the room. The system for the radiation room 
must have a shut-off valve to control flooding into unrestricted areas.


<R05>
Sec. 36.29  Radiation monitors.

    (a) Irradiators with automatic product conveyor systems must have a 
radiation monitor with an audible alarm located to detect loose 
radioactive sources that are carried toward the product exit. If the 
monitor detects a source, an alarm must sound and product conveyors must 
stop automatically. The alarm must be capable of alerting an individual 
in the facility who is prepared to summon assistance. Underwater 
irradiators in which the product moves within an enclosed stationary 
tube are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) Underwater irradiators that are not in a shielded radiation room 
must have a radiation monitor over the pool to detect abnormal radiation 
levels. The monitor must have an audible alarm and a visible indicator 
at entrances to the personnel access barrier around the pool. The 
audible alarm may have a manual shut-off. The alarm must be capable of 
alerting an individual who is prepared to respond promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 36.31  Control of source movement.

    (a) The mechanism that moves the sources of a panoramic irradiator 
must require a key to actuate. Actuation of the mechanism must cause an 
audible signal to indicate that the sources are leaving the shielded 
position. Only one key may be in use at any time, and only operators or 
facility management may possess it. The key must be attached to a 
portable radiation survey meter by a chain or cable. The lock for source 
control must be designed so that the key may not be removed if the 
sources are in an unshielded position. The door to the radiation room 
must require the same key.

[[Page 549]]

    (b) The console of a panoramic irradiator must have a source 
position indicator that indicates when the sources are in the fully 
shielded position, when they are in transit, and when the sources are 
exposed.
    (c) The control console of a panoramic irradiator must have a 
control that promptly returns the sources to the shielded position.
    (d) Each control for a panoramic irradiator must be clearly marked 
as to its function.


<R05>
Sec. 36.33  Irradiator pools.

    (a) For licenses initially issued after July 1, 1993, irradiator 
pools must either:
    (1) Have a water-tight stainless steel liner or a liner 
metallurgically compatible with other components in the pool; or
    (2) Be constructed so that there is a low likelihood of substantial 
leakage and have a surface designed to facilitate decontamination. In 
either case, the licensee shall have a method to safely store the 
sources during repairs of the pool.
    (b) For licenses initially issued after July 1, 1993, irradiator 
pools must have no outlets more than 0.5 meter below the normal low 
water level that could allow water to drain out of the pool. Pipes that 
have intakes more than 0.5 meter below the normal low water level and 
that could act as siphons must have siphon breakers to prevent the 
siphoning of pool water.
    (c) A means must be provided to replenish water losses from the 
pool.
    (d) A visible indicator must be provided in a clearly visible 
location to indicate if the pool water level is below the normal low 
water level or above the normal high water level.
    (e) Irradiator pools must be equipped with a purification system 
designed to be capable of maintaining the water during normal operation 
at a conductivity of 20 microsiemens per centimeter or less and with a 
clarity so that the sources can be seen clearly.
    (f) A physical barrier, such as a railing or cover, must be used 
around or over irradiator pools during normal operation to prevent 
personnel from accidentally falling into the pool. The barrier may be 
removed during maintenance, inspection, and service operations.

<R05>
Sec. 36.39  Design requirements.

    Irradiators whose construction begins after July 1, 1993, must meet 
the design requirements of this section.
    (a) Shielding. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall design 
shielding walls to meet generally accepted building code requirements 
for reinforced concrete and design the walls, wall penetrations, and 
entranceways to meet the radiation shielding requirements of Sec. 36.25. 
If the irradiator will use more than 2  x  10\17\ becquerels (5 million 
curies) of activity, the licensee shall evaluate the effects of heating 
of the shielding walls by the irradiator sources.
    (b) Foundations. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
design the foundation, with consideration given to soil characteristics, 
to ensure it is adequate to support the weight of the facility shield 
walls.
    (c) Pool integrity. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall design 
the pool to assure that it is leak resistant, that it is strong enough 
to bear the weight of the

[[Page 550]]

pool water and shipping casks, that a dropped cask would not fall on 
sealed sources, that all outlets or pipes meet the requirements of 
Sec. 36.33(b), and that metal components are metallurgically compatible 
with other components in the pool.
    (d) Water handling system. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall 
verify that the design of the water purification system is adequate to 
meet the requirements of Sec. 36.33(e). The system must be designed so 
that water leaking from the system does not drain to unrestricted areas 
without being monitored.
    (e) Radiation monitors. For all irradiators, the licensee shall 
evaluate the location and sensitivity of the monitor to detect sources 
carried by the product conveyor system as required by Sec. 36.29(a). The 
licensee shall verify that the product conveyor is designed to stop 
before a source on the product conveyor would cause a radiation 
overexposure to any person. For pool irradiators, if the licensee uses 
radiation monitors to detect contamination under Sec. 36.59(b), the 
licensee shall verify that the design of radiation monitoring systems to 
detect pool contamination includes sensitive detectors located close to 
where contamination is likely to concentrate.
    (f) Source rack. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall verify 
that there are no crevices on the source or between the source and 
source holder that would promote corrosion on a critical area of the 
source. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall determine that 
source rack drops due to loss of power will not damage the source rack 
and that source rack drops due to failure of cables (or alternate means 
of support) will not cause loss of integrity of sealed sources. For 
panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall review the design of the 
mechanism that moves the sources to assure that the likelihood of a 
stuck source is low and that, if the rack sticks, a means exists to free 
it with minimal risk to personnel.
    (g) Access control. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
verify from the design and logic diagram that the access control system 
will meet the requirements of Sec. 36.23.
    (h) Fire protection. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
verify that the number, location, and spacing of the smoke and heat 
detectors are appropriate to detect fires and that the detectors are 
protected from mechanical and radiation damage. The licensee shall 
verify that the design of the fire extinguishing system provides the 
necessary discharge patterns, densities, and flow characteristics for 
complete coverage of the radiation room and that the system is protected 
from mechanical and radiation damage.
    (i) Source return. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
verify that the source rack will automatically return to the fully 
shielded position if offsite power is lost for more than 10 seconds.
    (j) Seismic. For panoramic irradiators to be built in seismic areas, 
the licensee shall design the reinforced concrete radiation shields to 
retain their integrity in the event of an earthquake by designing to the 
seismic requirements of an appropriate source such as American Concrete 
Institute Standard ACI 318-89, ``Building Code Requirements for 
Reinforced Concrete,'' Chapter 21, ``Special Provisions for Seismic 
Design,'' or local building codes, if current.
    (k) Wiring. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall verify 
that electrical wiring and electrical equipment in the radiation room 
are selected to minimize failures due to prolonged exposure to 
radiation.


<R05>
Sec. 36.41  Construction monitoring and acceptance testing.

    The requirements of this section must be met for irradiators whose 
construction begins after July 1, 1993. The requirements must be met 
prior to loading sources.
    (a) Shielding. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall monitor 
the construction of the shielding to verify that its construction meets 
design specifications and generally accepted building code requirements 
for reinforced concrete.
    (b) Foundations. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
monitor the construction of the foundations to verify that their 
construction meets design specifications.

[[Page 551]]

    (c) Pool integrity. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall verify 
that the pool meets design specifications and shall test the integrity 
of the pool. The licensee shall verify that outlets and pipes meet the 
requirements of Sec. 36.33(b).
    (d) Water handling system. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall 
verify that the water purification system, the conductivity meter, and 
the water level indicators operate properly.
    (e) Radiation monitors. For all irradiators, the licensee shall 
verify the proper operation of the monitor to detect sources carried on 
the product conveyor system and the related alarms and interlocks 
required by Sec. 36.29(a). For pool irradiators, the licensee shall 
verify the proper operation of the radiation monitors and the related 
alarm if used to meet Sec. 36.59(b). For underwater irradiators, the 
licensee shall verify the proper operation of the over-the-pool monitor, 
alarms, and interlocks required by Sec. 36.29(b).
    (f) Source rack. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall test 
the movement of the source racks for proper operation prior to source 
loading; testing must include source rack lowering due to simulated loss 
of power. For all irradiators with product conveyor systems, the 
licensee shall observe and test the operation of the conveyor system to 
assure that the requirements in Sec. 36.35 are met for protection of the 
source rack and the mechanism that moves the rack; testing must include 
tests of any limit switches and interlocks used to protect the source 
rack and mechanism that moves the rack from moving product carriers.
    (g) Access control. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
test the completed access control system to assure that it functions as 
designed and that all alarms, controls, and interlocks work properly.
     (h) Fire protection. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
test the ability of the heat and smoke detectors to detect a fire, to 
activate alarms, and to cause the source rack to automatically become 
fully shielded. The licensee shall test the operability of the fire 
extinguishing system.
     (i) Source return. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall 
demonstrate that the source racks can be returned to their fully 
shielded positions without offsite power.
     (j) Computer systems. For panoramic irradiators that use a computer 
system to control the access control system, the licensee shall verify 
that the access control system will operate properly if offsite power is 
lost and shall verify that the computer has security features that 
prevent an irradiator operator from commanding the computer to override 
the access control system when it is required to be operable.
     (k) Wiring. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall verify 
that the electrical wiring and electrical equipment that were installed 
meet the design specifications.

<R05>
Sec. 36.55  Personnel monitoring.

     (a) Irradiator operators shall wear either a film badge or a 
thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) while operating a panoramic irradiator 
or while in the area around the pool of an underwater irradiator. The 
film badge or TLD processor must be accredited by the National Voluntary 
Laboratory Accreditation Program for high energy photons in the normal 
and accident dose ranges (see 10 CFR 20.1501(c)). Each film badge or TLD 
must be assigned to and worn by only one individual. Film badges must be 
processed at least monthly, and TLDs must be processed at least 
quarterly.
    (b) Other individuals who enter the radiation room of a panoramic 
irradiator shall wear a dosimeter, which may be a pocket dosimeter. For 
groups of visitors, only two people who enter the radiation room are 
required to wear dosimeters. If pocket dosimeters are used to meet the 
requirements of this paragraph, a check of their response to radiation 
must be done at least annually. Acceptable dosimeters must read within 
plus or minus 30 percent of the true radiation dose.


<R05>
Sec. 36.57  Radiation surveys.

    (a) A radiation survey of the area outside the shielding of the 
radiation room of a panoramic irradiator must be conducted with the 
sources in the exposed position before the facility starts to operate. A 
radiation survey of the area above the pool of pool irradiators must be 
conducted after the sources are loaded but before the facility starts to 
operate. Additional radiation surveys of the shielding must be performed 
at intervals not to exceed 3 years and before resuming operation after 
addition of new sources or any modification to the radiation room 
shielding or structure that might increase dose rates.
    (b) If the radiation levels specified in Sec. 36.25 are exceeded, 
the facility must be modified to comply with the requirements in 
Sec. 36.25.
    (c) Portable radiation survey meters must be calibrated at least 
annually to an accuracy of <SUP>plus-minus20 percent for the gamma 
energy of the sources in use. The calibration must be done at two points 
on each scale or, for digital instruments, at one point per decade over 
the range that will be used. Portable radiation survey meters must be of 
a type that does not saturate and read zero at high radiation dose 
rates.
    (d) Water from the irradiator pool, other potentially contaminated 
liquids, and sediments from pool vacuuming must be monitored for 
radioactive contamination before release to unrestricted areas. 
Radioactive concentrations must not exceed those specified in 10 CFR 
part 20, Table 2, Column 2 or Table 3 of appendix B, ``Annual Limits on 
Intake (ALIs) and Derived Air Concentrations (DACs) of Radionuclides for 
Occupational Exposure; Effluent Concentrations; Concentrations for 
Release to Sewerage.''
    (e) Before releasing resins for unrestricted use, they must be 
monitored before release in an area with a background level less than 
0.5 microsievert (0.05 millirem) per hour. The resins may be released 
only if the survey does not detect radiation levels above background 
radiation levels. The survey meter used must be capable of detecting 
radiation levels of 0.5 microsievert (0.05 millirem) per hour.


<R05>
Sec. 36.59  Detection of leaking sources.

    (a) Each dry-source-storage sealed source must be tested for leakage 
at intervals not to exceed 6 months using a leak test kit or method 
approved by the Commission or an Agreement State. In the absence of a 
certificate

[[Page 554]]

from a transferor that a test has been made within the 6 months before 
the transfer, the sealed source may not be used until tested. The test 
must be capable of detecting the presence of 200 becquerels (0.005 
microcurie) of radioactive material and must be performed by a person 
approved by the Commission or an Agreement State to perform the test.
    (b) For pool irradiators, sources may not be put into the pool 
unless the licensee tests the sources for leaks or has a certificate 
from a transferor that leak test has been done within the 6 months 
before the transfer. Water from the pool must be checked for 
contamination each day the irradiator operates. The check may be done 
either by using a radiation monitor on a pool water circulating system 
or by analysis of a sample of pool water. If a check for contamination 
is done by analysis of a sample of pool water, the results of the 
analysis must be available within 24 hours. If the licensee uses a 
radiation monitor on a pool water circulating system, the detection of 
above normal radiation levels must activate an alarm. The alarm set-
point must be set as low as practical, but high enough to avoid false 
alarms. The licensee may reset the alarm set-point to a higher level if 
necessary to operate the pool water purification system to clean up 
contamination in the pool if specifically provided for in written 
emergency procedures.
    (c) If a leaking source is detected, the licensee shall arrange to 
remove the leaking source from service and have it decontaminated, 
repaired, or disposed of by an NRC or Agreement State licensee that is 
authorized to perform these functions. The licensee shall promptly check 
its personnel, equipment, facilities, and irradiated product for 
radioactive contamination. No product may be shipped until the product 
has been checked and found free of contamination. If a product has been 
shipped that may have been inadvertently contaminated, the licensee 
shall arrange to locate and survey that product for contamination. If 
any personnel are found to be contaminated, decontamination must be 
performed promptly. If contaminated equipment, facilities, or products 
are found, the licensee shall arrange to have them decontaminated or 
disposed of by an NRC or Agreement State licensee that is authorized to 
perform these functions. If a pool is contaminated, the licensee shall 
arrange to clean the pool until the contamination levels do not exceed 
the appropriate concentration in Table 2, Column 2, appendix B to part 
20. (See 10 CFR 30.50 for reporting requirements.)

conducted pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section reveals the 
presence of 0.005 microcurie (185 Bq) or more of removable radioactive 
material, the licensee shall remove the sealed source from service 
immediately and have it decontaminated, repaired, or disposed of by an 
NRC or Agreement State licensee that is authorized to perform these 
functions. The licensee shall check the equipment associated with the 
leaking source for radioactive contamination and, if contaminated, have 
it decontaminated or disposed of by an NRC or Agreement State licensee 
that is authorized to perform these functions.
    (2) The licensee shall submit a report to the appropriate NRC 
Regional Office listed in appendix D of part 20 of this chapter, within 
5 days of receiving the test results. The report must describe the 
equipment involved in the leak, the test results, any contamination 
which resulted from the leaking source, and the corrective actions taken 
up to the time the report is made.

Sec. 40.7  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a 
Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission 
licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain 
protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed

[[Page 574]]

under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of 
requirements imposed under either of those statutes;
    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory 
text.
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraphs (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be 
grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee or applicant.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each specific licensee, each applicant for a specific 
license, and each general licensee subject to part 19 shall prominently 
post the revision of NRC Form 3, ``Notice to Employees'', referenced in 
10 CFR 19.11(c).
    (2) The posting of NRC Form 3 must be at locations sufficient to 
permit employees protected by this section to observe a copy on the way 
to or from their place of work. Premises must be posted not later than 
30 days after an application is docketed and remain posted while the 
application is pending before the Commission, during the term of the 
license, and for 30 days following license termination.
    (3) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in Appendix D to Part 20 of this chapter or by 
calling the NRC Information and Records Management Branch at (301) 415-
7230.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974,

[[Page 575]]

may contain any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise 
discourage an employee from participating in protected activity as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited 
to, providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on 
potential violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory 
responsibilities.

Sec. 40.27  General license for custody and long-term care of residual radioactive material disposal sites.

    (a) A general license is issued for the custody of and long-term 
care, including monitoring, maintenance, and emergency measures 
necessary to protect public health and safety and other actions 
necessary to comply with the standards promulgated under section 275(a) 
of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, for disposal sites under 
title I of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, as 
amended. The license is available only to the Department of Energy, or 
another Federal agency designated by the President to provide long-term 
care. The

[[Page 582]]

purpose of this general license is to ensure that uranium mill tailings 
disposal sites will be cared for in such a manner as to protect the 
public health, safety, and the environment after remedial action has 
been completed.
    (b) The general license in paragraph (a) of this section becomes 
effective when the Commission accepts a site Long-Term Surveillance Plan 
(LTSP) that meets the requirements of this section, and when the 
Commission concurs with the Department of Energy's determination of 
completion of remedial action at each disposal site. There is no 
termination of this general license. The LTSP may incorporate by 
reference information contained in documents previously submitted to the 
Commission if the references to the individual incorporated documents 
are clear and specific. Each LTSP must include--
    (1) A legal description of the disposal site to be licensed, 
including documentation on whether land and interests are owned by the 
United States or an Indian tribe. If the site is on Indian land, then, 
as specified in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, 
as amended, the Indian tribe and any person holding any interest in the 
land shall execute a waiver releasing the United States of any liability 
or claim by the Tribe or person concerning or arising from the remedial 
action and holding the United States harmless against any claim arising 
out of the performance of the remedial action;
    (2) A detailed description, which can be in the form of a reference, 
of the final disposal site conditions, including existing ground water 
characterization and any necessary ground water protection activities or 
strategies. This description must be detailed enough so that future 
inspectors will have a baseline to determine changes to the site and 
when these changes are serious enough to require maintenance or repairs. 
If the disposal site has continuing aquifer restoration requirements, 
then the licensing process will be completed in two steps. The first 
step includes all items other than ground water restoration. Ground 
water monitoring, which would be addressed in the LTSP, may still be 
required in this first step to assess performance of the tailings 
disposal units. When the Commission concurs with the completion of 
ground water restoration, the licensee shall assess the need to modify 
the LTSP and report results to the Commission. If the proposed 
modifications meet the requirements of this section, the LTSP will be 
considered suitable to accommodate the second step.
    (3) A description of the long-term surveillance program, including 
proposed inspection frequency and reporting to the Commission (as 
specified in appendix A, criterion 12 of this part), frequency and 
extent of ground water monitoring if required, appropriate constituent 
concentration limits for ground water, inspection personnel 
qualifications, inspection procedures, recordkeeping and quality 
assurance procedures;
    (4) The criteria for follow-up inspections in response to 
observations from routine inspections or extreme natural events; and
    (5) The criteria for instituting maintenance or emergency measures.
    (c) The long-term care agency under the general license established 
by paragraph (a) of this section shall--
    (1) Implement the LTSP as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section;
    (2) Care for the disposal site in accordance with the provisions of 
the LTSP;
    (3) Notify the Commission of any changes to the LTSP; the changes 
may not conflict with the requirements of this section;
    (4) Guarantee permanent right-of-entry to Commission representatives 
for the purpose of periodic site inspections; and
    (5) Notify the Commission prior to undertaking any significant 
construction, actions, or repairs related to the disposal site, even if 
the action is required by a State or another Federal agency.
    (d) As specified in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act 
of 1978, as amended, the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence 
of the Secretary of Energy and the Commission, may sell or lease any 
subsurface mineral rights associated with land on which residual 
radioactive materials

[[Page 583]]

are disposed. In such cases, the Commission shall grant a license 
permitting use of the land if it finds that the use will not disturb the 
residual radioactive materials or that the residual radioactive 
materials will be restored to a safe and environmentally sound condition 
if they are disturbed by the use.
    (e) The general license in paragraph (a) of this section is exempt 
from parts 19, 20, and 21 of this chapter, unless significant 
construction, actions, or repairs are required. If these types of 
actions are to be undertaken, the licensee shall explain to the 
Commission which requirements from these parts apply for the actions and 
comply with the appropriate requirements.

Sec. 40.28  General license for custody and long-term care of uranium or thorium byproduct materials disposal sites.

    (a) A general license is issued for the custody of and long-term 
care, including monitoring, maintenance, and emergency measures 
necessary to protect the public health and safety and other actions 
necessary to comply with the standards in this part for uranium or 
thorium mill tailings sites closed under title II of the Uranium Mill 
Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, as amended. The licensee will be 
the Department of Energy, another Federal agency designated by the 
President, or a State where the disposal site is located. The purpose of 
this general license is to ensure that uranium and thorium mill tailings 
disposal sites will be cared for in such a manner as to protect the 
public health, safety, and the environment after closure.
    (b) The general license in paragraph (a) of this section becomes 
effective when the Commission terminates, or concurs in an Agreement 
State's termination of, the current specific license and a site Long-
Term Surveillance Plan (LTSP) meeting the requirements of this section 
has been accepted by the Commission. There is no termination of this 
general license. If the LTSP has not been formally received by the NRC 
prior to termination of the current specific license, the Commission may 
issue a specific order to the intended custodial agency to ensure 
continued control and surveillance of the disposal site to protect the 
public health, safety, and the environment. The Commission will not 
unnecessarily delay the termination of the specific license solely on 
the basis that an acceptable LTSP has not been received. The LTSP may 
incorporate by reference information contained in documents previously 
submitted to the Commission if the references to the individual 
incorporated documents are clear and specific. Each LTSP must include--
    (1) A legal description of the disposal site to be transferred 
(unless transfer is exempted under provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, 
Sec. 83(b)(1)(A)) and licensed;
    (2) A detailed description, which can be in the form of a reference 
of the final disposal site conditions, including existing ground water 
characterization. This description must be detailed enough so that 
future inspectors will have a baseline to determine changes to the site 
and when these changes are serious enough to require maintenance or 
repairs;
    (3) A description of the long-term surveillance program, including 
proposed inspection frequency and reporting to the Commission (as 
specified in appendix A, Criterion 12 of this part), frequency and 
extent of ground water monitoring if required, appropriate constituent 
concentration limits for ground water, inspection personnel 
qualifications, inspection procedures, recordkeeping and quality 
assurance procedures;
    (4) The criteria for follow-up inspections in response to 
observations from routine inspections or extreme natural events; and
    (5) The criteria for instituting maintenance or emergency measures.
    (c) The long-term care agency who has a general license established 
by paragraph (a) of this section shall--
    (1) Implement the LTSP as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section;
    (2) Care for the disposal site in accordance with the provisions of 
the LTSP;
    (3) Notify the Commission of any changes to the LTSP; the changes 
may not conflict with the requirements of this section;

[[Page 584]]

    (4) Guarantee permanent right-of-entry to Commission representatives 
for the purpose of periodic site inspections; and
    (5) Notify the Commission prior to undertaking any significant 
construction, actions, or repairs related to the disposal site, even if 
the action is required by a State or another Federal agency.
    (d) Upon application, the Commission may issue a specific license, 
as specified in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, 
as amended, permitting the use of surface and/or subsurface estates 
transferred to the United States or a State. Although an application may 
be received from any person, if permission is granted, the person who 
transferred the land to DOE or the State shall receive the right of 
first refusal with respect to this use of the land. The application must 
demonstrate that--
    (1) The proposed action does not endanger the public health, safety, 
welfare, or the environment;
    (2) Whether the proposed action is of a temporary or permanent 
nature, the site would be maintained and/or restored to meet 
requirements in appendix A of this part for closed sites; and
    (3) Adequate financial arrangements are in place to ensure that the 
byproduct materials will not be disturbed, or if disturbed that the 
applicant is able to restore the site to a safe and environmentally 
sound condition.
    (e) The general license in paragraph (a) of this section is exempt 
from parts 19, 20, and 21 of this chapter, unless significant 
construction, actions, or repairs are required. If these types of 
actions are to be undertaken, the licensee shall explain to the 
Commission which requirements from these parts apply for the actions and 
comply with the appropriate requirements.
    (f) In cases where the Commission determines that transfer of title 
of land used for disposal of any byproduct materials to the United 
States or any appropriate State is not necessary to protect the public 
health, safety or welfare or to minimize or eliminate danger to life or 
property (Atomic Energy Act, Sec. 83(b)(1)(A)), the Commission will 
consider specific modifications of the custodial agency's LTSP 
provisions on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 40.32   General requirements for issuance of specific licenses.

    An application for a specific license will be approved if:
    (a) The application is for a purpose authorized by the Act; and
    (b) The applicant is qualified by reason of training and experience 
to use the source material for the purpose requested in such manner as 
to protect health and minimize danger to life or property; and
    (c) The applicant's proposed equipment, facilities and procedures 
are adequate to protect health and minimize danger to life or property; 
and
    (d) The issuance of the license will not be inimical to the common 
defense and security or to the health and safety of the public; and
    (e) In the case of an application for a license for a uranium 
enrichment facility, or for a license to possess and use source and 
byproduct material for uranium milling, production of uranium 
hexafluoride, or for the conduct of any other activity which the 
Commission determines will significantly affect the quality of the 
environment, the Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards or 
his designee, before commencement of construction of the plant or 
facility in which the activity will be conducted, on the basis of 
information filed and evaluations made pursuant to subpart A of part 51 
of this chapter, has concluded, after weighing the environmental, 
economic, technical and other benefits against environmental costs and 
considering available alternatives, that the action called for is the 
issuance of the proposed license, with any appropriate conditions to 
protect environmental values. Commencement of construction prior to this 
conclusion is grounds for denial of a license to possess and use source 
and byproduct material in the plant or facility. As used in this 
paragraph, the term ``commencement of construction'' means any clearing 
of land, excavation, or other substantial action that would adversely 
affect the environment of a site. The term does not mean site 
exploration, roads necessary for site exploration, borings to determine 
foundation conditions, or other preconstruction monitoring or testing to 
establish background information related to the suitability of the site 
or the protection of environmental values.
    (f) The applicant satisfies any applicable special requirements 
contained in Sec. 40.34.
    (g) If the proposed activity involves use of source material in a 
uranium enrichment facility, the applicant has satisfied the applicable 
provisions of part 140 of this chapter.

chapter; and
    (3) The applicant submits sufficient information regarding the 
industrial product or device and the presence of depleted uranium for a 
mass-volume application in the product or device to provide reasonable 
assurance that unique benefits will accrue to the public because of the 
usefulness of the product or device.
    (b) In the case of an industrial product or device whose unique 
benefits are questionable, the Commission will approve an application 
for a specific license under this paragraph only if the product or 
device is found to combine a high degree of utility and low probability 
of uncontrolled disposal and dispersal of significant quantities of 
depleted uranium into the environment.
    (c) The Commission may deny an applicant for a specific license 
under this paragraph if the end uses of the industrial product or device

1990, for renewal of license in accordance with Sec. 40.43 shall provide 
financial assurance for decommissioning in accordance with paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section. This assurance must be submitted when this 
rule becomes effective November 24, 1995.
    (d) Each decommissioning funding plan must contain a cost estimate 
for decommissioning and a description of the method of assuring funds 
for decommissioning from paragraph (e) of this section, including means 
for adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels periodically 
over the life of the facility. The decommissioning funding plan must 
also contain a certification by the licensee that financial assurance 
for decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate 
for decommissioning and a signed original of the financial instrument 
obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Financial assurance for decommissioning must be provided by one 
or more of the following methods:
    (1) Prepayment. Prepayment is the deposit prior to the start of 
operation into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside 
the licensee's administrative control of cash or liquid assets such that 
the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs. 
Prepayment may be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government 
fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government securities.
    (2) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These 
methods guarantee that decommissioning costs will be paid. A surety 
method may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of 
credit. A parent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs 
based on a financial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as 
contained in appendix A of 10 CFR part 30. A parent company guarantee 
may not be used in combination with other financial methods to satisfy 
the requirements of this section. A guarantee of funds by the applicant 
or licensee for decommissioning costs based on a financial test may be 
used if the guarantee and test are as contained in appendix C of 10 CFR 
part 30. A guarantee by the applicant or licensee may not be used in 
combination with any other financial methods to satisfy the requirements 
of this section or in any situation where the applicant or licensee has 
a parent company holding majority control of the voting stock of the 
company. Any surety method or insurance used to provide financial 
assurance for decommissioning must contain the following conditions:
    (i) The surety method or insurance must be open-ended or, if written 
for a specified term, such as five years, must be renewed automatically 
unless 90 days or more prior to the renewal date, the issuer notifies 
the Commission, the beneficiary, and the licensee of its intention not 
to renew. The surety method or insurance must also provide that the full 
face amount be paid to the beneficiary automatically prior to the 
expiration without proof of forfeiture if

[[Page 591]]

the licensee fails to provide a replacement acceptable to the Commission 
within 30 days after receipt of notification of cancellation.
    (ii) The surety method or insurance must be payable to a trust 
established for decommissioning costs. The trustee and trust must be 
acceptable to the Commission. An acceptable trustee includes an 
appropriate State or Federal government agency or an entity which has 
the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are 
regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.
    (iii) The surety method or insurance must remain in effect until the 
Commission has terminated the license.
    (3) An external sinking fund in which deposits are made at least 
annually, coupled with a surety method or insurance, the value of which 
may decrease by the amount being accumulated in the sinking fund. An 
external sinking fund is a fund established and maintained by setting 
aside funds periodically in an account segregated from licensee assets 
and outside the licensee's administrative control in which the total 
amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs at the 
time termination of operation is expected. An external sinking fund may 
be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government fund, certificate 
of deposit, or deposit of government securities. The surety or insurance 
provision must be as stated in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) In the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, a 
statement of intent containing a cost estimate for decommissioning or an 
amount based on paragraph (b) of this section, and indicating that funds 
for decommissioning will be obtained when necessary.
    (f) Each person licensed under this part shall keep records of 
information important to the decommissioning of a facility in an 
identified location until the site is released for unrestricted use. 
Before licensed activities are transferred or assigned in accordance 
with Sec. 40.41(b) licensees shall transfer all records described in 
this paragraph to the new licensee. In this case, the new licensee will 
be responsible for maintaining these records until the license is 
terminated. If records important to the decommissioning of a facility 
are kept for other purposes, reference to these records and their 
locations may be used. Information the Commission considers important to 
decommissioning consists of--
    (1) Records of spills or other unusual occurrences involving the 
spread of contamination in and around the facility, equipment, or site. 
These records may be limited to instances when contamination remains 
after any cleanup procedures or when there is reasonable likelihood that 
contaminants may have spread to inaccessible areas as in the case of 
possible seepage into porous materials such as concrete. These records 
must include any known information on identification of involved 
nuclides, quantities, forms, and concentrations.
    (2) As-built drawings and modifications of structures and equipment 
in restricted areas where radioactive materials are used and/or stored, 
and of locations of possible inaccessible contamination such as buried 
pipes which may be subject to contamination. If required drawings are 
referenced, each relevant document need not be indexed individually. If 
drawings are not available, the licensee shall substitute appropriate 
records of available information concerning these areas and locations.
    (3) Except for areas containing depleted uranium used only for 
shielding or as penetrators in unused munitions, a list contained in a 
single document and updated every 2 years, of the following:
    (i) All areas designated and formerly designated as restricted areas 
as defined under 10 CFR 20.1003;
    (ii) All areas outside of restricted areas that require 
documentation under Sec. 40.36(f)(1);
    (iii) All areas outside of restricted areas where current and 
previous wastes have been buried as documented under 10 CFR 20.2108; and
    (iv) All areas outside of restricted areas which contain material so 
that, if the license expired, the licensee would be required to either 
decontaminate the area to unrestricted release levels or apply for 
approval for disposal under 10 CFR 20.2002.

[[Page 592]]

    (4) Records of the cost estimate performed for the decommissioning 
funding plan or of the amount certified for decommissioning, and records 
of the funding method used for assuring funds if either a funding plan 
or certification is used.

Sec. 40.42   Expiration and termination of licenses and decommissioning of sites and separate buildings or outdoor areas.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each 
specific license expires at the end of the day on the expiration date 
stated in the license unless the licensee has filed an application for 
renewal under Sec. 40.43 not less than 30 days before the expiration 
date stated in the existing license (or, for those licenses subject to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 30 days before the deemed expiration 
date in that

[[Page 593]]

paragraph). If an application for renewal has been filed at least 30 
days before the expiration date stated in the existing license (or, for 
those licenses subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 30 days 
before the deemed expiration date in that paragraph), the existing 
license expires at the end of the day on which the Commission makes a 
final determination to deny the renewal application or, if the 
determination states an expiration date, the expiration date stated in 
the determination.
    (2) Each specific license that has an expiration date after July 1, 
1995, and is not one of the licenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, shall be deemed to have an expiration date that is five 
years after the expiration date stated in the current license.
    (3) The following specific licenses are not subject to, or otherwise 
affected by, the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
    (i) Specific licenses for which, on February 15, 1996, an evaluation 
or an emergency plan is required in accordance with Sec. 40.31(j);
    (ii) Specific licenses whose holders are subject to the financial 
assurance requirements specified in 10 CFR 40.36, and on February 15, 
1996, the holders either:
    (A) Have not submitted a decommissioning funding plan nor 
certification of financial assurance for decommissioning; or
    (B) Have not received written notice that the decommissioning 
funding plan or certification of financial assurance for decommissioning 
is acceptable;
    (iii) Specific licenses whose holders are listed in the SDMP List 
published in NUREG 1444, Supplement 1 (November 1995);
    (iv) Specific licenses whose issuance, amendment, or renewal, as of 
February 15, 1996, is not a categorical exclusion under 10 CFR 
51.22(c)(14) and, therefore, need an environmental assessment or 
environmental impact statement pursuant to Subpart A of Part 51 of this 
chapter;
    (v) Specific licenses whose holders have not had at least one NRC 
inspection of licensed activities before February 15, 1996;
    (vi) Specific licenses whose holders, as the result of the most 
recent NRC inspection of licensed activities conducted before February 
15, 1996, have been:
    (A) Cited for a Severity Level I, II, or III violation in a Notice 
of Violation;
    (B) Subject to an Order issued by the NRC; or
    (C) Subject to a CAL issued by the NRC.
    (vii) Specific licenses with expiration dates before July 1, 1995, 
for which the holders have submitted applications for renewal under 10 
CFR 40.43 of this part.
    (b) Each specific license revoked by the Commission expires at the 
end of the day on the date of the Commission's final determination to 
revoke the license, or on the expiration date stated in the 
determination, or as otherwise provided by Commission Order.
    (c) Each specific license continues in effect, beyond the expiration 
date if necessary, with respect to possession of source material until 
the Commission notifies the licensee in writing that the license is 
terminated. During this time, the licensee shall--
    (1) Limit actions involving source material to those related to 
decommissioning; and
    (2) Continue to control entry to restricted areas until they are 
suitable for release in accordance with NRC requirements;
    (d) Within 60 days of the occurrence of any of the following, 
consistent with the administrative directions in Sec. 40.5, each 
licensee shall provide notification to the NRC in writing and either 
begin decommissioning its site, or any separate building or outdoor area 
that contains residual radioactivity, so that the building or outdoor 
area is suitable for release in accordance with NRC requirements, or 
submit within 12 months of notification a decommissioning plan, if 
required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and begin decommissioning 
upon approval of that plan if--
    (1) The license has expired pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section; or
    (2) The licensee has decided to permanently cease principal 
activities, as defined in this part, at the entire site

[[Page 594]]

or in any separate building or outdoor area; or
    (3) No principal activities under the license have been conducted 
for a period of 24 months; or
    (4) No principal activities have been conducted for a period of 24 
months in any separate building or outdoor area that contains residual 
radioactivity such that the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for 
release in accordance with NRC requirements.
    (e) Coincident with the notification required by paragraph (d) of 
this section, the licensee shall maintain in effect all decommissioning 
financial assurances established by the licensee pursuant to Sec. 40.36 
in conjunction with a license issuance or renewal or as required by this 
section. The amount of the financial assurance must be increased, or may 
be decreased, as appropriate, to cover the detailed cost estimate for 
decommissioning established pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(v) of this 
section.
    (1) Any licensee who has not provided financial assurance to cover 
the detailed cost estimate submitted with the decommissioning plan shall 
do so when this rule becomes effective November 24, 1995.
    (2) Following approval of the decommissioning plan, a licensee may 
reduce the amount of the financial assurance as decommissioning proceeds 
and radiological contamination is reduced at the site with the approval 
of the Commission.
    (f) The Commission may grant a request to delay or postpone 
initiation of the decommissioning process if the Commission determines 
that such relief is not detrimental to the public health and safety and 
is otherwise in the public interest. The request must be submitted no 
later than 30 days before notification pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section. The schedule for decommissioning set forth in paragraph (d) of 
this section may not commence until the Commission has made a 
determination on the request.
    (g)(1) A decommissioning plan must be submitted if required by 
license condition or if the procedures and activities necessary to carry 
out decommissioning of the site or separate building or outdoor area 
have not been previously approved by the Commission and these procedures 
could increase potential health and safety impacts to workers or to the 
public, such as in any of the following cases:
    (i) Procedures would involve techniques not applied routinely during 
cleanup or maintenance operations;
    (ii) Workers would be entering areas not normally occupied where 
surface contamination and radiation levels are significantly higher than 
routinely encountered during operation;
    (iii) Procedures could result in significantly greater airborne 
concentrations of radioactive materials than are present during 
operation; or
    (iv) Procedures could result in significantly greater releases of 
radioactive material to the environment than those associated with 
operation.
    (2) The Commission may approve an alternate schedule for submittal 
of a decommissioning plan required pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section if the Commission determines that the alternative schedule is 
necessary to the effective conduct of decommissioning operations and 
presents no undue risk from radiation to the public health and safety 
and is otherwise in the public interest.
    (3) The procedures listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section may 
not be carried out prior to approval of the decommissioning plan.
    (4) The proposed decommissioning plan for the site or separate 
building or outdoor area must include:
    (i) A description of the conditions of the site or separate building 
or outdoor area sufficient to evaluate the acceptability of the plan;
    (ii) A description of planned decommissioning activities;
    (iii) A description of methods used to ensure protection of workers 
and the environment against radiation hazards during decommissioning;
    (iv) A description of the planned final radiation survey; and
    (v) An updated detailed cost estimate for decommissioning, 
comparison of that estimate with present funds set aside for 
decommissioning, and a plan for assuring the availability of adequate 
funds for completion of decommissioning.

[[Page 595]]

    (vi) For decommissioning plans calling for completion of 
decommissioning later than 24 months after plan approval, a 
justification for the delay based on the criteria in paragraph (i) of 
this section.
    (5) The proposed decommissioning plan will be approved by the 
Commission if the information therein demonstrates that the 
decommissioning will be completed as soon as practicable and that the 
health and safety of workers and the public will be adequately 
protected.
    (h)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, 
licensees shall complete decommissioning of the site or separate 
building or outdoor area as soon as practicable but no later than 24 
months following the initiation of decommissioning.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when 
decommissioning involves the entire site, the licensee shall request 
license termination as soon as practicable but no later than 24 months 
following the initiation of decommissioning.
    (i) The Commission may approve a request for an alternate schedule 
for completion of decommissioning of the site or separate building or 
outdoor area, and license termination if appropriate, if the Commission 
determines that the alternative is warranted by consideration of the 
following:
    (1) Whether it is technically feasible to complete decommissioning 
within the allotted 24-month period;
    (2) Whether sufficient waste disposal capacity is available to allow 
completion of decommissioning within the allotted 24-month period;
    (3) Whether a significant volume reduction in wastes requiring 
disposal will be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to 
decay;
    (4) Whether a significant reduction in radiation exposure to workers 
can be achieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to decay; and
    (5) Other site-specific factors which the Commission may consider 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis, such as the regulatory requirements 
of other government agencies, lawsuits, ground-water treatment 
activities, monitored natural ground-water restoration, actions that 
could result in more environmental harm than deferred cleanup, and other 
factors beyond the control of the licensee.
    (j) As the final step in decommissioning, the licensee shall--
    (1) Certify the disposition of all licensed material, including 
accumulated wastes, by submitting a completed NRC Form 314 or equivalent 
information; and
    (2) Conduct a radiation survey of the premises where the licensed 
activities were carried out and submit a report of the results of this 
survey unless the licensee demonstrates that the premises are suitable 
for release in some other manner. The licensee shall, as appropriate--
    (i) Report levels of gamma radiation in units of millisieverts 
(microroentgen) per hour at one meter from surfaces, and report levels 
of radioactivity, including alpha and beta, in units of megabecquerels 
(disintegrations per minute or microcuries) per 100 square centimeters 
removable and fixed for surfaces, megabecquerels (microcuries) per 
milliliter for water, and becquerels (picocuries) per gram for solids 
such as soils or concrete; and
    (ii) Specify the survey instrument(s) used and certify that each 
instrument is properly calibrated and tested.
    (k) Specific licenses, including expired licenses, will be 
terminated by written notice to the licensee when the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) Source material has been properly disposed;
    (2) Reasonable effort has been made to eliminate residual 
radioactive contamination, if present; and
    (3)(i) A radiation survey has been performed which demonstrates that 
the premises are suitable for release in accordance with NRC 
requirements.
    (ii) Other information submitted by the licensee is sufficient to 
demonstrate that the premises are suitable for release in accordance 
with NRC requirements.
    (4) Records required by Sec. 40.61(d) and (f) have been received.
    (l) Specific licenses for uranium and thorium milling are exempt 
from paragraphs (d)(4), (f) and (g) of this section with respect to 
reclamation of tailings

Sec. 40.60  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Immediate report. Each licensee shall notify the NRC as soon as 
possible but not later than 4 hours after the discovery of an event that 
prevents immediate protective actions necessary to avoid exposures to 
radiation or radioactive materials that could exceed regulatory limits 
or releases of licensed material that could exceed regulatory limits 
(events may include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, etc.).
    (b) Twenty-four hour report. Each licensee shall notify the NRC 
within 24 hours after the discovery of any of the following events 
involving licensed material:

  Appendix A to Part 40--Criteria Relating to the Operation of Uranium 
    Mills and the Disposition of Tailings or Wastes Produced by the 
   Extraction or Concentration of Source Material From Ores Processed 
               Primarily for Their Source Material Content

    Introduction. Every applicant for a license to possess and use 
source material in conjunction with uranium or thorium milling, or 
byproduct material at sites formerly associated with such milling, is 
required by the provisions of Sec. 40.31(h) to include in a license 
application proposed specifications relating to milling operations and 
the disposition of tailings or wastes resulting from such milling 
activities. This appendix establishes technical, financial, ownership, 
and long-term site surveillance criteria relating to the siting, 
operation, decontamination, decommissioning, and reclamation of mills 
and tailings or waste systems and sites at which such mills and systems 
are located. As used in this appendix, the term ``as low as is 
reasonably achievable'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 20.1003 of this 
chapter.
    In many cases, flexibility is provided in the criteria to allow 
achieving an optimum tailings disposal program on a site-specific basis. 
However, in such cases the objectives, technical alternatives and 
concerns which must be taken into account in developing a tailings 
program are identified. As provided by the provisions of Sec. 40.31(h) 
applications for licenses must clearly demonstrate how the criteria have 
been addressed.
    The specifications must be developed considering the expected full 
capacity of tailings or waste systems and the lifetime of mill 
operations. Where later expansions of systems or operations may be 
likely (for example, where large quantities of ore now marginally 
uneconomical may be stockpiled), the amenability of the disposal system 
to accommodate increased capacities without degradation in long-term 
stability and other performance factors must be evaluated.
    Licensees or applicants may propose alternatives to the specific 
requirements in this appendix. The alternative proposals may take into 
account local or regional conditions, including geology, topography, 
hydrology, and meterology. The Commission may find that the proposed 
alternatives meet the Commission's requirements if the alternatives will 
achieve a level of stabilization and containment of the sites concerned, 
and a level of protection for public health, safety, and the environment 
from radiological and nonradiological hazards associated with the sites, 
which is equivalent to, to the extent practicable, or more stringent 
than the level which would be achieved by the requirements of this 
Appendix and the standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection 
Agency in 40 CFR Part 192, Subparts D and E.
    All site specific licensing decisions based on the criteria in this 
Appendix or alternatives proposed by licensees or applicants will take 
into account the risk to the public health and safety and the 
environment with due consideration to the economic costs involved and 
any other factors the Commission determines to be appropriate. In 
implementing this Appendix, the Commission will consider ``practicable'' 
and ``reasonably achievable'' as equivalent terms. Decisions involved 
these terms will take into account the state of technology, and the 
economics of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health 
and safety, and other societal and socioeconomic considerations, and in 
relation to the utilization of atomic energy in the public interest.
    The following definitions apply to the specified terms as used in 
this appendix:
    Aquifer means a geologic formation, group of formations, or part of 
a formation capable of yielding a significant amount of ground water to 
wells or springs. Any saturated zone created by uranium or thorium 
recovery operations would not be considered an aquifer unless the zone 
is or potentially is (1) hydraulically interconnected to a natural 
aquifer, (2) capable of discharge to surface water, or (3) reasonably 
accessible because of migration beyond the vertical projection of the 
boundary of the land transferred for long-term government ownership and 
care in accordance with Criterion 11 of this appendix.
    As expeditiously as practicable considering technological 
feasibility, for the purposes of Criterion 6A, means as quickly as 
possible considering: the physical characteristics of the tailings and 
the site; the limits of available technology; the need for consistency 
with mandatory requirements of other regulatory programs; and factors 
beyond the control of the licensee. The phrase permits consideration of 
the cost of compliance only to the extent specifically provided for by 
use of the term available technology.

[[Page 604]]

    Available technology means technologies and methods for emplacing a 
final radon barrier on uranium mill tailings piles or impoundments. This 
term shall not be construed to include extraordinary measures or 
techniques that would impose costs that are grossly excessive as 
measured by practice within the industry (or one that is reasonably 
analogous), (such as, by way of illustration only, unreasonable 
overtime, staffing, or transportation requirements, etc., considering 
normal practice in the industry; laser fusion of soils, etc.), provided 
there is reasonable progress toward emplacement of the final radon 
barrier. To determine grossly excessive costs, the relevant baseline 
against which cost shall be compared is the cost estimate for tailings 
impoundment closure contained in the licensee's approved reclamation 
plan, but costs beyond these estimates shall not automatically be 
considered grossly excessive.
    Closure means the activities following operations to decontaminate 
and decommission the buildings and site used to produce byproduct 
materials and reclaim the tailings and/or waste disposal area.
    Closure plan means the Commission approved plan to accomplish 
closure.
    Compliance period begins when the Commission sets secondary ground-
water protection standards and ends when the owner or operator's license 
is terminated and the site is transferred to the State or Federal agency 
for long-term care.
    Dike means an embankment or ridge of either natural or man-made 
materials used to prevent the movement of liquids, sludges, solids or 
other materials.
    Disposal area means the area containing byproduct materials to which 
the requirements of Criterion 6 apply.
    Existing portion means that land surface area of an existing surface 
impoundment on which significant quantities of uranium or thorium 
byproduct materials had been placed prior to September 30, 1983.
    Factors beyond the control of the licensee means factors proximately 
causing delay in meeting the schedule in the applicable reclamation plan 
for the timely emplacement of the final radon barrier notwithstanding 
the good faith efforts of the licensee to complete the barrier in 
compliance with paragraph (1) of Criterion 6A. These factors may 
include, but are not limited to--
    (1) Physical conditions at the site;
    (2) Inclement weather or climatic conditions;
    (3) An act of God;
    (4) An act of war;
    (5) A judicial or administrative order or decision, or change to the 
statutory, regulatory, or other legal requirements applicable to the 
licensee's facility that would preclude or delay the performance of 
activities required for compliance;
    (6) Labor disturbances;
    (7) Any modifications, cessation or delay ordered by State, Federal, 
or local agencies;
    (8) Delays beyond the time reasonably required in obtaining 
necessary government permits, licenses, approvals, or consent for 
activities described in the reclamation plan proposed by the licensee 
that result from agency failure to take final action after the licensee 
has made a good faith, timely effort to submit legally sufficient 
applications, responses to requests (including relevant data requested 
by the agencies), or other information, including approval of the 
reclamation plan; and
    (9) An act or omission of any third party over whom the licensee has 
no control.
    Final radon barrier means the earthen cover (or approved alternative 
cover) over tailings or waste constructed to comply with Criterion 6 of 
this appendix (excluding erosion protection features).
    Ground water means water below the land surface in a zone of 
saturation. For purposes of this appendix, ground water is the water 
contained within an aquifer as defined above.
    Leachate means any liquid, including any suspended or dissolved 
components in the liquid, that has percolated through or drained from 
the byproduct material.
    Licensed site means the area contained within the boundary of a 
location under the control of persons generating or storing byproduct 
materials under a Commission license.
    Liner means a continuous layer of natural or man-made materials, 
beneath or on the sides of a surface impoundment which restricts the 
downward or lateral escape of byproduct material, hazardous 
constituents, or leachate.
    Milestone means an action or event that is required to occur by an 
enforceable date.
    Operation means that a uranium or thorium mill tailings pile or 
impoundment is being used for the continued placement of byproduct 
material or is in standby status for such placement. A pile or 
impoundment is in operation from the day that byproduct material is 
first placed in the pile or impoundment until the day final closure 
begins.
    Point of compliance is the site specific location in the uppermost 
aquifer where the ground-water protection standard must be met.
    Reclamation plan, for the purposes of Criterion 6A, means the plan 
detailing activities to accomplish reclamation of the tailings or waste 
disposal area in accordance with the technical criteria of this 
appendix. The reclamation plan must include a schedule for reclamation 
milestones that are key to the completion of the final radon barrier 
including as appropriate, but not limited to, wind blown tailings 
retrieval and placement on the pile, interim stabilization (including

[[Page 605]]

dewatering or the removal of freestanding liquids and recontouring), and 
final radon barrier construction. (Reclamation of tailings must also be 
addressed in the closure plan; the detailed reclamation plan may be 
incorporated into the closure plan.)
    Surface impoundment means a natural topographic depression, man-made 
excavation, or diked area, which is designed to hold an accumulation of 
liquid wastes or wastes containing free liquids, and which is not an 
injection well.
    Uppermost aquifer means the geologic formation nearest the natural 
ground surface that is an aquifer, as well as lower aquifers that are 
hydraulically interconnected with this aquifer within the facility's 
property boundary.

                          I. Technical Criteria

    Criterion 1--The general goal or broad objective in siting and 
design decisions is permanent isolation of tailings and associated 
contaminants by minimizing disturbance and dispersion by natural forces, 
and to do so without ongoing maintenance. For practical reasons, 
specific siting decisions and design standards must involve finite times 
(e.g., the longevity design standard in Criterion 6). The following site 
features which will contribute to such a goal or objective must be 
considered in selecting among alternative tailings disposal sites or 
judging the adequacy of existing tailings sites:
    Remoteness from populated areas;
    Hydrologic and other natural conditions as they contribute to 
continued immobilization and isolation of contaminants from ground-water 
sources; and
    Potential for minimizing erosion, disturbance, and dispersion by 
natural forces over the long term.
    The site selection process must be an optimization to the maximum 
extent reasonably achievable in terms of these features.
    In the selection of disposal sites, primary emphasis must be given 
to isolation of tailings or wastes, a matter having long-term impacts, 
as opposed to consideration only of short-term convenience or benefits, 
such as minimization of transportation or land acquisition costs. While 
isolation of tailings will be a function of both site and engineering 
design, overriding consideration must be given to siting features given 
the long-term nature of the tailings hazards.
    Tailings should be disposed of in a manner that no active 
maintenance is required to preserve conditions of the site.
    Criterion 2--To avoid proliferation of small waste disposal sites 
and thereby reduce perpetual surveillance obligations, byproduct 
material from in situ extraction operations, such as residues from 
solution evaporation or contaminated control processes, and wastes from 
small remote above ground extraction operations must be disposed of at 
existing large mill tailings disposal sites; unless, considering the 
nature of the wastes, such as their volume and specific activity, and 
the costs and environmental impacts of transporting the wastes to a 
large disposal site, such offsite disposal is demonstrated to be 
impracticable or the advantages of onsite burial clearly outweigh the 
benefits of reducing the perpetual surveillance obligations.
    Criterion 3--The ``prime option'' for disposal of tailings is 
placement below grade, either in mines or specially excavated pits (that 
is, where the need for any specially constructed retention structure is 
eliminated). The evaluation of alternative sites and disposal methods 
performed by mill operators in support of their proposed tailings 
disposal program (provided in applicants' environmental reports) must 
reflect serious consideration of this disposal mode. In some instances, 
below grade disposal may not be the most environmentally sound approach, 
such as might be the case if a ground-water formation is relatively 
close to the surface or not very well isolated by overlying soils and 
rock. Also, geologic and topographic conditions might make full below 
grade burial impracticable: For example, bedrock may be sufficiently 
near the surface that blasting would be required to excavate a disposal 
pit at excessive cost, and more suitable alternative sites are not 
available. Where full below grade burial is not practicable, the size of 
retention structures, and size and steepness of slopes associated 
exposed embankments must be minimized by excavation to the maximum 
extent reasonably achievable or appropriate given the geologic and 
hydrologic conditions at a site. In these cases, it must be demonstrated 
that an above grade disposal program will provide reasonably equivalent 
isolation of the tailings from natural erosional forces.
    Criterion 4--The following site and design criteria must be adhered 
to whether tailings or wastes are disposed of above or below grade.
    (a) Upstream rainfall catchment areas must be minimized to decrease 
erosion potential and the size of the floods which could erode or wash 
out sections of the tailings disposal area.
    (b) Topographic features should provide good wind protection.
    (c) Embankment and cover slopes must be relatively flat after final 
stabilization to minimize erosion potential and to provide conservative 
factors of safety assuring long-term stability. The broad objective 
should be to contour final slopes to grades which are as close as 
possible to those which would be provided if tailings were disposed of 
below grade; this could, for example, lead to slopes of about 10 
horizontal to 1 vertical (10h:1v) or less steep. In general, slopes 
should not be steeper than about 5h:1v. Where steeper slopes are 
proposed, reasons why a slope less

[[Page 606]]

steep than 5h:1v would be impracticable should be provided, and 
compensating factors and conditions which make such slopes acceptable 
should be identified.
    (d) A full self-sustaining vegetative cover must be established or 
rock cover employed to reduce wind and water erosion to negligible 
levels.
    Where a full vegetative cover is not likely to be self-sustaining 
due to climatic or other conditions, such as in semi-arid and arid 
regions, rock cover must be employed on slopes of the impoundment 
system. The NRC will consider relaxing this requirement for extremely 
gentle slopes such as those which may exist on the top of the pile.
    The following factors must be considered in establishing the final 
rock cover design to avoid displacement of rock particles by human and 
animal traffic or by natural process, and to preclude undercutting and 
piping:
    Shape, size, composition, and gradation of rock particles (excepting 
bedding material average particles size must be at least cobble size or 
greater);
    Rock cover thickness and zoning of particles by size; and
    Steepness of underlying slopes.
    Individual rock fragments must be dense, sound, and resistant to 
abrasion, and must be free from cracks, seams, and other defects that 
would tend to unduly increase their destruction by water and frost 
actions. Weak, friable, or laminated aggregate may not be used.
    Rock covering of slopes may be unnecessary where top covers are very 
thick ( or less); bulk cover materials have inherently favorable erosion 
resistance characteristics; and, there is negligible drainage catchment 
area upstream of the pile and good wind protection as described in 
points (a) and (b) of this Criterion.
    Furthermore, all impoundment surfaces must be contoured to avoid 
areas of concentrated surface runoff or abrupt or sharp changes in slope 
gradient. In addition to rock cover on slopes, areas toward which 
surface runoff might be directed must be well protected with substantial 
rock cover (rip rap). In addition to providing for stability of the 
impoundment system itself, overall stability, erosion potential, and 
geomorphology of surrounding terrain must be evaluated to assure that 
there are not ongoing or potential processes, such as gully erosion, 
which would lead to impoundment instability.
    (e) The impoundment may not be located near a capable fault that 
could cause a maximum credible earthquake larger than that which the 
impoundment could reasonably be expected to withstand. As used in this 
criterion, the term ``capable fault'' has the same meaning as defined in 
section III(g) of Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 100. The term ``maximum 
credible earthquake'' means that earthquake which would cause the 
maximum vibratory ground motion based upon an evaluation of earthquake 
potential considering the regional and local geology and seismology and 
specific characteristics of local subsurface material.
    (f) The impoundment, where feasible, should be designed to 
incorporate features which will promote deposition. For example, design 
features which promote deposition of sediment suspended in any runoff 
which flows into the impoundment area might be utilized; the object of 
such a design feature would be to enhance the thickness of cover over 
time.
    Criterion 5--Criteria 5A-5D and new Criterion 13 incorporate the 
basic ground-water protection standards imposed by the Environmental 
Protection Agency in 40 CFR Part 192, Subparts D and E (48 FR 45926; 
October 7, 1983) which apply during operations and prior to the end of 
closure. Ground-water monitoring to comply with these standards is 
required by Criterion 7A.
    5A(1)--The primary ground-water protection standard is a design 
standard for surface impoundments used to manage uranium and thorium 
byproduct material. Unless exempted under paragraph 5A(3) of this 
criterion, surface impoundments (except for an existing portion) must 
have a liner that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any 
migration of wastes out of the impoundment to the adjacent subsurface 
soil, ground water, or surface water at any time during the active life 
(including the closure period) of the impoundment. The liner may be 
constructed of materials that may allow wastes to migrate into the liner 
(but not into the adjacent subsurface soil, ground water, or surface 
water) during the active life of the facility, provided that impoundment 
closure includes removal or decontamination of all waste residues, 
contaminated containment system components (liners, etc.), contaminated 
subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste and 
leachate. For impoundments that will be closed with the liner material 
left in place, the liner must be constructed of materials that can 
prevent wastes from migrating into the liner during the active life of 
the facility.
    5A(2)--The liner required by paragraph 5A(1) above must be--
    (a) Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical 
properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due 
to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic 
forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are 
exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress 
of daily operation;
    (b) Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to 
the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner 
to prevent failure of the liner

[[Page 607]]

due to settlement, compression, or uplift; and
    (c) Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact 
with the wastes or leachate.
    5A(3)--The applicant or licensee will be exempted from the 
requirements of paragraph 5A(1) of this criterion if the Commission 
finds, based on a demonstration by the applicant or licensee, that 
alternate design and operating practices, including the closure plan, 
together with site characteristics will prevent the migration of any 
hazardous constituents into ground water or surface water at any future 
time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Commission will 
consider--
    (a) The nature and quantity of the wastes;
    (b) The proposed alternate design and operation;
    (c) The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the 
attenuative capacity and thickness of the liners and soils present 
between the impoundment and ground water or surface water; and
    (d) All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility 
of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to ground 
water or surface water.
    5A(4)--A surface impoundment must be designed, constructed, 
maintained, and operated to prevent overtopping resulting from normal or 
abnormal operations, overfilling, wind and wave actions, rainfall, or 
run-on; from malfunctions of level controllers, alarms, and other 
equipment; and from human error.
    5A(5)--When dikes are used to form the surface impoundment, the 
dikes must be designed, constructed, and maintained with sufficient 
structural integrity to prevent massive failure of the dikes. In 
ensuring structural integrity, it must not be presumed that the liner 
system will function without leakage during the active life of the 
impoundment.
    5B(1)--Uranium and thorium byproduct materials must be managed to 
conform to the following secondary ground-water protection standard: 
Hazardous constituents entering the ground water from a licensed site 
must not exceed the specified concentration limits in the uppermost 
aquifer beyond the point of compliance during the compliance period. 
Hazardous constituents are those constituents identified by the 
Commission pursuant to paragraph 5B(2) of this criterion. Specified 
concentration limits are those limits established by the Commission as 
indicated in paragraph 5B(5) of this criterion. The Commission will also 
establish the point of compliance and compliance period on a site 
specific basis through license conditions and orders. The objective in 
selecting the point of compliance is to provide the earliest practicable 
warning that the impoundment is releasing hazardous constituents to the 
ground water. The point of compliance must be selected to provide prompt 
indication of ground-water contamination on the hydraulically 
downgradient edge of the disposal area. The Commission shall identify 
hazardous constituents, establish concentration limits, set the 
compliance period, and may adjust the point of compliance if needed to 
accord with developed data and site information as to the flow of ground 
water or contaminants, when the detection monitoring established under 
Criterion 7A indicates leakage of hazardous constituents from the 
disposal area.
    5B(2)--A constituent becomes a hazardous constituent subject to 
paragraph 5B(5) only when the constituent meets all three of the 
following tests:
    (a) The constituent is reasonably expected to be in or derived from 
the byproduct material in the disposal area;
    (b) The constituent has been detected in the ground water in the 
uppermost aquifer; and
    (c) The constituent is listed in Criterion 13 of this appendix.
    5B(3)--Even when constituents meet all three tests in paragraph 
5B(2) of this criterion, the Commission may exclude a detected 
constituent from the set of hazardous constituents on a site specific 
basis if it finds that the constituent is not capable of posing a 
substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the 
environment. In deciding whether to exclude constituents, the Commission 
will consider the following:
    (a) Potential adverse effects on ground-water quality, considering--
    (i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the 
licensed site, including its potential for migration;
    (ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and 
surrounding land;
    (iii) The quantity of ground water and the direction of ground-water 
flow;
    (iv) The proximity and withdrawal rates of ground-water users;
    (v) The current and future uses of ground water in the area;
    (vi) The existing quality of ground water, including other sources 
of contamination and their cumulative impact on the ground-water 
quality;
    (vii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to 
waste constituents;
    (viii) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and 
physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents;
    (ix) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse 
effects.
    (b) Potential adverse effects on hydraulically-connected surface 
water quality, considering--
    (i) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the 
waste in the licensed site;

[[Page 608]]

    (ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and 
surrounding land;
    (iii) The quantity and quality of ground water, and the direction of 
ground-water flow;
    (iv) The patterns of rainfall in the region;
    (v) The proximity of the licensed site to surface waters;
    (vi) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and 
any water quality standards established for those surface waters;
    (vii) The existing quality of surface water, including other sources 
of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface-water quality;
    (viii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to 
waste constituents;
    (ix) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and 
physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and
    (x) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.
    5B(4)--In making any determinations under paragraphs 5B(3) and 5B(6) 
of this criterion about the use of ground water in the area around the 
facility, the Commission will consider any identification of underground 
sources of drinking water and exempted aquifers made by the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
    5B(5)--At the point of compliance, the concentration of a hazardous 
constituent must not exceed--
    (a) The Commission approved background concentration of that 
constituent in the ground water;
    (b) The respective value given in the table in paragraph 5C if the 
constituent is listed in the table and if the background level of the 
constituent is below the value listed; or
    (c) An alternate concentration limit established by the Commission.
    5B(6)--Conceptually, background concentrations pose no incremental 
hazards and the drinking water limits in paragraph 5C state acceptable 
hazards but these two options may not be practically achievable at a 
specific site. Alternate concentration limits that present no 
significant hazard may be proposed by licensees for Commission 
consideration. Licensees must provide the basis for any proposed limits 
including consideration of practicable corrective actions, that limits 
are as low as reasonably achievable, and information on the factors the 
Commission must consider. The Commission will establish a site specific 
alternate concentration limit for a hazardous constituent as provided in 
paragraph 5B(5) of this criterion if it finds that the proposed limit is 
as low as reasonably achievable, after considering practicable 
corrective actions, and that the constituent will not pose a substantial 
present or potential hazard to human health or the environment as long 
as the alternate concentration limit is not exceeded. In making the 
present and potential hazard finding, the Commission will consider the 
following factors:
    (a) Potential adverse effects on ground-water quality, considering--
    (i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the 
licensed site including its potential for migration;
    (ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and 
surrounding land;
    (iii) The quantity of ground water and the direction of ground-water 
flow;
    (iv) The proximity and withdrawal rates of ground-water users;
    (v) The current and future uses of ground water in the area;
    (vi) The existing quality of ground water, including other sources 
of contamination and their cumulative impact on the ground-water 
quality;
    (vii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to 
waste constituents;
    (viii) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and 
physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents;
    (ix) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse 
effects.
    (b) Potential adverse effects on hydraulically-connected surface 
water quality, considering--
    (i) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the 
waste in the licensed site;
    (ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and 
surrounding land;
    (iii) The quantity and quality of ground water, and the direction of 
ground-water flow;
    (iv) The patterns of rainfall in the region;
    (v) The proximity of the licensed site to surface waters;
    (vi) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and 
any water quality standards established for those surface waters;
    (vii) The existing quality of surface water including other sources 
of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface water quality;
    (viii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to 
waste constituents;
    (ix) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and 
physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and
    (x) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.

    5D--If the ground-water protection standards established under 
paragraph 5B(1) of this criterion are exceeded at a licensed site, a 
corrective action program must be put into operation as soon as is 
practicable, and in no event later than eighteen (18) months after the 
Commission finds that the standards have been exceeded. The licensee 
shall submit the proposed corrective action program and supporting 
rationale for Commission approval prior to putting the program into 
operation, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. The objective of 
the program is to return hazardous constituent concentration levels in 
ground water to the concentration limits set as standards. The 
licensee's proposed program must address removing the hazardous 
constituents that have entered the ground water at the point of 
compliance or treating them in place. The program must also address 
removing or treating in place any hazardous constituents that exceed 
concentration limits in ground water between the point of compliance and 
the downgradient facility property boundary. The licensee shall continue 
corrective action measures to the extent necessary to achieve and 
maintain compliance with the ground-water protection standard. The 
Commission will determine when the licensee may terminate corrective 
action measures based on data from the ground-water monitoring program 
and other information that provide reasonable assurance that the ground-
water protection standard will not be exceeded.
    5E--In developing and conducting ground-water protection programs, 
applicants and licensees shall also consider the following:
    (1) Installation of bottom liners (Where synthetic liners are used, 
a leakage detection system must be installed immediately below the liner 
to ensure major failures are detected if they occur. This is in addition 
to the ground-water monitoring program conducted as provided in 
Criterion 7. Where clay liners are proposed or relatively thin, in-situ 
clay soils are to be relied upon for seepage control, tests must be 
conducted with representative tailings solutions and clay materials to 
confirm that no significant deterioration of permeability or stability 
properties will occur with continuous exposure of clay to tailings 
solutions. Tests must be run for a sufficient period of time to reveal 
any effects if they are going to occur (in some cases deterioration has 
been observed to occur rather rapidly after about nine months of 
exposure)).
    (2) Mill process designs which provide the maximum practicable 
recycle of solutions and conservation of water to reduce the net input 
of liquid to the tailings impoundment.
    (3) Dewatering of tailings by process devices and/or in-situ 
drainage systems (At new sites, tailings must be dewatered by a drainage 
system installed at the bottom of the impoundment to lower the phreatic 
surface and reduce the driving head of seepage, unless tests show 
tailings are not amenable to such a system. Where in-situ dewatering is 
to be conducted, the impoundment bottom must be graded to assure that 
the drains are at a low point. The drains must be protected by suitable 
filter materials to assure that drains remain free running. The drainage 
system must also be adequately sized to assure good drainage).
    (4) Neutralization to promote immobilization of hazardous 
constituents.
    5F--Where ground-water impacts are occurring at an existing site due 
to seepage, action must be taken to alleviate conditions that lead to 
excessive seepage impacts and restore ground-water quality. The specific 
seepage control and ground-water protection method, or combination of 
methods, to be used must be worked out on a site-specific basis. 
Technical specifications must be prepared to control installation of 
seepage control systems. A quality assurance, testing, and inspection 
program, which includes supervision by a qualified engineer or 
scientist, must be established to assure the specifications are met.
    5G--In support of a tailings disposal system proposal, the 
applicant/operator shall supply information concerning the following:
    (1) The chemical and radioactive characteristics of the waste 
solutions.
    (2) The characteristics of the underlying soil and geologic 
formations particularly as they will control transport of contaminants

[[Page 610]]

and solutions. This includes detailed information concerning extent, 
thickness, uniformity, shape, and orientation of underlying strata. 
Hydraulic gradients and conductivities of the various formations must be 
determined. This information must be gathered from borings and field 
survey methods taken within the proposed impoundment area and in 
surrounding areas where contaminants might migrate to ground water. The 
information gathered on boreholes must include both geologic and 
geophysical logs in sufficient number and degree of sophistication to 
allow determining significant discontinuities, fractures, and channeled 
deposits of high hydraulic conductivity. If field survey methods are 
used, they should be in addition to and calibrated with borehole 
logging. Hydrologic parameters such as permeability may not be 
determined on the basis of laboratory analysis of samples alone; a 
sufficient amount of field testing (e.g., pump tests) must be conducted 
to assure actual field properties are adequately understood. Testing 
must be conducted to allow estimating chemi-sorption attenuation 
properties of underlying soil and rock.
    (3) Location, extent, quality, capacity and current uses of any 
ground water at and near the site.
    5H--Steps must be taken during stockpiling of ore to minimize 
penetration of radionuclides into underlying soils; suitable methods 
include lining and/or compaction of ore storage areas.
    Criterion 6--(1) In disposing of waste byproduct material, licensees 
shall place an earthen cover (or approved alternative) over tailings or 
wastes at the end of milling operations and shall close the waste 
disposal area in accordance with a design <SUP>1 which provides 
reasonable assurance of control of radiological hazards to (i) be 
effective for 1,000 years, to the extent reasonably achievable, and, in 
any case, for at least 200 years, and (ii) limit releases of radon-222 
from uranium byproduct materials, and radon-220 from thorium byproduct 
materials, to the atmosphere so as not to exceed an average <SUP>2 
release rate of 20 picocuries per square meter per second (pCi/m<SUP>2s) 
to the extent practicable throughout the effective design life 
determined pursuant to (1)(i) of this Criterion. In computing required 
tailings cover thicknesses, moisture in soils in excess of amounts found 
normally in similar soils in similar circumstances may not be 
considered. Direct gamma exposure from the tailings or wastes should be 
reduced to background levels. The effects of any thin synthetic layer 
may not be taken into account in determining the calculated radon 
exhalation level. If non-soil materials are proposed as cover materials, 
it must be demonstrated that these materials will not crack or degrade 
by differential settlement, weathering, or other mechanism, over long-
term intervals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In the case of thorium byproduct materials, the standard applies 
only to design. Monitoring for radon emissions from thorium byproduct 
materials after installation of an appropriately designed cover is not 
required.
    \2\ This average applies to the entire surface of each disposal area 
over a period of a least one year, but a period short compared to 100 
years. Radon will come from both byproduct materials and from covering 
materials. Radon emissions from covering materials should be estimated 
as part of developing a closure plan for each site. The standard, 
however, applies only to emissions from byproduct materials to the 
atmosphere.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) As soon as reasonably achievable after emplacement of the final 
cover to limit releases of radon-222 from uranium byproduct material and 
prior to placement of erosion protection barriers or other features 
necessary for long-term control of the tailings, the licensee shall 
verify through appropriate testing and analysis that the design and 
construction of the final radon barrier is effective in limiting 
releases of radon-222 to a level not exceeding 20 pCi/m \2\s averaged 
over the entire pile or impoundment using the procedures described in 40 
CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115, or another method of verification 
approved by the Commission as being at least as effective in 
demonstrating the effectiveness of the final radon barrier.
    (3) When phased emplacement of the final radon barrier is included 
in the applicable reclamation plan, the verification of radon-222 
release rates required in paragraph (2) of this criterion must be 
conducted for each portion of the pile or impoundment as the final radon 
barrier for that portion is emplaced.
    (4) Within ninety days of the completion of all testing and analysis 
relevant to the required verification in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this 
criterion, the uranium mill licensee shall report to the Commission the 
results detailing the actions taken to verify that levels of release of 
radon-222 do not exceed 20 pCi/m \2\s when averaged over the entire pile 
or impoundment. The licensee shall maintain records until termination of 
the license documenting the source of input parameters including the 
results of all measurements on which they are based, the calculations 
and/or analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, 
and the procedure used to determine compliance. These records shall be 
kept in a form suitable for transfer to the custodial agency at the time 
of transfer of the site to DOE or a State for long-term care if 
requested.
    (5) Near surface cover materials (i.e., within the top three meters) 
may not include waste or rock that contains elevated levels of radium; 
soils used for near surface cover

[[Page 611]]

must be essentially the same, as far as radioactivity is concerned, as 
that of surrounding surface soils. This is to ensure that surface radon 
exhalation is not significantly above background because of the cover 
material itself.
    (6) The design requirements in this criterion for longevity and 
control of radon releases apply to any portion of a licensed and/or 
disposal site unless such portion contains a concentration of radium in 
land, averaged over areas of 100 square meters, which, as a result of 
byproduct material, does not exceed the background level by more than: 
(i) 5 picocuries per gram (pCi/g) of radium-226, or, in the case of 
thorium byproduct material, radium-228, averaged over the first 15 
centimeters (cm) below the surface, and (ii) 15 pCi/g of radium-226, or, 
in the case of thorium byproduct material, radium-228, averaged over 15-
cm thick layers more than 15 cm below the surface.
    (7) The licensee shall also address the nonradiological hazards 
associated with the wastes in planning and implementing closure. The 
licensee shall ensure that disposal areas are closed in a manner that 
minimizes the need for further maintenance. To the extent necessary to 
prevent threats to human health and the environment, the licensee shall 
control, minimize, or eliminate post-closure escape of nonradiological 
hazardous constituents, leachate, contaminated rainwater, or waste 
decomposition products to the ground or surface waters or to the 
atmosphere.
    Criterion 6A--(1) For impoundments containing uranium byproduct 
materials, the final radon barrier must be completed as expeditiously as 
practicable considering technological feasibility after the pile or 
impoundment ceases operation in accordance with a written, Commission-
approved reclamation plan. (The term as expeditiously as practicable 
considering technological feasibility as specifically defined in the 
Introduction of this appendix includes factors beyond the control of the 
licensee.) Deadlines for completion of the final radon barrier and, if 
applicable, the following interim milestones must be established as a 
condition of the individual license: windblown tailings retrieval and 
placement on the pile and interim stabilization (including dewatering or 
the removal of freestanding liquids and recontouring). The placement of 
erosion protection barriers or other features necessary for long-term 
control of the tailings must also be completed in a timely manner in 
accordance with a written, Commission-approved reclamation plan.
    (2) The Commission may approve a licensee's request to extend the 
time for performance of milestones related to emplacement of the final 
radon barrier if, after providing an opportunity for public 
participation, the Commission finds that the licensee has adequately 
demonstrated in the manner required in paragraph (2) of Criterion 6 that 
releases of radon-222 do not exceed an average of 20 pCi/m\2\s. If the 
delay is approved on the basis that the radon releases do not exceed 20 
pCi/m\2\s, a verification of radon levels, as required by paragraph (2) 
of Criterion 6, must be made annually during the period of delay. In 
addition, once the Commission has established the date in the 
reclamation plan for the milestone for completion of the final radon 
barrier, the Commission may extend that date based on cost if, after 
providing an opportunity for public participation, the Commission finds 
that the licensee is making good faith efforts to emplace the final 
radon barrier, the delay is consistent with the definition of available 
technology, and the radon releases caused by the delay will not result 
in a significant incremental risk to the public health.
    (3) The Commission may authorize by license amendment, upon licensee 
request, a portion of the impoundment to accept uranium byproduct 
material or such materials that are similar in physical, chemical, and 
radiological characteristics to the uranium mill tailings and associated 
wastes already in the pile or impoundment, from other sources, during 
the closure process. No such authorization will be made if it results in 
a delay or impediment to emplacement of the final radon barrier over the 
remainder of the impoundment in a manner that will achieve levels of 
radon-222 releases not exceeding 20 pCi/m\2\s averaged over the entire 
impoundment. The verification required in paragraph (2) of Criterion 6 
may be completed with a portion of the impoundment being used for 
further disposal if the Commission makes a final finding that the 
impoundment will continue to achieve a level of radon-222 releases not 
exceeding 20 pCi/m<SUP>2s averaged over the entire impoundment. In this 
case, after the final radon barrier is complete except for the 
continuing disposal area, (a) only byproduct material will be authorized 
for disposal, (b) the disposal will be limited to the specified existing 
disposal area, and (c) this authorization will only be made after 
providing opportunity for public participation. Reclamation of the 
disposal area, as appropriate, must be completed in a timely manner 
after disposal operations cease in accordance with paragraph (1) of 
Criterion 6; however, these actions are not required to be complete as 
part of meeting the deadline for final radon barrier construction.
    Criterion 7--At least one full year prior to any major site 
construction, a preoperational monitoring program must be conducted to 
provide complete baseline data on a milling site and its environs. 
Throughout the construction and operating phases of the mill, an 
operational monitoring program must be conducted to measure or evaluate 
compliance with applicable standards and

[[Page 612]]

regulations; to evaluate performance of control systems and procedures; 
to evaluate environmental impacts of operation; and to detect potential 
long-term effects.
    7A--The licensee shall establish a detection monitoring program 
needed for the Commission to set the site-specific ground-water 
protection standards in paragraph 5B(1) of this appendix. For all 
monitoring under this paragraph the licensee or applicant will propose 
for Commission approval as license conditions which constituents are to 
be monitored on a site specific basis. A detection monitoring program 
has two purposes.The initial purpose of the program is to detect leakage 
of hazardous constituents from the disposal area so that the need to set 
ground-water protection standards is monitored. If leakage is detected, 
the second purpose of the program is to generate data and information 
needed for the Commission to establish the standards under Criterion 5B. 
The data and information must provide a sufficient basis to identify 
those hazardous constituents which require concentration limit standards 
and to enable the Commission to set the limits for those constituents 
and the compliance period. They may also need to provide the basis for 
adjustments to the point of compliance. For licenses in effect September 
30, 1983, the detection monitoring programs must have been in place by 
October 1, 1984. For licenses issued after September 30, 1983, the 
detection monitoring programs must be in place when specified by the 
Commission in orders or license conditions. Once ground-water protection 
standards have been established pursuant to paragraph 5B(1), the 
licensee shall establish and implement a compliance monitoring program. 
The purpose of the compliance monitoring program is to determine that 
the hazardous constituent concentrations in ground water continue to 
comply with the standards set by the Commission. In conjunction with a 
corrective action program, the licensee shall establish and implement a 
corrective action monitoring program. The purpose of the corrective 
action monitoring program is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
corrective actions. Any monitoring program required by this paragraph 
may be based on existing monitoring programs to the extent the existing 
programs can meet the stated objective for the program.
    Criterion 8--Milling operations must be conducted so that all 
airborne effluent releases are reduced to levels as low as is reasonably 
achievable. The primary means of accomplishing this must be by means of 
emission controls. Institutional controls, such as extending the site 
boundary and exclusion area, may be employed to ensure that offsite 
exposure limits are met, but only after all practicable measures have 
been taken to control emissions at the source. Notwithstanding the 
existence of individual dose standards, strict control of emissions is 
necessary to assure that population exposures are reduced to the maximum 
extent reasonably achievable and to avoid site contamination. The 
greatest potential sources of offsite radiation exposure (aside from 
radon exposure) are dusting from dry surfaces of the tailings disposal 
area not covered by tailings solution and emissions from yellowcake 
drying and packaging operations. During operations and prior to closure, 
radiation doses from radon emissions from surface impoundments of 
uranium or thorium byproduct materials must be kept as low as is 
reasonably achievable.
    Checks must be made and logged hourly of all parameters (e.g., 
differential pressures and scrubber water flow rates) that determine the 
efficiency of yellowcake stack emission control equipment operation. The 
licensee shall retain each log as a record for three years after the 
last entry in the log is made. It must be determined whether or not 
conditions are within a range prescribed to ensure that the equipment is 
operating consistently near peak efficiency; corrective action must be 
taken when performance is outside of prescribed ranges. Effluent control 
devices must be operative at all times during drying and packaging 
operations and whenever air is exhausting from the yellowcake stack. 
Drying and packaging operations must terminate when controls are 
inoperative. When checks indicate the equipment is not operating within 
the range prescribed for peak efficiency, actions must be taken to 
restore parameters to the prescribed range. When this cannot be done 
without shutdown and repairs, drying and packaging operations must cease 
as soon as practicable. Operations may not be restarted after cessation 
due to off-normal performance until needed corrective actions have been 
identified and implemented. All these cessations, corrective actions, 
and restarts must be reported to the appropriate NRC regional office as 
indicated in Criterion 8A, in writing, within ten days of the subsequent 
restart.
    To control dusting from tailings, that portion not covered by 
standing liquids must be wetted or chemically stabilized to prevent or 
minimize blowing and dusting to the maximum extent reasonably 
achievable. This requirement may be relaxed if tailings are effectively 
sheltered from wind, such as may be the case where they are disposed of 
below grade and the tailings surface is not exposed to wind. 
Consideration must be given in planning tailings disposal programs to 
methods which would allow phased covering and reclamation of tailings 
impoundments because this will help in controlling particulate and radon 
emissions during operation. To control dusting from diffuse sources, 
such as tailings and ore pads where automatic

[[Page 613]]

controls do not apply, operators shall develop written operating 
procedures specifying the methods of control which will be utilized.
    Milling operations producing or involving thorium byproduct material 
must be conducted in such a manner as to provide reasonable assurance 
that the annual dose equivalent does not exceed 25 millirems to the 
whole body, 75 millirems to the thyroid, and 25 millirems to any other 
organ of any member of the public as a result of exposures to the 
planned discharge of radioactive materials, radon-220 and its daughters 
excepted, to the general environment.
    Uranium and thorium byproduct materials must be managed so as to 
conform to the applicable provisions of Title 40 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 440, ``Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category: 
Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards, 
Subpart C, Uranium, Radium, and Vanadium Ores Subcategory,'' as codified 
on January 1, 1983.
    Criterion 8A--Daily inspections of tailings or waste retention 
systems must be conducted by a qualified engineer or scientist and 
documented. The licensee shall retain the documentation for each daily 
inspection as a record for three years after the documentation is made. 
The appropriate NRC regional office as indicated in Appendix D to 10 CFR 
Part 20 of this chapter, or the Director, Office of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, 
DC, 20555, must be immediately notified of any failure in a tailings or 
waste retention system that results in a release of tailings or waste 
into unrestricted areas, or of any unusual conditions (conditions not 
contemplated in the design of the retention system) that is not 
corrected could indicate the potential or lead to failure of the system 
and result in a release of tailings or waste into unrestricted areas.

                         II. Financial Criteria

    Criterion 9--Financial surety arrangements must be established by 
each mill operator prior to the commencement of operations to assure 
that sufficient funds will be available to carry out the decontamination 
and decommissioning of the mill and site and for the reclamation of any 
tailings or waste disposal areas. The amount of funds to be ensured by 
such surety arrangements must be based on Commission-approved cost 
estimates in a Commission-approved plan for (1) decontamination and 
decommissioning of mill buildings and the milling site to levels which 
allow unrestricted use of these areas upon decommissioning, and (2) the 
reclamation of tailings and/or waste areas in accordance with technical 
criteria delineated in Section I of this Appendix. The licensee shall 
submit this plan in conjunction with an environmental report that 
addresses the expected environmental impacts of the milling operation, 
decommissioning and tailings reclamation, and evaluates alternatives for 
mitigating these impacts. The surety must also cover the payment of the 
charge for long-term surveillance and control required by Criterion 10. 
In establishing specific surety arrangements, the licensee's cost 
estimates must take into account total costs that would be incurred if 
an independent contractor were hired to perform the decommissioning and 
reclamation work. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication and expense, 
the Commission may accept financial sureties that have been consolidated 
with financial or surety arrangements established to meet requirements 
of other Federal or state agencies and/or local governing bodies for 
such decommissioning, decontamination, reclamation, and long-term site 
surveillance and control, provided such arrangements are considered 
adequate to satisfy these requirements and that the portion of the 
surety which covers the decommissioning and reclamation of the mill, 
mill tailings site and associated areas, and the long-term funding 
charge is clearly identified and committed for use in accomplishing 
these activities. The licensees's surety mechanism will be reviewed 
annually by the Commission to assure, that sufficient funds would be 
available for completion of the reclamation plan if the work had to be 
performed by an independent contractor. The amount of surety liability 
should be adjusted to recognize any increases or decreases resulting 
from inflation, changes in engineering plans, activities performed, and 
any other conditions affecting costs. Regardless of whether reclamation 
is phased through the life of the operation or takes place at the end of 
operations, an appropriate portion of surety liability must be retained 
until final compliance with the reclamation plan is determined.
    This will yield a surety that is at least sufficient at all times to 
cover the costs of decommissioning and reclamation of the areas that are 
expected to be disturbed before the next license renewal. The term of 
the surety mechanism must be open ended, unless it can be demonstrated 
that another arrangement would provide an equivalent level of assurance. 
This assurance would be provided with a surety instrument which is 
written for a specified period of time (e.g., 5 years) yet which must be 
automatically renewed unless the surety notifies the beneficiary (the 
Commission or the State regulatory agency) and the principal (the 
licensee) some reasonable time (e.g., 90 days) prior to the renewal date 
of their intention not to renew. In such a situation the surety 
requirement still exists and the licensee would be required to submit an 
acceptable replacement surety within a brief period of time to allow at 
least 60 days for the regulatory agency to collect.

[[Page 614]]

    Proof of forfeiture must not be necessary to collect the surety so 
that in the event that the licensee could not provide an acceptable 
replacement surety within the required time, the surety shall be 
automatically collected prior to its expiration. The conditions 
described above would have to be clearly stated on any surety instrument 
which is not open-ended, and must be agreed to by all parties. Financial 
surety arrangements generally acceptable to the Commission are:
    (a) Surety bonds;
    (b) Cash deposits;
    (c) Certificates of deposits;
    (d) Deposits of government securities;
    (e) Irrevocable letters or lines of credit; and
    (f) Combinations of the above or such other types of arrangements as 
may be approved by the Commission. However, self insurance, or any 
arrangement which essentially constitutes self insurance (e.g., a 
contract with a State or Federal agency), will not satisfy the surety 
requirement since this provides no additional assurance other than that 
which already exists through license requirements.
    Criterion 10--A minimum charge of $250,000 (1978 dollars) to cover 
the costs of long-term surveillance must be paid by each mill operator 
to the general treasury of the United States or to an appropriate State 
agency prior to the termination of a uranium or thorium mill license.
    If site surveillance or control requirements at a particular site 
are determined, on the basis of a site-specific evaluation, to be 
significantly greater than those specified in Criterion 12 (e.g., if 
fencing is determined to be necessary), variance in funding requirements 
may be specified by the Commission. In any case, the total charge to 
cover the costs of long-term surveillance must be such that, with an 
assumed 1 percent annual real interest rate, the collected funds will 
yield interest in an amount sufficient to cover the annual costs of site 
surveillance. The total charge will be adjusted annually prior to actual 
payment to recognize inflation. The inflation rate to be used is that 
indicated by the change in the Consumer Price Index published by the 
U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

               III. Site and Byproduct Material Ownership

    Criterion 11--A. These criteria relating to ownership of tailings 
and their disposal sites become effective on November 8, 1981, and apply 
to all licenses terminated, issued, or renewed after that date.
    B. Any uranium or thorium milling license or tailings license must 
contain such terms and conditions as the Commission determines necessary 
to assure that prior to termination of the license, the licensee will 
comply with ownership requirements of this criterion for sites used for 
tailings disposal.
    C. Title to the byproduct material licensed under this Part and 
land, including any interests therein (other than land owned by the 
United States or by a State) which is used for the disposal of any such 
byproduct material, or is essential to ensure the long term stability of 
such disposal site, must be transferred to the United States or the 
State in which such land is located, at the option of such State. In 
view of the fact that physical isolation must be the primary means of 
long-term control, and Government land ownership is a desirable 
supplementary measure, ownership of certain severable subsurface 
interests (for example, mineral rights) may be determined to be 
unnecessary to protect the public health and safety and the environment. 
In any case, however, the applicant/operator must demonstrate a serious 
effort to obtain such subsurface rights, and must, in the event that 
certain rights cannot be obtained, provide notification in local public 
land records of the fact that the land is being used for the disposal of 
radioactive material and is subject to either an NRC general or specific 
license prohibiting the disruption and disturbance of the tailings. In 
some rare cases, such as may occur with deep burial where no ongoing 
site surveillance will be required, surface land ownership transfer 
requirements may be waived. For licenses issued before November 8, 1981, 
the Commission may take into account the status of the ownership of such 
land, and interests therein, and the ability of a licensee to transfer 
title and custody thereof to the United States or a State.
    D. If the Commission subsequent to title transfer determines that 
use of the surface or subsurface estates, or both, of the land 
transferred to the United States or to a State will not endanger the 
public health, safety, welfare, or environment, the Commission may 
permit the use of the surface or subsurface estates, or both, of such 
land in a manner consistent with the provisions provided in these 
criteria. If the Commission permits such use of such land, it will 
provide the person who transferred such land with the right of first 
refusal with respect to such use of such land.
    E. Material and land transferred to the United States or a State in 
accordance with this Criterion must be transferred without cost to the 
United States or a State other than administrative and legal costs 
incurred in carrying out such transfer.
    F. The provisions of this part respecting transfer of title and 
custody to land and tailings and wastes do not apply in the case of 
lands held in trust by the United States for any Indian tribe or lands 
owned by such Indian tribe subject to a restriction against alienation 
imposed by the United States. In the case of such lands which are used 
for the

[[Page 615]]

disposal of byproduct material, as defined in this Part, the licensee 
shall enter into arrangements with the Commission as may be appropriate 
to assure the long-term surveillance of such lands by the United States.

                     IV. Long-Term Site Surveillance

    Criterion 12--The final disposition of tailings, residual 
radioactive material, or wastes at milling sites should be such that 
ongoing active maintenance is not necessary to preserve isolation. As a 
minimum, annual site inspections must be conducted by the government 
agency responsible for long-term care of the disposal site to confirm 
its integrity and to determine the need, if any, for maintenance and/or 
monitoring. Results of the inspections for all the sites under the 
licensee's jurisdiction will be reported to the Commission annually 
within 90 days of the last site inspection in that calendar year. Any 
site where unusual damage or disruption is discovered during the 
inspection, however, will require a preliminary site inspection report 
to be submitted within 60 days. On the basis of a site specific 
evaluation, the Commission may require more frequent site inspections if 
necessary due to the features of a particular disposal site. In this 
case, a preliminary inspection report is required to be submitted within 
60 days following each inspection.

                        V. Hazardous Constituents

    Criterion 13--Secondary ground-water protection standards required 
by Criterion 5 of this appendix are concentration limits for individual 
hazardous constituents. The following list of constituents identifies 
the constituents for which standards must be set and complied with if 
the specific constituent is reasonably expected to be in or derived from 
the byproduct material and has been detected in ground water. For 
purposes of this appendix, the property of gross alpha activity will be 
treated as if it is a hazardous constituent. Thus, when setting 
standards under paragraph 5B(5) of Criterion 5, the Commission will also 
set a limit for gross alpha activity. The Commission does not consider 
the following list imposed by 40 CFR Part 192 to be exhaustive and may 
determine other constituents to be hazardous on a case-by-case basis, 
independent of those specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency in Part 192.

    Low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel means fuel in which the weight 
percent of U-235 in the uranium is less than 20%.
    Low population zone means the area immediately surrounding the 
exclusion area which contains residents, the total number and density of 
which are such that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate 
protective measures could be taken in their behalf in the event of a 
serious accident. These guides do not specify a permissible population 
density or total population within this zone because the situation may 
vary from case to case. Whether a specific number of people can, for 
example, be evacuated from a specific area, or instructed to take 
shelter, on a timely basis will depend on many factors such as location, 
number and size of highways, scope and extent of advance planning, and 
actual distribution of residents within the area.

application for experimental and demonstration purposes, including the 
experimental production and testing of models, devices, equipment, 
materials, and processes.
    Responsible officer means, for the purposes of Sec. 50.55(e) of this 
chapter, the president, vice-president, or other individual in the 
organization of a corporation, partnership, or other entity who is 
vested with executive authority over activities subject to this part.
    Restricted Data means all data concerning (1) design, manufacture, 
or utilization of atomic weapons; (2) the production of special nuclear 
material; or (3) the use of special nuclear material in the production 
of energy, but shall not include data declassified or removed from the 
Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Act.
    Safe shutdown (non-design basis accident (non-DBA)) for station 
blackout means bringing the plant to those shutdown conditions specified 
in plant technical specifications as Hot Standby or Hot Shutdown, as 
appropriate (plants have the option of maintaining the RCS at normal 
operating temperatures or at reduced temperatures).
    Safety-related structures, systems, and components means those 
structures, systems, and components that are relied on to remain 
functional during and following design basis (postulated) events to 
assure:

[[Page 627]]

    (1) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary;
    (2) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition; and
    (3) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents which could result in potential offsite exposures comparable 
to the applicable guideline exposures set forth in Sec. 50.34(a)(1) or 
Sec. 100.11 of this chapter, as applicable.
    Source material means source material as defined in subsection 11z. 
of the Act and in the regulations contained in part 40 of this chapter.
    Special nuclear material means (1) plutonium, uranium-233, uranium 
enriched in the isotope-233 or in the isotope-235, and any other 
material which the Commission, pursuant to the provisions of section 51 
of the act, determines to be special nuclear material, but does not 
include source material; or (2) any material artificially enriched by 
any of the foregoing, but does not include source material.
    Station blackout means the complete loss of alternating current (ac) 
electric power to the essential and nonessential switchgear buses in a 
nuclear power plant (i.e., loss of offsite electric power system 
concurrent with turbine trip and unavailability of the onsite emergency 
ac power system). Station blackout does not include the loss of 
available ac power to buses fed by station batteries through inverters 
or by alternate ac sources as defined in this section, nor does it 
assume a concurrent single failure or design basis accident. At single 
unit sites, any emergency ac power source(s) in excess of the number 
required to meet minimum redundancy requirements (i.e., single failure) 
for safe shutdown (non-DBA) is assumed to be available and may be 
designated as an alternate power source(s) provided the applicable 
requirements are met. At multi-unit sites, where the combination of 
emergency ac power sources exceeds the minimum redundancy requirements 
for safe shutdown (non-DBA) of all units, the remaining emergency ac 
power sources may be used as alternate ac power sources provided they 
meet the applicable requirements. If these criteria are not met, station 
blackout must be assumed on all the units.
    Substantial safety hazard means, for the purposes of Sec. 50.55(e) 
of this chapter, a loss of safety function to the extent that there is a 
major reduction in the degree of protection provided to public health 
and safety for any facility or activity authorized by the construction 
permit issued under this part.
    Testing facility means a nuclear reactor which is of a type 
described in Sec. 50.21(c) of this part and for which an application has 
been filed for a license authorizing operation at:
    (1) A thermal power level in excess of 10 megawatts; or
    (2) A thermal power level in excess of 1 megawatt, if the reactor is 
to contain:
    (i) A circulating loop through the core in which the applicant 
proposes to conduct fuel experiments; or
    (ii) A liquid fuel loading; or
    (iii) An experimental facility in the core in excess of 16 square 
inches in cross-section.
    Total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) means the sum of the deep-
dose equivalent (for external exposures) and the committed effective 
dose equivalent (for internal exposures).
    Unique purpose means a project, program, or commercial activity 
which cannot reasonably be accomplished without the use of HEU fuel, and 
may include: (1) A specific experiment, program, or commercial activity 
(typically long-term) that significantly serves the U.S. national 
interest and cannot be accomplished without the use of HEU fuel; (2) 
Reactor physics or reactor development based explicitly on the use of 
HEU fuel; (3) Research projects based on neutron flux levels or spectra 
attainable only with HEU fuel; or (4) A reactor core of special design 
that could not perform its intended function without using HEU fuel.
    United States, when used in a geographical sense, includes Puerto 
Rico and all territories and possessions of the United States.
    Utilization facility means any nuclear reactor other than one 
designed or used primarily for the formation of plutonium or U-233.

    Note: Pursuant to subsections 11v. and 11cc., respectively, of the 
Act, the Commission may from time to time add to, or otherwise alter, 
the foregoing definitions of production and utilization facility. It may 
also include as a facility an important component part especially 
designed for a facility, but has not at this time included any component 
parts in the definitions.

Sec. 50.7  Employee protection.

    (a) Discrimination by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a 
Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission 
licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain 
protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes discharge 
and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 
section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in 
general are related to the administration or enforcement of a 
requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy 
Reorganization Act.
    (1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:
    (i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information 
about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph 
(a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of 
requirements imposed under either of those statutes;

[[Page 631]]

    (ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either 
of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these 
requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
the employer;
    (iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or 
her employer for the administration or enforcement of these 
requirements;
    (iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or 
at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed 
provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory 
text.
    (v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or 
participate in, these activities.
    (2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is 
actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or 
participation.
    (3) This section has no application to any employee alleging 
discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction 
from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes 
a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 
as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or 
otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected 
activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a 
remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative 
proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding 
must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The 
employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with 
the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and 
Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back 
pay, and compensatory damages.
    (c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a 
Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a 
contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be 
grounds for--
    (1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.
    (2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee or applicant.
    (3) Other enforcement action.
    (d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect 
an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The 
prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee 
has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in 
protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune 
from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse 
action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.
    (e)(1) Each licensee and each applicant for a license shall 
prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, ``Notice to Employees,'' 
referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(c). This form must be posted at locations 
sufficient to permit employees protected by this section to observe a 
copy on the way to or from their place of work. Premises must be posted 
not later than 30 days after an application is docketed and remain 
posted while the application is pending before the Commission, during 
the term of the license, and for 30 days following license termination.
    (2) Copies of NRC Form 3 may be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Administrator of the appropriate U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Regional Office listed in Appendix D to Part 20 of this chapter or by 
calling the NRC Information and Records Management Branch at (301) 415-
7230.
    (f) No agreement affecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint 
filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to section 
211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain 
any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an 
employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section including, but not limited to, 
providing information to the NRC or to his or her employer on potential 
violations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

testing facilities, required to be licensed pursuant to section 104a or 
section 104c of the Act, the construction of buildings which will be 
used for activities other than operation of a facility and which may 
also be used to house a facility. (For example, the construction of a 
college laboratory building with space for installation of a training 
reactor is not affected by this paragraph. This paragraph does not apply 
to production or utilization facilities subject to paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
and subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, no person shall 
effect commencement of construction of a production or utilization 
facility subject to the provisions of Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter on a 
site on which the facility is to be operated until a construction permit 
has been issued. As used in this paragraph, the term ``commencement of 
construction'' means any clearing of land, excavation or other 
substantial action that would adversely affect the environment of a 
site, but does not mean:
    (1) Changes desirable for the temporary use of the land for public 
recreational uses, necessary borings to determine foundation conditions 
or other preconstruction monitoring to establish background information 
related to the suitability of the site or to the protection of 
environmental values;
    (2) Procurement or manufacture of components of the facility; and
    (3) With respect to production or utilization facilities, other than 
testing facilities, required to be licensed pursuant to section 104a or 
section 104c of the Act, the construction of buildings which will be 
used for activities other than operation of a facility and which may 
also be used to house a facility. (For example, the construction of a 
college laboratory building with space for installation of a training 
reactor is not affected by this paragraph.)
    (d)(1) Each person subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of 
this section, who is, on March 21, 1972, conducting activities permitted 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section in effect prior to March 21, 
1972, may furnish to the Commission within 30 days after March 21, 1972 
or such later date as may be approved by the Commission upon good cause 
shown, a written statement of any reasons, with supporting factual 
submission, why, with reference to the factors stated in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the activities should be continued, pending the 
issuance of a construction permit, notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section. If such written statement has been 
submitted, within the time specified, such activities may continue to be 
conducted pending Commission action pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Upon submission of a statement of reasons pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section the Commission may authorize the continued 
conduct of activities permitted by paragraph (b) of this section in 
effect prior to March 21, 1972, upon consideration and balancing of the 
following factors:
    (i) Whether continuation of the activities will give rise to a 
significant adverse impact on the environment and the nature and extent 
of such impact, if any;
    (ii) Whether redress of any adverse environmental impact from 
continuation of the activities can reasonably be effected should such 
redress be necessary;
    (iii) Whether continuation of the activities would foreclose 
subsequent adoption of alternatives; and
    (iv) The effect of delay in conducting such activities on the public 
interest, including the power needs to be served by the proposed 
facility, the availability of alternative sources, if any, to meet those 
needs on a timely basis, and delay costs to the applicant and to 
consumers.
    (3) Activities permitted to be continued pursuant to this paragraph 
(d)

[[Page 634]]

shall be conducted in such a manner as will minimize or reduce their 
environmental impact.
    (e)(1) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may authorize an 
applicant for a construction permit for a utilization facility which is 
subject to Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter, and is of the type specified 
in Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 or is a testing facility to 
conduct the following activities: (i) Preparation of the site for 
construction of the facility (including such activities as clearing, 
grading, construction of temporary access roads and borrow areas); (ii) 
installation of temporary construction support facilities (including 
such items as warehouse and shop facilities, utilities, concrete mixing 
plants, docking and unloading facilities, and construction support 
buildings); (iii) excavation for facility structures; (iv) construction 
of service facilities (including such facilities as roadways, paving, 
railroad spurs, fencing, exterior utility and lighting systems, 
transmission lines, and sanitary sewerage treatment facilities); and (v) 
the construction of structures, systems and components which do not 
prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents that could 
cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public. No such 
authorization shall be granted unless the staff has completed a final 
environmental impact statement on the issuance of the construction 
permit as required by subpart A of part 51 of this chapter.
    (2) Such an authorization shall be granted only after the presiding 
officer in the proceeding on the construction permit application (i) has 
made all the findings required by Secs. 51.104(b) and 51.105 of this 
chapter to be made prior to issuance of the construction permit for the 
facility, and (ii) has determined that, based upon the available 
information and review to date, there is reasonable assurance that the 
proposed site is a suitable location for a reactor of the general size 
and type proposed from the standpoint of radiological health and safety 
considerations under the Act and rules and regulations promulgated by 
the Commission pursuant thereto.
    (3)(i) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may authorize an 
applicant for a construction permit for a utilization facility which is 
subject to Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter, and is of the type specified 
in Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 or is a testing facility to 
conduct, in addition to the activities described in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section, the installation of structural foundations, including any 
necessary subsurface preparation, for structures, systems and components 
which prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents that 
could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public.
    (ii) Such an authorization, which may be combined with the 
authorization described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or may be 
granted at a later time, shall be granted only after the presiding 
officer in the proceeding on the construction permit application has, in 
addition to making the findings and determinations required by paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section, determined that there are no unresolved safety 
issues relating to the additional activities that may be authorized 
pursuant to this paragraph that would constitute good cause for 
withholding authorization.
    (4) Any activities undertaken pursuant to an authorization granted 
under this paragraph shall be entirely at the risk of the applicant and, 
except as to matters determined under paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3)(ii), 
the grant of the authorization shall have no bearing on the issuance of 
a construction permit with respect to the requirements of the Act, and 
rules, regulations, or orders promulgated pursuant thereto.

<R05>
Sec. 50.34   Contents of applications; technical information.

    (a) Preliminary safety analysis report. Each application for a 
construction permit shall include a preliminary safety analysis report. 
The minimum information <SUP>5 to be included shall consist of the 
following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>5 The applicant may provide information required by this 
paragraph in the form of a discussion, with specific references, of 
similarities to and differences from, facilities of similar design for 
which applications have previously been filed with the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Stationary power reactor applicants for a construction permit 
pursuant to this part, or a design certification or combined license 
pursuant to part 52 of this chapter who apply on or after January 10, 
1997, shall comply with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. All other 
applicants for a construction permit pursuant to this part or a design 
certification or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter, 
shall comply with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
    (i) A description and safety assessment of the site on which the 
facility is to be located, with appropriate attention to features 
affecting facility design. Special attention should be directed to the 
site evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this chapter. The 
assessment must contain an analysis and evaluation of the major 
structures, systems and components of the facility which bear 
significantly on the acceptability of the site under the site evaluation 
factors identified in part 100 of this chapter, assuming that the 
facility will be operated at the ultimate power level which is 
contemplated by the applicant. With respect to operation at the 
projected initial power level, the applicant is required to submit 
information prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(8) of this 
section, as well as the information required by this paragraph, in 
support of the application for a construction permit, or a design 
approval.
    (ii) A description and safety assessment of the site and a safety 
assessment of the facility. It is expected that reactors will reflect 
through their design, construction and operation an extremely low 
probability for accidents that could result in the release of 
significant quantities of radioactive fission products. The following 
power reactor design characteristics and proposed operation will be 
taken into consideration by the Commission:
    (A) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power 
level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials;
    (B) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are 
applied to the design of the reactor;
    (C) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual or 
enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the probability 
or consequences of accidental release of radioactive materials;
    (D) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility 
and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident 
before a release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 
Special attention must be directed to plant design features intended to 
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In

[[Page 642]]

performing this assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product 
release <SUP>6 from the core into the containment assuming that the 
facility is operated at the ultimate power level contemplated. The 
applicant shall perform an evaluation and analysis of the postulated 
fission product release, using the expected demonstrable containment 
leak rate and any fission product cleanup systems intended to mitigate 
the consequences of the accidents, together with applicable site 
characteristics, including site meteorology, to evaluate the offsite 
radiological consequences. Site characteristics must comply with part 
100 of this chapter. The evaluation must determine that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The fission product release assumed for this evaluation should 
be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site 
analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidental 
events. Such accidents have generally been assumed to result in 
substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the 
containment of appreciable quantities of fission products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the 
exclusion area for any 2 hour period following the onset of the 
postulated fission product release, would not receive a radiation dose 
in excess of 25 rem <SUP>7 total effective dose equivalent (TEDE).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ A whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond 
numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for 
radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations at the time 
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure 
status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, its use is not 
intended to imply that this number constitutes an acceptable limit for 
an emergency dose to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this 
dose value has been set forth in this section as a reference value, 
which can be used in the evaluation of plant design features with 
respect to postulated reactor accidents, in order to assure that such 
designs provide assurance of low risk of public exposure to radiation, 
in the event of such accidents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of the 
low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of 
its passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem 
total effective dose equivalent (TEDE);
    (E) With respect to operation at the projected initial power level, 
the applicant is required to submit information prescribed in paragraphs 
(a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, as well as the information 
required by this paragraph (a)(1)(i), in support of the application for 
a construction permit, or a design approval.
    (2) A summary description and discussion of the facility, with 
special attention to design and operating characteristics, unusual or 
novel design features, and principal safety considerations.
    (3) The preliminary design of the facility including:
    (i) The principal design criteria for the facility.<SUP>8 Appendix 
A, General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants, establishes minimum 
requirements for the principal design criteria for water-cooled nuclear 
power plants similar in design and location to plants for which 
construction permits have previously been issued by the Commission and 
provides guidance to applicants for construction permits in establishing 
principal design criteria for other types of nuclear power units;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>8 General design criteria for chemical processing facilities 
are being developed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The design bases and the relation of the design bases to the 
principal design criteria;
    (iii) Information relative to materials of construction, general 
arrangement, and approximate dimensions, sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance that the final design will conform to the design 
bases with adequate margin for safety.
    (4) A preliminary analysis and evaluation of the design and 
performance of structures, systems, and components of the facility with 
the objective of assessing the risk to public health and safety 
resulting from operation of the facility and including determination of 
(i) the margins of safety during normal operations and transient 
conditions anticipated during the life of the facility, and (ii) the 
adequacy of structures, systems, and components provided for the 
prevention of accidents and the mitigation of the consequences of 
accidents.

[[Page 643]]

Analysis and evaluation of ECCS cooling performance following postulated 
loss-of-coolant accidents shall be performed in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 50.46 of this part for facilities for which 
construction permits may be issued after December 28, 1974.
    (5) An identification and justification for the selection of those 
variables, conditions, or other items which are determined as the result 
of preliminary safety analysis and evaluation to be probable subjects of 
technical specifications for the facility, with special attention given 
to those items which may significantly influence the final design: 
Provided, however, That this requirement is not applicable to an

the manufacturing license, if issued, will be that number whose start of 
manufacture, as defined in the license application, can practically 
begin within a ten-year period commencing on the date of issuance of the 
manufacturing license, but in no event will that number be in excess of 
ten. The manufacturing license will require the plant design to be 
updated no later than five years after its approval. Paragraphs 
(f)(1)(xii), (2)(ix), and (3)(v) of this section, pertaining to hydrogen

[[Page 646]]

control measures, must be met by all applicants covered by this rule. 
However, the Commission may decide to impose additional requirements and 
the issue of whether compliance with these provisions, together with 10 
CFR 50.44 and Criterion 50 of appendix A to 10 CFR part 50, is 
sufficient for issuance of the manufacturing license may be considered 
in the manufacturing license proceeding.
    (1) To satisfy the following requirements, the application shall 
provide sufficient information to describe the nature of the studies, 
how they are to be conducted, estimated submittal dates, and a program 
to ensure that the results of such studies are factored into the final 
design of the facility. All studies shall be completed no later than two 
years following issuance of the construction permit or manufacturing 
license.<SUP>10

plant parameters and data trends on demand, and capable of indicating 
when process limits are being approached or exceeded. (I.D.2)
    (v) Provide for automatic indication of the bypassed and operable 
status of safety systems. (I.D.3)
    (vi) Provide the capability of high point venting of noncondensible 
gases from the reactor coolant system, and other systems that may be 
required to maintain adequate core cooling. Systems to achieve this 
capability shall be capable of being operated from the control room and 
their operation shall not lead to an unacceptable increase in the 
probability of loss-of-coolant accident or an unacceptable challenge to 
containment integrity. (II.B.1)
    (vii) Perform radiation and shielding design reviews of spaces 
around systems that may, as a result of an accident, contain TID 14844 
source term radioactive materials, and design as necessary to permit 
adequate access to important areas and to protect safety equipment from 
the radiation environment. (II.B.2)
    (viii) Provide a capability to promptly obtain and analyze samples 
from the reactor coolant system and containment that may contain TID-
14844 source term radioactive materials without radiation exposures to

quantified include certain radionuclides that are indicators of the 
degree of core damage (e.g., noble gases, iodines and cesiums, and 
nonvolatile isotopes), hydrogen in the containment atmosphere, dissolved 
gases, chloride, and boron concentrations. (II.B.3)
    (ix) Provide a system for hydrogen control that can safely 
accommodate hydrogen generated by the equivalent of a 100% fuel-clad 
metal water reaction. Preliminary design information on the tentatively 
preferred system option of those being evaluated in paragraph 
(f)(1)(xii) of this section is sufficient at the construction permit 
stage. The hydrogen control system and associated systems shall provide, 
with reasonable assurance, that: (II.B.8)
    (A) Uniformly distributed hydrogen concentrations in the containment 
do not exceed 10% during and following an accident that releases an

support hydrogen combustion.
    (B) Combustible concentrations of hydrogen will not collect in areas 
where unintended combustion or detonation could cause loss of 
containment integrity or loss of appropriate mitigating features.
    (C) Equipment necessary for achieving and maintaining safe shutdown 
of the plant and maintaining containment integrity will perform its 
safety function during and after being exposed to the environmental 
conditions attendant with the release of hydrogen generated by the 
equivalent of a 100% fuel-clad metal water reaction including the 
environmental conditions created by activation of the hydrogen control 
system.
    (D) If the method chosen for hydrogen control is a post-accident 
inerting system, inadvertent actuation of the system can be safely 
accommodated during plant operation.
    (x) Provide a test program and associated model development and 
conduct tests to qualify reactor coolant system relief and safety valves 
and, for PWR's, PORV block valves, for all fluid conditions expected 
under operating conditions, transients and accidents. Consideration of 
anticipated transients without scram (ATWS) conditions shall be included 
in the test program. Actual testing under ATWS conditions need not be 
carried out until subsequent phases of the test program are developed.

    (C) Do not result in reopening of the containment isolation valves 
on resetting of the isolation signal,
    (D) Utilize a containment set point pressure for initiating 
containment isolation as low as is compatible with normal operation,
    (E) Include automatic closing on a high radiation signal for all 
systems that provide a path to the environs.
    (xv) Provide a capability for containment purging/venting designed 
to minimize the purging time consistent with ALARA principles for 
occupational exposure. Provide and demonstrate high assurance that the 
purge system will reliably isolate under accident conditions. (II.E.4.4)

actuation cycles of the emergency core cooling system and reactor 
protection system consistent with the expected occurrence rates of 
severe overcooling events (considering both anticipated transients and 
accidents). (Applicable to B&W designs only). (II.E.5.1)

    (xvii) Provide instrumentation to measure, record and readout in the 
control room: (A) containment pressure, (B) containment water level, (C) 
containment hydrogen concentration, (D) containment radiation intensity 
(high level), and (E) noble gas effluents at all potential, accident 
release points. Provide for continuous sampling of radioactive iodines

    (xxvi) Provide for leakage control and detection in the design of 
systems outside containment that contain (or might contain) TID 14844 
source term radioactive materials following an accident. Applicants 
shall submit a leakage control program, including an initial test 
program, a schedule for re-testing these systems, and the actions to be 
taken for minimizing leakage from such systems. The goal is to minimize 
potential exposures to workers and public, and to provide reasonable 
assurance that excessive leakage will not prevent the use of systems 
needed in an emergency. (III.D.1.1)

conditions resulting in a TID 14844 source term release, and make 
necessary design provisions to preclude such problems. (III.D.3.4)
    (3) To satisfy the following requirements, the application shall 
provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the requirement has 
been met. This information is of the type customarily required to 
satisfy paragraph (a)(1) of this section or to address the applicant's 
technical qualifications and management structure and competence.

important to safety. (I.F.1)
    (iii) Establish a quality assurance (QA) program based on 
consideration of: (A) Ensuring independence of the organization 
performing checking functions from the organization responsible for 
performing the functions; (B) performing quality assurance/quality 
control functions at construction sites to the maximum feasible extent; 
(C) including QA personnel in the documented review of and concurrence 
in quality related procedures associated with design, construction and 
installation; (D) establishing criteria for determining QA programmatic 
requirements; (E) establishing qualification requirements for QA and QC 
personnel; (F) sizing the QA staff commensurate with its duties and 
responsibilities; (G) establishing procedures for maintenance of ``as-

    (iv) Provide one or more dedicated containment penetrations, 
equivalent in size to a single 3-foot diameter opening, in order not to 
preclude future installation of systems to prevent containment failure, 
such as a filtered vented containment system. (II.B.8)
    (v) Provide preliminary design information at a level of detail 
consistent with that normally required at the construction permit stage 
of review sufficient to demonstrate that: (II.B.8)
    (A)(1) Containment integrity will be maintained (i.e., for steel 
containments by meeting the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsubarticle NE-3220, Service 
Level C Limits, except that evaluation of instability is not required, 
considering pressure and dead load alone. For concrete containments by 
meeting the requirements of the ASME Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section III, Division 2 Subsubarticle CC-3720, Factored Load Category, 
considering pressure and dead load alone) during an accident that 
releases hydrogen generated from 100% fuel clad metal-water reaction 
accompanied by either hydrogen burning or the added pressure from post-
accident inerting assuming carbon dioxide is the inerting agent. As a 
minimum, the specific code requirements set forth above appropriate for 
each type of containment will be met for a combination of dead load and 
an internal pressure of 45 psig. Modest deviations from these criteria 
will be considered by the staff, if good cause is shown by an applicant. 
Systems necessary to ensure containment integrity shall also be 
demonstrated to perform their function under these conditions.
    (2) Subarticle NE-3220, Division 1, and subarticle CC-3720, Division 
2, of section III of the July 1, 1980 ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code, which are referenced in paragraphs (f)(3)(v)(A)(1) and 
(f)(3)(v)(B)(1) of this section, were approved for incorporation by 
reference by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register. A 
notice of any changes made to the material incorporated by reference 
will be published in the Federal Register. Copies of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code may be purchased from the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, United Engineering Center, 345 East 47th St., New 
York, NY 10017. It is also available for inspection at the NRC Library,

    (B)(1) Containment structure loadings produced by an inadvertent 
full actuation of a post-accident inerting hydrogen control system 
(assuming carbon dioxide), but not including seismic or design basis 
accident loadings will not produce stresses in steel containments in 
excess of the limits set forth in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsubarticle NE-3220, Service Level A 
Limits, except that evaluation of instability is not required (for 
concrete containments the loadings specified above will not produce 
strains in the containment liner in excess of the limits set forth in 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Division 2, 
Subsubarticle CC-3720, Service Load Category, (2) The containment has 
the capability to safely withstand pressure tests at 1.10 and 1.15 times 
(for steel and concrete containments, respectively) the pressure 
calculated to result from carbon dioxide inerting.

the nuclear steam supply vendor; (D) proposed procedures for handling 
the transition to operation; (E) the degree of top level management 
oversight and technical control to be exercised by the applicant during 
design and construction, including the preparation and implementation of 
procedures necessary to guide the effort. (II.J.3.1)
    (g) Conformance with the Standard Review Plan (SRP). (1)(i) 
Applications for light water cooled nuclear power plant operating 
licenses docketed after May 17, 1982 shall include an evaluation of the 
facility against the Standard Review Plan (SRP) in effect on May 17, 
1982 or the SRP revision in effect six months prior to the docket date 
of the application, whichever is later.
    (ii) Applications for light water cooled nuclear power plant 
construction permits, manufacturing licenses, and preliminary or final 
design approvals for standard plants docketed after May 17, 1982 shall 
include an evaluation of the facility against the SRP in effect on May 
17, 1982 or the SRP revision in effect six months prior to the docket 
date of the application, whichever is later.
    (2) The evaluation required by this section shall include an 
identification and description of all differences in design features, 
analytical techniques, and procedural measures proposed for a facility 
and those corresponding features, techniques, and measures given in the 
SRP acceptance criteria. Where such a difference exists, the evaluation 
shall discuss how the alternative proposed provides an acceptable method 
of complying with those rules or regulations of Commission, or portions 
thereof, that underlie the corresponding SRP acceptance criteria.
    (3) The SRP was issued to establish criteria that the NRC staff 
intends to use in evaluating whether an applicant/licensee meets the 
Commission's regulations. The SRP is not a substitute for the 
regulations, and compliance is not a requirement. Applicants shall 
identify differences from the SRP acceptance criteria and evaluate how 
the proposed alternatives to the SRP criteria provide an acceptable 
method of complying with the Commission's regulations.

Sec. 50.34a   Design objectives for equipment to control releases of radioactive material in effluents--nuclear power reactors.

    (a) An application for a permit to construct a nuclear power reactor 
shall include a description of the preliminary design of equipment to be 
installed to maintain control over radioactive materials in gaseous and 
liquid effluents produced during normal reactor operations, including 
expected operational occurrences. In the case of an application filed on 
or after January 2, 1971, the application shall also identify the design 
objectives, and the means to be employed, for keeping levels of 
radioactive material in effluents to unrestricted areas as low as is 
reasonably achievable. The term ``as low as is reasonably achievable'' 
as used in this part means as low as is reasonably achievable taking 
into account the state of technology, and the economics of improvements 
in relation to benefits to the public health and safety and other 
societal and socioeconomic considerations, and in relation to the 
utilization of atomic energy in the public interest. The guides set out 
in appendix I to this part provide numerical guidance on design 
objectives for light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors to meet the 
requirements that radioactive material in effluents released to 
unrestricted areas be kept as low as is reasonably achievable. These 
numerical guides for design objectives and limiting conditions for 
operation are not to be construed as radiation protection standards.
    (b) Each application for a permit to construct a nuclear power 
reactor shall include:
    (1) A description of the preliminary design of equipment to be 
installed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) An estimate of:
    (i) The quantity of each of the principal radio-nuclides expected to 
be released annually to unrestricted areas in liquid effluents produced 
during normal reactor operations; and
    (ii) The quantity of each of the principal radio-nuclides of the 
gases, halides, and particulates expected to be released annually to 
unrestricted areas in gaseous effluents produced during normal reactor 
operations.
    (3) A general description of the provisions for packaging, storage, 
and shipment offsite of solid waste containing radioactive materials 
resulting from treatment of gaseous and liquid effluents and from other 
sources.
    (c) Each application for a license to operate a nuclear power 
reactor shall include (1) a description of the equipment and procedures 
for the control of gaseous and liquid effluents and for the maintenance 
and use of equipment installed in radioactive waste systems, pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section; an (2) a revised estimate of the 
information required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if the expected 
releases and exposures differ significantly from the estimates submitted 
in the application for a construction permit.

Sec. 50.35  Issuance of construction permits.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Commission may issue a provisional construction permit 
pursuant to the regulations in this part in effect on March 30, 1970, 
for any facility for which a notice of hearing on an application for a 
provisional construction permit has been published on or before that 
date.

    (a) When an applicant has not supplied initially all of the 
technical information required to complete the application and support 
the issuance of a construction permit which approves all proposed design 
features, the Commission may issue a construction permit if the 
Commission finds that (1) the applicant has described the proposed 
design of the facility, including, but not limited to, the principal 
architectural and engineering criteria for the design, and has 
identified the major features or components incorporated therein for the 
protection of the health and safety of the public; (2) such further 
technical or design information as may be required to complete the 
safety analysis, and which can reasonably be left for later 
consideration, will be supplied in the final safety analysis report; (3) 
safety features or components, if any,

[[Page 653]]

which require research and development have been described by the 
applicant and the applicant has identified, and there will be conducted, 
a research and development program reasonably designed to resolve any 
safety questions associated with such features or components; and that 
(4) on the basis of the foregoing, there is reasonable assurance that, 
(i) such safety questions will be satisfactorily resolved at or before 
the latest date stated in the application for completion of construction 
of the proposed facility, and (ii) taking into consideration the site 
criteria contained in part 100 of this chapter, the proposed facility 
can be constructed and operated at the proposed location without undue 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
risk to the health and safety of the public.

    Note: When an applicant has supplied initially all of the technical 
information required to complete the application, including the final 
design of the facility, the findings required above will be 
appropriately modified to reflect that fact.

    (b) A construction permit will constitute an authorization to the 
applicant to proceed with construction but will not constitute 
Commission approval of the safety of any design feature or specification 
unless the applicant specifically requests such approval and such 
approval is incorporated in the permit. The applicant, at his option, 
may request such approvals in the construction permit or, from time to 
time, by amendment of his construction permit. The Commission may, in 
its discretion, incorporate in any construction permit provisions 
requiring the applicant to furnish periodic reports of the progress and 
results of research and development programs designed to resolve safety 
questions.
    (c) Any construction permit will be subject to the limitation that a 
license authorizing operation of the facility will not be issued by the 
Commission until (1) the applicant has submitted to the Commission, by 
amendment to the application, the complete final safety analysis report, 
portions of which may be submitted and evaluated from time to time, and 
(2) the Commission has found that the final design provides reasonable 
assurance that the health and safety of the public will not be 
endangered by operation of the facility in accordance with the 
requirements of the license and the regulations in this chapter.

Sec. 50.36   Technical specifications.

    (a) Each applicant for a license authorizing operation of a 
production or utilization facility shall include in his application 
proposed technical specifications in accordance with the requirements of 
this section. A summary statement of the bases or reasons for such 
specifications, other than those covering administrative controls, shall 
also be included in the application, but shall not become part of the 
technical specifications.
    (b) Each license authorizing operation of a production or 
utilization facility of a type described in Sec. 50.21 or Sec. 50.22 
will include technical specifications. The technical specifications will 
be derived from the analyses and evaluation included in the safety 
analysis report, and amendments thereto, submitted pursuant to 
Sec. 50.34. The Commission may include such additional technical 
specifications as the Commission finds appropriate.
    (c) Technical specifications will include items in the following 
categories:
    (1) Safety limits, limiting safety system settings, and limiting 
control settings. (i)(A) Safety limits for nuclear reactors are limits 
upon important process variables that are found to be necessary to 
reasonably protect the integrity of certain of the physical barriers 
that guard against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity. If any 
safety limit is exceeded, the reactor must be shut down. The licensee 
shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results 
of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for 
corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. Operation must not be 
resumed until authorized by the Commission. The licensee shall retain 
the record of the results of each review until the Commission terminates 
the license for the reactor, except for nuclear power reactors licensed 
under Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22 of this part. For these reactors, the 
licensee shall notify

[[Page 654]]

the Commission as required by Sec. 50.72 and submit a Licensee Event 
Report to the Commission as required by Sec. 50.73. Licensees in these 
cases shall retain the records of the review for a period of three years 
following issuance of a Licensee Event Report.
    (B) Safety limits for fuel reprocessing plants are those bounds 
within which the process variables must be maintained for adequate 
control of the operation and that must not be exceeded in order to 
protect the integrity of the physical system that is designed to guard 
against the uncontrolled release or radioactivity. If any safety limit 
for a fuel reprocessing plant is exceeded, corrective action must be 
taken as stated in the technical specification or the affected part of 
the process, or the entire process if required, must be shut down, 
unless this action would further reduce the margin of safety. The 
licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the 
results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the 
basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. If a portion 
of the process or the entire process has been shutdown, operation must 
not be resumed until authorized by the Commission. The licensee shall 
retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission 
terminates the license for the plant.
    (ii)(A) Limiting safety system settings for nuclear reactors are 
settings for automatic protective devices related to those variables 
having significant safety functions. Where a limiting safety system 
setting is specified for a variable on which a safety limit has been 
placed, the setting must be so chosen that automatic protective action 
will correct the abnormal situation before a safety limit is exceeded. 
If, during operation, it is determined that the automatic safety system 
does not function as required, the licensee shall take appropriate 
action, which may include shutting down the reactor. The licensee shall 
notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results of the 
review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for 
corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. The licensee shall 
retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission 
terminates the license for the reactor except for nuclear power reactors 
licensed under Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22 of this part. For these 
reactors, the licensee shall notify the Commission as required by 
Sec. 50.72 and submit a Licensee Event Report to the Commission as 
required by Sec. 50.73. Licensees in these cases shall retain the 
records of the review for a period of three years following issuance of 
a Licensee Event Report.
    (B) Limiting control settings for fuel reprocessing plants are 
settings for automatic alarm or protective devices related to those 
variables having significant safety functions. Where a limiting control 
setting is specified for a variable on which a safety limit has been 
placed, the setting must be so chosen that protective action, either 
automatic or manual, will correct the abnormal situation before a safety 
limit is exceeded. If, during operation, the automatic alarm or 
protective devices do not function as required, the licensee shall take 
appropriate action to maintain the variables within the limiting 
control-setting values and to repair promptly the automatic devices or 
to shut down the affected part of the process and, if required, to shut 
down the entire process for repair of automatic devices. The licensee 
shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and record the results 
of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for 
corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. The licensee shall 
retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission 
terminates the license for the plant.
    (2) Limiting conditions for operation. (i) Limiting conditions for 
operation are the lowest functional capability or performance levels of 
equipment required for safe operation of the facility. When a limiting 
condition for operation of a nuclear reactor is not met, the licensee 
shall shut down the reactor or follow any remedial action permitted by 
the technical specifications until the condition can be met. When a 
limiting condition for operation of any process step in the system of a 
fuel reprocessing plant is not met, the licensee shall shut down that 
part of the operation or follow any remedial action permitted by the 
technical specifications until

[[Page 655]]

the condition can be met. In the case of a nuclear reactor not licensed 
under Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22 of this part or fuel reprocessing 
plant, the licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter, and 
record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition 
and the basis for corrective action taken to preclude recurrence. The 
licensee shall retain the record of the results of each review until the 
Commission terminates the license for the nuclear reactor or the fuel 
reprocessing plant. In the case of nuclear power reactors licensed under 
Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22, the licensee shall notify the Commission if 
required by Sec. 50.72 and shall submit a Licensee Event Report to the 
Commission as required by Sec. 50.73. In this case, licensees shall 
retain records associated with preparation of a Licensee Event Report 
for a period of three years following issuance of the report. For events 
which do not require a Licensee Event Report, the licensee shall retain 
each record as required by the technical specifications.
    (ii) A technical specification limiting condition for operation of a 
nuclear reactor must be established for each item meeting one or more of 
the following criteria:
    (A) Criterion 1. Installed instrumentation that is used to detect, 
and indicate in the control room, a significant abnormal degradation of 
the reactor coolant pressure boundary.
    (B) Criterion 2. A process variable, design feature, or operating 
restriction that is an initial condition of a design basis accident or 
transient analysis that either assumes the failure of or presents a 
challenge to the integrity of a fission product barrier.
    (C) Criterion 3. A structure, system, or component that is part of 
the primary success path and which functions or actuates to mitigate a 
design basis accident or transient that either assumes the failure of or 
presents a challenge to the integrity of a fission product barrier.
    (D) Criterion 4. A structure, system, or component which operating 
experience or probabilistic risk assessment has shown to be significant 
to public health and safety.
    (iii) A licensee is not required to propose to modify technical 
specifications that are included in any license issued before August 18, 
1995, to satisfy the criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (3) Surveillance requirements. Surveillance requirements are 
requirements relating to test, calibration, or inspection to assure that 
the necessary quality of systems and components is maintained, that 
facility operation will be within safety limits, and that the limiting 
conditions for operation will be met.
    (4) Design features. Design features to be included are those 
features of the facility such as materials of construction and geometric 
arrangements, which, if altered or modified, would have a significant 
effect on safety and are not covered in categories described in 
paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.
    (5) Administrative controls. Administrative controls are the 
provisions relating to organization and management, procedures, 
recordkeeping, review and audit, and reporting necessary to assure 
operation of the facility in a safe manner. Each licensee shall submit 
any reports to the Commission pursuant to approved technical 
specifications as specified in Sec. 50.4.
    (6) Decommissioning. This paragraph applies only to nuclear power 
reactor facilities that have submitted the certifications required by 
Sec. 50.82(a)(1) and to non-power reactor facilities which are not 
authorized to operate. Technical specifications involving safety limits, 
limiting safety system settings, and limiting control system settings; 
limiting conditions for operation; surveillance requirements; design 
features; and administrative controls will be developed on a case-by-
case basis.
    (7) Initial notification. Reports made to the Commission by 
licensees in response to the requirements of this section must be made 
as follows:
    (i) Licensees that have an installed Emergency Notification System 
shall make the initial notification to the NRC Operations Center in 
accordance with Sec. 50.72 of this part.
    (ii) All other licensees shall make the initial notification by 
telephone to the Administrator of the appropriate NRC Regional Office 
listed in appendix D, part 20, of this chapter.

[[Page 656]]

    (8) Written Reports. Licensees for nuclear power reactors licensed 
under Sec. 50.21(b) and Sec. 50.22 of this part shall submit written 
reports to the Commission in accordance with Sec. 50.73 of this part for 
events described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. For 
all licensees, the Commission may require Special Reports as 
appropriate.
    (d)(1) This section shall not be deemed to modify the technical 
specifications included in any license issued prior to January 16, 1969. 
A license in which technical specifications have not been designated 
shall be deemed to include the entire safety analysis report as 
technical specifications.
    (2) An applicant for a license authorizing operation of a production 
or utilization facility to whom a construction permit has been issued 
prior to January 16, 1969, may submit technical specifications in 
accordance with this section, or in accordance with the requirements of 
this part in effect prior to January 16, 1969.
    (3) At the initiative of the Commission or the licensee, any license 
may be amended to include technical specifications of the scope and 
content which would be required if a new license were being issued.
    (e) The provisions of this section apply to each nuclear reactor 
licensee whose authority to operate the reactor has been removed by 
license amendment, order, or regulation.

Sec. 50.36a  Technical specifications on effluents from nuclear power reactors.

    (a) In order to keep releases of radioactive materials to 
unrestricted areas during normal conditions, including expected 
occurrences, as low as is reasonably achievable, each licensee of a 
nuclear power reactor will include technical specifications that, in 
addition to requiring compliance with applicable provisions of 
Sec. 20.1301 of this chapter, require that:
    (1) Operating procedures developed pursuant to Sec. 50.34a(c) for 
the control of effluents be established and followed and that the 
radioactive waste system, pursuant to Sec. 50.34a, be maintained and 
used. The licensee shall retain the operating procedures in effect as a 
record until the Commission terminates the license and shall retain each 
superseded revision of the procedures for 3 years from the date it was 
superseded.
    (2) Each licensee shall submit a report to the Commission annually 
that specifies the quantity of each of the principal radionuclides 
released to unrestricted areas in liquid and in gaseous effluents during 
the previous 12 months, including any other information as may be 
required by the Commission to estimate maximum potential annual 
radiation doses to the public resulting from effluent releases. The 
report must be submitted as specified in Sec. 50.4, and the time between 
submission of the reports must be no longer than 12 months. If 
quantities of radioactive materials released during the reporting period 
are significantly above design objectives, the report must cover this 
specifically. On the basis of these reports and any additional 
information the Commission may obtain from the licensee or others, the 
Commission may require the licensee to take action as the Commission 
deems appropriate.
    (b) In establishing and implementing the operating procedures 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the licensee shall be guided 
by the following considerations: Experience with the design, 
construction, and operation of nuclear power reactors indicates that 
compliance with the technical specifications described in this section 
will keep average annual releases of radioactive material in effluents 
and their resultant committed effective dose equivalents at small 
percentages of the dose limits specified in Sec. 20.1301 and in the 
license. At the same time, the licensee is permitted the flexibility of 
operation, compatible with considerations of health and safety, to 
assure that the public is provided a dependable source of power even 
under unusual conditions which may temporarily result in releases higher 
than such small percentages, but still within the limits specified in 
Sec. 20.1301 of this chapter and in the license. It is expected that in 
using this flexibility under unusual conditions, the licensee

[[Page 657]]

will exert its best efforts to keep levels of radioactive material in 
effluents as low as is reasonably achievable. The guides set out in 
appendix I, provide numerical guidance on limiting conditions for 
operation for light-water cooled nuclear power reactors to meet the 
requirement that radioactive materials in effluents released to 
unrestricted areas be kept as low as is reasonably achievable.

Sec. 50.36b  Environmental conditions.

    Each license authorizing operation of a production or utilization 
facility, and each license for a nuclear power reactor facility for 
which the certification of permanent cessation of operations required 
under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) has been submitted, which is of a type described 
in Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 or is a testing facility, may 
include conditions to protect the environment to be set out in an 
attachment to the license which is incorporated in and made a part of 
the license. These conditions will be derived from information contained 
in the environmental report and the supplement to the environmental 
report submitted pursuant to Secs. 51.50 and 51.53 of this chapter as 
analyzed and evaluated in the NRC record of decision, and will identify 
the obligations of the licensee in the environmental area, including, as 
appropriate, requirements for reporting and keeping records of 
environmental data, and any conditions and monitoring requirement for 
the protection of the nonaquatic environment.

Sec. 50.37   Agreement limiting access to Restricted Data.

    As part of his application and in any event prior to the receipt of 
Restricted Data or the issuance of a license or construction permit, the 
applicant shall agree in writing that he will not permit any individual 
to have access to Restricted Data until the Civil Service Commission 
shall have made an investigation and report to the Commission on the 
character, associations, and loyalty of such individual, and the 
Commission shall have determined that permitting such person to have 
access to Restricted Data will not endanger the common defense and 
security. The agreement of the applicant in this regard shall be deemed 
part of the license or construction permit, whether so stated therein or 
not.


<R05>
Sec. 50.38   Ineligibility of certain applicants.

    Any person who is a citizen, national, or agent of a foreign 
country, or any corporation, or other entity which the Commission knows 
or has reason to believe is owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, 
a foreign corporation, or a foreign government, shall be ineligible to 
apply for and obtain a license.

this chapter.

             Standards for Licenses and Construction Permits


<R05>
Sec. 50.40   Common standards.

    In determining that a license will be issued to an applicant, the 
Commission will be guided by the following considerations:
    (a) The processes to be performed, the operating procedures, the 
facility and equipment, the use of the facility, and other technical 
specifications, or the proposals, in regard to any of the foregoing 
collectively provide reasonable assurance that the applicant will comply 
with the regulations in this chapter, including the regulations in part 
20, and that the health and safety of the public will not be endangered.
    (b) The applicant is technically and financially qualified to engage 
in the proposed activities in accordance with the regulations in this 
chapter. However, no consideration of financial qualification is 
necessary for an electric utility applicant for an operating license for 
a utilization facility of the type described in Sec. 50.21(b) or 
Sec. 50.22.

[[Page 658]]

    (c) The issuance of a license to the applicant will not, in the 
opinion of the Commission, be inimical to the common defense and 
security or to the health and safety of the public.
    (d) Any applicable requirements of subpart A of part 51 have been 
satisfied.

<R05>
Sec. 50.41   Additional standards for class 104 licenses.

    In determining that a class 104 license will be issued to an 
applicant, the Commission will, in addition to applying the standards 
set forth in Sec. 50.40 be guided by the following considerations:
    (a) The Commission will permit the widest amount of effective 
medical therapy possible with the amount of special nuclear material 
available for such purposes.
    (b) The Commission will permit the conduct of widespread and diverse 
research and development.
    (c) An application for a class 104 operating license as to which a 
person who intervened or sought by timely written notice to the 
Commission to intervene in the construction permit proceeding for the 
facility to obtain a determination of antitrust considerations or to 
advance a jurisdictional basis for such determination has requested an 
antitrust review under section 105 of the Act within 25 days after the 
date of publication in the Federal Register of notice of filing of the 
application for an operating license or December 19, 1970, whichever is 
later, is also subject to the provisions of Sec. 50.42(b).

<R05>
Sec. 50.42   Additional standards for class 103 licenses.

    In determining whether a class 103 license will be issued to an 
applicant, the Commission will, in addition to applying the standards 
set forth in Sec. 50.40, be guided by the following considerations:
    (a) The proposed activities will serve a useful purpose 
proportionate to the quantities of special nuclear material or source 
material to be utilized.
    (b) Due account will be taken of the advice provided by the Attorney 
General, pursuant to subsection 105c of the Act, and to such evidence as 
may be provided during any proceedings in connection with the antitrust 
aspects of the application. For this purpose, the Commission will 
promptly transmit to the Attorney General a copy of the license 
application, and request such advice as the Attorney General determines 
to be appropriate in regard to the finding to be made by the Commission 
as to whether the proposed license would create or maintain a situation 
inconsistent with the antitrust laws, as specified in subsection 105a of 
the Act: Provided, That this requirement will not apply with respect to 
the types of class 103 licenses which the Commission, with the approval 
of the Attorney General, may determine would not significantly affect 
the applicant's activities under the antitrust laws: And provided 
further, That this requirement will not apply to an application for a 
license to operate a production or utilization facility for which a 
class 103 construction permit was issued unless the Commission, after 
consultation with the Attorney General, determines such review is 
advisable on the ground that significant changes in the licensee's 
activities or proposed activities have occurred subsequent to the 
previous review by the Attorney General and the Commission. Upon receipt 
of the Attorney General's advice, the Commission will cause such advice 
to be published in the Federal Register. After consideration of the 
antitrust aspects of the application, the Commission, if it finds that 
the license to be issued or continued, would create or maintain a 
situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws as specified in 
subsection 105a of the Act, will consider, in determining whether a 
license should be issued or continued, such other factors as the 
Commission in its judgment deems necessary to protect the public 
interest, including the need for power in the affected area.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As permitted by subsection 105c(8) of the Act, with respect to 
proceedings in which an application for a construction permit was filed 
prior to Dec. 19, 1970, and proceedings in which a written request for 
antitrust review of an application for an operating license to be issued 
under section 104b has been made by a person who intervened or sought by 
timely written notice to the Atomic Energy Commission to intervene in 
the construction permit proceeding for the facility to obtain a 
determination of antitrust considerations or to advance a jurisdictional 
basis for such determination within 25 days after the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of notice of filing of the 
application for an operating license or Dec. 19, 1970, whichever is 
later, the Commission may issue a construction permit or operating 
license in advance of consideration of, and findings with respect to the 
antitrust aspects of the application, provided that the permit or 
license so issued contains the condition specified in Sec. 50.55b.

Sec. 50.43   Additional standards and provisions affecting class 103 licenses for commercial power.

    In addition to applying the standards set forth in Secs. 50.40 and 
50.42, in the case of a class 103 license for a facility for the 
generation of commercial power:
    (a) The Commission will give notice in writing of each application 
to such regulatory agency as may have jurisdiction over the rates and 
services incident to the proposed activity; will publish notice of the 
application in such trade or news publications as it deems appropriate 
to give reasonable notice to municipalities, private utilities, public 
bodies, and cooperatives which might have a potential interest in such 
utilization or production facility; and will publish notice of the 
application once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in the Federal 
Register. No license will be issued by the Commission prior to the 
giving of such notices and until 4 weeks after the last publication in 
the Federal Register.
    (b) If there are conflicting applications for a limited opportunity 
for such license, the Commission will give preferred consideration in 
the following order: First, to applications submitted by public or 
cooperative bodies for facilities to be located in high cost power areas 
in the United States; second, to applications submitted by others for 
facilities to be located in such areas; third, to applications submitted 
by public or cooperative bodies for facilities to be located in other 
than high cost power areas; and, fourth, to all other applicants.
    (c) The licensee who transmits electric energy in interstate 
commerce, or sells it at wholesale in interstate commerce, shall be 
subject to the regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act.
    (d) Nothing herein shall preclude any government agency, now or 
hereafter authorized by law to engage in the production, marketing, or 
distribution of electric energy, if otherwise qualified, from obtaining 
a license for the construction and operation of a utilization facility 
for the primary purpose of producing electric energy for disposition for 
ultimate public consumption.

Sec. 50.44  Standards for combustible gas control system in light-water-cooled power reactors.

    (a) Each boiling or pressurized light-water nuclear power reactor 
fueled with oxide pellets within cylindrical zircaloy or ZIRLO cladding, 
must, as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, include 
means for control of hydrogen gas that may be generated, following a 
postulated loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) by--
    (1) Metal-water reaction involving the fuel cladding and the reactor 
coolant,
    (2) Radiolytic decomposition of the reactor coolant, and
    (3) Corrosion of metals.

This section does not apply to a nuclear power reactor facility for 
which the certifications required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been 
submitted.
    (b) Each boiling or pressurized light-water nuclear power reactor 
fueled with oxide pellets within cylindrical zircaloy or ZIRLO cladding 
must be provided with the capability for--
    (1) Measuring the hydrogen concentration in the containment,
    (2) Insuring a mixed atmosphere in the containment, and
    (3) Controlling combustible gas concentrations in the containment 
following a postulated LOCA.
    (c)(1) For each boiling or pressurized light-water nuclear power 
reactor

[[Page 660]]

fueled with oxide pellets within cylindrical zircaloy or ZIRLO cladding, 
it must be shown that during the time period following a postulated 
LOCA, but prior to effective operation of the combustible gas control 
system, either:
    (i) An uncontrolled hydrogen-oxygen recombination would not take 
place in the containment; or
    (ii) The plant could withstand the consequences of uncontrolled 
hydrogen-oxygen recombination without loss of safety function.
    (2) If the conditions set out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
cannot be shown, the containment shall be provided with an inerted or an 
oxygen deficient atmosphere in order to provide protection against 
hydrogen burning and explosions during the time period specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section:
    (i) Effective May 4, 1982 or 6 months after initial criticality, 
whichever is later, an inerted atmosphere shall be provided for each 
boiling light-water nuclear power reactor with a Mark I or Mark II type 
containment; and
    (ii) By the end of the first scheduled outage beginning after July 
5, 1982 and of sufficient duration to permit required modifications, 
each light-water nuclear power reactor that relies upon a purge/
repressurization system as the primary means for controlling combustible 
gases following a LOCA shall be provided with either an internal 
recombiner or the capability to install an external recombiner following 
the start of an accident. The internal or external recombiners must meet 
the combustible gas control requirements in paragraph (d) of this 
section. The containment penetrations used for external recombiners must 
either be:
    (A) Dedicated to that service only, conform to the requirements of 
Criteria 54 and 56 of appendix A of this part, be designed against 
postulated single failures for containment isolation purposes, and be 
sized to satisfy the flow requirements of the external recombiners, or
    (B) Of a combined design for use by either external recombiners or 
purge/repressurization systems and other systems, conform to the 
requirements of criteria 54 and 56 of appendix A of this part, be 
designed against postulated single failures both for containment 
isolation purposes and for operation of the external recombiners or 
purge/repressurization systems, and be sized to satisfy the flow 
requirements of the external recombiners or purge repressurization 
systems.
    (iii) To provide improved operational capability to maintain 
adequate core cooling following an accident, by the end of the first 
scheduled outage beginning after July 1, 1982 and of sufficient duration 
to permit required modifications, each light-water nuclear power reactor 
shall be provided with high point vents for the reactor coolant system, 
for the reactor vessel head, and for other systems required to maintain 
adequate core cooling if the accumulation of noncondensible gases would 
cause the loss of function of these systems. (High point vents are not 
required, however, for the tubes in U-tube steam generators.) The high 
point vents must be remotely operated from the control room. Since these 
vents form a part of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, the design 
of the vents and associated controls, instruments and power sources must 
conform to the requirements of appendix A and appendix B of this part. 
In particular, the vent system shall be designed to ensure a low 
probability that (A) the vents will not perform their safety functions 
and (B) there would be inadvertent or irreversible actuation of a vent. 
Furthermore, the use of these vents during and following an accident 
must not aggravate the challenge to the containment or the course of the 
accident.
    (iv) (A) Each licensee with a boiling light-water nuclear power 
reactor with a Mark III type of containment and each licensee with a 
pressurized light-water nuclear power reactor with an ice condenser type 
of containment issued a construction permit before March 28, 1979, shall 
provide its nuclear power reactor with a hydrogen control system 
justified by a suitable program of experiment and analysis. The hydrogen 
control system must be capable of handling without loss of containment 
structural integrity an amount of hydrogen equivalent to that generated 
from a metal-water reaction involving

[[Page 661]]

75% of the fuel cladding surrounding the active fuel region (excluding 
the cladding surrounding the plenum volume).
    (B) Containment structural integrity must be demonstrated by use of 
an analytical technique that is accepted by the NRC staff. This 
demonstration must include sufficient supporting justification to show 
that the technique describes the containment response to the structural 
loads involved. This method could include the use of actual material 
properties with suitable margins to account for uncertainties in 
modeling, in material properties, in construction tolerances, and so on. 
Another method could include a showing that the following specific 
criteria of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code are met:
    (1) That steel containments meet the requirements of the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code (Edition and Addenda as incorporated by 
reference in Sec. 50.55a(b)(1) of this part), specifically in Section 
III, Division 1, Subsubarticle NE-3220, Service Level C Limits, 
considering pressure and dead load alone (evaluation of instability is 
not required); and
    (2) That concrete containments meet the requirements of the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure vessel Code, Section III, Division 2, Subsubarticle 
CC-3720, Factored Load Category, considering pressure and dead load 
alone.
    (C) Subsubarticle NE-3220, Divisin 1, and Subsubarticle CC-3720, 
Division 2, of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
referenced in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv)(B)(1) and (c)(3)(iv)(B)(2) of this 
section, have been approved for incorporation by reference by the 
Director of the Office of the Federal Register. A notice of any changes 
made to the material incorporated by reference will be published in the 
Federal Register. Copies of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code may 
be purchased from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, United 
Engineering Center, 345 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. It is 
also available for inspection at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.
    (D) If the hydrogen control system relies on post-accident inerting, 
the containment structure must be capable of withstanding the increased 
pressure:
    (1) During the accident, where it is acceptable to show that it does 
not exceed Service Level C Limits or the Factored load Category (as 
described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section; and
    (2) Following inadvertent full inerting during normal plant 
operations, where it is acceptable to show that it does not exceed 
either the Service Level A Limits of Subsubarticle NE-3220 (for a steel 
containment) or the Service Load Category of Subsubarticle CC-3720 (for 
a concrete containment.)
    (3) Modest deviations from the criteria in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(D) 
of this section will be considered by the Commission if good cause is 
shown.
    (E) If the hydrogen control system relies on post-accident inerting, 
the systems and components required to establish and maintain safe 
shutdown and containment integrity must be designed and qualified for 
the environment caused by such inerting. Furthermore, inadvertent full 
inerting during normal plant operations must not adversely affect 
systems and components needed for safe operation of the plant.
    (v) (A) Each licensee with a boiling light-water nuclear power 
reactor with a Mark III type of containment and each licensee with a 
pressurized light-water nuclear power reactor with an ice condenser type 
of containment issued a construction permit before March 28, 1979, for a 
reactor that does not rely upon an inerted atmosphere to control 
hydrogen inside the containment, shall provide its nuclear power reactor 
with systems and components necessary to establish and maintain safe 
shutdown and to maintain containment integrity. These systems and 
components must be capable of performing their functions during and 
after exposure to the environmental conditions created by the burning of 
hydrogen. Environmental conditions caused by local detonations of 
hydrogen must also be included, unless such detonations can be shown 
unlikely to occur.

[[Page 662]]

    (B) The amount of hydrogen to be considered is equivalent to that 
generated from a metal-water reaction involving 75% of the fuel cladding 
surrounding the active fuel region (excluding the cladding surrounding 
the plenum volume).
    (vi)(A) Each applicant for or holder of an operating license for a 
boiling light-water nuclear power reactor with a Mark III type of 
containment or for a pressurized light-water nuclear power reactor with 
an ice condenser type of containment issued a construction permit before 
March 28, 1979, shall submit an analysis to the Commission as specified 
in Sec. 50.4.
    (B) The analysis required by paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(A) of this section 
must:
    (1) Provide an evaluation of the consequences of large amounts of 
hydrogen generated after the start of an accident (hydrogen resulting 
from the metal-water reaction of up to and including 75% of the fuel 
cladding surrounding the active fuel region, excluding the cladding 
surrounding the plenum volume) and include consideration of hydrogen 
control measures as appropriate;
    (2) Include the period of recovery from the degraded condition;
    (3) Use accident scenarios that are accepted by the NRC staff. These 
scenarios must be accompanied by sufficient supporting justification to 
show that they describe the behavior of the reactor system during and 
following an accident resulting in a degraded core.
    (4) Support the design of the hydrogen control system selected under 
paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section; and,
    (5) Show that for those reactors described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) 
of this section that do not rely upon an inerted atmosphere to control 
hydrogen inside the containment:
    (i) The containment structural integrity as described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(iv) of this section will be maintained; and
    (ii) Systems and components necessary to establish and maintain safe 
shutdown and to maintain containment integrity will be capable of 
performing their functions during and after exposure to the 
environmental conditions created by the burning of hydrogen, including 
the effect of local detonations, unless such detonations can be shown 
unlikely to occur.
    (vii)(A) By June 25, 1985, each applicant for or holder of an 
operating license subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) (iv), 
(v) and (vi) of this section shall develop and submit to the Commission 
a proposed schedule for meeting these requirements. The schedule may be 
developed using integrated scheduling systems previously approved for 
the facility by the NRC.
    (B) For each applicant for an operating license as of Febuary 25, 
1985, the schedule shall provide for compliance with the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A) of this section prior to operation of the 
reactor in excess of 5 percent power. Completed final analyses are not 
necessary for a staff determination that a plant is safe to operate at 
full power provided that prior to such operation an applicant has 
provided a preliminary analysis which the staff has determined provides 
a satisfactory basis for a decision to support interim operation at full 
power until the final analysis has been completed. However, the record 
in this rulemaking shows that such preliminary analyses are not 
necessary for a staff determination that a plant is safe to operate at 
full power if the staff has determined for similar plants, referenced in 
this notice of rulemaking, that similar systems provide a satisfactory 
basis for a decision to support operation at full power until the 
preliminary analyses have been completed.
    (C) For those holders of operating licenses containing license 
conditions on Hydrogen Control Measures covered by this section, the 
schedule shall be consistent with those license conditions, or approved 
amendments thereto.
    (D) For those facilities not having an NRC approved integrated 
scheduling system, a final schedule for meeting the requirements of 
paragraphs (c)(3) (iv), (v) and (vi) of this section shall be 
established by the NRC staff within 90 days of receipt of a proposed 
schedule from the licensee or applicant, taking into account the current 
status of efforts at the facility to comply with the requirements; 
analyses that may be

[[Page 663]]

provided by applicants or licensees regarding the impacts of these 
requirements on other scheduled plant modifications, including any NRC-
mandated safety modifications, and their relative importance to safety; 
and the Commission's objective that these requirements be complied with 
without undue delay.
    (d)(1) For facilities that are in compliance with Sec. 50.46(b), the 
amount of hydrogen contributed by core metal-water reaction (percentage 
of fuel cladding that reacts with water), as a result of degradation, 
but not total failure, of emergency core cooling functioning shall be 
assumed either to be five times the total amount of hydrogen calculated 
in demonstrating compliance with Sec. 50.46(b)(3), or to be the amount 
that would result from reaction of all the metal in the outside surfaces 
of the cladding cylinders surrounding the fuel (excluding the cladding 
surrounding the plenum volume) to a depth of 0.00023 inch (0.0058 mm), 
whichever amount is greater. A time period of 2 minutes shall be used as 
the interval after the postulated LOCA over which the metal-water 
reaction occurs.
    (2) For facilities as to which no evaluation of compliance in 
accordance with Sec. 50.46(b) has been submitted and evaluated, the 
amounts of hydrogen so contributed shall be assumed to be that amount 
resulting from the reaction of 5 percent of the mass of metal in the 
cladding cylinders surrounding the fuel, excluding the cladding 
surrounding the plenum volume.
    (e) For facilities whose notice of hearing on the application for a 
construction permit was published on or after November 5, 1970, purging 
and/or repressurization shall not be the primary means for controlling 
combustible gases following a LOCA. However, the capability for 
controlled purging shall be provided. For these facilities, the primary 
means for controlling combustible gases following a LOCA shall consist 
of a combustible gas control system, such as recombiners, that does not 
result in a significant release from containment.
    (f) For facilities with respect to which the notice of hearing on 
the application for a construction permit was published between December 
22, 1968, and November 5, 1970, if the incremental radiation dose from 
purging (and repressurization if a repressurization system is provided) 
occurring at all points beyond the exclusion area boundary after a 
postulated LOCA calculated in accordance with Sec. 100.11(a)(2) of this 
chapter is less than 2.5 rem to the whole body and less than 30 rem to 
the thyroid, and if the combined radiation dose at the low population 
zone outer boundary from purging and the postulated LOCA calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 100.11(a)(2) of this chapter is less than 25 rem to 
the whole body and less than 300 rem to the thyroid, only a purging 
system is necessary, provided that the purging system and any filtration 
system associated with it are designed to conform with the general 
requirements of Criteria 41, 42, and 43 of appendix A to this part. 
Otherwise the facility shall be provided with another type of 
combustible gas control system (a repressurization system is acceptable) 
designed to conform with the general requirements of Criteria 41, 42, 
and 43 of appendix A to this part. If a purge system is used as part of 
the repressurization system, the purge system shall be designed to 
conform with the general requirements of Criteria 41, 42, and 43 of 
appendix A to this part. The containment shall not be repressurized 
beyond 50 percent of the containment design pressure.
    (g) For facilities with respect to which the notice of hearing on 
the application for a construction permit was published on or before 
December 22, 1968, if the combined radiation dose at the low population 
zone outer boundary from purging (and repressurization if a 
repressurization system is provided) and the postulated LOCA calculated 
in accordance with Sec. 100.11(a)(2) of this chapter is less than 25 rem 
to the whole body and less than 300 rem to the thyroid, only a purging 
system is necessary, provided that the purging system and any filtration 
system associated with it are designed to conform with the general 
requirements of Criteria 41, 42, and 43 of appendix A to this part. 
Otherwise, the facility shall be provided with another type of 
combustible gas control system (a repressurization system is acceptable)

[[Page 664]]

designed to conform with the general requirements of Criteria 41, 42, 
and 43 of appendix A to this part. If a purge system is used as part of 
the repressurization system, it shall be designed to conform with the 
general requirements of Criteria 41, 42, and 43 of appendix A to this 
part. The containment shall not be repressurized beyond 50 percent of 
the containment design pressure.
    (h) As used in this section: (1) Degradation, but not total failure, 
of emergency core cooling functioning means that the performance of the 
emergency core cooling system is postulated, for purposes of design of 
the combustible gas control system, not to meet the acceptance criteria 
in Sec. 50.46 and that there could be localized clad melting and metal-
water reaction to the extent postulated in paragraph (d) of this 
section. The degree of performance degradation is not postulated to be 
sufficient to cause core meltdown.
    (2) A combustible gas control system is a system that operates after 
a LOCA to maintain the concentrations of combustible gases within the 
containment, such as hydrogen, below flammability limits. Combustible 
gas control systems are of two types: (i) Systems that allow controlled 
release from containment, through filters if necessary, such as purging 
systems and repressurization systems, and (ii) systems that do not 
result in a significant release from containment such as recombiners.
    (3) A purging system is a system for the controlled release of the 
containment atmosphere to the environment through filters if needed.
    (4) A repressurization system is a system used to dilute the 
concentration of combustible gas within containment by adding inert gas 
or air to the containment. Dilution of the combustible gas results in a 
delay in time until a flammable concentration is reached and permits 
fission product decay. Operation is limited to a containment 
repressurization to 50 percent of the containment design pressure. A 
purging system is normally part of the repressurization system.

Sec. 50.45  Standards for construction permits.

    An applicant for a license or an amendment of a license who proposes 
to construct or alter a production or utilization facility will be 
initially granted a construction permit, if the application is in 
conformity with and acceptable under the criteria of Secs. 50.31 through 
50.38 and the standards of Secs. 50.40 through 50.43.


<R05>
Sec. 50.46   Acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling systems for light-water nuclear power reactors.

    (a)(1)(i) Each boiling or pressurized light-water nuclear power 
reactor fueled with uranium oxide pellets within cylindrical zircaloy or 
ZIRLO cladding must be provided with an emergency core cooling system 
(ECCS) that must be designed so that its calculated cooling performance 
following postulated loss-of-coolant accidents conforms to the criteria 
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. ECCS cooling performance 
must be calculated in accordance with an acceptable evaluation model and 
must be calculated for a number of postulated loss-of-coolant accidents 
of different sizes, locations, and other properties sufficient to 
provide assurance that the most severe postulated loss-of-coolant 
accidents are calculated. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the evaluation model must include sufficient supporting 
justification to show that the analytical technique realistically 
describes the behavior of the reactor system during a loss-of-coolant 
accident. Comparisons to applicable experimental data must be made and 
uncertainties in the analysis method and inputs must be identified and 
assessed so that the uncertainty in the calculated results can be 
estimated. This uncertainty must be accounted for, so

[[Page 665]]

that, when the calculated ECCS cooling performance is compared to the 
criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, there is a high 
level of probability that the criteria would not be exceeded. Appendix 
K, Part II Required Documentation, sets forth the documentation 
requirements for each evaluation model. This section does not apply to a 
nuclear power reactor facility for which the certifications required 
under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted.
    (ii) Alternatively, an ECCS evaluation model may be developed in 
conformance with the required and acceptable features of appendix K ECCS 
Evaluation Models.
    (2) The Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulations may impose 
restrictions on reactor operation if it is found that the evaluations of 
ECCS cooling performance submitted are not consistent with paragraphs 
(a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (3)(i) Each applicant for or holder of an operating license or 
construction permit shall estimate the effect of any change to or error 
in an acceptable evaluation model or in the application of such a model 
to determine if the change or error is significant. For this purpose, a 
significant change or error is one which results in a calculated peak 
fuel cladding temperature different by more than 50 deg.F from the 
temperature calculated for the limiting transient using the last 
acceptable model, or is a cumulation of changes and errors such that the 
sum of the absolute magnitudes of the respective temperature changes is 
greater than 50 deg.F.
    (ii) For each change to or error discovered in an acceptable 
evaluation model or in the application of such a model that affects the 
temperature calculation, the applicant or licensee shall report the 
nature of the change or error and its estimated effect on the limiting 
ECCS analysis to the Commission at least annually as specified in 
Sec. 50.4. If the change or error is signficant, the applicant or 
licensee shall provide this report within 30 days and include with the 
report a proposed schedule for providing a reanalysis or taking other 
action as may be needed to show compliance with Sec. 50.46 requirements. 
This schedule may be developed using an integrated scheduling system 
previously approved for the facility by the NRC. For those facilities 
not using an NRC approved integrated scheduling system, a schedule will 
be established by the NRC staff within 60 days of receipt of the 
proposed schedule. Any change or error correction that results in a 
calculated ECCS performance that does not conform to the criteria set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section is a reportable event as 
described in Secs. 50.55(e), 50.72 and 50.73. The affected applicant or 
licensee shall propose immediate steps to demonstrate compliance or 
bring plant design or operation into compliance with Sec. 50.46 
requirements.
    (b)(1) Peak cladding temperature. The calculated maximum fuel 
element cladding temperature shall not exceed 2200 deg. F.
    (2) Maximum cladding oxidation. The calculated total oxidation of 
the cladding shall nowhere exceed 0.17 times the total cladding 
thickness before oxidation. As used in this subparagraph total oxidation 
means the total thickness of cladding metal that would be locally 
converted to oxide if all the oxygen absorbed by and reacted with the 
cladding locally were converted to stoichiometric zirconium dioxide. If 
cladding rupture is calculated to occur, the inside surfaces of the 
cladding shall be included in the oxidation, beginning at the calculated 
time of rupture. Cladding thickness before oxidation means the radial 
distance from inside to outside the cladding, after any calculated 
rupture or swelling has occurred but before significant oxidation. Where 
the calculated conditions of transient pressure and temperature lead to 
a prediction of cladding swelling, with or without cladding rupture, the 
unoxidized cladding thickness shall be defined as the cladding cross-
sectional area, taken at a horizontal plane at the elevation of the 
rupture, if it occurs, or at the elevation of the highest cladding 
temperature if no rupture is calculated to occur, divided by the average 
circumference at that elevation. For ruptured cladding the circumference 
does not include the rupture opening.
    (3) Maximum hydrogen generation. The calculated total amount of 
hydrogen

[[Page 666]]

generated from the chemical reaction of the cladding with water or steam 
shall not exceed 0.01 times the hypothetical amount that would be 
generated if all of the metal in the cladding cylinders surrounding the 
fuel, excluding the cladding surrounding the plenum volume, were to 
react.
    (4) Coolable geometry. Calculated changes in core geometry shall be 
such that the core remains amenable to cooling.
    (5) Long-term cooling. After any calculated successful initial 
operation of the ECCS, the calculated core temperature shall be 
maintained at an acceptably low value and decay heat shall be removed 
for the extended period of time required by the long-lived radioactivity 
remaining in the core.
    (c) As used in this section: (1) Loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCA's) 
are hypothetical accidents that would result from the loss of reactor 
coolant, at a rate in excess of the capability of the reactor coolant 
makeup system, from breaks in pipes in the reactor coolant pressure 
boundary up to and including a break equivalent in size to the double-
ended rupture of the largest pipe in the reactor coolant system.
    (2) An evaluation model is the calculational framework for 
evaluating the behavior of the reactor system during a postulated loss-
of-coolant accident (LOCA). It includes one or more computer programs 
and all other information necessary for application of the calculational 
framework to a specific LOCA, such as mathematical models used, 
assumptions included in the programs, procedure for treating the program 
input and output information, specification of those portions of 
analysis not included in computer programs, values of parameters, and 
all other information necessary to specify the calculational procedure.
    (d) The requirements of this section are in addition to any other 
requirements applicable to ECCS set forth in this part. The criteria set 
forth in paragraph (b), with cooling performance calculated in 
accordance with an acceptable evaluation model, are in implementation of 
the general requirements with respect to ECCS cooling performance design 
set forth in this part, including in particular Criterion 35 of appendix 
A.

Sec. 50.47  Emergency plans.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no 
initial operating license for a nuclear power reactor will be issued 
unless a finding is made by the NRC that there is reasonable assurance 
that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of 
a radiological emergency. No finding under this section is necessary for 
issuance of a renewed nuclear power reactor operating license.
    (2) The NRC will base its finding on a review of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) findings and determinations as to 
whether State and local emergency plans are adequate and whether there 
is reasonable assurance that they can be implemented, and on the NRC 
assessment as to whether the applicant's onsite emergency plans are 
adequate and whether there is reasonable assurance that they can be 
implemented. A FEMA finding will primarily be based on a review of the 
plans. Any other information already available to FEMA may be considered 
in assessing whether there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be 
implemented. In any NRC licensing proceeding, a FEMA finding will 
constitute a rebuttable presumption on questions of adequacy and 
implementation capability.
    (b) The onsite and, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, offsite emergency response plans for nuclear power reactors 
must meet the following standards:
    (1) Primary responsibilities for emergency response by the nuclear 
facility licensee and by State and local organizations within the 
Emergency Planning Zones have been assigned, the emergency 
responsibilities of the various supporting organizations have been 
specifically established, and each principal response organization has 
staff to respond and to augment its initial response on a continuous 
basis.
    (2) On-shift facility licensee responsibilities for emergency 
response are

[[Page 667]]

unambiguously defined, adequate staffing to provide initial facility 
accident response in key functional areas is maintained at all times, 
timely augmentation of response capabilities is available and the 
interfaces among various onsite response activities and offsite support 
and response activities are specified.
    (3) Arrangements for requesting and effectively using assistance 
resources have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and local 
staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility have 
been made, and other organizations capable of augmenting the planned 
response have been identified.
    (4) A standard emergency classification and action level scheme, the 
bases of which include facility system and effluent parameters, is in 
use by the nuclear facility licensee, and State and local response plans 
call for reliance on information provided by facility licensees for 
determinations of minimum initial offsite response measures.
    (5) Procedures have been established for notification, by the 
licensee, of State and local response organizations and for notification 
of emergency personnel by all organizations; the content of initial and 
followup messages to response organizations and the public has been 
established; and means to provide early notification and clear 
instruction to the populace within the plume exposure pathway Emergency 
Planning Zone have been established.
    (6) Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal 
response organizations to emergency personnel and to the public.
    (7) Information is made available to the public on a periodic basis 
on how they will be notified and what their initial actions should be in 
an emergency (e.g., listening to a local broadcast station and remaining 
indoors), the principal points of contact with the news media for 
dissemination of information during an emergency (including the physical 
location or locations) are established in advance, and procedures for 
coordinated dissemination of information to the public are established.
    (8) Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the 
emergency response are provided and maintained.
    (9) Adequate methods, systems, and equipment for assessing and 
monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological 
emergency condition are in use.
    (10) A range of protective actions have been developed for the plume 
exposure pathway EPZ for emergency workers and the public. Guidelines 
for the choice of protective actions during an emergency, consistent 
with Federal guidance, are developed and in place, and protective 
actions for the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ appropriate to the locale 
have been developed.
    (11) Means for controlling radiological exposures, in an emergency, 
are established for emergency workers. The means for controlling 
radiological exposures shall include exposure guidelines consistent with 
EPA Emergency Worker and Lifesaving Activity Protective Action Guides.
    (12) Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated 
injured individuals.
    (13) General plans for recovery and reentry are developed.
    (14) Periodic exercises are (will be) conducted to evaluate major 
portions of emergency response capabilities, periodic drills are (will 
be) conducted to develop and maintain key skills, and deficiencies 
identified as a result of exercises or drills are (will be) corrected.
    (15) Radiological emergency response training is provided to those 
who may be called on to assist in an emergency.
    (16) Responsibilities for plan development and review and for 
distribution of emergency plans are established, and planners are 
properly trained.
    (c)(1) Failure to meet the applicable standards set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section may result in the Commission declining to 
issue an operating license; however, the applicant will have an 
opportunity to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that 
deficiencies in the plans are not significant for the plant in question, 
that adequate interim compensating actions have been or will be taken 
promptly, or that there are other compelling reasons to permit plant 
operations. Where an applicant for an operating license asserts that its 
inability to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section

[[Page 668]]

results wholly or substantially from the decision of state and/or local 
governments not to participate further in emergency planning, an 
operating license may be issued if the applicant demonstrates to the 
Commission's satisfaction that:
    (i) The applicant's inability to comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section is wholly or substantially the result of 
the non-participation of state and/or local governments.
    (ii) The applicant has made a sustained, good faith effort to secure 
and retain the participation of the pertinent state and/or local 
governmental authorities, including the furnishing of copies of its 
emergency plan.
    (iii) The applicant's emergency plan provides reasonable assurance 
that public health and safety is not endangered by operation of the 
facility concerned. To make that finding, the applicant must demonstrate 
that, as outlined below, adequate protective measures can and will be 
taken in the event of an emergency. A utility plan will be evaluated 
against the same planning standards applicable to a state or local plan, 
as listed in paragraph (b) of this section, with due allowance made both 
for--
    (A) Those elements for which state and/or local non-participation 
makes compliance infeasible and
    (B) The utility's measures designed to compensate for any 
deficiencies resulting from state and/or local non-participation.

In making its determination on the adequacy of a utility plan, the NRC 
will recognize the reality that in an actual emergency, state and local 
government officials will exercise their best efforts to protect the 
health and safety of the public. The NRC will determine the adequacy of 
that expected response, in combination with the utility's compensating 
measures, on a case-by-case basis, subject to the following guidance. In 
addressing the circumstance where applicant's inability to comply with 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is wholly or 
substantially the result of non-participation of state and/or local 
governments, it may be presumed that in the event of an actual 
radiological emergency state and local officials would generally follow 
the utility plan. However, this presumption may be rebutted by, for 
example, a good faith and timely proffer of an adequate and feasible 
state and/or local radiological emergency plan that would in fact be 
relied upon in a radiological emergency.
    (2) Generally, the plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power 
plants shall consist of an area about 10 miles (16 km) in radius and the 
ingestion pathway EPZ shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 km) in 
radius. The exact size and configuration of the EPZs surrounding a 
particular nuclear power reactor shall be determined in relation to 
local emergency response needs and capabilities as they are affected by 
such conditions as demography, topography, land characteristics, access 
routes, and jurisdictional boundaries. The size of the EPZs also may be 
determined on a case-by-case basis for gas-cooled nuclear reactors and 
for reactors with an authorized power level less than 250 MW thermal. 
The plans for the ingestion pathway shall focus on such actions as are 
appropriate to protect the food ingestion pathway.
    (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, and except as specified by this paragraph, no NRC or FEMA 
review, findings, or determinations concerning the state of offsite 
emergency preparedness or the adequacy of and capability to implement 
State and local or utility offsite emergency plans are required prior to 
issuance of an operating license authorizing only fuel loading or low 
power testing and training (up to 5 percent of the rated power). Insofar 
as emergency planning and preparedness requirements are concerned, a 
license authorizing fuel loading and/or low power testing and training 
may be issued after a finding is made by the NRC that the state of 
onsite emergency preparedness provides reasonable assurance that 
adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a 
radiological emergency. The NRC will base this finding on its assessment 
of the applicant's onsite emergency plans against the pertinent 
standards in paragraph (b) of this section and appendix E. Review of 
applicant's emergency plans will include the

[[Page 669]]

following standards with offsite aspects:
    (1) Arrangements for requesting and effectively using offsite 
assistance on site have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and 
local staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility 
have been made, and other organizations capable of augmenting the 
planned onsite response have been identified.
    (2) Procedures have been established for licensee communications 
with State and local response organizations, including initial 
notification of the declaration of emergency and periodic provision of 
plant and response status reports.
    (3) Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal 
response organizations to offsite emergency personnel who would be 
responding onsite.
    (4) Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the 
emergency response onsite are provided and maintained.
    (5) Adequate methods, systems, and equipment for assessing and 
monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological 
emergency condition are in use onsite.
    (6) Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated and 
injured onsite individuals.
    (7) Radiological emergency response training has been made available 
to those offsite who may be called to assist in an emergency onsite.

Sec. 50.48  Fire protection.

    (a) Each operating nuclear power plant must have a fire protection 
plan that satisfies Criterion 3 of appendix A of this part. This fire 
protection plan must describe the overall fire protection program for 
the facility, identify the various positions within the licensee's 
organization that are responsible for the program, state the authorities 
that are delegated to each of these positions to implement those 
responsibilities, and outline the plans for fire protection, fire 
detection and suppression capability, and limitation of fire damage. The 
plan must also describe specific features necessary to implement the 
program described above, such as administrative controls and personnel 
requirements for fire prevention and manual fire suppression activities, 
automatic and manually operated fire detection and suppression systems, 
and the means to limit fire damage to structures, systems, or components 
important to safety so that the capability to safely shut down the plant 
is ensured.\3\ The licensee shall retain the fire protection plan and 
each change to the plan as a record until the Commission terminates the 
reactor license and shall retain each superseded revision of the 
procedures for three years from the date it was superseded.

    (b) Appendix R to this part establishes fire protection features 
required to satisfy Criterion 3 of appendix A to this part with respect 
to certain generic issues for nuclear power plants licensed to operate 
prior to January 1, 1979. Except for the requirements of sections III.G, 
III.J, and III.O, the provisions of appendix R to this part shall not be 
applicable to nuclear power plants licensed to operate prior to January 
1, 1979, to the extent that fire protection features proposed or 
implemented by the licensee have been accepted by the NRC staff as 
satisfying the provisions of appendix A to Branch Technical Position BTP 
APCSB 9.5-1 \4\

reflected in staff fire protection safety evaluation reports issued 
prior to the effective date of this rule, or to the extent that fire 
protection features were accepted by the staff in comprehensive fire 
protection safety evaluation reports issued before appendix A to Branch 
Technical Position BTP APCSB 9.5-1 was published in August 1976. With 
respect to all other fire protection features covered by appendix R, all 
nuclear power plants licensed to operate prior to January 1, 1979 shall 
satisfy the applicable requirements of appendix R to this part, 
including specifically the requirements of sections III.G, III.J, and 
III.O.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Clarification and guidance with respect to permissible 
alternatives to satisfy Appendix A to BTP APCSB 9.5-1 has been provided 
in four other NRC documents.
     ``Supplementary Guidance on Information Needed for Fire Protection 
Evaluation,'' dated October 21, 1976.
     ``Sample Technical Specification,'' dated May 12, 1977.
     ``Nuclear Plant Fire Protection Functional Responsibilities, 
Administrative Control and Quality Assurance,'' dated June 14, 1977.
     ``Manpower Requirements for Operating Reactors,'' dated May 11, 
1978.
    A Fire Protection Safety Evaluation Report that has been issued for 
each operating plant states how these guidelines were applied to each 
facility and identifies open fire protection issues that will be 
resolved when the facility satisfies the appropriate requirements of 
Appendix R to this part.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) All fire protection modifications required to satisfy the 
provisions of appendix R to this part or directly affected by such 
requirements shall be completed on the following schedule:
    (1) Those fire protection features that involve revisions of 
administrative controls, manpower changes, and training, shall be 
implemented within 30 days after the effective date of this section and 
appendix R to this part.
    (2) Those fire protection features that involve installation of 
modifications that do not require prior NRC approval or plant shutdown 
shall be implemented within 9 months after the effective date of this 
section and appendix R to this part.
    (3) Those fire protection features, except for those requiring prior 
NRC approval by paragraph (c)(5) of this section, that involve 
installation of modifications that do require plant shutdown, the need 
for which is justified in the plans and schedules required by the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, shall be implemented 
before startup after the earliest of the following events commencing 180 
days or more after the effective date of this section and appendix R to 
this part:
    (i) The first refueling outage;
    (ii) Another planned outage that lasts for at least 60 days; or
    (iii) An unplanned outage that lasts for at least 120 days.
    (4) Those fire protection features that require prior NRC approval 
by paragraph (c)(5) of this section, shall be implemented within the 
following schedule: Dedicated shutdown systems--30 months after NRC 
approval; modifications requiring plant shutdown--before startup after 
the earliest of the events given in paragraph (c)(3) commencing 180 days 
after NRC approval; modifications not requiring plant shutdown--6 months 
after NRC approval.
    (5) Licensees shall make any modifications necessary to comply with 
these requirements in accordance with the above schedule without prior 
review and approval by NRC except for modifications required by section 
III.G.3 of appendix R to this part. Licensees shall submit plans and 
schedules for meeting the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and 
(c)(4) within 30 days after the effective date of this section and 
appendix R to this part. Licensees shall submit design descriptions of 
modifications needed to satisfy section III.G.3 of appendix R to this 
part within 30 days after the the effective date of this section and 
appendix R to this part.
    (6) In the event that a request for exemption from a requirement to 
comply with one or more of the provisions of Appendix R filed within 30 
days of the effective date of this rule is based on an assertion by the 
licensee that such required modifications would not enhance fire 
protection safety in the facility or that such modifications may be 
detrimental to overall facility safety, the schedule requirements of 
paragraph (c) shall be tolled until final Commission action on the 
exemption request upon a determination by the Director of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation that the licensee has provided a sound technical 
basis for such assertion that warrants further staff review of the 
request.

[[Page 671]]

    (d) Fire protection features accepted by the NRC staff in Fire 
Protection Safety Evaluation Reports referred to in paragraph (b) of 
this section and supplements to such reports, other than features 
covered by paragraph (c), shall be completed as soon as practicable but 
no later than the completion date currently specified in license 
conditions or technical specifications for such facility, or the date 
determined by paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section, 
whichever is sooner, unless the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation 
determines, upon a showing by the licensee, that there is good cause for 
extending such date and that the public health and safety is not 
adversely affected by such extension. Extensions of such date shall not 
exceed the dates determined by paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this 
section.
    (1) Those fire protection features that involve revisions of 
administrative controls, manpower changes, and training shall be 
implemented within 4 months after the date of the NRC staff Fire

implemented within 12 months after the date of the NRC staff Fire 
Protection Safety Evaluation Report accepting or requiring such 
features.
    (3) Those fire protection features, including alternative shutdown 
capability, involving installation of modifications requiring plant 
shutdown shall be implemented before the startup after the earliest of 
the following events commencing 9 months or more after the date of the 
NRC staff Fire Protection Safety Evaluation Report accepting or 
requiring such features:
    (i) The first refueling outage;
    (ii) Another planned outage that lasts for at least 60 days; or
    (iii) An unplanned outage that lasts for at least 120 days.
    (4) Those fire protection features involving dedicated shutdown 
capability requiring new buildings and systems shall be implemented 
within 30 months of NRC approval. Other modifications requiring NRC 
approval prior to installation shall be implemented within 6 months 
after NRC approval.
    (e) Nuclear power plants licensed to operate after January 1, 1979, 
shall complete all fire protection modifications needed to satisfy 
Criterion 3 of appendix A to this part in accordance with the provisions 
of their licenses.
    (f) Licensees that have submitted the certifications required under 
Sec. 50.82(a)(1) shall maintain a fire protection program to address the 
potential for fires which could cause the release or spread of 
radioactive materials (i.e., which could result in a radiological 
hazard).
    (1) The objectives of the fire protection program are to--
    (i) Reasonably prevent such fires from occurring;
    (ii) Rapidly detect, control, and extinguish those fires which do 
occur and which could result in a radiological hazard; and
    (iii) Ensure that the risk of fire-induced radiological hazards to 
the public, environment and plant personnel is minimized.
    (2) The fire protection program must be assessed by the licensee on 
a regular basis and revised as appropriate throughout the various stages 
of facility decommissioning.
    (3) The licensee may make changes to the fire protection program 
without NRC approval if these changes do not reduce the effectiveness of 
fire protection for facilities, systems, and equipment which could 
result in a radiological hazard, taking into account the decommissioning 
plant conditions and activities.

Sec. 50.49  Environmental qualification of electric equipment important to safety for nuclear power plants.

    (a) Each holder of or an applicant for a license for a nuclear power 
plant, other than a nuclear power plant for which the certifications 
required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, shall establish a 
program for qualifying the electric equipment defined in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Electric equipment important to safety covered by this section 
is:

[[Page 672]]

    (1) Safety-related electric equipment.<SUP>3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Safety-related electric equipment is referred to as ``Class 1E'' 
equipment in IEEE 323-1974. Copies of this standard may be obtained from 
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., 345 East 
47th Street, New York, NY 10017.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) This equipment is that relied upon to remain functional during 
and following design basis events to ensure--
    (A) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary;
    (B) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition; and
    (C) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents that could result in potential offsite exposures comparable to 
the guidelines in Sec. 50.34(a)(1) or Sec. 100.11 of this chapter, as 
applicable.
    (ii) Design basis events are defined as conditions of normal 
operation, including anticipated operational occurrences, design basis 
accidents, external events, and natural phenomena for which the plant 
must be designed to ensure functions (b)(1)(i) (A) through (C) of this 
section.
    (2) Nonsafety-related electric equipment whose failure under 
postulated environmental conditions could prevent satisfactory 
accomplishment of safety functions specified in subparagraphs (i) 
through (iii) of paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the safety-related 
equipment.
    (3) Certain post-accident monitoring equipment.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Specific guidance concerning the types of variables to be 
monitored is provided in Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide 1.97, 
``Instrumentation for Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Plants to Assess 
Plant and Environs Conditions During and Following an Accident.'' Copies 
of the Regulatory Guide may be purchased through the U.S. Government 
Printing Office by calling 202-275-2060 or by writing to the U.S. 
Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013-7082.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Requirements for (1) dynamic and seismic qualification of 
electric equipment important to safety, (2) protection of electric 
equipment important to safety against other natural phenomena and 
external events, and (3) environmental qualification of electric 
equipment important to safety located in a mild environment are not 
included within the scope of this section. A mild environment is an 
environment that would at no time be significantly more severe than the 
environment that would occur during normal plant operation, including 
anticipated operational occurrences.
    (d) The applicant or licensee shall prepare a list of electric 
equipment important to safety covered by this section. In addition, the 
applicant or licensee shall include the information in paragraphs 
(d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for this electric equipment 
important to safety in a qualification file. The applicant or licensee 
shall keep the list and information in the file current and retain the 
file in auditable form for the entire period during which the covered 
item is installed in the nuclear power plant or is stored for future use 
to permit verification that each item of electric equipment is important 
to safely meet the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section.
    (1) The performance specifications under conditions existing during 
and following design basis accidents.
    (2) The voltage, frequency, load, and other electrical 
characteristics for which the performance specified in accordance with 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section can be ensured.
    (3) The environmental conditions, including temperature, pressure, 
humidity, radiation, chemicals, and submergence at the location where 
the equipment must perform as specified in accordance with paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (e) The electric equipment qualification program must include and be 
based on the following:
    (1) Temperature and pressure. The time-dependent temperature and 
pressure at the location of the electric equipment important to safety 
must be established for the most severe design basis accident during or 
following which this equipment is required to remain functional.
    (2) Humidity. Humidity during design basis accidents must be 
considered.
    (3) Chemical effects. The composition of chemicals used must be at 
least as severe as that resulting from the most limiting mode of plant 
operation (e.g., containment spray, emergency core

[[Page 673]]

cooling, or recirculation from containment sump). If the composition of 
the chemical spray can be affected by equipment malfunctions, the most 
severe chemical spray environment that results from a single failure in 
the spray system must be assumed.
    (4) Radiation. The radiation environment must be based on the type 
of radiation, the total dose expected during normal operation over the 
installed life of the equipment, and the radiation environment 
associated with the most severe design basis accident during or 
following which the equipment is required to remain functional, 
including the radiation resulting from recirculating fluids for 
equipment located near the recirculating lines and including dose-rate 
effects.
    (5) Aging. Equipment qualified by test must be preconditioned by 
natural or artificial (accelerated) aging to its end-of-installed life 
condition. Consideration must be given to all significant types of 
degradation which can have an effect on the functional capability of the 
equipment. If preconditioning to an end-of-installed life condition is 
not practicable, the equipment may be preconditioned to a shorter 
designated life. The equipment must be replaced or refurbished at the 
end of this designated life unless ongoing qualification demonstrates 
that the item has additional life.
    (6) Submergence (if subject to being submerged).
    (7) Synergistic effects. Synergistic effects must be considered when 
these effects are believed to have a significant effect on equipment 
performance.
    (8) Margins. Margins must be applied to account for unquantified 
uncertainty, such as the effects of production variations and 
inaccuracies in test instruments. These margins are in addition to any 
conservatisms applied during the derivation of local environmental 
conditions of the equipment unless these conservatisms can be quantified 
and shown to contain appropriate margins.
    (f) Each item of electric equipment important to safety must be 
qualified by one of the following methods:
    (1) Testing an identical item of equipment under identical 
conditions or under similar conditions with a supporting analysis to 
show that the equipment to be qualified is acceptable.
    (2) Testing a similar item of equipment with a supporting analysis 
to show that the equipment to be qualified is acceptable.
    (3) Experience with identical or similar equipment under similar 
conditions with a supporting analysis to show that the equipment to be 
qualified is acceptable.
    (4) Analysis in combination with partial type test data that 
supports the analytical assumptions and conclusions.
    (g) Each holder of an operating license issued prior to February 22, 
1983, shall, by May 20, 1983, identify the electric equipment important 
to safety within the scope of this section already qualified and submit 
a schedule for either the qualification to the provisions of this 
section or for the replacement of the remaining electric equipment 
important to safety within the scope of this section. This schedule must 
establish a goal of final environmental qualification of the electric 
equipment within the scope of this section by the end of the second 
refueling outage after March 31, 1982 or by March 31, 1985, whichever is 
earlier. The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may 
grant requests for extensions of this deadline to a date no later than 
November 30, 1985, for specific pieces of equipment if these requests 
are filed on a timely basis and demonstrate good cause for the 
extension, such as procurement lead time, test complications, and 
installation problems. In exceptional cases, the Commission itself may 
consider and grant extensions beyond November 30, 1985, for completion 
of environmental qualification.

The schedule in this paragraph supersedes the June 30, 1982, deadline, 
or any other previously imposed date, for environmental qualification of 
electric equipment contained in certain nuclear power operating 
licenses.
    (h) Each license shall notify the Commission as specified in 
Sec. 50.4 of any significant equipment qualification problem that may 
require extension of the completion date provided in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section within 60 days of its discovery.

[[Page 674]]

    (i) Applicants for operating licenses granted after February 22, 
1983, but prior to November 30, 1985, shall perform an analysis to 
ensure that the plant can be safely operated pending completion of 
equipment qualification required by this section. This analysis must be 
submitted, as specified in Sec. 50.4, for consideration prior to the 
granting of an operating license and must include, where appropriate, 
consideration of:
    (1) Accomplishing the safety function by some designated alternative 
equipment if the principal equipment has not been demonstrated to be 
fully qualified.
    (2) The validity of partial test data in support of the original 
qualification.
    (3) Limited use of administrative controls over equipment that has 
not been demonstrated to be fully qualified.
    (4) Completion of the safety function prior to exposure to the 
accident environment resulting from a design basis event and ensuring 
that the subsequent failure of the equipment does not degrade any safety 
function or mislead the operator.
    (5) No significant degradation of any safety function or misleading 
information to the operator as a result of failure of equipment under 
the accident environment resulting from a design basis event.
    (j) A record of the qualification, including documentation in 
paragraph (d) of this section, must be maintained in an auditable form 
for the entire period during which the covered item is installed in the 
nuclear power plant or is stored for future use to permit verification 
that each item of electric equipment important to safety covered by this 
section:
    (1) Is qualified for its application; and
    (2) Meets its specified performance requirements when it is 
subjected to the conditions predicted to be present when it must perform 
its safety function up to the end of its qualified life.
    (k) Applicants for and holders of operating licenses are not 
required to requalify electric equipment important to safety in 
accordance with the provisions of this section if the Commission has 
previously required qualification of that equipment in accordance with 
``Guidelines for Evaluating Environmental Qualification of Class 1E 
Electrical Equipment in Operating Reactors,'' November 1979 (DOR 
Guidelines), or NUREG-0588 (For Comment version), ``Interim Staff 
Position on Environmental Qualification of Safety-Related Electrical 
Equipment.''
    (l) Replacement equipment must be qualified in accordance with the 
provisions of this section unless there are sound reasons to the 
contrary.

<R05>
Sec. 50.54   Conditions of licenses.

    Whether stated therein or not, the following shall be deemed 
conditions in every license issued:
    (a)(1) Each nuclear power plant or fuel reprocessing plant licensee 
subject to the quality assurance criteria in appendix B of this part 
shall implement, pursuant to Sec. 50.34(b)(6)(ii) of this part, the 
quality assurance program described or referenced in the Safety Analysis 
Report, including changes to that report.
    (2) Each licensee described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall, by June 10, 1983, submit to the appropriate NRC Regional Office 
shown in appendix D of part 20 of this chapter the current description 
of the quality assurance program it is implementing for inclusion in the 
Safety Analysis Report, unless there are no changes to the description 
previously accepted by NRC. This submittal must identify changes made to 
the quality assurance program description since the description was 
submitted to NRC. (Should a licensee need additional time beyond June 
10, 1983 to submit its current quality assurance program description to 
NRC, it shall notify the appropriate NRC Regional Office in writing, 
explain why additional time is needed, and provide a schedule for NRC 
approval showing when its current quality assurance program description 
will be submitted.)

[[Page 676]]

    (3) After March 11, 1983, each licensee described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section may make a change to a previously accepted 
quality assurance program description included or referenced in the 
Safety Analysis Report, provided the change does not reduce the 
commitments in the program description previously accepted by the NRC. 
Changes to the quality assurance program description that do not reduce 
the commitments must be submitted to the NRC in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 50.71(e). Changes to the quality assurance program 
description that do reduce the commitments must be submitted to NRC and 
receive NRC approval prior to implementation, as follows:
    (i) Changes made to the Safety Analysis Report must be submitted, as 
specified in Sec. 50.4. Changes made to NRC-accepted quality assurance 
topical report descriptions must be submitted, as specified in 
Sec. 50.4.
    (ii) The submittal of a change to the Safety Analysis Report quality 
assurance program description must include all pages affected by that 
change and must be accompanied by a forwarding letter identifying the 
change, the reason for the change, and the basis for concluding that the 
revised program incorporating the change continues to satisfy the 
criteria of appendix B of this part and the Safety Analysis Report 
quality assurance program description commitments previously accepted by 
the NRC (the letter need not provide the basis for changes that correct 
spelling, punctuation, or editorial items).
    (iii) A copy of the forwarding letter identifying the changes must 
be maintained as a facility record for three years.
    (iv) Changes to the quality assurance program description included 
or referenced in the Safety Analysis Report shall be regarded as 
accepted by the Commission upon receipt of a letter to this effect from 
the appropriate reviewing office of the Commission or 60 days after 
submittal to the Commission, whichever occurs first.
    (b) No right to the special nuclear material shall be conferred by 
the license except as may be defined by the license.
    (c) Neither the license, nor any right thereunder, nor any right to 
utilize or produce special nuclear material shall be transferred, 
assigned, or disposed of in any manner, either voluntarily or 
involuntarily, directly or indirectly, through transfer of control of 
the license to any person, unless the Commission shall, after securing 
full information, find that the transfer is in accordance with the 
provisions of the act and give its consent in writing.
    (d) The license shall be subject to suspension and to the rights of 
recapture of the material or control of the facility reserved to the 
Commission under section 108 of the act in a state of war or national 
emergency declared by Congress.
    (e) The license shall be subject to revocation, suspension, 
modification, or amendment for cause as provided in the act and 
regulations, in accordance with the procedures provided by the act and 
regulations.
    (f) The licensee shall at any time before expiration of the license, 
upon request of the Commission, submit, as specified in Sec. 50.4, 
written statements, signed under oath or affirmation, to enable the 
Commission to determine whether or not the license should be modified, 
suspended, or revoked. Except for information sought to verify licensee 
compliance with the current licensing basis for that facility, the NRC 
must prepare the reason or reasons for each information request prior to 
issuance to ensure that the burden to be imposed on respondents is 
justified in view of the potential safety significance of the issue to 
be addressed in the requested information. Each such justification 
provided for an evaluation performed by the NRC staff must be approved 
by the Executive Director for Operations or his or her designee prior to 
issuance of the request.
    (g) The issuance or existence of the license shall not be deemed to 
waive, or relieve the licensee from compliance with, the antitrust laws, 
as specified in subsection 105a of the Act. In the event that the 
licensee should be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have 
violated any provision of such antitrust laws in the conduct of the 
licensed activity, the Commission may suspend or revoke the license or 
take

[[Page 677]]

such other action with respect to it as shall be deemed necessary.
    (h) The license shall be subject to the provisions of the Act now or 
hereafter in effect and to all rules, regulations, and orders of the 
Commission. The terms and conditions of the license shall be subject to 
amendment, revision, or modification, by reason of amendments of the Act 
or by reason of rules, regulations, and orders issued in accordance with 
the terms of the act.
    (i) Except as provided in Sec. 55.13 of this chapter, the licensee 
may not permit the manipulation of the controls of any facility by 
anyone who is not a licensed operator or senior operator as provided in 
part 55 of this chapter.
    (i-1) Within three months after issuance of an operating license, 
the licensee shall have in effect an operator requalification program 
which must as a minimum, meet the requirements of Sec. 55.59(c) of this 
chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 50.59, the licensee may 
not, except as specifically authorized by the Commission decrease the 
scope of an approved operator requalification program.
    (j) Apparatus and mechanisms other than controls, the operation of 
which may affect the reactivity or power level of a reactor shall be 
manipulated only with the knowledge and consent of an operator or senior 
operator licensed pursuant to part 55 of this chapter present at the 
controls.
    (k) An operator or senior operator licensed pursuant to part 55 of 
this chapter shall be present at the controls at all times during the 
operation of the facility.
    (l) The licensee shall designate individuals to be responsible for 
directing the licensed activities of licensed operators. These 
individuals shall be licensed as senior operators pursuant to part 55 of 
this chapter.
    (m)(1) A senior operator licensed pursuant to part 55 of this 
chapter shall be present at the facility or readily available on call at 
all times during its operation, and shall be present at the facility 
during initial start-up and approach to power, recovery from an 
unplanned or unscheduled shut-down or significant reduction in power, 
and refueling, or as otherwise prescribed in the facility license.
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, by January 
1, 1984, licensees of nuclear power units shall meet the following 
requirements:
    (i) Each licensee shall meet the minimum licensed operator staffing 
requirements in the following table:

\1\ Temporary deviations from the numbers required by this table shall be in accordance with criteria           
  established in the unit's technical specifications.                                                           
\2\ For the purpose of this table, a nuclear power unit is considered to be operating when it is in a mode other
  than cold shutdown or refueling as defined by the unit's technical specifications.                            
\3\ The number of required licensed personnel when the operating nuclear power units are controlled from a      
  common control room are two senior operators and four operators.                                        

    (ii) Each licensee shall have at its site a person holding a senior 
operator license for all fueled units at the site who is assigned 
responsibility for overall plant operation at all times there is fuel in 
any unit. If a single senior operator does not hold a senior operator 
license on all fueled units at the site, then the licensee must have at 
the site two or more senior operators, who in

[[Page 678]]

combination are licensed as senior operators on all fueled units.
    (iii) When a nuclear power unit is in an operational mode other than 
cold shutdown or refueling, as defined by the unit's technical 
specifications, each licensee shall have a person holding a senior 
operator license for the nuclear power unit in the control room at all 
times. In addition to this senior operator, for each fueled nuclear 
power unit, a licensed operator or senior operator shall be present at 
the controls at all times.
    (iv) Each licensee shall have present, during alteration of the core 
of a nuclear power unit (including fuel loading or transfer), a person 
holding a senior operator license or a senior operator license limited 
to fuel handling to directly supervise the activity and, during this 
time, the licensee shall not assign other duties to this person.
    (3) Licensees who cannot meet the January 1, 1984 deadline must 
submit by October 1, 1983 a request for an extension to the Director of 
the Office of Nuclear Regulation and demonstrate good cause for the 
request.
    (n) The licensee shall not, except as authorized pursuant to a 
construction permit, make any alteration in the facility constituting a 
change from the technical specifications previously incorporated in a 
license or construction permit pursuant to Sec. 50.36 of this part.
    (o) Primary reactor containments for water cooled power reactors, 
other than facilities for which the certifications required under 
Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, shall be subject to the 
requirements set forth in appendix J to this part.
    (p)(1) The licensee shall prepare and maintain safeguards 
contingency plan procedures in accordance with appendix C of part 73 of 
this chapter for effecting the actions and decisions contained in the 
Responsibility Matrix of the safeguards contingency plan. The licensee 
may make no change which would decrease the effectiveness of a security 
plan, or guard training and qualification plan, prepared pursuant to 
Sec. 50.34(c) or part 73 of this chapter, or of the first four 
categories of information (Background, Generic Planning Base, Licensee 
Planning Base, Responsibility Matrix) contained in a licensee safeguards 
contingency plan prepared pursuant to Sec. 50.34(d) or part 73 of this 
chapter, as applicable, without prior approval of the Commission. A 
licensee desiring to make such a change shall submit an application for 
an amendment to the licensee's license pursuant to Sec. 50.90.
    (2) The licensee may make changes to the plans referenced in 
paragraph (p)(1) of this section, without prior Commission approval if 
the changes do not decrease the safeguards effectiveness of the plan. 
The licensee shall maintain records of changes to the plans made without 
prior Commission approval for a period of three years from the date of 
the change, and shall submit, as specified in Sec. 50.4, a report 
containing a description of each change within two months after the 
change is made. Prior to the safeguards contingency plan being put into 
effect, the licensee shall have:
    (i) All safeguards capabilities specified in the safeguards 
contingency plan available and functional,
    (ii) Detailed procedures developed according to appendix C to part 
73 available at the licensee's site, and
    (iii) All appropriate personnel trained to respond to safeguards 
incidents as outlined in the plan and specified in the detailed 
procedures.
    (3) The licensee shall provide for the development, revision, 
implementation, and maintanence of its safeguards contingency plan. To 
this end, the licensee shall provide for a review at least every 12 
months of the safeguards contingency plan by individuals independent of 
both security program management and personnel who have direct 
responsibility for implementation of the security program. The review 
must include a review and audit of safeguards contingency procedures and 
practices, an audit of the security system testing and maintenance 
program, and a test of the safeguards systems along with commitments 
established for response by local law enforcement authorities. The 
results of the review and audit, along with recommendations for 
improvements, must be documented, reported to the licensee's corporate 
and plant management, and kept available at the plant for inspection for 
a period of two years.

[[Page 679]]

    (q) A licensee authorized to possess and operate a nuclear power 
reactor shall follow and maintain in effect emergency plans which meet 
the standards in Sec. 50.47(b) and the requirements in appendix E of 
this part. A licensee authorized to possess and/or operate a research 
reactor or a fuel facility shall follow and maintain in effect emergency 
plans which meet the requirements in appendix E to this part. The 
licensee shall retain the emergency plan and each change that decreases 
the effectiveness of the plan as a record until the Commission 
terminates the license for the nuclear power reactor. The nuclear power 
reactor licensee may make changes to these plans without Commission 
approval only if the changes do not decrease the effectiveness of the 
plans and the plans, as changed, continue to meet the standards of 
Sec. 50.47(b) and the requirements of appendix E to this part. The 
research reactor and/or the fuel facility licensee may make changes to 
these plans without Commission approval only if these changes do not 
decrease the effectiveness of the plans and the plans, as changed, 
continue to meet the requirements of appendix E to this part. This 
nuclear power reactor, research reactor, or fuel facility licensee shall 
retain a record of each change to the emergency plan made without prior 
Commission approval for a period of three years from the date of the 
change. Proposed changes that decrease the effectiveness of the approved 
emergency plans may not be implemented without application to and 
approval by the Commission. The licensee shall submit, as specified in 
Sec. 50.4, a report of each proposed change for approval. If a change is 
made without approval, the licensee shall submit, as specified in 
Sec. 50.4, a report of each change within 30 days after the change is 
made.
    (r) Each licensee who is authorized to possess and/or operate a 
research or test reactor facility with an authorized power level greater 
than or equal to 2 MW thermal, under a licensee of the type specified in 
Sec. 50.21(c), shall submit emergency plans complying with 10 CFR part 
50, appendix E, to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation for approval by September 7, 1982. Each licensee who is 
authorized to possess and/or operate a research or test reactor facility 
with an authorized power level less than 2 MW thermal, under a license 
of the type specified in Sec. 50.21(c), shall submit emergency plans 
complying with 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, to the Director of the Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation for approval by November 3, 1982.
    (s)(1) Each licensee who is authorized to possess and/or operate a 
nuclear power reactor shall submit to NRC within 60 days of the 
effective date of this amendment the radiological emergency response 
plans of State and local governmental entities in the United States that 
are wholly or partially within a plume exposure pathway EPZ, as well as 
the plans of State governments wholly or partially within an ingestion 
pathway EPZ.\2\ Ten (10) copies of the above plans shall be forwarded to 
the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation with 3 copies to the 
Administrator of the appropriate NRC regional office. Generally, the 
plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power reactors shall consist of 
an area about 10 miles (16 km) in radius and the ingestion pathway EPZ 
shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 km) in radius. The exact 
size and configuration of the EPZs for a particular nuclear power 
reactor shall be determined in relation to local emergency response 
needs and capabilities as they are affected by such conditions as 
demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes, and 
jurisdictional boundaries. The size of the EPZs also may be determined 
on a case-by-case basis for gas-cooled nuclear reactors and for reactors 
with an authorized power level less than 250 MW thermal. The plans for 
the ingestion pathway EPZ shall focus on such

[[Page 680]]

actions as are appropriate to protect the food ingestion pathway.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Emergency Planning Zones (EPZs) are discussed in NUREG-0396; EPA 
520/1-78-016, ``Planning Basis for the Development of State and Local 
Government Radiological Emergency Response Plans in Support of Light 
Water Nuclear Power Plants,'' December 1978.
    If the State and local emergency response plans have been previously 
provided to the NRC for inclusion in the facility docket, the applicant 
need only provide the appropriate reference to meet this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2)(i) For operating power reactors, the licensee, State, and local 
emergency response plans shall be implemented by April 1, 1981, except 
as provided in section IV.D.3 of appendix E to this part.
    (ii) If after April 1, 1981, the NRC finds that the state of 
emergency preparedness does not provide reasonable assurance that 
adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a 
radiological emergency (including findings based on requirements of 
appendix E, section IV.D.3) and if the deficiencies (including 
deficiencies based on requirements of appendix E, section IV.D.3) are 
not corrected within four months of that finding, the Commission will 
determine whether the reactor shall be shut down until such deficiencies 
are remedied or whether other enforcement action is appropriate. In 
determining whether a shutdown or other enforcement action is 
appropriate, the Commission shall take into account, among other 
factors, whether the licensee can demonstrate to the Commission's 
satisfaction that the deficiencies in the plan are not significant for 
the plant in question, or that adequate interim compensating actions 
have been or will be taken promptly, or that that there are other 
compelling reasons for continued operation.
    (3) The NRC will base its finding on a review of the FEMA findings 
and determinations as to whether State and local emergency plans are 
adequate and capable of being implemented, and on the NRC assessment as 
to whether the licensee's emergency plans are adequate and capable of 
being implemented. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as 
limiting the authority of the Commission to take action under any other 
regulation or authority of the Commission or at any time other than that 
specified in this paragraph.
    (t) A nuclear power reactor licensee shall provide for the 
development, revision, implementation, and maintenance of its emergency 
preparedness program. To this end, the licensee shall provide for a 
review of its emergency preparedness program at least every 12 months by 
persons who have no direct responsibility for implementation of the 
emergency preparedness program. The review shall include an evaluation 
for adequacy of interfaces with State and local governments and of 
licensee drills, exercises, capabilities, and procedures. The results of 
the review, along with recommendations for improvements, shall be 
documented, reported to the licensee's corporate and plant management, 
and retained for a period of five years. The part of the review 
involving the evaluation for adequacy of interface with State and local 
governments shall be available to the appropriate State and local 
governments.
    (u) Within 60 days after the effective date of this amendment, each 
nuclear power reactor licensee shall submit to the NRC plans for coping 
with emergencies that meet standards in Sec. 50.47(b) and the 
requirements of appendix E to this part.
    (v) Each licensee subject to the requirements of part 73 of this 
chapter shall ensure that physical security, safeguards contingency and 
guard qualification and training plans and other related Safeguards 
Information are protected against unauthorized disclosure in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. 73.21 of this chapter, as appropriate.
    (w) Each electric utility licensee under this part for a production 
or utilization facility of the type described in Sec. 50.21(b) or 
Sec. 50.22 shall take reasonable steps to obtain insurance available at 
reasonable costs and on reasonable terms from private sources or to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that it possesses an 
equivalent amount of protection covering the licensee's obligation, in 
the event of an accident at the licensee's reactor, to stabilize and 
decontaminate the reactor and the reactor station site at which the 
reactor experiencing the accident is located, provided that:
    (1) The insurance required by paragraph (w) of this section must 
have a minimum coverage limit for each reactor station site of either 
$1.06 billion or whatever amount of insurance is generally available 
from private sources, whichever is less. The required insurance must 
clearly state that, as and to the extent provided in paragraph (w)(4)

[[Page 681]]

of this section, any proceeds must be payable first for stabilization of 
the reactor and next for decontamination of the reactor and the reactor 
station site. If a licensee's coverage falls below the required minimum, 
the licensee shall within 60 days take all reasonable steps to restore 
its coverage to the required minimum. The required insurance may, at the 
option of the licensee, be included within policies that also provide 
coverage for other risks, including, but not limited to, the risk of 
direct physical damage.
    (2)(i) With respect to policies issued or annually renewed on or 
after April 2, 1991, the proceeds of such required insurance must be 
dedicated, as and to the extent provided in this paragraph, to 
reimbursement or payment on behalf of the insured of reasonable expenses 
incurred or estimated to be incurred by the licensee in taking action to 
fulfill the licensee's obligation, in the event of an accident at the 
licensee's reactor, to ensure that the reactor is in, or is returned to, 
and maintained in, a safe and stable condition and that radioactive 
contamination is removed or controlled such that personnel exposures are 
consistent with the occupational exposure limits in 10 CFR part 20. 
These actions must be consistent with any other obligation the licensee 
may have under this chapter and must be subject to paragraph (w)(4) of 
this section. As used in this section, an ``accident'' means an event 
that involves the release of radioactive material from its intended 
place of confinement within the reactor or on the reactor station site 
such that there is a present danger of release off site in amounts that 
would pose a threat to the public health and safety.
    (ii) The stabilization and decontamination requirements set forth in 
paragraph (w)(4) of this section must apply uniformly to all insurance 
policies required under paragraph (w) of this section.
    (3) The licensee shall report to the NRC on April 1 of each year the 
current levels of this insurance or financial security it maintains and 
the sources of this insurance or financial security.
    (4)(i) In the event of an accident at the licensee's reactor, 
whenever the estimated costs of stabilizing the licensed reactor and of 
decontaminating the reactor and the reactor station site exceed $100 
million, the proceeds of the insurance required by paragraph (w) of this 
section must be dedicated to and used, first, to ensure that the 
licensed reactor is in, or is returned to, and can be maintained in, a 
safe and stable condition so as to prevent any significant risk to the 
public health and safety and, second, to decontaminate the reactor and 
the reactor station site in accordance with the licensee's cleanup plan 
as approved by order of the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation. This priority on insurance proceeds must remain in effect 
for 60 days or, upon order of the Director, for such longer periods, in 
increments not to exceed 60 days except as provided for activities under 
the cleanup plan required in paragraphs (w)(4)(iii) and (w)(4)(iv) of 
this section, as the Director may find necessary to protect the public 
health and safety. Actions needed to bring the reactor to and maintain 
the reactor in a safe and stable condition may include one or more of 
the following, as appropriate: (A) Shutdown of the reactor; (B) 
Establishment and maintenance of long-term cooling with stable decay 
heat removal; (C) Maintenance of sub-criticality; (D) Control of 
radioactive releases; and (E) Securing of structures, systems, or 
components to minimize radiation exposure to onsite personnel or to the 
offsite public or to facilitate later decontamination or both.

    (ii) The licensee shall inform the Director of the Office of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation in writing when the reactor is and can be maintained 
in a safe and stable condition so as to prevent any significant risk to 
the public health and safety. Within 30 days after the licensee informs 
the Director that the reactor is in this condition, or at such earlier 
time as the licensee may elect or the Director may for good cause 
direct, the licensee shall prepare and submit a cleanup plan for the 
Director's approval. The cleanup plan must identify and contain an 
estimate of the cost of each cleanup operation that will be required to 
decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit the licensee either to 
resume operation of

[[Page 682]]

the reactor or to apply to the Commission under Sec. 50.82 for authority 
to decommission the reactor and to surrender the license voluntarily. 
Cleanup operations may include one or more of the following, as 
appropriate: (A) Processing any contaminated water generated by the 
accident and by decontamination operations to remove radioactive 
materials; (B) Decontamination of surfaces inside the auxiliary and 
fuel-handling buildings and the reactor building to levels consistent 
with the Commission's occupational exposure limits in 10 CFR part 20, 
and decontamination or disposal of equipment; (C) Decontamination or 
removal and disposal of internal parts and damaged fuel from the reactor 
vessel; and (D) Cleanup of the reactor coolant system.

    (iii) Following review of the licensee's cleanup plan, the Director 
will order the licensee to complete all operations that the Director 
finds are necessary to decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit 
the licensee either to resume operation of the reactor or to apply to 
the Commission under Sec. 50.82 for authority to decommission the 
reactor and to surrender the license voluntarily. The Director shall 
approve or disapprove, in whole or in part for stated reasons, the 
licensee's estimate of cleanup costs for such operations. Such order may 
not be effective for more than 1 year, at which time it may be renewed. 
Each subsequent renewal order, if imposed, may be effective for not more 
than 6 months.
    (iv) Of the balance of the proceeds of the required insurance not 
already expended to place the reactor in a safe and stable condition 
pursuant to paragraph (w)(2)(i) of this section, an amount sufficient to 
cover the expenses of completion of those decontamination operations 
that are the subject of the Director's order shall be dedicated to such 
use, provided that, upon certification to the Director of the amounts 
expended previously and from time to time for stabilization and 
decontamination and upon further certification to the Director as to the 
sufficiency of the dedicated amount remaining, policies of insurance may 
provide for payment to the licensee or other loss payees of amounts not 
so dedicated, and the licensee may proceed to use in parallel (and not 
in preference thereto) any insurance proceeds not so dedicated for other 
purposes.
    (x) A licensee may take reasonable action that departs from a 
license condition or a technical specification (contained in a license 
issued under this part) in an emergency when this action is immediately 
needed to protect the public health and safety and no action consistent 
with license conditions and technical specifications that can provide 
adequate or equivalent protection is immediately apparent.
    (y) Licensee action permitted by paragraph (x) of this section shall 
be approved, as a minimum, by a licensed senior operator, or, at a 
nuclear power reactor facility for which the certifications required 
under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, by either a licensed senior 
operator or a certified fuel handler, prior to taking the action.
    (z) Each licensee with a utilization facility licensed pursuant to 
sections 103 or 104b. of the Act shall immediately notify the NRC 
Operations Center of the occurrence of any event specified in Sec. 50.72 
of this part.
    (aa) The license shall be subject to all conditions deemed imposed 
as a matter of law by sections 401(a)(2) and 401(d) of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C.A. 1341(a)(2) and (d).)
    (bb) For nuclear power reactors licensed by the NRC, the licensee 
shall, within 2 years following permanent cessation of operation of the 
reactor or 5 years before expiration of the reactor operating license, 
whichever occurs first, submit written notification to the Commission 
for its review and preliminary approval of the program by which the 
licensee intends to manage and provide funding for the management of all 
irradiated fuel at the reactor following permanent cessation of 
operation of the reactor until title to the irradiated fuel and 
possession of the fuel is transferred to the Secretary of Energy for its 
ultimate disposal in a repository. Licensees of nuclear power reactors 
that have permanently ceased operation by April 4, 1994 are required to 
submit such written notification by April 4, 1996. Final Commission 
review

[[Page 683]]

will be undertaken as part of any proceeding for continued licensing 
under part 50 or part 72 of this chapter. The licensee must demonstrate 
to NRC that the elected actions will be consistent with NRC requirements 
for licensed possession of irradiated nuclear fuel and that the actions 
will be implemented on a timely basis. Where implementation of such 
actions requires NRC authorizations, the licensee shall verify in the 
notification that submittals for such actions have been or will be made 
to NRC and shall identify them. A copy of the notification shall be 
retained by the licensee as a record until expiration of the reactor 
operating license. The licensee shall notify the NRC of any significant 
changes in the proposed waste management program as described in the 
initial notification.
    (cc)(1) Each licensee shall notify the appropriate NRC Regional 
Administrator, in writing, immediately following the filing of a 
voluntary or involuntary petition for bankruptcy under any chapter of 
title 11 (Bankruptcy) of the United States Code by or against:
    (i) The licensee;
    (ii) An entity (as that term is defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(14)) 
controlling the licensee or listing the license or licensee as property 
of the estate; or
    (iii) An affiliate (as that term is defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(2)) of 
the licensee.
    (2) This notification must indicate:
    (i) The bankruptcy court in which the petition for bankruptcy was 
filed; and
    (ii) The date of the filing of the petition.
    (dd) A licensee may take reasonable action that departs from a 
license condition or a technical specification (contained in a license 
issued under this part) in a national security emergency:
    (1) When this action is immediately needed to implement national 
security objectives as designated by the national command authority 
through the Commission, and
    (2) No action consistent with license conditions and technical 
specifications that can meet national security objectives is immediately 
apparent.

A national security emergency is established by a law enacted by the 
Congress or by an order or directive issued by the President pursuant to 
statutes or the Constitution of the United States. The authority under 
this paragraph must be exercised in accordance with law, including 
section 57e of the Act, and is in addition to the authority granted 
under paragraph (x) of this section, which remains in effect unless 
otherwise directed by the Commission during a national security 
emergency.
    (ee)(1) Each license issued under this part authorizing the 
possession of byproduct and special nuclear material produced in the 
operation of the licensed reactor includes, whether stated in the 
license or not, the authorization to receive back that same material, in 
the same or altered form or combined with byproduct or special nuclear 
material produced in the operation of another reactor of the same 
licensee located at that site, from a licensee of the Commission or an

Sec. 50.55   Conditions of construction permits.

    Each construction permit shall be subject to the following terms and 
conditions:
    (a) The permit shall state the earliest and latest dates for 
completion of the construction or modification.
    (b) If the proposed construction or modification of the facility is 
not completed by the latest completion date, the permit shall expire and 
all rights thereunder shall be forfeited: Provided, however, That upon 
good cause shown the Commission will extend the completion date for a 
reasonable period of time. The Commission will recognize, among other 
things, developmental problems attributable to the experimental nature 
of the facility or fire, flood, explosion, strike, sabotage, domestic 
violence, enemy action, an act of the elements, and other acts beyond 
the control of the permit holder, as a basis for extending the 
completion date.
    (c) Except as modified by this section and Sec. 50.55a, the 
construction permit shall be subject to the same conditions to which a 
license is subject.
    (d) At or about the time of completion of the construction or 
modification of the facility, the applicant will file any additional 
information needed to bring the original application for license up to 
date, and will file an application for an operating license or an 
amendment to an application for a license to construct and operate the 
facility for the issuance of an operating license, as appropriate, as 
specified in Sec. 50.30(d) of this part.
    (e)(1) Each individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity 
holding a facility construction permit subject to this part must adopt 
appropriate procedures to--
    (i) Evaluate deviations and failures to comply to identify defects 
and failures to comply associated with substantial safety hazards as 
soon as practicable, and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of 
this section, in all cases within 60 days of discovery, in order to 
identify a reportable defect or failure to comply that could create a 
substantial safety hazard, were it to remain uncorrected.
    (ii) Ensure that if an evaluation of an identified deviation or 
failure to comply potentially associated with a substantial safety 
hazard cannot be completed within 60 days from discovery of the 
deviation or failure to comply, an interim report is prepared and 
submitted to the Commission through a director or responsible officer or 
designated person as discussed in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. The 
interim report should describe the deviation or failure to comply that 
is being evaluated and should also state when the evaluation will be 
completed. This interim report must be submitted in writing within 60 
days of discovery of the deviation or failure to comply.
    (iii) Ensure that a director or responsible officer of the holder of 
a facility construction permit subject to this part is informed as soon 
as practicable, and, in all cases, within the 5 working days after 
completion of the evaluation described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section, if the construction of a facility or 
activity, or a basic component supplied for such facility or activity--
    (A) Fails to comply with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 
or any applicable rule, regulation, order, or license of the Commission 
relating to a substantial safety hazard,
    (B) Contains a defect, or
    (C) Undergoes any significant breakdown in any portion of the 
quality assurance program conducted pursuant to the requirements of 
appendix B to 10 CFR part 50 which could have produced a defect in a 
basic component. Such breakdowns in the quality assurance program are 
reportable whether or not the breakdown actually resulted in a defect in 
a design approved and released for construction or installation.
    (2) The holder of a facility construction permit subject to this 
part who obtains information reasonably indicating that the facility 
fails to comply with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or any 
applicable rule, regulation, order, or license of the Commission 
relating to a substantial safety hazard must notify the Commission of 
the failure to comply through a director or responsible officer or 
designated person as discussed in paragraph (e)(7) of this section.

[[Page 685]]

    (3) The holder of a facility construction permit subject to this 
part who obtains information reasonably indicating the existence of any 
defect found in construction or any defect found in the final design of 
a facility as approved and released for construction must notify the 
Commission of the defect through a director or responsible officer or 
designated person as discussed in paragraph (e)(7) of this section.
    (4) The holder of a facility construction permit subject to this 
part who obtains information reasonably indicating that the quality 
assurance program has undergone any significant breakdown discussed in 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section must notify the Commission of 
the breakdown in the quality assurance program through a director or 
responsible officer or designated person as discussed in paragraph 
(e)(7) of this section.
    (5) The notification requirements of paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and 
(e)(4) of this section apply to all defects and failures to comply 
associated with a substantial safety hazard regardless of whether 
extensive evaluation, redesign, or repair is required to conform to the 
criteria and bases stated in the safety analysis report or construction 
permit. Evaluation of potential defects and failures to comply and 
reporting of defects and failures to comply under this section satisfies 
the construction permit holder's evaluation and notification obligations 
under part 21 of this chapter and, satisfies the responsibility of 
individual directors or responsible officers of holders of construction 
permits issued under Sec. 50.23 of this chapter to report defects, and 
failures to comply associated with substantial safety hazards under 
section 206 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974.
    (6) The notification required by paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and 
(e)(4) of this section must consist of--
    (i) Initial notification by facsimile, which is the preferred method 
of notification, to the NRC Operations Center at (301) 816-5151 or by 
telephone at (301) 816-5100 within two days following receipt of 
information by the director or responsible corporate officer under 
paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, on the identification of a defect 
or a failure to comply. Verification that the facsimile has been 
received should be made by calling the NRC Operations Center. This 
paragraph does not apply to interim reports described in paragraph

current description of the quality assurance program it is implementing 
for inclusion in the Safety Analysis Report, unless there are no changes 
to the description previously accepted by NRC. This submittal must 
identify changes made to the quality assurance program description since 
the description was submitted to NRC. (Should a permit holder need 
additional time beyond June 10, 1983 to submit its current quality 
assurance program description to NRC, it shall notify the appropriate 
NRC Regional Office in writing, explain why additional time is needed, 
and provide a schedule for NRC approval showing when its current quality 
assurance program description will be submitted.)
    (3) After March 11, 1983, each construction permit holder described 
in paragraph (f)(1) of this section may make a change to a previously 
accepted quality assurance program description included or referenced in 
the Safety Analysis Report, provided the change does not reduce the 
commitments in the program description previously accepted by the NRC. 
Changes to the quality assurance program description that do not reduce 
the commitments must be submitted to NRC within 90 days. Changes to the 
quality assurance program description that do reduce the commitments 
must be submitted to NRC and receive NRC approval before implementation,

accessible must be visually examined to detect grease leakage or grease 
cap deformations. Grease caps must be removed for this examination when 
there is evidence of grease cap deformation that indicates deterioration 
of anchorage hardware.
    (B) When evaluation of consecutive surveillances of prestressing 
forces for the same tendon or tendons in a group indicates a trend of 
prestress loss such that the tendon force(s) would be less than the 
minimum design prestress requirements before the next inspection 
interval, an evaluation shall be performed and reported in the 
Engineering

[[Page 689]]

Evaluation Report as prescribed in IWL-3300.
    (C) When the elongation corresponding to a specific load (adjusted 
for effective wires or strands) during retensioning of tendons differs 
by more than 10 percent from that recorded during the last measurement, 
an evaluation must be performed to determine whether the difference is 
related to wire failures or slip of wires in anchorages. A difference of 
more than 10 percent must be identified in the ISI Summary Report 
required by IWA-6000.
    (D) The licensee shall report the following conditions, if they 
occur, in the ISI Summary Report required by IWA-6000:

amount replaced exceeds 10 percent of the tendon net duct volume.
    (3) Grease leakage is detected during general visual examination of 
the containment surface.
    (E) For Class CC applications, the licensee shall evaluate the 
acceptability of inaccessible areas when conditions exist in accessible 
areas that could indicate the presence of or result in degradation to 
such inaccessible areas. For each inaccessible area identified, the 
licensee shall provide the following in the ISI Summary Report required 
by IWA-6000:
    (1) A description of the type and estimated extent of degradation, 
and the conditions that led to the degradation;
    (2) An evaluation of each area, and the result of the evaluation, 
and;
    (3) A description of necessary corrective actions.
    (x) Examination of metal containments and the liners of concrete 
containments. (A) For Class MC applications, the licensee shall evaluate 
the acceptability of inaccessible areas when conditions exist in 
accessible areas that could indicate the presence of or result in 
degradation to such inaccessible areas. For each inaccessible area 
identified, the licensee shall provide the following in the ISI Summary 
Report required by IWA-6000:
    (1) A description of the type and estimated extent of degradation, 
and the conditions that led to the degradation;
    (2) An evaluation of each area, and the result of the evaluation, 
and;
    (3) A description of necessary corrective actions.
    (B) When performing remotely the visual examinations required by 
Subsection IWE, the maximum direct examination distance specified in 
Table IWA-2210-1 may be extended and the minimum illumination 
requirements specified in Table IWA-2210-1 may be decreased provided 
that the conditions or indications for which the visual examination is 
performed can be detected at the chosen distance and illumination.
    (C) The examinations specified in Examination Category E-B, Pressure 
Retaining Welds, and Examination Category E-F, Pressure Retaining 
Dissimilar Metal Welds, are optional.
    (D) Section 50.55a(b)(2)(x)(D) may be used as an alternative to the 
requirements of IWE-2430.
    (1) If the examinations reveal flaws or areas of degradation 
exceeding the acceptance standards of Table IWE-3410-1, an evaluation 
shall be performed to determine whether additional component 
examinations are required. For each flaw or area of degradation 
identified which exceeds acceptance standards, the licensee shall 
provide the following in the ISI Summary Report required by IWA-6000:
    (i) A description of each flaw or area, including the extent of 
degradation, and the conditions that led to the degradation;
    (ii) The acceptability of each flaw or area, and the need for 
additional examinations to verify that similar degradation does not 
exist in similar components, and;
    (iii) A description of necessary corrective actions.
    (2) The number and type of additional examinations to ensure 
detection of similar degradation in similar components.

during that interval.
    (vi) The deferred augmented examination shall be performed in 
accordance with the related procedures specified in the section XI 
edition and addenda applicable to the inspection interval in which the 
augmented examination is performed.
    (4) The requirement for augmented examination of the reactor vessel 
may be satisfied by an examination of essentially 100 percent of the 
reactor vessel shell welds specified in Sec. 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(A)(2) that 
has been completed, or is scheduled for implementation with a written 
commitment, or is required by Sec. 50.55a(g)(4)(i), during the inservice 
inspection interval in effect on September 8, 1992.
    (5) Licensees that make a determination that they are unable to 
completely satisfy the requirements for the augmented reactor vessel 
shell weld examination specified in Sec. 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(A) shall 
submit information to the Commission to support the determination and 
shall propose an alternative to the examination requirements that would 
provide an acceptable level of quality and safety. The licensee may use 
the proposed alternative when authorized by the Director of the Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
    (B) Expedited examination of containment. (1) Licensees of all 
operating nuclear power plants shall implement the inservice 
examinations specified for the first period of the first inspection 
interval in Subsection IWE of the 1992 Edition with the 1992 Addenda in 
conjunction with the modifications specified in Sec. 50.55a (b)(2)(ix)

Sec. 50.58   Hearings and report of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards.

    (a) Each application for a construction permit or an operating 
license for a facility which is of a type described in Sec. 50.21(b) or 
Sec. 50.22, or for a testing facility, shall be referred to the Advisory 
Committee on Reactor Safeguards for a review and report. An application 
for an amendment to such a construction permit or operating license may 
be referred to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards for review 
and report. Any report shall be made part of the record of the 
application and available to the public, except to the extent that 
security classification prevents disclosure.
    (b)(1) The Commission will hold a hearing after at least 30-days' 
notice and publication once in the Federal Register on each application 
for a construction permit for a production or utilization facility which 
is of a type described in Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22, or for a testing 
facility.
    (2) When a construction permit has been issued for such a facility 
following the holding of a public hearing, and an application is made 
for an operating license or for an amendment to a construction permit or 
operating license, the Commission may hold a hearing after at least 30-
days' notice and publication once in the Federal Register, or, in the 
absence of a request therefor by any person whose interest may be 
affected, may issue an operating license or an amendment to a 
construction permit or operating license without a hearing, upon 30-
days' notice and publication once in the Federal Register of its intent 
to do so.
    (3) If the Commission finds, in an emergency situation, as defined 
in Sec. 50.91, that no significant hazards consideration is presented by 
an application for an amendment to an operating license, it may dispense 
with public notice and comment and may issue the amendment. If the 
Commission finds that exigent circumstances exist, as described in 
Sec. 50.91, it may reduce the period provided for public notice and 
comment.
    (4) Both in an emergency situation and in the case of exigent 
circumstances, the Commission will provide 30 days notice of opportunity 
for a hearing, though this notice may be published after issuance of the 
amendment if the Commission determines that no significant hazards 
consideration is involved.
    (5) The Commission will use the standards in Sec. 50.92 to determine 
whether a significant hazards consideration is presented by an amendment 
to an operating license for a facility of the type described in 
Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22, or which is a testing facility, and may 
make the amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency 
before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the 
holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined 
that no significant hazards consideration is involved.
    (6) No petition or other request for review of or hearing on the 
staff's significant hazards consideration determination will be 
entertained by the Commission. The staff's determination is final, 
subject only to the Commission's discretion, on its own initiative, to 
review the determination.

water nuclear power reactors, other than reactor facilities for which 
the certifications required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, 
must meet the fracture toughness and material surveillance program 
requirements for the reactor coolant pressure boundary set forth in 
appendices G and H to this part.

<R05>
Sec. 50.61  Fracture toughness requirements for protection against pressurized thermal shock events.

    (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) ASME Code means the American Society of Mechanical Engineers 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Division I, ``Rules for 
the Construction of Nuclear Power Plant Components,'' edition and 
addenda and any limitations and modifications thereof as specified in 
Sec. 50.55a.
    (2) Pressurized Thermal Shock Event means an event or transient in 
pressurized water reactors (PWRs) causing severe overcooling (thermal 
shock) concurrent with or followed by significant pressure in the 
reactor vessel.
    (3) Reactor Vessel Beltline means the region of the reactor vessel 
(shell material including welds, heat affected

[[Page 700]]

zones and plates or forgings) that directly surrounds the effective 
height of the active core and adjacent regions of the reactor vessel 
that are predicted to experience sufficient neutron radiation damage to 
be considered in the selection of the most limiting material with regard 
to radiation damage.
    (4) RT<INF>NDT means the reference temperature for a reactor vessel 
material, under any conditions. For the reactor vessel beltline 
materials, RT<INF>NDT must account for the effects of neutron radiation.
    (5) RT<INF>NDT(U) means the reference temperature for a reactor 
vessel material in the pre-service or unirradiated condition, evaluated 
according to the procedures in the ASME Code, Paragraph NB-2331 or other 
methods approved by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
    (6) EOL Fluence means the best-estimate neutron fluence projected 
for a specific vessel beltline material at the clad-base-metal interface 
on the inside surface of the vessel at the location where the material 
receives the highest fluence on the expiration date of the operating 
license.
    (7) RT<INF>PTS means the reference temperature, RT<INF>NDT, 
evaluated for the EOL Fluence for each of the vessel beltline materials, 
using the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (8) PTS Screening Criterion means the value of RT<INF>PTS for the 
vessel beltline material above which the plant cannot continue to 
operate without justification.
    (b) Requirements. (1) For each pressurized water nuclear power 
reactor for which an operating license has been issued, other than a 
nuclear power reactor facility for which the certifications required 
under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted, the licensee shall have 
projected values of RT<INF>PTS, accepted by the NRC, for each reactor 
vessel beltline material for the EOL fluence of the material. The 
assessment of RT<INF>PTS must use the calculation procedures given in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. The assessment must specify the bases 
for the projected value of RT<INF>PTS for each vessel beltline material, 
including the assumptions regarding core loading patterns, and must 
specify the copper and nickel contents and the fluence value used in the 
calculation for each beltline material. This assessment must be updated 
whenever there is a significant <SUP>2 change in projected values of 
RT<INF>PTS, or upon request for a change in the expiration date for 
operation of the facility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Changes to RT<INF>PTS values are considered significant if 
either the previous value or the current value, or both values, exceed 
the screening criterion prior to the expiration of the operating 
license, including any renewed term, if applicable for the plant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The pressurized thermal shock (PTS) screening criterion is 270 
deg.F for plates, forgings, and axial weld materials, and 300  deg.F for 
circumferential weld materials. For the purpose of comparison with this 
criterion, the value of RT<INF>PTS for the reactor vessel must be 
evaluated according to the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section, 
for each weld and plate, or forging, in the reactor vessel beltline. 
RT<INF>PTS must be determined for each vessel beltline material using 
the EOL fluence for that material.
    (3) For each pressurized water nuclear power reactor for which the 
value of RT<INF>PTS for any material in the beltline is projected to 
exceed the PTS screening criterion using the EOL fluence, the licensee 
shall implement those flux reduction programs that are reasonably 
practicable to avoid exceeding the PTS screening criterion set forth in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The schedule for implementation of 
flux reduction measures may take into account the schedule for submittal 
and anticipated approval by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation, of detailed plant-specific analyses, submitted to 
demonstrate acceptable risk with RT<INF>PTS above the screening limit 
due to plant modifications, new information or new analysis techniques.
    (4) For each pressurized water nuclear power reactor for which the 
analysis required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section indicates that no 
reasonably practicable flux reduction program will prevent RT<INF>PTS 
from exceeding the PTS screening criterion using the EOL fluence, the 
licensee shall submit a safety analysis to determine what, if

[[Page 701]]

any, modifications to equipment, systems, and operation are necessary to 
prevent potential failure of the reactor vessel as a result of 
postulated PTS events if continued operation beyond the screening 
criterion is allowed. In the analysis, the licensee may determine the 
properties of the reactor vessel materials based on available 
information, research results, and plant surveillance data, and may use 
probabilistic fracture mechanics techniques. This analysis must be 
submitted at least three years before RT<INF>PTS is projected to exceed 
the PTS screening criterion.
    (5) After consideration of the licensee's analyses, including 
effects of proposed corrective actions, if any, submitted in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, the Director, Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, may, on a case-by-case basis, approve 
operation of the facility with RT<INF>PTS in excess of the PTS screening 
criterion. The Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, will 
consider factors significantly affecting the potential for failure of 
the reactor vessel in reaching a decision.
    (6) If the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, 
concludes, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, that operation 
of the facility with RT<INF>PTS in excess of the PTS screening criterion 
cannot be approved on the basis of the licensee's analyses submitted in 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, the 
licensee shall request and receive approval by the Director, Office of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, prior to any operation beyond the criterion. 
The request must be based upon modifications to equipment, systems, and 
operation of the facility in addition to those previously proposed in 
the submitted analyses that would reduce the potential for failure of 
the reactor vessel due to PTS events, or upon further analyses based 
upon new information or improved methodology.
    (7) If the limiting RT<INF>PTS value of the plant is projected to 
exceed the screening criteria in paragraph (b)(2), or the criteria in 
paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(6) of this section cannot be satisfied, 
the reactor vessel beltline may be given a thermal annealing treatment 
to recover the fracture toughness of the material, subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 50.66. The reactor vessel may continue to be 
operated only for that service period within which the predicted 
fracture toughness of the vessel beltline materials satisfy the 
requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(6) of this section, with 
RT<INF>PTS accounting for the effects of annealing and subsequent 
irradiation.
    (c) Calculation of RT<INF>PTS. RT<INF>PTS must be calculated for 
each vessel beltline material using a fluence value, f, which is the EOL 
fluence for the material. RT<INF>PTS must be evaluated using the same 
procedures used to calculate RT<INF>NDT, as indicated in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, and as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) 
of this section.
    (1) Equation 1 must be used to calculate values of RT<INF>NDT for 
each weld and plate, or forging, in the reactor vessel beltline.

Equation 1: RT<INF>NDT=RT<INF>NDT(U)+M+<greek-D>RT<INF>NDT

    (i) If a measured value of RT<INF>NDT(U) is not available, a generic 
mean value for the class <SUP>3 of material may be used if there are 
sufficient test results to establish a mean and a standard deviation for 
the class.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The class of material for estimating RT<INF>NDT(U) is generally 
determined for welds by the type of welding flux (Linde 80, or other), 
and for base metal by the material specification.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) For generic values of weld metal, the following generic mean 
values must be used unless justification for different values is 
provided: 0 deg.F for welds made with Linde 80 flux, and -56 deg.F for 
welds made with Linde 0091, 1092 and 124 and ARCOS B-5 weld fluxes.
    (iii) M means the margin to be added to account for uncertainties in 
the values of RT<INF>NDT(U), copper and nickel contents, fluence and the 
calculational procedures. M is evaluated from Equation 2.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19DE95.003

    (A) In Equation 2, <greek-s><INF>U is the standard deviation for 
RT<INF>NDT(U). If a measured value of RT<INF>NDT(U) is used, then 
<greek-s><INF>U is determined from the precision of the test method. If 
a measured value of RT<INF>NDT(U) is not available and a generic mean

[[Page 702]]

value for that class of materials is used, then <greek-s><INF>U is the 
standard deviation obtained from the set of data used to establish the 
mean. If a generic mean value given in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this 
section for welds is used, then <greek-s><INF>U is 17 deg.F.
    (B) In Equation 2, <greek-s><greek-D> is the standard deviation for 
<greek-D>RT<INF>NDT. The value of <greek-s><greek-D> to be used is 
28 deg.F for welds and 17 deg.F for base metal; the value of 
<greek-s><greek-D> need not exceed one-half of <greek-D>RT<INF>NDT.
    (iv) <greek-D>RT<INF>NDT is the mean value of the transition 
temperature shift, or change in RT<INF>NDT, due to irradiation, and must 
be calculated using Equation 3.

Equation 3: <greek-D>RT<INF>NDT=(CF)f<SUP>(0.28-0.10 log f)

    (A) CF ( deg.F) is the chemistry factor, which is a function of 
copper and nickel content. CF is given in Table 1 for welds and in Table 
2 for base metal (plates and forgings). Linear interpolation is 
permitted. In Tables 1 and 2, ``Wt-% copper'' and ``Wt-% nickel'' are 
the best-estimate values for the material, which will normally be the 
mean of the measured values for a plate or forging. For a weld, the best 
estimate values will normally be the mean of the measured values for a 
weld deposit made using the same weld wire heat number as the critical 
vessel weld. If these values are not available, the upper limiting 
values given in the material specifications to which the vessel material 
was fabricated may be used. If not available, conservative estimates 
(mean plus one standard deviation) based on generic data <SUP>4 may be 
used if justification is provided. If none of these alternatives are 
available, 0.35% copper and 1.0% nickel must be assumed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Data from reactor vessels fabricated to the same material 
specification in the same shop as the vessel in question and in the same 
time period is an example of ``generic data.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) f is the best estimate neutron fluence, in units of 10<SUP>19 n/
cm<SUP>2 (E greater than 1 MeV), at the clad-base-metal interface on the 
inside surface of the vessel at the location where the material in 
question receives the highest fluence for the period of service in 
question. As specified in this paragraph, the EOL fluence for the vessel 
beltline material is used in calculating KRT<INF>PTS.
    (v) Equation 4 must be used for determining RT<INF>PTS using 
equation 3 with EOL fluence values for determining <greek-D>RT<INF>PTS.

Equation 4: RT<INF>PTS=RT<INF>NDT(U)+M+<greek-D>RT<INF>PTS

    (2) To verify that RT<INF>NDT for each vessel beltline material is a 
bounding value for the specific reactor vessel, licensees shall consider 
plant-specific information that could affect the level of embrittlement. 
This information includes but is not limited to the reactor vessel 
operating temperature and any related surveillance program <SUP>5 
results.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Surveillance program results means any data that demonstrates 
the embrittlement trends for the limiting beltline material, including 
but not limited to data from test reactors or from surveillance programs 
at other plants with or without surveillance program integrated per 10 
CFR Part 50, Appendix H.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Results from the plant-specific surveillance program must be 
integrated into the RT<INF>NDT estimate if the plant-specific 
surveillance data has been deemed credible as judged by the following 
criteria:
    (A) The materials in the surveillance capsules must be those which 
are the controlling materials with regard to radiation embrittlement.
    (B) Scatter in the plots of Charpy energy versus temperature for the 
irradiated and unirradiated conditions must be small enough to permit 
the determination of the 30-foot-pound temperature unambiguously.
    (C) Where there are two or more sets of surveillance data from one 
reactor, the scatter of <greek-D>RT<INF>NDT values must be less than 
28 deg.F for welds and 17 deg.F for base metal. Even if the range in the 
capsule fluences is large (two or more orders of magnitude), the scatter 
may not exceed twice those values.
    (D) The irradiation temperature of the Charpy specimens in the 
capsule must equal the vessel wall temperature at the cladding/base 
metal interface within <plus-minus>25 deg.F.
    (E) The surveillance data for the correlation monitor material in 
the capsule, if present, must fall within the scatter band of the data 
base for the material.

[[Page 703]]

    (ii)(A) Surveillance data deemed credible according to the criteria 
of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section must be used to determine a 
material-specific value of CF for use in Equation 3. A material-specific 
value of CF is determined from Equation 5.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19DE95.004

    (B) In Equation 5, ``n'' is the number of surveillance data points, 
``A<INF>i'' is the measured value of <greek-D>RT<INF>NDT and ``f<INF>i'' 
is the fluence for each surveillance data point. If there is clear 
evidence that the copper and nickel content of the surveillance weld 
differs from the vessel weld, i.e. differs from the average for the weld 
wire heat number associated with the vessel weld and the surveillance 
weld, the measured values of <greek-D>RT<INF>NDT must be adjusted for 
differences in copper and nickel content by multiplying them by the 
ratio of the chemistry factor for the vessel material to that for the 
surveillance weld.
    (iii) For cases in which the results from a credible plant-specific 
surveillance program are used, the value of <greek-s><greek-D> to be 
used is 14 deg.F for welds and 8.5 deg.F for base metal; the value of 
<greek-s><greek-D> need not exceed one-half of DRT<INF>NDT.
    (iv) The use of results from the plant-specific surveillance program 
may result in an RT<INF>NDT that is higher or lower than those 
determined in paragraph (c)(1).
    (3) Any information that is believed to improve the accuracy of the 
RT<INF>PTS value significantly must be reported to the Director, Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. Any value of RT<INF>PTS that has been 
modified using the procedures of paragraph (c)(2) of this section is 
subject to the approval of the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation, when used as provided in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 50.62  Requirements for reduction of risk from anticipated transients without scram (ATWS) events for light-water-cooled nuclear power plants.

     (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all 
commercial light-water-cooled nuclear power plants, other than nuclear 
power reactor facilities for which the certifications required under 
Sec. 50.82(a)(1) have been submitted.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section, Anticipated Transient 
Without Scram (ATWS) means an anticipated operational occurrence as 
defined in appendix A of this part followed by the failure of the 
reactor trip portion of the protection system specified in General 
Design Criterion 20 of appendix A of this part.
    (c) Requirements. (1) Each pressurized water reactor must have 
equipment from sensor output to final actuation device, that is diverse 
from the reactor trip system, to automatically initiate the auxiliary 
(or emergency) feedwater system and initiate a turbine trip under 
conditions indicative of an ATWS. This equipment must be designed to 
perform its function in a reliable manner and be independent (from 
sensor output to the final actuation device) from the existing reactor 
trip system.
    (2) Each pressurized water reactor manufactured by Combustion 
Engineering or by Babcock and Wilcox must have a diverse scram system 
from the sensor output to interruption of power to the control rods. 
This scram system must be designed to perform its function in a reliable 
manner and be independent from the existing reactor trip system (from 
sensor output to interruption of power to the control rods).
    (3) Each boiling water reactor must have an alternate rod injection 
(ARI) system that is diverse (from the reactor trip system) from sensor 
output to the final actuation device. The ARI system must have redundant 
scram air header exhaust valves. The ARI must be designed to perform its 
function in a reliable manner and be independent (from the existing 
reactor trip system) from sensor output to the final actuation device.
    (4) Each boiling water reactor must have a standby liquid control 
system (SLCS) with the capability of injecting into the reactor pressure 
vessel a borated water solution at such a flow rate, level of boron 
concentration and boron-10 isotope enrichment, and accounting for 
reactor pressure vessel volume, that the resulting reactivity control is 
at least equivalent to that resulting from injection of 86 gallons per 
minute of 13 weight percent sodium pentaborate decahydrate solution at 
the natural boron-10 isotope abundance into a 251-inch inside diameter 
reactor pressure vessel for a given core design. The SLCS and its 
injection location must be designed to perform its function in a 
reliable manner. The SLCS initiation must be automatic and must be 
designed to perform its function in a reliable manner for plants granted 
a construction permit after July 26, 1984, and for plants granted a 
construction permit prior to July 26, 1984, that have already been 
designed and built to include this feature.
    (5) Each boiling water reactor must have equipment to trip the 
reactor coolant recirculating pumps automatically under conditions 
indicative of an ATWS. This equipment must be designed to perform its 
function in a reliable manner.
    (6) Information sufficient to demonstrate to the Commission the 
adequacy of items in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section 
shall be submitted to the Commission as specified in Sec. 50.4.
    (d) Implementation. By 180 days after the issuance of the QA 
guidance for non-safety related components, each licensee shall develop 
and submit to the Commission, as specified in Sec. 50.4, a proposed 
schedule for meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(c)(5) of this section. Each shall include an explanation of the 
schedule along with a justification if the schedule calls for final 
implementation later than the second refueling outage after July 26, 
1984, or the date of issuance of a license authorizing operation above 5 
percent of full power. A final schedule shall then be mutually

agreed upon by the Commission and licensee.

[49 FR 26044, June 26, 1984; 49 FR 27736, July 6, 1984, as amended at 51 
FR 40310, Nov. 6, 1986; 54 FR 13362, Apr. 3, 1989; 61 FR 39301, July 29, 
1996]

Sec. 50.63  Loss of all alternating current power.

    (a) Requirements. (1) Each light-water-cooled nuclear power plant 
licensed to operate must be able to withstand for a specified duration 
and recover from a station blackout as defined in Sec. 50.2. The 
specified station blackout duration shall be based on the following 
factors:
    (i) The redundancy of the onsite emergency ac power sources;
    (ii) The reliability of the onsite emergency ac power sources;
    (iii) The expected frequency of loss of offsite power; and
    (iv) The probable time needed to restore offsite power.
    (2) The reactor core and associated coolant, control, and protection 
systems, including station batteries and any other necessary support 
systems, must provide sufficient capacity and capability to ensure that 
the core is cooled and appropriate containment integrity is maintained 
in the event of a station blackout for the specified duration. The 
capability for coping with a station blackout of specified duration 
shall be determined by an appropriate coping analysis. Utilities are 
expected to have the baseline assumptions, analyses, and related 
information used in their coping evaluations available for NRC review.
    (b) Limitation of scope. Paragraph (c) of this section does not 
apply to those plants licensed to operate prior to July 21, 1988, if the 
capability to withstand station blackout was specifically addressed in 
the operating license proceeding and was explicitly approved by the NRC.
    (c) Implementation--(1) Information Submittal. For each light-water-
cooled nuclear power plant licensed to operate on or before July 21, 
1988, the licensee shall submit the information defined below to the 
Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation by April 17, 1989. 
For each light-water-cooled nuclear power plant licensed to operate 
after the effective date of this amendment, the licensee shall submit 
the information defined below to the Director by 270 days after the date 
of license issuance.
    (i) A proposed station blackout duration to be used in determining 
compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, including a justification 
for the selection based on the four factors identified in paragraph (a) 
of this section;
    (ii) A description of the procedures that will be implemented for 
station blackout events for the duration determined in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section and for recovery therefrom; and
    (iii) A list of modifications to equipment and associated 
procedures, if any, necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section, for the specified station blackout duration determined 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and a proposed schedule for 
implementing the stated modifications.
    (2) Alternate ac source: The alternate ac power source(s), as 
defined in Sec. 50.2, will constitute acceptable capability to withstand 
station blackout provided an analysis is performed which demonstrates 
that the plant has this capability from onset of the station blackout 
until the alternate ac source(s) and required shutdown equipment are 
started and lined up to operate. The time required for startup and 
alignment of the alternate ac power source(s) and this equipment shall 
be demonstrated by test. Alternate ac source(s) serving a multiple unit 
site where onsite emergency ac sources are not shared between units must 
have, as a minimum, the capacity and capability for coping with a 
station blackout in any of the units. At sites where onsite emergency ac 
sources are shared between units, the alternate ac source(s) must have 
the capacity and capability as required to ensure that all units can be 
brought to and maintained in safe shutdown (non-DBA) as defined in 
Sec. 50.2. If the alternate ac source(s) meets the above requirements 
and can be demonstrated by test to be available to power the shutdown 
buses within 10 minutes of the onset of station blackout, then no coping 
analysis is required.

    (3) Regulatory Assessment: After consideration of the information 
submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, will notify the licensee 
of the Director's conclusions regarding the adequacy of the proposed 
specified station blackout duration, the proposed equipment 
modifications and procedures, and the proposed schedule for implementing 
the procedures and modifications for compliance with paragraph (a) this 
section.
    (4) Implementation Schedule: For each light-water-cooled nuclear 
power plant licensed to operate on or before June 21, 1988, the licensee 
shall, within 30 days of the notification provided in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, submit to the Director of the Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation a schedule commitment for implementing any 
equipment and associated procedure modifications necessary to meet the

include an explanation of the schedule and a justification if the 
schedule does not provide for completion of the modifications within two 
years of the notification provided in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section. A final schedule for implementing modifications 
necessary to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section will be established by the NRC staff in consultation and 
coordination with the affected licensee.

Sec. 50.64  Limitations on the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in domestic non-power reactors.

    (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all 
non-power reactors.
    (b) Requirements. (1) The Commission will not issue a construction 
permit after March 27, 1986 for a non-power reactor where the applicant 
proposes to use highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel, unless the applicant 
demonstrates that the proposed reactor will have a unique purpose as 
defined in Sec. 50.2.
    (2) Unless the Commission has determined, based on a request 
submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that the 
non-power reactor has a unique purpose, each licensee authorized to 
possess and use HEU fuel in connection with the reactor's operation 
shall:
    (i) Not initiate acquisition of additional HEU fuel, if low enriched 
uranium (LEU) fuel acceptable to the Commission for that reactor is 
available when it proposes that acquisition; and
    (ii) Replace all HEU fuel in its possession with available LEU fuel 
acceptable to the Commission for that reactor, in accordance with a 
schedule determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (3) If not required by paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section to 
use LEU fuel, the applicant or licensee must use HEU fuel of enrichment 
as close to 20% as is available and acceptable to the Commisson.
    (c) Implementation. (1) Any request by a licensee for a 
determination that a non-power reactor has a unique purpose as defined 
in Sec. 50.2 should be submitted with supporting documentation to the 
Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, by September 29, 1986.
    (2) (i) By March 27, 1987 and at 12-month intervals thereafter, each 
licensee of a non-power reactor authorized to possess and use HEU fuel 
shall develop and submit to the Director of the Office of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation a written proposal for meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section. The licensee shall include in 
the proposal a certification that Federal Government funding for 
conversion is available through the Department of Energy (DOE) or other 
appropriate Federal Agency. The licensee shall also include in the 
proposal a schedule for conversion, based upon availability of 
replacement fuel acceptable to the Commisson for that reactor and upon 
consideration of other factors such as the availability of shipping 
casks, implementation of arrangements for the available financial 
support, and reactor usage.
    (ii) If Federal Government funding for conversion cannot be 
certified, the proposal's contents may be limited to a statement of this 
fact. If a statement

[[Page 708]]

of non-availability of Federal Government funding for conversion is 
submitted by a licensee, then it shall be required to resubmit a 
proposal for meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of 
this section at 12-month intervals.
    (iii) The proposal shall include, to the extent required to effect 
the conversion, all necessary changes in the license, facility, or 
procedures. Supporting safety analyses should be provided so as to meet 
the schedule established for conversion. As long as Federal Government 
funding for conversion is not available, the resubmittal may be a 
reiteration of the original proposal. The Director of the Office of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation shall review the proposal and confirm the 
status of Federal Government funding for conversion and, if a schedule 
for conversion has been submitted by the licensee, will then determine a 
final schedule.
    (3) After review of the safety analysis required by paragraph 
(c)(2), the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will 
issue an appropriate enforcement order directing both the conversion 
and, to the extent consistent with protection of the public health and 
safety, any necessary changes to the license, facility, or procedures.

Sec. 50.65   Requirements for monitoring the effectiveness of maintenance at nuclear power plants.

    (a)(1) Each holder of a license to operate a nuclear power plant 
under Secs. 50.21(b) or 50.22 shall monitor the performance or condition 
of structures, systems, or components, against licensee-established 
goals, in a manner sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that such 
structures, systems, and components, as defined in paragraph (b), are 
capable of fulfilling their intended functions. Such goals shall be 
established commensurate with safety and, where practical, take into 
account industry-wide operating experience. When the performance or 
condition of a structure, system, or component does not meet established 
goals, appropriate corrective action shall be taken. For a nuclear power 
plant for which the licensee has submitted the certifications specified 
in Sec. 50.82(a)(1), this section only shall apply to the extent that 
the licensee shall monitor the performance or condition of all 
structures, systems, or components associated with the storage, control, 
and maintenance of spent fuel in a safe condition, in a manner 
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that such structures, 
systems, and components are capable of fulfilling their intended 
functions.
    (2) Monitoring as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
not required where it has been demonstrated that the performance or 
condition of a structure, system, or component is being effectively 
controlled through the performance of appropriate preventive 
maintenance, such that the structure, system, or component remains 
capable of performing its intended function.
    (3) Performance and condition monitoring activities and associated 
goals and preventive maintenance activities shall be evaluated at least 
every refueling cycle provided the interval between evaluations does not 
exceed 24 months. The evaluations shall be conducted taking into 
account, where practical, industry-wide operating experience. 
Adjustments shall be made where necessary to ensure that the objective 
of preventative failures of structures, systems, and components through 
maintenance is appropriately balanced against the objective of 
minimizing unavailability of structures, systems, and components due to 
monitoring or preventative maintenance. In performing monitoring and 
preventative maintenance activities, an assessment of the total plant 
equipment that is out of service should be taken into account to 
determine the overall effect on performance of safety functions.
    (b) The scope of the monitoring program specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall include safety related and nonsafety 
related structures, systems, and components, as follows:
    (1) Safety related structures, systems, or components that are 
relied upon to remain functional during and following design basis 
events to ensure the integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, 
the capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe 
shutdown condition, and the

capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents that 
could result in potential offsite exposure comparable to the guidelines 
in Sec. 50.34(a)(1) or Sec. 100.11 of this chapter, as applicable.
    (2) Nonsafety related structures, systems, or components:
    (i) That are relied upon to mitigate accidents or transients or are 
used in plant emergency operating procedures (EOPs); or
    (ii) Whose failure could prevent safety-related structures, systems, 
and components from fulfilling their safety-related function; or
    (iii) Whose failure could cause a reactor scram or actuation of a 
safety-related system.
    (c) The requirements of this section shall be implemented by each 
licensee no later than July 10, 1996.

<R05>
Sec. 50.66  Requirements for thermal annealing of the reactor pressure vessel.

    (a) For those light water nuclear power reactors where neutron 
radiation has reduced the fracture toughness of the reactor vessel 
materials, a thermal annealing may be applied to the reactor vessel to 
recover the fracture toughness of the material. The use of a thermal 
annealing treatment is subject to the requirements in this section. A 
report describing the licensee's plan for conducting the thermal 
annealing must be submitted in accordance with Sec. 50.4 at least three 
years prior to the date at which the limiting fracture toughness 
criteria in Sec. 50.61 or appendix G to part 50 would be exceeded. 
Within three years of the submittal of the Thermal Annealing Report and 
at least thirty days prior to the start of the thermal annealing, the 
NRC will review the Thermal Annealing Report and place the results of 
its evaluation in its Public Document Room. The licensee may begin the 
thermal anneal after:
    (1) Submitting the Thermal Annealing Report required by paragraph 
(b) of this section;
    (2) The NRC places the results of its evaluation of the Thermal 
Annealing Report in the Public Document Room; and
    (3) The requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section have been 
satisfied.
    (b) Thermal Annealing Report. The Thermal Annealing Report must 
include: a Thermal Annealing Operating Plan; a Requalification 
Inspection and Test Program; a Fracture Toughness Recovery and 
Reembrittlement Trend Assurance Program; and Identification of 
Unreviewed Safety Questions and Technical Specification Changes.
    (1) Thermal Annealing Operating Plan.
    The thermal annealing operating plan must include:
    (i) A detailed description of the pressure vessel and all structures 
and components that are expected to experience significant thermal or 
stress effects during the thermal annealing operation;
    (ii) An evaluation of the effects of mechanical and thermal stresses 
and temperatures on the vessel, containment, biological shield, attached 
piping and appurtenances, and adjacent equipment and components to 
demonstrate that operability of the reactor

[[Page 710]]

will not be detrimentally affected. This evaluation must include:
    (A) Detailed thermal and structural analyses to establish the time 
and temperature profile of the annealing operation. These analyses must 
include heatup and cooldown rates, and must demonstrate that localized 
temperatures, thermal stress gradients, and subsequent residual stresses 
will not result in unacceptable dimensional changes or distortions in 
the vessel, attached piping and appurtenances, and that the thermal 
annealing cycle will not result in unacceptable degradation of the 
fatigue life of these components.
    (B) The effects of localized high temperatures on degradation of the 
concrete adjacent to the vessel and changes in thermal and mechanical 
properties, if any, of the reactor vessel insulation, and on detrimental 
effects, if any, on containment and the biological shield. If the design 
temperature limitations for the adjacent concrete structure are to be 
exceeded during the thermal annealing operation, an acceptable maximum 
temperature for the concrete must be established for the annealing 
operation using appropriate test data.
    (iii) The methods, including heat source, instrumentation and 
procedures proposed for performing the thermal annealing. This shall 
include any special precautions necessary to minimize occupational 
exposure, in accordance with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) 
principle and the provisions of Sec. 20.1206.
    (iv) The proposed thermal annealing operating parameters, including 
bounding conditions for temperatures and times, and heatup and cooldown 
schedules.
    (A) The thermal annealing time and temperature parameters selected 
must be based on projecting sufficient recovery of fracture toughness, 
using the procedures of paragraph (e) of this section, to satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. 50.60 and Sec. 50.61 for the proposed period of 
operation addressed in the application.
    (B) The time and temperature parameters evaluated as part of the 
thermal annealing operating plan, and supported by the evaluation 
results of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, represent the bounding 
times and temperatures for the thermal annealing operation. If these 
bounding conditions for times and temperatures are violated during the 
thermal annealing operation, then the annealing operation is considered 
not in accordance with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan, as required 
by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the licensee must comply with 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Requalification Inspection and Test Program. The inspection and 
test program to requalify the annealed reactor vessel must include the 
detailed monitoring, inspections, and tests proposed to demonstrate that 
the limitations on temperatures, times and temperature profiles, and 
stresses evaluated for the proposed thermal annealing conditions of 
paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section have not been exceeded, and to 
determine the thermal annealing time and temperature to be used in 
quantifying the fracture toughness recovery. The requalification 
inspection and test program must demonstrate that the thermal annealing 
operation has not degraded the reactor vessel, attached piping or 
appurtenances, or the adjacent concrete structures to a degree that 
could affect the safe operation of the reactor.
    (3) Fracture Toughness Recovery and Reembrittlement Trend Assurance 
Program. The percent recovery of RT<INF>NDT and Charpy upper-shelf 
energy due to the thermal annealing treatment must be determined based 
on the time and temperature of the actual vessel thermal anneal. The 
recovery of RT<INF>NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy provide the basis 
for establishing the post-anneal RT<INF>NDT and Charpy upper-shelf 
energy for each vessel material. Changes in the RT<INF>NDT and Charpy 
upper-shelf energy with subsequent plant operation must be determined 
using the post-anneal values of these parameters in conjunction with the 
projected reembrittlement trend determined in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. Recovery and reembrittlement evaluations 
shall include:
    (i) Recovery Evaluations. (A) The percent recovery of both 
RT<INF>NDT and

[[Page 711]]

Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined by one of the procedures 
described in paragraph (e) of this section, using the proposed lower 
bound thermal annealing time and temperature conditions described in the 
operating plan.
    (B) If the percent recovery is determined from testing surveillance 
specimens or from testing materials removed from the reactor vessel, 
then it shall be demonstrated that the proposed thermal annealing 
parameters used in the test program are equal to or bounded by those 
used in the vessel annealing operation.
    (C) If generic computational methods are used, appropriate 
justification must be submitted as a part of the application.
    (ii) Reembrittlement Evaluations. (A) The projected post-anneal 
reembrittlement of RT<INF>NDT must be calculated using the procedures in 
Sec. 50.61(c), or must be determined using the same basis as that used 
for the pre-anneal operating period. The projected change due to post-
anneal reembrittlement for Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined 
using the same basis as that used for the pre-anneal operating period.
    (B) The post-anneal reembrittlement trend of both RT<INF>NDT and 
Charpy upper-shelf energy must be estimated, and must be monitored using 
a surveillance program defined in the Thermal Annealing Report and which 
conforms to the intent of Appendix H of this part, ``Reactor Vessel 
Material Surveillance Program Requirements.''
    (4) Identification of Unreviewed Safety Questions and Technical 
Specification Changes. Any changes to the facility as described in the 
updated final safety analysis report constituting unreviewed safety 
questions, and any changes to the technical specifications, which are 
necessary to either conduct the thermal annealing or operate the nuclear 
power reactor following the annealing, must be identified. The section 
shall demonstrate that the Commission's requirements continue to be 
complied with, and that there is reasonable assurance of adequate 
protection to the public health and safety following the changes.
    (c) Completion or Termination of Thermal Annealing. (1) If the 
thermal annealing was completed in accordance with the Thermal Annealing 
Operating Plan and the Requalification Inspection and Test Program, the 
licensee shall so confirm in writing to the Director, Office of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation. The licensee may restart its reactor after the 
requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have been met.
    (2) If the thermal annealing was completed but the annealing was not 
performed in accordance with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and 
the Requalification Inspection and Test Program, the licensee shall 
submit a summary of lack of compliance with the Thermal Annealing 
Operating Plan and the Requalification Inspection and Test Program and a 
justification for subsequent operation to the Director, Office of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation. Any changes to the facility as described in 
the updated final safety analysis report which are attributable to the 
noncompliances and constitute unreviewed safety questions, and any 
changes to the technical specifications which are required as a result 
of the noncompliances, shall also be identified.
    (i) If no unreviewed safety questions or changes to technical 
specifications are identified, the licensee may restart its reactor 
after the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have been 
met.
    (ii) If any unreviewed safety questions or changes to technical 
specifications are identified, the licensee may not restart its reactor 
until approval is obtained from the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation and the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have 
been met.
    (3) If the thermal annealing was terminated prior to completion, the 
licensee shall immediately notify the NRC of the premature termination 
of the thermal anneal.
    (i) If the partial annealing was otherwise performed in accordance 
with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant portions of the 
Requalification Inspection and Test Program, and the licensee does not 
elect to take credit for any recovery, the licensee

[[Page 712]]

need not submit the Thermal Annealing Results Report required by 
paragraph (d) of this section but instead shall confirm in writing to 
the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation that the partial 
annealing was otherwise performed in accordance with the Thermal 
Annealing Operating Plan and relevant portions of the Requalification 
Inspection and Test Program. The licensee may restart its reactor after 
the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have been met.
    (ii) If the partial annealing was otherwise performed in accordance 
with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant portions of the 
Requalification Inspection and Test Program, and the licensee elects to 
take full or partial credit for the partial annealing, the licensee 
shall confirm in writing to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation that the partial annealing was otherwise performed in 
compliance with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant 
portions of the Requalification Inspection and Test Program. The 
licensee may restart its reactor after the requirements of paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section have been met.
    (iii) If the partial annealing was not performed in accordance with 
the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant portions of the 
Requalification Inspection and Test Program, the licensee shall submit a 
summary of lack of compliance with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan 
and the Requalification Inspection and Test Program and a justification 
for subsequent operation to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation. Any changes to the facility as described in the updated 
final safety analysis report which are attributable to the 
noncompliances and constitute unreviewed safety questions, and any 
changes to the technical specifications which are required as a result 
of the noncompliances, shall also be identified.
    (A) If no unreviewed safety questions or changes to technical 
specifications are identified, the licensee may restart its reactor 
after the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have been 
met.
    (B) If any unreviewed safety questions or changes to technical 
specifications are identified, the licensee may not restart its reactor 
until approval is obtained from the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation and the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have 
been met.
    (d) Thermal Annealing Results Report. Every licensee that either 
completes a thermal annealing, or that terminates an annealing but 
elects to take full or partial credit for the annealing, shall provide 
the following information within three months of completing the thermal 
anneal, unless an extension is authorized by the Director, Office of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation:
    (1) The time and temperature profiles of the actual thermal 
annealing;
    (2) The post-anneal RT<INF>NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy values 
of the reactor vessel materials for use in subsequent reactor operation;
    (3) The projected post-anneal reembrittlement trends for both 
RT<INF>NDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy; and
    (4) The projected values of RT<INF>PTS and Charpy upper-shelf energy 
at the end of the proposed period of operation addressed in the Thermal 
Annealing Report.
    (e) Procedures for Determining the Recovery of Fracture Toughness. 
The procedures of this paragraph must be used to determine the percent 
recovery of <greek-D>RT<INF>NDT, R<INF>t, and percent recovery of Charpy 
upper-shelf energy, R<INF>u. In all cases, R<INF>t and R<INF>u may not 
exceed 100.
    (1) For those reactors with surveillance programs which have 
developed credible surveillance data as defined in Sec. 50.61, percent 
recovery due to thermal annealing (R<INF>t and R<INF>u) must be 
evaluated by testing surveillance specimens that have been withdrawn 
from the surveillance program and that have been annealed under the same 
time and temperature conditions as those given the beltline material.
    (2) Alternatively, the percent recovery due to thermal annealing 
(R<INF>t and R<INF>u) may be determined from the results

[[Page 713]]

of a verification test program employing materials removed from the 
beltline region of the reactor vessel <SUP>6 and that have been annealed 
under the same time and temperature conditions as those given the 
beltline material.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ For those cases where materials are removed from the beltline of 
the pressure vessel, the stress limits of the applicable portions of the 
ASME Code Section III must be satisfied, including consideration of 
fatigue and corrosion, regardless of the Code of record for the vessel 
design.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Generic computational methods may be used to determine recovery 
if adequate justification is provided.
    (f) Public information and participation. (1) Upon receipt of a 
Thermal Annealing Report, and a minimum of 30 days before the licensee 
starts thermal annealing, the Commission shall:
    (i) Notify and solicit comments from local and State governments in 
the vicinity of the site where the thermal annealing will take place and 
any Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or 
statutory rights that could be affected by the thermal annealing,
    (ii) Publish a notice of a public meeting in the Federal Register 
and in a forum, such as local newspapers, which is readily accessible to 
individuals in the vicinity of the site, to solicit comments from the 
public, and
    (iii) Hold a public meeting on the licensee's Thermal Annealing 
Report.
    (2) Within 15 days after the NRC's receipt of the licensee 
submissions required by paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3)(i)-(iii) of 
this section, the NRC staff shall place in the NRC Public Document Room 
a summary of its inspection of the licensee's thermal annealing, and the 
Commission shall hold a public meeting:
    (i) For the licensee to explain to NRC and the public the results of 
the reactor pressure vessel annealing,
    (ii) for the NRC to discuss its inspection of the reactor vessel 
annealing, and
    (iii) for the NRC to receive public comments on the annealing.
    (3) Within 45 days of NRC's receipt of the licensee submissions 
required by paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3)(i)-(iii) of this 
section, the NRC staff shall complete full documentation of its 
inspection of the licensee's annealing process and place this 
documentation in the NRC Public Document Room.

less than the amount stated in the table in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, adjusted annually using a rate at least equal to that stated in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, by one or more of the methods 
described in paragraph (e) of this section as acceptable to the 
Commission. The amount stated in the applicant's or licensee's 
certification may be based on a cost estimate for decommissioning the 
facility. As part of the certification, a copy of the financial 
instrument obtained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of this 
section is to be submitted to NRC.
    (c) Table of minimum amounts (January 1986 dollars) required to 
demonstrate reasonable assurance of funds for decommissioning by reactor 
type and power level, P (in MWt); adjustment factor.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Amounts are based on activities related to the definition of 
``Decommission'' in Sec. 50.2 of this part and do not include the cost 
of removal and disposal of spent fuel or of nonradioactive structures 
and materials beyond that necessary to terminate the license.

                                                                        
                                                            Millions    
                                                                        
(1)(i) For a PWR:                                                       
  greater than or equal to 3400 MWt...................              $105
  between 1200 MWt and 3400 MWt (For a PWR of less                      
   than 1200 MWt, use P=1200 MWt).....................     $(75+0.0088P)
(ii) For a BWR:                                                         
  greater than or equal to 3400 MWt...................              $135
  between 1200 MWt and 3400 MWt (For a BWR of less                      
   than 1200 MWt, use P=1200 MWt).....................     $(104+0.009P)
                                                                        

    (2) An adjustment factor at least equal to 0.65 L + 0.13 E + 0.22 B 
is to be used where L and E are escalation factors for labor and energy, 
respectively, and are to be taken from regional data of U.S. Department 
of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics and B is an escalation factor for 
waste burial and is to be taken from NRC report NUREG-1307, ``Report on 
Waste Burial Charges.''
    (d) Each non-electric utility applicant for or holder of an 
operating license for a production or utilization facility shall submit 
a decommissioning report as required by Sec. 50.33(k) of this part 
containing a cost estimate for decommissioning the facility, an 
indication of which method or methods described in paragraph (e) of this 
section as acceptable to the Commission will be used to provide funds 
for decommissioning, and a description of the means of adjusting the 
cost estimate and associated funding level periodically over the life of 
the facility.
    (e)(1) As provided in paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section, 
financial assurance is to be provided by the following methods:
    (i) Prepayment. Prepayment is the deposit prior to the start of 
operation into an account segregated from licensee assets and outside 
the licensee's administrative control of cash or liquid assets such that 
the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay decommissioning costs. 
Prepayment may be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government 
fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government securities.
    (ii) External sinking fund. An external sinking fund is a fund 
established and maintained by setting funds aside periodically in an 
account segregated from licensee assets and outside the licensee's 
administrative control in which the total amount of funds would be 
sufficient to pay decommissioning costs at the time termination of 
operation is expected. An external sinking fund may be in the form of a 
trust, escrow account, government fund, certificate of deposit, or 
deposit of government securities.
    (iii) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These 
methods guarantee that decommissioning costs will be paid. A surety 
method may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of 
credit. Any surety method or insurance used to provide financial 
assurance for decommissioning must contain the following conditions:
    (A) The surety method or insurance must be open-ended or, if written 
for a specified term, such as five years, must be renewed automatically 
unless 90 days or more prior to the renewal date, the issuer notifies 
the Commission, the beneficiary, and the licensee of its intention not 
to renew. The surety or insurance must also provide that the full face 
amount be paid to the beneficiary

[[Page 722]]

automatically prior to the expiration without proof of forfeiture if the 
licensee fails to provide a replacement acceptable to the Commission 
within 30 days after receipt of notification of cancellation.
    (B) The surety or insurance must be payable to a trust established 
for decommissioning costs. The trustee and trust must be acceptable to 
the Commission. An acceptable trustee includes an appropriate State or 
Federal government agency or an entity which has the authority to act as 
a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a 
Federal or State agency.
    (C) The surety method or insurance must remain in effect until the 
Commission has terminated the license.
    (2) For a licensee other than an electric utility, acceptable 
methods of providing financial assurance for decommissioning are--
    (i) Prepayment;
    (ii) An external sinking fund, in which deposits are made at least 
annually, coupled with a surety method or insurance, the value of which 
may decrease by the amount being accumulated in the sinking fund,
    (iii) A surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. A 
parent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs based on a 
financial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as contained in 
appendix A of 10 CFR part 30. A parent company guarantee may not be used 
in combination with other financial methods to satisfy the requirements 
of this section. A guarantee of funds by the applicant or licensee for 
decommissioning costs based on a financial test may be used if the 
guarantee and test are as contained in appendix C of 10 CFR part 30. A 
guarantee by the applicant or the licensee may not be used in 
combination with any other financial methods to satisfy the requirements 
of this section or in any situation where the applicant or licensee has 
a parent company holding majority control of the voting stock of the 
company.
    (iv) In the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, a 
statement of intent containing a cost estimate for decommissioning, and 
indicating that funds for decommissioning will be obtained when 
necessary.
    (3) For an electric utility, acceptable methods of providing 
financial assurance for decommissioning are--
    (i) Prepayment;
    (ii) An external sinking fund in which deposits are made at least 
annually:
    (iii) A surety method or insurance; and
    (iv) In the case of Federal government licensees, a statement of 
intent containing a cost estimate for decommissioning or an amount based 
on paragraph (c) of this section, and indicating that funds for 
decommissioning will be obtained when necessary.
    (f)(1) Each power reactor licensee shall at or about 5 years prior 
to the projected end of operations submit a preliminary decommissioning 
cost estimate which includes an up-to-date assessment of the major 
factors that could affect the cost to decommission.
    (2) Each non-power reactor licensee shall at or about 2 years prior 
to the projected end of operations submit a preliminary decommissioning 
plan containing a cost estimate for decommissioning and an up-to-date 
assessment of the major factors that could affect planning for 
decommissioning. Factors to be considered in submitting this preliminary 
plan information include--
    (i) The decommissioning alternative anticipated to be used. The 
requirements of Sec. 50.82(b)(4)(i) must be considered at this time;
    (ii) Major technical actions necessary to carry out decommissioning 
safely;
    (iii) The current situation with regard to disposal of high-level 
and low-level radioactive waste;
    (iv) Residual radioactivity criteria;
    (v) Other site specific factors which could affect decommissioning 
planning and cost.
    (3) If necessary, the cost estimate, for power and non-power 
reactors, shall also include plans for adjusting levels of funds assured 
for decommissioning to demonstrate that a reasonable level of assurance 
will be provided that funds will be available when needed to cover the 
cost of decommissioning.
    (g) Each licensee shall keep records of information important to the 
safe and effective decommissioning of the facility in an identified 
location until

[[Page 723]]

the license is terminated by the Commission. If records of relevant 
information are kept for other purposes, reference to these records and 
their locations may be used. Information the Commission considers 
important to decommissioning consists of--
    (1) Records of spills or other unusual occurrences involving the 
spread of contamination in and around the facility, equipment, or site. 
These records may be limited to instances when significant contamination 
remains after any cleanup procedures or when there is reasonable 
likelihood that contaminants may have spread to inaccessible areas as in 
the case of possible seepage into porous materials such as concrete. 
These records must include any known information on identification of 
involved nuclides, quantities, forms, and concentrations.
    (2) As-built drawings and modifications of structures and equipment 
in restricted areas where radioactive materials are used and/or stored 
and of locations of possible inaccessible contamination such as buried 
pipes which may be subject to contamination. If required drawings are 
referenced, each relevant document need not be indexed individually. If 
drawings are not available, the licensee shall substitute appropriate 
records of available information concerning these areas and locations.
    (3) Records of the cost estimate performed for the decommissioning 
funding plan or of the amount certified for decommissioning, and records 
of the funding method used for assuring funds if either a funding plan 
or certification is used.

<R05>
Sec. 50.82  Termination of license.

    For power reactor licensees who, before the effective date of this 
rule, either submitted a decommissioning plan for approval or possess an 
approved decommissioning plan, the plan is considered to be the PSDAR 
submittal required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the 
provisions of this section apply accordingly. For power reactor 
licensees whose decommissioning plan approval activities have been 
relegated to notice of opportunity for a hearing under subpart G of 10 
CFR part 2, the public meeting convened and 90-day delay of major 
decommissioning activities required in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(5) 
of this section shall not apply, and any orders arising from proceedings 
under subpart G of 10 CFR part 2 shall continue and remain in effect 
absent any orders from the Commission.
    (a) For power reactor licensees--
    (1) (i) When a licensee has determined to permanently cease 
operations the licensee shall, within 30 days, submit a written 
certification to the NRC, consistent with the requirements of 
Sec. 50.4(b)(8);
    (ii) Once fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel, 
the licensee shall submit a written certification to the NRC that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 50.4(b)(9) and;
    (iii) For licensees whose licenses have been permanently modified to 
allow possession but not operation of the facility, before the effective 
date of this rule, the certifications required in paragraphs (a)(1) (i)-
(ii) of this section shall be deemed to have been submitted.
    (2) Upon docketing of the certifications for permanent cessation of 
operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel, or 
when a final legally effective order to permanently

[[Page 725]]

cease operations has come into effect, the 10 CFR part 50 license no 
longer authorizes operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention 
of fuel into the reactor vessel.
    (3) Decommissioning will be completed within 60 years of permanent 
cessation of operations. Completion of decommissioning beyond 60 years 
will be approved by the Commission only when necessary to protect public 
health and safety. Factors that will be considered by the Commission in 
evaluating an alternative that provides for completion of 
decommissioning beyond 60 years of permanent cessation of operations 
include unavailability of waste disposal capacity and other site-
specific factors affecting the licensee's capability to carry out 
decommissioning, including presence of other nuclear facilities at the 
site.
    (4) (i) Prior to or within 2 years following permanent cessation of 
operations, the licensee shall submit a post-shutdown decommissioning 
activities report (PSDAR) to the NRC, and a copy to the affected 
State(s). The report must include a description of the planned 
decommissioning activities along with a schedule for their 
accomplishment, an estimate of expected costs, and a discussion that 
provides the reasons for concluding that the environmental impacts 
associated with site-specific decommissioning activities will be bounded 
by appropriate previously issued environmental impact statements.
    (ii) The NRC shall notice receipt of the PSDAR and make the PSDAR 
available for public comment. The NRC shall also schedule a public 
meeting in the vicinity of the licensee's facility upon receipt of the 
PSDAR. The NRC shall publish a notice in the Federal Register and in a 
forum, such as local newspapers, that is readily accessible to 
individuals in the vicinity of the site, announcing the date, time and 
location of the meeting, along with a brief description of the purpose 
of the meeting.
    (5) Licensees shall not perform any major decommissioning 
activities, as defined in Sec. 50.2, until 90 days after the NRC has 
received the licensee's PSDAR submittal and until certifications of 
permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the 
reactor vessel, as required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1), have been submitted.
    (6) Licensees shall not perform any decommissioning activities, as 
defined in Sec. 50.2, that--
    (i) Foreclose release of the site for possible unrestricted use;
    (ii) Result in significant environmental impacts not previously 
reviewed; or
    (iii) Result in there no longer being reasonable assurance that 
adequate funds will be available for decommissioning.
    (7) In taking actions permitted under Sec. 50.59 following submittal 
of the PSDAR, the licensee shall notify the NRC, in writing and send a 
copy to the affected State(s), before performing any decommissioning 
activity inconsistent with, or making any significant schedule change 
from, those actions and schedules described in the PSDAR, including 
changes that significantly increase the decommissioning cost.
    (8)(i) Decommissioning trust funds may be used by licensees if--
    (A) The withdrawals are for expenses for legitimate decommissioning 
activities consistent with the definition of decommissioning in 
Sec. 50.2;
    (B) The expenditure would not reduce the value of the 
decommissioning trust below an amount necessary to place and maintain 
the reactor in a safe storage condition if unforeseen conditions or 
expenses arise and;
    (C) The withdrawals would not inhibit the ability of the licensee to 
complete funding of any shortfalls in the decommissioning trust needed 
to ensure the availability of funds to ultimately release the site and 
terminate the license.
    (ii) Initially, 3 percent of the generic amount specified in 
Sec. 50.75 may be used for decommissioning planning. For licensees that 
have submitted the certifications required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) and 
commencing 90 days after the NRC has received the PSDAR, an additional 
20 percent may be used. A site-specific decommissioning cost estimate 
must be submitted to the NRC prior to the licensee using any funding in 
excess of these amounts.

[[Page 726]]

    (iii) Within 2 years following permanent cessation of operations, if 
not already submitted, the licensee shall submit a site-specific 
decommissioning cost estimate.
    (iv) For decommissioning activities that delay completion of 
decommissioning by including a period of storage or surveillance, the 
licensee shall provide a means of adjusting cost estimates and 
associated funding levels over the storage or surveillance period.
    (9) All power reactor licensees must submit an application for 
termination of license. The application for termination of license must 
be accompanied or preceded by a license termination plan to be submitted 
for NRC approval.
    (i) The license termination plan must be a supplement to the FSAR or 
equivalent and must be submitted at least 2 years before termination of 
the license date.
    (ii) The license termination plan must include--
    (A) A site characterization;
    (B) Identification of remaining dismantlement activities;
    (C) Plans for site remediation;
    (D) Detailed plans for the final radiation survey;
    (E) A description of the end use of the site, if restricted;
    (F) An updated site-specific estimate of remaining decommissioning 
costs; and
    (G) A supplement to the environmental report, pursuant to 
Sec. 51.53, describing any new information or significant environmental 
change associated with the licensee's proposed termination activities.
    (iii) The NRC shall notice receipt of the license termination plan 
and make the license termination plan available for public comment. The 
NRC shall also schedule a public meeting in the vicinity of the 
licensee's facility upon receipt of the license termination plan. The 
NRC shall publish a notice in the Federal Register and in a forum, such 
as local newspapers, which is readily accessible to individuals in the 
vicinity of the site, announcing the date, time and location of the 
meeting, along with a brief description of the purpose of the meeting.
    (10) If the license termination plan demonstrates that the remainder 
of decommissioning activities will be performed in accordance with the 
regulations in this chapter, will not be inimical to the common defense 
and security or to the health and safety of the public, and will not 
have a significant effect on the quality of the environment and after 
notice to interested persons, the Commission shall approve the plan, by 
license amendment, subject to such conditions and limitations as it 
deems appropriate and necessary and authorize implementation of the 
license termination plan.
    (11) The Commission shall terminate the license if it determines 
that--
    (i) The remaining dismantlement has been performed in accordance 
with the approved license termination plan, and
    (ii) The terminal radiation survey and associated documentation 
demonstrates that the facility and site are suitable for release.
    (b) For non-power reactor licensees--
    (1) A licensee that permanently ceases operations must make 
application for license termination within 2 years following permanent 
cessation of operations, and in no case later than 1 year prior to 
expiration of the operating license. Each application for termination of 
a license must be accompanied or preceded by a proposed decommissioning 
plan. The contents of the decommissioning plan are specified in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (2) For decommissioning plans in which the major dismantlement 
activities are delayed by first placing the facility in storage, 
planning for these delayed activities may be less detailed. Updated 
detailed plans must be submitted and approved prior to the start of 
these activities.
    (3) For decommissioning plans that delay completion of 
decommissioning by including a period of storage or surveillance, the 
licensee shall provide that--
    (i) Funds needed to complete decommissioning be placed into an 
account segregated from the licensee's assets and outside the licensee's 
administrative control during the storage or surveillance period, or a 
surety method or fund statement of intent be maintained in accordance 
with the criteria of Sec. 50.75(e); and

[[Page 727]]

    (ii) Means be included for adjusting cost estimates and associated 
funding levels over the storage or surveillance period.
    (4) The proposed decommissioning plan must include--
    (i) The choice of the alternative for decommissioning with a 
description of activities involved. An alternative is acceptable if it 
provides for completion of decommissioning without significant delay. 
Consideration will be given to an alternative which provides for delayed 
completion of decommissioning only when necessary to protect the public 
health and safety. Factors to be considered in evaluating an alternative 
which provides for delayed completion of decommissioning include 
unavailability of waste disposal capacity and other site-specific 
factors affecting the licensee's capability to carry out 
decommissioning, including the presence of other nuclear facilities at 
the site.
    (ii) A description of the controls and limits on procedures and 
equipment to protect occupational and public health and safety;
    (iii) A description of the planned final radiation survey;
    (iv) An updated cost estimate for the chosen alternative for 
decommissioning, comparison of that estimate with present funds set 
aside for decommissioning, and plan for assuring the availability of 
adequate funds for completion of decommissioning; and
    (v) A description of technical specifications, quality assurance 
provisions and physical security plan provisions in place during 
decommissioning.
    (5) If the decommissioning plan demonstrates that the 
decommissioning will be performed in accordance with the regulations in 
this chapter and will not be inimical to the common defense and security 
or to the health and safety of the public, and after notice to 
interested persons, the Commission will approve, by amendment, the plan 
subject to such conditions and limitations as it deems appropriate and 
necessary. The approved decommissioning plan will be a supplement to the 
Safety Analysis report or equivalent.
    (6) The Commission will terminate the license if it determines 
that--
    (i) The decommissioning has been performed in accordance with the 
approved decommissioning plan, and
    (ii) The terminal radiation survey and associated documentation 
demonstrates that the facility and site are suitable for release.
    (c) For a facility that has permanently ceased operation before the 
expiration of its license, the collection period for any shortfall of 
funds will be determined, upon application by the licensee, on a case-
by-case basis taking into account the specific financial situation of 
each licensee.

Sec. 50.92.
    (2)(i) The Commission may publish in the Federal Register under 
Sec. 2.105 an individual notice of proposed action for an amendment for 
which it makes a

[[Page 728]]

proposed determination that no significant hazards consideration is 
involved, or, at least once every 30 days, publish a periodic Federal 
Register notice of proposed actions which identifies each amendment 
issued and each amendment proposed to be issued since the last such 
periodic notice, or it may publish both such notices.
    (ii) For each amendment proposed to be issued, the notice will (A) 
contain the staff's proposed determination, under the standards in 
Sec. 50.92, (B) provide a brief description of the amendment and of the 
facility involved, (C) solicit public comments on the proposed 
determination, and (D) provide for a 30-day comment period.
    (iii) The comment period will begin on the day after the date of the 
publication of the first notice, and, normally, the amendment will not 
be granted until after this comment period expires.
    (3) The Commission may inform the public about the final disposition 
of an amendment request for which it has made a proposed determination 
of no significant hazards consideration either by issuing an individual 
notice of issuance under Sec. 2.106 of this chapter or by publishing 
such a notice in its periodic system of Federal Register notices. In 
either event, it will not make and will not publish a final 
determination on no significant hazards consideration, unless it 
receives a request for a hearing on that amendment request.
    (4) Where the Commission makes a final determination that no 
significant hazards consideration is involved and that the amendment 
should be issued, the amendment will be effective upon issuance, even if 
adverse public comments have been received and even if an interested 
person meeting the provisions for intervention called for in Sec. 2.714 
of this chapter has filed a request for a hearing. The Commission need 
hold any required hearing only after it issues an amendment, unless it 
determines that a significant hazards consideration is involved in which 
case the Commission will provide an opportunity for a prior hearing.
    (5) Where the Commission finds that an emergency situation exists, 
in that failure to act in a timely way would result in derating or 
shutdown of a nuclear power plant, or in prevention of either resumption 
of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed 
power level, it may issue a license amendment involving no significant 
hazards consideration without prior notice and opportunity for a hearing 
or for public comment. In such a situation, the Commission will not 
publish a notice of proposed determination on no significant hazards 
consideration, but will publish a notice of issuance under Sec. 2.106 of 
this chapter, providing for opportunity for a hearing and for public 
comment after issuance. The Commission expects its licensees to apply 
for license amendments in timely fashion. It will decline to dispense 
with notice and comment on the determination of no significant hazards 
consideration if it determines that the licensee has abused the 
emergency provision by failing to make timely application for the 
amendment and thus itself creating the emergency. Whenever an emergency 
situation exists, a licensee requesting an amendment must explain why 
this emergency situation occurred and why it could not avoid this 
situation, and the Commission will assess the licensee's reasons for 
failing to file an application sufficiently in advance of that event.
    (6) Where the Commission finds that exigent circumstances exist, in 
that a licensee and the Commission must act quickly and that time does 
not permit the Commission to publish a Federal Register notice allowing 
30 days for prior public comment, and it also determines that the 
amendment involves no significant hazards considerations, it:
    (i)(A) Will either issue a Federal Register notice providing notice 
of an opportunity for hearing and allowing at least two weeks from the 
date of the notice for prior public comment; or
    (B) Will use local media to provide reasonable notice to the public 
in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's 
amendment and of its proposed determination as described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, consulting with the licensee on the proposed 
media release and on the geographical area of its coverage;
    (ii) Will provide for a reasonable opportunity for the public to 
comment,

[[Page 729]]

using its best efforts to make available to the public whatever means of 
communication it can for the public to respond quickly, and, in the case 
of telephone comments, have these comments recorded or transcribed, as 
necessary and appropriate;
    (iii) When it has issued a local media release, may inform the 
licensee of the public's comments, as necessary and appropriate;
    (iv) Will publish a notice of issuance under Sec. 2.106;
    (v) Will provide a hearing after issuance, if one has been requested 
by a person who satisfies the provisions for intervention called for in 
Sec. 2.714 of this chapter;
    (vi) Will require the licensee to explain the exigency and why the 
licensee cannot avoid it, and use its normal public notice and comment 
procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section if it determines that the 
licensee has failed to use its best efforts to make a timely application 
for the amendment in order to create the exigency and to take advantage 
of this procedure.
    (7) Where the Commission finds that significant hazards 
considerations are involved, it will issue a Federal Register notice 
providing an opportunity for a prior hearing even in an emergency 
situation, unless it finds an imminent danger to the health or safety of 
the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    (b) State consultation. (1) At the time a licensee requests an 
amendment, it must notify the State in which its facility is located of 
its request by providing that State with a copy of its application and 
its reasoned analysis about no significant hazards considerations and 
indicate on the application that it has done so. (The Commission will 
make available to the licensee the name of the appropriate State 
official designated to receive such amendments.)
    (2) The Commission will advise the State of its proposed 
determination about no significant hazards consideration normally by 
sending it a copy of the Federal Register notice.
    (3) The Commission will make available to the State official 
designated to consult with it about its proposed determination the names 
of the Project Manager or other NRC personnel it designated to consult 
with the State. The Commission will consider any comments of that State 
official. If it does not hear from the State in a timely manner, it will 
consider that the State has no interest in its determination; 
nonetheless, to ensure that the State is aware of the application, 
before it issues the amendment, it will make a good faith effort to 
telephone that official. (Inability to consult with a responsible State 
official following good faith attempts will not prevent the Commission 
from making effective a license amendment involving no significant 
hazards consideration.)
    (4) The Commission will make a good faith attempt to consult with 
the State before it issues a license amendment involving no significant 
hazards consideration. If, however, it does not have time to use its 
normal consultation procedures because of an emergency situation, it 
will attempt to telephone the appropriate State official. (Inability to 
consult with a responsible State official following good faith attempts 
will not prevent the Commission from making effective a license 
amendment involving no significant hazards consideration, if the 
Commission deems it necessary in an emergency situation.)
    (5) After the Commission issues the requested amendment, it will 
send a copy of its determination to the State.
    (c) Caveats about State consultation. (1) The State consultation 
procedures in paragraph (b) of this section do not give the State a 
right:
    (i) To veto the Commission's proposed or final determination;
    (ii) To a hearing on the determination before the amendment becomes 
effective; or
    (iii) To insist upon a postponement of the determination or upon 
issuance of the amendment.
    (2) These procedures do not alter present provisions of law that 
reserve to the Commission exclusive responsibility for setting and 
enforcing radiological health and safety requirements for nuclear power 
plants.

<R05>
Sec. 50.92  Issuance of amendment.

    (a) In determining whether an amendment to a license or construction 
permit will be issued to the applicant, the Commission will be guided by 
the considerations which govern the issuance of initial licenses or 
construction permits to the extent applicable and appropriate. If the 
application involves the material alteration of a licensed facility, a 
construction permit will be issued before the issuance of the amendment 
to the license. If the amendment involves a significant hazards 
consideration, the Commission will give notice of its proposed action 
(1) pursuant to Sec. 2.105 of this chapter before acting thereon and (2) 
as soon as practicable after the application has been docketed.
    (b) The Commission will be particularly sensitive to a license 
amendment request that involves irreversible consequences (such as one 
that permits a significant increase in the amount of effluents or 
radiation emitted by a nuclear power plant).
    (c) The Commission may make a final determination, pursuant to the 
procedures in Sec. 50.91, that a proposed amendment to an operating 
license for a facility licensed under Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22 or for 
a testing facility involves no significant hazards consideration, if 
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment 
would not:
    (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or
    (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any accident previously evaluated; or
    (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

    Revocation, Suspension, Modification, Amendment of Licenses and 
      Construction Permits, Emergency Operations by the Commission


<R05>
Sec. 50.100   Revocation, suspension, modification of licenses and construction permits for cause.

    A license or construction permit may be revoked, suspended, or 
modified, in whole or in part, for any material false statement in the 
application for license or in the supplemental or other statement of 
fact required of the applicant; or because of conditions revealed by the 
application for license or statement of fact or any report, record, 
inspection, or other means, which would warrant the Commission to refuse 
to grant a license on an original application (other than those relating 
to Secs. 50.51, 50.42(a), and 50.43(b) of this part); or for failure to 
construct or operate a facility in accordance with the terms of the 
construction permit or license, provided that failure to make timely 
completion of the proposed construction or alteration of a facility 
under a construction permit shall be governed by the provisions of 
Sec. 50.55(b); or for violation of, or failure to observe, any of the 
terms and provisions of the act, regulations, license, permit, or order 
of the Commission.

Sec. 50.102   Commission order for operation after revocation.

    Whenever the Commission finds that the public convenience and 
necessity, or the Department finds that the production program of the 
Department requires continued operation of a production or utilization 
facility, the license for which has been revoked, the Commission may, 
after consultation with the appropriate federal or state regulatory 
agency having jurisdiction, order that possession be taken of such 
facility and that it be operated for a period of time as, in the 
judgment of the Commission, the public convenience and necessity or the 
production program of the Department may require, or until a license for 
operation of the facility shall become effective. Just compensation 
shall be paid for the use of the facility.

    (a) Whenever Congress declares that a state of war or national 
emergency exists, the Commission, if it finds it necessary to the common 
defense and security, may,
    (1) Suspend any license it has issued.
    (2) Cause the recapture of special nuclear material.
    (3) Order the operation of any licensed facility.
    (4) Order entry into any plant or facility in order to recapture 
special nuclear material or to operate the facility.

                               Backfitting


<R05>
Sec. 50.109  Backfitting.

    (a)(1) Backfitting is defined as the modification of or addition to 
systems, structures, components, or design of a facility; or the design 
approval or manufacturing license for a facility; or the procedures or 
organization required to design, construct or operate a facility; any of 
which may result from a new or amended provision in the Commission rules 
or the imposition of a regulatory staff position interpreting the 
Commission rules that is either new or different from a previously 
applicable staff position after:
    (i) The date of issuance of the construction permit for the facility 
for facilities having construction permits issued after October 21, 
1985; or
    (ii) Six months before the date of docketing of the operating 
license application for the facility for facilities having construction 
permits issued before October 21, 1985; or
    (iii) The date of issuance of the operating license for the facility 
for facilities having operating licenses; or
    (iv) The date of issuance of the design approval under appendix M, 
N, or O of part 52.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
Commission shall require a systematic and documented analysis pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section for backfits which it seeks to impose.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
Commission shall require the backfitting of a facility only when it 
determines, based on the analysis described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, that there is a substantial increase in the overall protection 
of the public health and safety or the common defense and security to be 
derived from the backfit and that the direct and indirect costs of 
implementation for that facility are justified in view of this increased 
protection.
    (4) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section 
are inapplicable and, therefore, backfit analysis is not required and 
the standards in paragraph (a)(3) of this section do not apply where the 
Commission or staff, as appropriate, finds and declares, with 
appropriated documented evaluation for its finding, either:
    (i) That a modification is necessary to bring a facility into 
compliance with a license or the rules or orders of the Commission, or 
into conformance with written commitments by the licensee; or
    (ii) That regulatory action is necessary to ensure that the facility 
provides adequate protection to the health and safety of the public and 
is in accord with the common defense and security; or
    (iii) That the regulatory action involves defining or redefining 
what level of protection to the public health and safety or common 
defense and security should be regarded as adequate.
    (5) The Commission shall always require the backfitting of a 
facility if it determines that such regulatory action is necessary to 
ensure that the facility provides adequate protection to the health and 
safety of the public and is in accord with the common defense and 
security.
    (6) The documented evaluation required by paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section shall include a statement of the objectives of and reasons for 
the modification and the basis for invoking the exception. If 
immediately effective regulatory action is required, then the documented 
evaluation may follow

[[Page 732]]

rather than precede the regulatory action.
    (7) If there are two or more ways to achieve compliance with a 
license or the rules or orders of the Commission, or with written 
licensee commitments, or there are two or more ways to reach a level of 
protection which is adequate, then ordinarily the applicant or licensee 
is free to choose the way which best suits its purposes. However, should 
it be necessary or appropriate for the Commission to prescribe a 
specific way to comply with its requirements or to achieve adequate 
protection, then cost may be a factor in selecting the way, provided 
that the objective of compliance or adequate protection is met.
    (b) Paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall not apply to backfits 
imposed prior to October 21, 1985.
    (c) In reaching the determination required by paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, the Commission will consider how the backfit should be 
scheduled in light of other ongoing regulatory activities at the 
facility and, in addition, will consider information available 
concerning any of the following factors as may be appropriate and any 
other information relevant and material to the proposed backfit:
    (1) Statement of the specific objectives that the proposed backfit 
is designed to achieve;
    (2) General description of the activity that would be required by 
the licensee or applicant in order to complete the backfit;
    (3) Potential change in the risk to the public from the accidental 
off-site release of radioactive material;
    (4) Potential impact on radiological exposure of facility employees;
    (5) Installation and continuing costs associated with the backfit, 
including the cost of facility downtime or the cost of construction 
delay;
    (6) The potential safety impact of changes in plant or operational 
complexity, including the relationship to proposed and existing 
regulatory requirements;
    (7) The estimated resource burden on the NRC associated with the 
proposed backfit and the availability of such resources;
    (8) The potential impact of differences in facility type, design or 
age on the relevancy and practicality of the proposed backfit;
    (9) Whether the proposed backfit is interim or final and, if 
interim, the justification for imposing the proposed backfit on an 
interim basis.
    (d) No licensing action will be withheld during the pendency of 
backfit analyses required by the Commission's rules.
    (e) The Executive Director for Operations shall be responsible for 
implementation of this section, and all analyses required by this 
section shall be approved by the Executive Director for Operations or 
his designee.

                              introduction

    Pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 50.34, an application for a 
construction permit must include the principal design criteria for a 
proposed facility. The principal design criteria establish the necessary 
design, fabrication, construction, testing, and performance requirements 
for structures, systems, and components important to safety; that is, 
structures, systems, and components that provide reasonable assurance 
that the facility can be operated without undue risk to the health and 
safety of the public.
    These General Design Criteria establish minimum requirements for the 
principal design criteria for water-cooled nuclear power plants similar 
in design and location to plants for which construction permits have 
been issued by the Commission. The General Design Criteria are also 
considered to be generally applicable to other types of nuclear power 
units and are intended to provide guidance in establishing the principal 
design criteria for such other units.
    The development of these General Design Criteria is not yet 
complete. For example, some of the definitions need further 
amplification. Also, some of the specific design requirements for 
structures, systems, and components important to safety have not as yet 
been suitably defined. Their omission does not relieve any applicant 
from considering these matters in the design of a specific facility and 
satisfying the necessary safety requirements. These matters include:
    (1) Consideration of the need to design against single failures of 
passive components in fluid systems important to safety. (See Definition 
of Single Failure.)
    (2) Consideration of redundancy and diversity requirements for fluid 
systems important to safety. A ``system'' could consist of a number of 
subsystems each of which is separately capable of performing the 
specified system safety function. The minimum acceptable redundancy and 
diversity of subsystems and components within a subsystem, and the 
required interconnection and independence of the subsystems have not yet 
been developed or defined. (See Criteria 34, 35, 38, 41, and 44.)
    (3) Consideration of the type, size, and orientation of possible 
breaks in components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary in 
determining design requirements to suitably protect against postulated 
loss-of-coolant accidents. (See Definition of Loss of Coolant 
Accidents.)
    (4) Consideration of the possibility of systematic, nonrandom, 
concurrent failures of redundant elements in the design of protection 
systems and reactivity control systems. (See Criteria 22, 24, 26, and 
29.)
    It is expected that the criteria will be augmented and changed from 
time to time as important new requirements for these and other features 
are developed.
    There will be some water-cooled nuclear power plants for which the 
General Design

[[Page 735]]

Criteria are not sufficient and for which additional criteria must be 
identified and satisfied in the interest of public safety. In 
particular, it is expected that additional or different criteria will be 
needed to take into account unusual sites and environmental conditions, 
and for water-cooled nuclear power units of advanced design. Also, there 
may be water-cooled nuclear power units for which fulfillment of some of 
the General Design Criteria may not be necessary or appropriate. For 
plants such as these, departures from the General Design Criteria must 
be identified and justified.

                      definitions and explanations

    Nuclear power unit. A nuclear power unit means a nuclear power 
reactor and associated equipment necessary for electric power generation 
and includes those structures, systems, and components required to 
provide reasonable assurance the facility can be operated without undue 
risk to the health and safety of the public.
    Loss of coolant accidents. Loss of coolant accidents mean those 
postulated accidents that result from the loss of reactor coolant at a 
rate in excess of the capability of the reactor coolant makeup system 
from breaks in the reactor coolant pressure boundary, up to and 
including a break equivalent in size to the double-ended rupture of the 
largest pipe of the reactor coolant system.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Further details relating to the type, size, and orientation of 
postulated breaks in specific components of the reactor coolant pressure 
boundary are under development.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Single failure. A single failure means an occurrence which results 
in the loss of capability of a component to perform its intended safety 
functions. Multiple failures resulting from a single occurrence are 
considered to be a single failure. Fluid and electric systems are 
considered to be designed against an assumed single failure if neither 
(1) a single failure of any active component (assuming passive 
components function properly) nor (2) a single failure of a passive 
component (assuming active components function properly), results in a 
loss of the capability of the system to perform its safety functions.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Single failures of passive components in electric systems should 
be assumed in designing against a single failure. The conditions under 
which a single failure of a passive component in a fluid system should 
be considered in designing the system against a single failure are under 
development.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Anticipated operational occurrences. Anticipated operational 
occurrences mean those conditions of normal operation which are expected 
to occur one or more times during the life of the nuclear power unit and 
include but are not limited to loss of power to all recirculation pumps, 
tripping of the turbine generator set, isolation of the main condenser, 
and loss of all offsite power.

                                criteria

                         I. Overall Requirements

    Criterion 1--Quality standards and records. Structures, systems, and 
components important to safety shall be designed, fabricated, erected, 
and tested to quality standards commensurate with the importance of the 
safety functions to be performed. Where generally recognized codes and 
standards are used, they shall be identified and evaluated to determine 
their applicability, adequacy, and sufficiency and shall be supplemented 
or modified as necessary to assure a quality product in keeping with the 
required safety function. A quality assurance program shall be 
established and implemented in order to provide adequate assurance that 
these structures, systems, and components will satisfactorily perform 
their safety functions. Appropriate records of the design, fabrication, 
erection, and testing of structures, systems, and components important 
to safety shall be maintained by or under the control of the nuclear 
power unit licensee throughout the life of the unit.
    Criterion 2--Design bases for protection against natural phenomena. 
Structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be 
designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena such as 
earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, tsunami, and seiches without 
loss of capability to perform their safety functions. The design bases 
for these structures, systems, and components shall reflect: (1) 
Appropriate consideration of the most severe of the natural phenomena 
that have been historically reported for the site and surrounding area, 
with sufficient margin for the limited accuracy, quantity, and period of 
time in which the historical data have been accumulated, (2) appropriate 
combinations of the effects of normal and accident conditions with the 
effects of the natural phenomena and (3) the importance of the safety 
functions to be performed.
    Criterion 3--Fire protection. Structures, systems, and components 
important to safety shall be designed and located to minimize, 
consistent with other safety requirements, the probability and effect of 
fires and explosions. Noncombustible and heat resistant materials shall 
be used wherever practical throughout the unit, particularly in 
locations such as the containment and control room. Fire detection and 
fighting systems of appropriate capacity and capability shall be 
provided and designed to minimize the adverse effects of fires on 
structures, systems, and components important to safety. Firefighting 
systems shall be designed to assure that their rupture or inadvertent 
operation

[[Page 736]]

does not significantly impair the safety capability of these structures, 
systems, and components.
    Criterion 4--Environmental and dynamic effects design bases. 
Structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be 
designed to accommodate the effects of and to be compatible with the 
environmental conditions associated with normal operation, maintenance, 
testing, and postulated accidents, including loss-of-coolant accidents. 
These structures, systems, and components shall be appropriately 
protected against dynamic effects, including the effects of missiles, 
pipe whipping, and discharging fluids, that may result from equipment 
failures and from events and conditions outside the nuclear power unit. 
However, dynamic effects associated with postulated pipe ruptures in 
nuclear power units may be excluded from the design basis when analyses 
reviewed and approved by the Commission demonstrate that the probability 
of fluid system piping rupture is extremely low under conditions 
consistent with the design basis for the piping.
    Criterion 5--Sharing of structures, systems, and components. 
Structures, systems, and components important to safety shall not be 
shared among nuclear power units unless it can be shown that such 
sharing will not significantly impair their ability to perform their 
safety functions, including, in the event of an accident in one unit, an 
orderly shutdown and cooldown of the remaining units.

           II. Protection by Multiple Fission Product Barriers

    Criterion 10--Reactor design. The reactor core and associated 
coolant, control, and protection systems shall be designed with 
appropriate margin to assure that specified acceptable fuel design 
limits are not exceeded during any condition of normal operation, 
including the effects of anticipated operational occurrences.
    Criterion 11--Reactor inherent protection. The reactor core and 
associated coolant systems shall be designed so that in the power 
operating range the net effect of the prompt inherent nuclear feedback 
characteristics tends to compensate for a rapid increase in reactivity.
    Criterion 12--Suppression of reactor power oscillations. The reactor 
core and associated coolant, control, and protection systems shall be 
designed to assure that power oscillations which can result in 
conditions exceeding specified acceptable fuel design limits are not 
possible or can be reliably and readily detected and suppressed.
    Criterion 13--Instrumentation and control. Instrumentation shall be 
provided to monitor variables and systems over their anticipated ranges 
for normal operation, for anticipated operational occurrences, and for 
accident conditions as appropriate to assure adequate safety, including 
those variables and systems that can affect the fission process, the 
integrity of the reactor core, the reactor coolant pressure boundary, 
and the containment and its associated systems. Appropriate controls 
shall be provided to maintain these variables and systems within 
prescribed operating ranges.
    Criterion 14--Reactor coolant pressure boundary. The reactor coolant 
pressure boundary shall be designed, fabricated, erected, and tested so 
as to have an extremely low probability of abnormal leakage, of rapidly 
propagating failure, and of gross rupture.
    Criterion 15--Reactor coolant system design. The reactor coolant 
system and associated auxiliary, control, and protection systems shall 
be designed with sufficient margin to assure that the design conditions 
of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not exceeded during any 
condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational 
occurrences.
    Criterion 16--Containment design. Reactor containment and associated 
systems shall be provided to establish an essentially leak-tight barrier 
against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity to the environment and 
to assure that the containment design conditions important to safety are 
not exceeded for as long as postulated accident conditions require.
    Criterion 17--Electric power systems. An onsite electric power 
system and an offsite electric power system shall be provided to permit 
functioning of structures, systems, and components important to safety. 
The safety function for each system (assuming the other system is not 
functioning) shall be to provide sufficient capacity and capability to 
assure that (1) specified acceptable fuel design limits and design 
conditions of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not exceeded as 
a result of anticipated operational occurrences and (2) the core is 
cooled and containment integrity and other vital functions are 
maintained in the event of postulated accidents.
    The onsite electric power supplies, including the batteries, and the 
onsite electric distribution system, shall have sufficient independence, 
redundancy, and testability to perform their safety functions assuming a 
single failure.
    Electric power from the transmission network to the onsite electric 
distribution system shall be supplied by two physically independent 
circuits (not necessarily on separate rights of way) designed and 
located so as to minimize to the extent practical the likelihood of 
their simultaneous failure under operating and postulated accident and 
environmental conditions. A switchyard common to

[[Page 737]]

both circuits is acceptable. Each of these circuits shall be designed to 
be available in sufficient time following a loss of all onsite 
alternating current power supplies and the other offsite electric power 
circuit, to assure that specified acceptable fuel design limits and 
design conditions of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not 
exceeded. One of these circuits shall be designed to be available within 
a few seconds following a loss-of-coolant accident to assure that core 
cooling, containment integrity, and other vital safety functions are 
maintained.
    Provisions shall be included to minimize the probability of losing 
electric power from any of the remaining supplies as a result of, or 
coincident with, the loss of power generated by the nuclear power unit, 
the loss of power from the transmission network, or the loss of power 
from the onsite electric power supplies.
    Criterion 18--Inspection and testing of electric power systems. 
Electric power systems important to safety shall be designed to permit 
appropriate periodic inspection and testing of important areas and 
features, such as wiring, insulation, connections, and switchboards, to 
assess the continuity of the systems and the condition of their 
components. The systems shall be designed with a capability to test 
periodically (1) the operability and functional performance of the 
components of the systems, such as onsite power sources, relays, 
switches, and buses, and (2) the operability of the systems as a whole 
and, under conditions as close to design as practical, the full 
operation sequence that brings the systems into operation, including 
operation of applicable portions of the protection system, and the 
transfer of power among the nuclear power unit, the offsite power 
system, and the onsite power system.
    Criterion 19--Control room. A control room shall be provided from 
which actions can be taken to operate the nuclear power unit safely 
under normal conditions and to maintain it in a safe condition under 
accident conditions, including loss-of-coolant accidents. Adequate 
radiation protection shall be provided to permit access and occupancy of 
the control room under accident conditions without personnel receiving 
radiation exposures in excess of 5 rem whole body, or its equivalent to 
any part of the body, for the duration of the accident.
    Equipment at appropriate locations outside the control room shall be 
provided (1) with a design capability for prompt hot shutdown of the 
reactor, including necessary instrumentation and controls to maintain 
the unit in a safe condition during hot shutdown, and (2) with a 
potential capability for subsequent cold shutdown of the reactor through 
the use of suitable procedures.

             III. Protection and Reactivity Control Systems

    Criterion 20--Protection system functions. The protection system 
shall be designed (1) to initiate automatically the operation of 
appropriate systems including the reactivity control systems, to assure 
that specified acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded as a 
result of anticipated operational occurrences and (2) to sense accident 
conditions and to initiate the operation of systems and components 
important to safety.
    Criterion 21--Protection system reliability and testability. The 
protection system shall be designed for high functional reliability and 
inservice testability commensurate with the safety functions to be 
performed. Redundancy and independence designed into the protection 
system shall be sufficient to assure that (1) no single failure results 
in loss of the protection function and (2) removal from service of any 
component or channel does not result in loss of the required minimum 
redundancy unless the acceptable reliability of operation of the 
protection system can be otherwise demonstrated. The protection system 
shall be designed to permit periodic testing of its functioning when the 
reactor is in operation, including a capability to test channels 
independently to determine failures and losses of redundancy that may 
have occurred.
    Criterion 22--Protection system independence. The protection system 
shall be designed to assure that the effects of natural phenomena, and 
of normal operating, maintenance, testing, and postulated accident 
conditions on redundant channels do not result in loss of the protection 
function, or shall be demonstrated to be acceptable on some other 
defined basis. Design techniques, such as functional diversity or 
diversity in component design and principles of operation, shall be used 
to the extent practical to prevent loss of the protection function.
    Criterion 23--Protection system failure modes. The protection system 
shall be designed to fail into a safe state or into a state demonstrated 
to be acceptable on some other defined basis if conditions such as 
disconnection of the system, loss of energy (e.g., electric power, 
instrument air), or postulated adverse environments (e.g., extreme heat 
or cold, fire, pressure, steam, water, and radiation) are experienced.
    Criterion 24--Separation of protection and control systems. The 
protection system shall be separated from control systems to the extent 
that failure of any single control system component or channel, or 
failure or removal from service of any single protection system 
component or channel which is common to the control and protection 
systems leaves intact a system satisfying all reliability, redundancy, 
and independence requirements of the protection system. Interconnection 
of the protection and control systems

[[Page 738]]

shall be limited so as to assure that safety is not significantly 
impaired.
    Criterion 25--Protection system requirements for reactivity control 
malfunctions. The protection system shall be designed to assure that 
specified acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded for any single 
malfunction of the reactivity control systems, such as accidental 
withdrawal (not ejection or dropout) of control rods.
    Criterion 26--Reactivity control system redundancy and capability. 
Two independent reactivity control systems of different design 
principles shall be provided. One of the systems shall use control rods, 
preferably including a positive means for inserting the rods, and shall 
be capable of reliably controlling reactivity changes to assure that 
under conditions of normal operation, including anticipated operational 
occurrences, and with appropriate margin for malfunctions such as stuck 
rods, specified acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded. The 
second reactivity control system shall be capable of reliably 
controlling the rate of reactivity changes resulting from planned, 
normal power changes (including xenon burnout) to assure acceptable fuel 
design limits are not exceeded. One of the systems shall be capable of 
holding the reactor core subcritical under cold conditions.
    Criterion 27--Combined reactivity control systems capability. The 
reactivity control systems shall be designed to have a combined 
capability, in conjunction with poison addition by the emergency core 
cooling system, of reliably controlling reactivity changes to assure 
that under postulated accident conditions and with appropriate margin 
for stuck rods the capability to cool the core is maintained.
    Criterion 28--Reactivity limits. The reactivity control systems 
shall be designed with appropriate limits on the potential amount and 
rate of reactivity increase to assure that the effects of postulated 
reactivity accidents can neither (1) result in damage to the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary greater than limited local yielding nor (2) 
sufficiently disturb the core, its support structures or other reactor 
pressure vessel internals to impair significantly the capability to cool 
the core. These postulated reactivity accidents shall include 
consideration of rod ejection (unless prevented by positive means), rod 
dropout, steam line rupture, changes in reactor coolant temperature and 
pressure, and cold water addition.
    Criterion 29--Protection against anticipated operational 
occurrences. The protection and reactivity control systems shall be 
designed to assure an extremely high probability of accomplishing their 
safety functions in the event of anticipated operational occurrences.

                            IV. Fluid Systems

    Criterion 30--Quality of reactor coolant pressure boundary. 
Components which are part of the reactor coolant pressure boundary shall 
be designed, fabricated, erected, and tested to the highest quality 
standards practical. Means shall be provided for detecting and, to the 
extent practical, identifying the location of the source of reactor 
coolant leakage.
    Criterion 31--Fracture prevention of reactor coolant pressure 
boundary. The reactor coolant pressure boundary shall be designed with 
sufficient margin to assure that when stressed under operating, 
maintenance, testing, and postulated accident conditions (1) the 
boundary behaves in a nonbrittle manner and (2) the probability of 
rapidly propagating fracture is minimized. The design shall reflect 
consideration of service temperatures and other conditions of the 
boundary material under operating, maintenance, testing, and postulated 
accident conditions and the uncertainties in determining (1) material 
properties, (2) the effects of irradiation on material properties, (3) 
residual, steady state and transient stresses, and (4) size of flaws.
    Criterion 32--Inspection of reactor coolant pressure boundary. 
Components which are part of the reactor coolant pressure boundary shall 
be designed to permit (1) periodic inspection and testing of important 
areas and features to assess their structural and leaktight integrity, 
and (2) an appropriate material surveillance program for the reactor 
pressure vessel.
    Criterion 33--Reactor coolant makeup. A system to supply reactor 
coolant makeup for protection against small breaks in the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary shall be provided. The system safety function 
shall be to assure that specified acceptable fuel design limits are not 
exceeded as a result of reactor coolant loss due to leakage from the 
reactor coolant pressure boundary and rupture of small piping or other 
small components which are part of the boundary. The system shall be 
designed to assure that for onsite electric power system operation 
(assuming offsite power is not available) and for offsite electric power 
system operation (assuming onsite power is not available) the system 
safety function can be accomplished using the piping, pumps, and valves 
used to maintain coolant inventory during normal reactor operation.
    Criterion 34--Residual heat removal. A system to remove residual 
heat shall be provided. The system safety function shall be to transfer

design conditions of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not 
exceeded.

not available) and for offsite electric power system operation (assuming 
onsite power is not available) the system safety function can be 
accomplished, assuming a single failure.
    Criterion 35--Emergency core cooling. A system to provide abundant 
emergency core cooling shall be provided. The system safety function 
shall be to transfer heat from the reactor core following any loss of 
reactor coolant at a rate such that (1) fuel and clad damage that could 
interfere with continued effective core cooling is prevented and (2) 
clad metal-water reaction is limited to negligible amounts.
    Suitable redundancy in components and features, and suitable 
interconnections, leak detection, isolation, and containment 
capabilities shall be provided to assure that for onsite electric power 
system operation (assuming offsite power is not available) and for

available) the system safety function can be accomplished, assuming a 
single failure.
    Criterion 36--Inspection of emergency core cooling system. The 
emergency core cooling system shall be designed to permit appropriate 
periodic inspection of important components, such as spray rings in the 
reactor pressure vessel, water injection nozzles, and piping, to assure 
the integrity and capability of the system.
    Criterion 37--Testing of emergency core cooling system. The 
emergency core cooling system shall be designed to permit appropriate 
periodic pressure and functional testing to assure (1) the structural 
and leaktight integrity of its components, (2) the operability and 
performance of the active components of the system, and (3) the 
operability of the system as a whole and, under conditions as close to 
design as practical, the performance of the full operational sequence 
that brings the system into operation, including operation of applicable 
portions of the protection system, the transfer between normal and 
emergency power sources, and the operation of the associated cooling 
water system.
    Criterion 38--Containment heat removal. A system to remove heat from 
the reactor containment shall be provided. The system safety function 
shall be to reduce rapidly, consistent with the functioning of other 
associated systems, the containment pressure and temperature following 
any loss-of-coolant accident and maintain them at acceptably low levels.
    Suitable redundancy in components and features, and suitable 
interconnections, leak detection, isolation, and containment 
capabilities shall be provided to assure that for onsite electric power 
system operation (assuming offsite power is not available) and for

the design as practical the performance of the full operational sequence 
that brings the system into operation, including operation of applicable 
portions of the protection system, the transfer between normal and

water system.
    Criterion 41--Containment atmosphere cleanup. Systems to control 
fission products, hydrogen, oxygen, and other substances which may be 
released into the reactor containment shall be provided as necessary to 
reduce, consistent with the functioning of other associated systems, the 
concentration and quality of fission products released to the 
environment following postulated accidents, and to control the 
concentration of hydrogen or oxygen and other substances in the 
containment atmosphere following postulated accidents to assure that 
containment integrity is maintained.
    Each system shall have suitable redundancy in components and 
features, and suitable interconnections, leak detection, isolation, and 
containment capabilities to assure that for onsite electric power system 
operation (assuming offsite power is not available) and for offsite 
electric power system operation (assuming onsite power is not available) 
its safety function can be accomplished, assuming a single failure.
    Criterion 42--Inspection of containment atmosphere cleanup systems. 
The containment atmosphere cleanup systems shall be designed to permit 
appropriate periodic inspection of important components, such as filter 
frames, ducts, and piping to assure the integrity and capability of the 
systems.
    Criterion 43--Testing of containment atmosphere cleanup systems. The 
containment atmosphere cleanup systems shall be designed to permit 
appropriate periodic pressure and functional testing to assure (1) the

practical, the performance of the full operational sequence that brings 
the systems into operation, including operation of applicable portions 
of the protection system, the transfer between normal and emergency 
power sources, and the operation of associated systems.
    Criterion 44--Cooling water. A system to transfer heat from

operation for reactor shutdown and for loss-of-coolant accidents, 
including operation of applicable portions of the protection system and 
the transfer between normal and emergency power sources.

                         V. Reactor Containment

    Criterion 50--Containment design basis. The reactor containment 
structure, including access openings, penetrations, and the containment 
heat removal system shall be designed so that the containment structure 
and its internal compartments can accommodate, without exceeding the 
design leakage rate and with sufficient margin, the calculated pressure 
and temperature conditions resulting from any loss-of-coolant accident. 
This margin shall reflect consideration of (1) the effects of potential 
energy sources which have not been included in the determination of the 
peak conditions, such as energy in steam generators and as required by 
Sec. 50.44 energy from metal-water and other chemical reactions that may 
result from degradation but not total failure of emergency core cooling 
functioning, (2) the limited experience and experimental data available 
for defining accident phenomena and containment responses, and (3) the 
conservatism of the calculational model and input parameters.
    Criterion 51--Fracture prevention of containment pressure boundary. 
The reactor containment boundary shall be designed with sufficient 
margin to assure that under operating, maintenance, testing, and 
postulated accident conditions (1) its ferritic materials behave in a 
nonbrittle manner and (2) the probability of rapidly propagating 
fracture is minimized. The design shall reflect consideration of service 
temperatures and other conditions of the containment boundary material 
during operation, maintenance, testing, and postulated accident 
conditions, and the uncertainties in determining (1) material 
properties, (2) residual, steady state, and transient stresses, and (3) 
size of flaws.
    Criterion 52--Capability for containment leakage rate testing. The 
reactor containment and other equipment which may be subjected to 
containment test conditions shall be designed so that periodic 
integrated leakage rate testing can be conducted at containment design 
pressure.
    Criterion 53--Provisions for containment testing and inspection. The 
reactor containment shall be designed to permit (1) appropriate periodic 
inspection of all important areas, such as penetrations, (2) an 
appropriate surveillance program, and (3) periodic testing at 
containment design pressure of the leaktightness of penetrations which 
have resilient seals and expansion bellows.
    Criterion 54--Piping systems penetrating containment. Piping systems 
penetrating primary reactor containment shall be provided with leak 
detection, isolation, and containment capabilities having redundancy, 
reliability, and performance capabilities which reflect the importance 
to safety of isolating these piping systems. Such piping systems shall 
be designed with a capability to test periodically the operability of 
the isolation valves and associated apparatus and to determine if valve 
leakage is within acceptable limits.
    Criterion 55--Reactor coolant pressure boundary penetrating 
containment. Each line that is part of the reactor coolant pressure 
boundary and that penetrates primary reactor containment shall be 
provided with containment isolation valves as follows, unless it can be 
demonstrated that the containment isolation provisions for a specific 
class of lines, such as instrument lines, are acceptable on some other 
defined basis:
    (1) One locked closed isolation valve inside and one locked closed 
isolation valve outside containment; or

[[Page 741]]

    (2) One automatic isolation valve inside and one locked closed 
isolation valve outside containment; or
    (3) One locked closed isolation valve inside and one automatic 
isolation valve outside containment. A simple check valve may not be 
used as the automatic isolation valve outside containment; or
    (4) One automatic isolation valve inside and one automatic isolation 
valve outside containment. A simple check valve may not be used as the 
automatic isolation valve outside containment.

Isolation valves outside containment shall be located as close to 
containment as practical and upon loss of actuating power, automatic 
isolation valves shall be designed to take the position that provides 
greater safety.
    Other appropriate requirements to minimize the probability or 
consequences of an accidental rupture of these lines or of lines 
connected to them shall be provided as necessary to assure adequate 
safety. Determination of the appropriateness of these requirements, such 
as higher quality in design, fabrication, and testing, additional 
provisions for inservice inspection, protection against more severe 
natural phenomena, and additional isolation valves and containment, 
shall include consideration of the population density, use 
characteristics, and physical characteristics of the site environs.
    Criterion 56--Primary containment isolation. Each line that connects 
directly to the containment atmosphere and penetrates primary reactor 
containment shall be provided with containment isolation valves as 
follows, unless it can be demonstrated that the containment isolation 
provisions for a specific class of lines, such as instrument lines, are 
acceptable on some other defined basis:
    (1) One locked closed isolation valve inside and one locked closed 
isolation valve outside containment; or
    (2) One automatic isolation valve inside and one locked closed 
isolation valve outside containment; or
    (3) One locked closed isolation valve inside and one automatic 
isolation valve outside containment. A simple check valve may not be 
used as the automatic isolation valve outside containment; or
    (4) One automatic isolation valve inside and one automatic isolation 
valve outside containment. A simple check valve may not be used as the 
automatic isolation valve outside containment.

Isolation valves outside containment shall be located as close to the 
containment as practical and upon loss of actuating power, automatic 
isolation valves shall be designed to take the position that provides 
greater safety.
    Criterion 57--Closed system isolation valves. Each line that 
penetrates primary reactor containment and is neither part of the 
reactor coolant pressure boundary nor connected directly to the 
containment atmosphere shall have at least one containment isolation 
valve which shall be either automatic, or locked closed, or capable of 
remote manual operation. This valve shall be outside containment and 
located as close to the containment as practical. A simple check valve 
may not be used as the automatic isolation valve.

                   VI. Fuel and Radioactivity Control

    Criterion 60--Control of releases of radioactive materials to the 
environment. The nuclear power unit design shall include means to 
control suitably the release of radioactive materials in gaseous and 
liquid effluents and to handle radioactive solid wastes produced during 
normal reactor operation, including anticipated operational occurrences. 
Sufficient holdup capacity shall be provided for retention of gaseous 
and liquid effluents containing radioactive materials, particularly 
where unfavorable site environmental conditions can be expected to 
impose unusual operational limitations upon the release of such 
effluents to the environment.
    Criterion 61--Fuel storage and handling and radioactivity control. 
The fuel storage and handling, radioactive waste, and other systems 
which may contain radioactivity shall be designed to assure adequate 
safety under normal and postulated accident conditions. These systems 
shall be designed (1) with a capability to permit appropriate periodic 
inspection and testing of components important to safety, (2) with 
suitable shielding for radiation protection, (3) with appropriate 
containment, confinement, and filtering systems, (4) with a residual 
heat removal capability having reliability and testability that reflects 
the importance to safety of decay heat and other residual heat removal, 
and (5) to prevent significant reduction in fuel storage coolant 
inventory under accident conditions.
    Criterion 62--Prevention of criticality in fuel storage and 
handling. Criticality in the fuel storage and handling system shall be 
prevented by physical systems or processes, preferably by use of 
geometrically safe configurations.
    Criterion 63--Monitoring fuel and waste storage. Appropriate systems 
shall be provided in fuel storage and radioactive waste systems and 
associated handling areas (1) to detect conditions that may result in 
loss of residual heat removal capability and excessive radiation levels 
and (2) to initiate appropriate safety actions.
    Criterion 64--Monitoring radioactivity releases. Means shall be 
provided for monitoring the reactor containment atmosphere, spaces 
containing components for recirculation of loss-of-coolant accident 
fluids, effluent discharge paths, and the plant environs for 
radioactivity that may be released from

[[Page 742]]

normal operations, including anticipated operational occurrences, and 
from postulated accidents.

  Appendix B to Part 50--Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power 
                   Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants

    Introduction. Every applicant for a construction permit is required 
by the provisions of Sec. 50.34 to include in its preliminary safety 
analysis report a description of the quality assurance program to be 
applied to the design, fabrication, construction, and testing of the 
structures, systems, and components of the facility. Every applicant for 
an operating license is required to include, in its final safety 
analysis report, information pertaining to the managerial and 
administrative controls to be used to assure safe operation. Nuclear 
power plants and fuel reprocessing plants include structures, systems, 
and components that prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulated 
accidents that could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the 
public. This appendix establishes quality assurance requirements for the 
design, construction, and operation of those structures, systems, and 
components. The pertinent requirements of this appendix apply to all 
activities affecting the safety-related functions of those structures, 
systems, and components; these activities include designing, purchasing, 
fabricating, handling, shipping, storing, cleaning, erecting, 
installing, inspecting, testing, operating, maintaining, repairing, 
refueling, and modifying.
    As used in this appendix, ``quality assurance'' comprises all those 
planned and systematic actions necessary to provide adequate confidence 
that a structure, system, or component will perform satisfactorily in 
service. Quality assurance includes quality control, which comprises 
those quality assurance actions related to the physical characteristics 
of a material, structure, component, or system which provide a means to 
control the quality of the material, structure, component, or system to 
predetermined requirements.

                             I. Organization

    The applicant\1\ shall be responsible for the establishment and 
execution of the quality assurance program. The applicant may delegate 
to others, such as contractors, agents, or consultants, the work of 
establishing and executing the quality assurance program, or any part 
thereof, but shall retain responsibility therefor. The authority and 
duties of persons and organizations performing activities affecting the 
safety-related functions of structures, systems, and components shall be 
clearly established and delineated in writing. These activities include 
both the performing functions of attaining quality objectives and the 
quality assurance functions. The quality assurance functions are those 
of (a) assuring that an appropriate quality assurance program is 
established and effectively executed and (b) verifying, such as by 
checking, auditing, and inspection, that activities affecting the 
safety-related functions have been correctly performed. The persons and 
organizations performing quality assurance functions shall have 
sufficient authority and organizational freedom to identify quality 
problems; to initiate, recommend, or provide solutions; and to verify 
implementation of solutions. Such persons and organizations performing 
quality assurance functions shall report to a management level such that 
this required authority and organizational freedom, including sufficient 
independence from cost and schedule when opposed to safety 
considerations, are provided. Because of the many variables involved, 
such as the number of personnel, the type of activity being performed, 
and the location or locations where activities are performed, the 
organizational structure for executing the quality assurance program may 
take various forms provided that the persons and organizations assigned 
the quality assurance functions have this required authority and 
organizational freedom. Irrespective of the organizational structure, 
the individual(s) assigned the responsibility for assuring effective 
execution of any portion of the quality assurance program at any 
location where activities subject to this appendix are being performed 
shall have direct access to such levels of management as may be 
necessary to perform this function.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While the term ``applicant'' is used in these criteria, the 
requirements are, of course, applicable after such a person has received 
a license to construct and operate a nuclear powerplant or a fuel 
reprocessing plant. These criteria will also be used for guidance in 
evaluating the adequacy of quality assurance programs in use by holders 
of construction permits and operating licenses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      II. Quality Assurance Program

    The applicant shall establish at the earliest practicable time, 
consistent with the schedule for accomplishing the activities, a quality 
assurance program which complies with the requirements of this appendix. 
This program shall be documented by written policies, procedures, or 
instructions and shall be carried out throughout plant life in 
accordance with those policies, procedures,

[[Page 743]]

or instructions. The applicant shall identify the structures, systems, 
and components to be covered by the quality assurance program and the 
major organizations participating in the program, together with the 
designated functions of these organizations. The quality assurance 
program shall provide control over activities affecting the quality of 
the identified structures, systems, and components, to an extent 
consistent with their importance to safety. Activities affecting quality 
shall be accomplished under suitably controlled conditions. Controlled 
conditions include the use of appropriate equipment; suitable 
environmental conditions for accomplishing the activity, such as 
adequate cleanness; and assurance that all prerequisites for the given 
activity have been satisfied. The program shall take into account the 
need for special controls, processes, test equipment, tools, and skills 
to attain the required quality, and the need for verification of quality 
by inspection and test. The program shall provide for indoctrination and 
training of personnel performing activities affecting quality as 
necessary to assure that suitable proficiency is achieved and 
maintained. The applicant shall regularly review the status and adequacy 
of the quality assurance program. Management of other organizations 
participating in the quality assurance program shall regularly review 
the status and adequacy of that part of the quality assurance program 
which they are executing.

                           III. Design Control

    Measures shall be established to assure that applicable regulatory 
requirements and the design basis, as defined in Sec. 50.2 and as 
specified in the license application, for those structures, systems, and 
components to which this appendix applies are correctly translated into 
specifications, drawings, procedures, and instructions. These measures 
shall include provisions to assure that appropriate quality standards 
are specified and included in design documents and that deviations from 
such standards are controlled. Measures shall also be established for 
the selection and review for suitability of application of materials, 
parts, equipment, and processes that are essential to the safety-related 
functions of the structures, systems and components.
    Measures shall be established for the identification and control of 
design interfaces and for coordination among participating design 
organizations. These measures shall include the establishment of 
procedures among participating design organizations for the review, 
approval, release, distribution, and revision of documents involving 
design interfaces.
    The design control measures shall provide for verifying or checking 
the adequacy of design, such as by the performance of design reviews, by 
the use of alternate or simplified calculational methods, or by the 
performance of a suitable testing program. The verifying or checking 
process shall be performed by individuals or groups other than those who 
performed the original design, but who may be from the same 
organization. Where a test program is used to verify the adequacy of a 
specific design feature in lieu of other verifying or checking 
processes, it shall include suitable qualifications testing of a 
prototype unit under the most adverse design conditions. Design control 
measures shall be applied to items such as the following: reactor 
physics, stress, thermal, hydraulic, and accident analyses; 
compatibility of materials; accessibility for inservice inspection, 
maintenance, and repair; and delineation of acceptance criteria for 
inspections and tests.
    Design changes, including field changes, shall be subject to design 
control measures commensurate with those applied to the original design 
and be approved by the organization that performed the original design 
unless the applicant designates another responsible organization.

                    IV. Procurement Document Control

    Measures shall be established to assure that applicable regulatory 
requirements, design bases, and other requirements which are necessary 
to assure adequate quality are suitably included or referenced in the 
documents for procurement of material, equipment, and services, whether 
purchased by the applicant or by its contractors or subcontractors. To 
the extent necessary, procurement documents shall require contractors or 
subcontractors to provide a quality assurance program consistent with 
the pertinent provisions of this appendix.

                V. Instructions, Procedures, and Drawings

    Activities affecting quality shall be prescribed by documented 
instructions, procedures, or drawings, of a type appropriate to the 
circumstances and shall be accomplished in accordance with these 
instructions, procedures, or drawings. Instructions, procedures, or 
drawings shall include appropriate quantitative or qualitative 
acceptance criteria for determining that important activities have been 
satisfactorily accomplished.

                          VI. Document Control

    Measures shall be established to control the issuance of documents, 
such as instructions, procedures, and drawings, including changes 
thereto, which prescribe all activities affecting quality. These 
measures shall assure that documents, including changes, are reviewed 
for adequacy and approved for release by authorized personnel and are 
distributed to and used at the location where the prescribed activity is 
performed. Changes to documents shall be reviewed and

[[Page 744]]

approved by the same organizations that performed the original review 
and approval unless the applicant designates another responsible 
organization.

       VII. Control of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Services

    Measures shall be established to assure that purchased material, 
equipment, and services, whether purchased directly or through 
contractors and subcontractors, conform to the procurement documents. 
These measures shall include provisions, as appropriate, for source 
evaluation and selection, objective evidence of quality furnished by the 
contractor or subcontractor, inspection at the contractor or 
subcontractor source, and examination of products upon delivery. 
Documentary evidence that material and equipment conform to the 
procurement requirements shall be available at the nuclear powerplant or 
fuel reprocessing plant site prior to installation or use of such 
material and equipment. This documentary evidence shall be retained at 
the nuclear powerplant or fuel reprocessing plant site and shall be 
sufficient to identify the specific requirements, such as codes, 
standards, or specifications, met by the purchased material and 
equipment. The effectiveness of the control of quality by contractors 
and subcontractors shall be assessed by the applicant or designee at 
intervals consistent with the importance, complexity, and quantity of 
the product or services.

  VIII. Identification and Control of Materials, Parts, and Components

    Measures shall be established for the identification and control of 
materials, parts, and components, including partially fabricated 
assemblies. These measures shall assure that identification of the item 
is maintained by heat number, part number, serial number, or other 
appropriate means, either on the item or on records traceable to the 
item, as required throughout fabrication, erection, installation, and 
use of the item. These identification and control measures shall be 
designed to prevent the use of incorrect or defective material, parts, 
and components.

                    IX. Control of Special Processes

    Measures shall be established to assure that special processes, 
including welding, heat treating, and nondestructive testing, are 
controlled and accomplished by qualified personnel using qualified 
procedures in accordance with applicable codes, standards, 
specifications, criteria, and other special requirements.

                              X. Inspection

    A program for inspection of activities affecting quality shall be 
established and executed by or for the organization performing the 
activity to verify conformance with the documented instructions, 
procedures, and drawings for accomplishing the activity. Such inspection 
shall be performed by individuals other than those who performed the 
activity being inspected. Examinations, measurements, or tests of 
material or products processed shall be performed for each work 
operation where necessary to assure quality. If inspection of processed 
material or products is impossible or disadvantageous, indirect control 
by monitoring processing methods, equipment, and personnel shall be 
provided. Both inspection and process monitoring shall be provided when 
control is inadequate without both. If mandatory inspection hold points, 
which require witnessing or inspecting by the applicant's designated 
representative and beyond which work shall not proceed without the 
consent of its designated representative are required, the specific hold 
points shall be indicated in appropriate documents.

                            XI. Test Control

    A test program shall be established to assure that all testing 
required to demonstrate that structures, systems, and components will 
perform satisfactorily in service is identified and performed in 
accordance with written test procedures which incorporate the 
requirements and acceptance limits contained in applicable design 
documents. The test program shall include, as appropriate, proof tests 
prior to installation, preoperational tests, and operational tests 
during nuclear power plant or fuel reprocessing plant operation, of 
structures, systems, and components. Test procedures shall include 
provisions for assuring that all prerequisites for the given test have 
been met, that adequate test instrumentation is available and used, and 
that the test is performed under suitable environmental conditions. Test 
results shall be documented and evaluated to assure that test 
requirements have been satisfied.

              XII. Control of Measuring and Test Equipment

    Measures shall be established to assure that tools, gages, 
instruments, and other measuring and testing devices used in activities 
affecting quality are properly controlled, calibrated, and adjusted at 
specified periods to maintain accuracy within necessary limits.

                  XIII. Handling, Storage and Shipping

    Measures shall be established to control the handling, storage, 
shipping, cleaning and preservation of material and equipment in 
accordance with work and inspection instructions to prevent damage or 
deterioration. When necessary for particular products,

[[Page 745]]

special protective environments, such as inert gas atmosphere, specific 
moisture content levels, and temperature levels, shall be specified and 
provided.

               XIV. Inspection, Test, and Operating Status

    Measures shall be established to indicate, by the use of markings 
such as stamps, tags, labels, routing cards, or other suitable means, 
the status of inspections and tests performed upon individual items of 
the nuclear power plant or fuel reprocessing plant. These measures shall 
provide for the identification of items which have satisfactorily passed 
required inspections and tests, where necessary to preclude inadvertent 
bypassing of such inspections and tests. Measures shall also be 
established for indicating the operating status of structures, systems, 
and components of the nuclear power plant or fuel reprocessing plant, 
such as by tagging valves and switches, to prevent inadvertent 
operation.

            XV. Nonconforming Materials, Parts, or Components

    Measures shall be established to control materials, parts, or 
components which do not conform to requirements in order to prevent 
their inadvertent use or installation. These measures shall include, as 
appropriate, procedures for identification, documentation, segregation, 
disposition, and notification to affected organizations. Nonconforming 
items shall be reviewed and accepted, rejected, repaired or reworked in 
accordance with documented procedures.

                         XVI. Corrective Action

    Measures shall be established to assure that conditions adverse to 
quality, such as failures, malfunctions, deficiencies, deviations, 
defective material and equipment, and nonconformances are promptly 
identified and corrected. In the case of significant conditions adverse 
to quality, the measures shall assure that the cause of the condition is 
determined and corrective action taken to preclude repetition. The 
identification of the significant condition adverse to quality, the 
cause of the condition, and the corrective action taken shall be 
documented and reported to appropriate levels of management.

                     XVII. Quality Assurance Records

    Sufficient records shall be maintained to furnish evidence of 
activities affecting quality. The records shall include at least the 
following: Operating logs and the results of reviews, inspections, 
tests, audits, monitoring of work performance, and materials analyses. 
The records shall also include closely-related data such as 
qualifications of personnel, procedures, and equipment. Inspection and 
test records shall, as a minimum, identify the inspector or data 
recorder, the type of observation, the results, the acceptability, and 
the action taken in connection with any deficiencies noted. Records 
shall be identifiable and retrievable. Consistent with applicable 
regulatory requirements, the applicant shall establish requirements 
concerning record retention, such as duration, location, and assigned 
responsibility.

                              XVIII. Audits

    A comprehensive system of planned and periodic audits shall be 
carried out to verify compliance with all aspects of the quality 
assurance program and to determine the effectiveness of the program. The 
audits shall be performed in accordance with the written procedures or 
check lists by appropriately trained personnel not having direct 
responsibilities in the areas being audited. Audit results shall be 
documented and reviewed by management having responsibility in the area 
audited. Followup action, including reaudit of deficient areas, shall be 
taken where indicated.

   Appendix C to Part 50--A Guide for the Financial Data and Related 
Information Required To Establish Financial Qualifications for Facility 
                          Construction Permits

                           General Information

    This appendix is intended to apprise applicants for licenses to 
construct production or utilization facilities of the types described in 
Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22, or testing facilities, of the general kinds 
of financial data and other related information that will demonstrate 
the financial qualification of the applicant to carry out the activities 
for which the permit is sought. The kind and depth of information 
described in this guide is not intended to be a rigid and absolute 
requirement. In some instances, additional pertinent material may be 
needed. In any case, the applicant should include information other than 
that specified, if such information is pertinent to establishing the 
applicant's financial ability to construct the proposed facility.
    It is important to observe also that both Sec. 50.33(f) and this 
appendix distinguish between applicants which are established 
organizations and those which are newly-formed entities organized 
primarily for the purpose of engaging in the activity for which the 
permit is sought. Those in the former category will normally have a 
history of operating experience and be able to submit financial 
statements reflecting the financial results of past operations. With 
respect, however, to

[[Page 746]]

the applicant which is a newly formed company established primarily for 
the purpose of carrying out the licensed activity, with little or no 
prior operating history, somewhat more detailed data and supporting 
documentation will generally be necessary. For this reason, the appendix 
describes separately the scope of information to be included in 
applications by each of these two classes of applicants.
    In determining an applicant's financial qualification, the 
Commission will require the minimum amount of information necessary for 
that purpose. No special forms are prescribed for submitting the 
information. In many cases, the financial information usually contained 
in current annual financial reports, including summary data of prior 
years, will be sufficient for the Commission's needs. The Commission 
reserves the right, however, to require additional financial information 
at the construction permit stage, particularly in cases in which the 
proposed power generating facility will be commonly owned by two or more 
existing companies or in which financing depends upon long-term 
arrangements for sharing of the power from the facility by two or more 
electrical generating companies.
    Applicants are encouraged to consult with the Commission with 
respect to any questions they may have relating to the requirements of 
the Commission's regulations or the information set forth in this 
appendix.

            I. Applicants Which Are Established Organizations

                A. Applications for construction permits

    1. Estimate of construction costs. For electric utilities, each 
applicant's estimate of the total cost of the proposed facility should 
be broken down as follows and be accompanied by a statement describing 
the bases from which the estimate is derived:

(a) Total nuclear production plant costs.....................  $........
                                                                      ..
(b) Transmission, distribution, and general plant costs......  $........
                                                                      ..
(c) Nuclear fuel inventory cost for first core \1\...........  $........
                                                                      ..
                                                              ----------
    Total estimated cost.....................................  $........
                                                                      ..
                                                                        
\1\ Section 2.790 of 10 CFR Part 2 and Sec.  9.5 of 10 CFR Part 9       
  indicate the circumstances under which information submitted by       
  applicants may be withheld from public disclosure.                    

If the fuel is to be acquired by lease or other arrangement than 
purchase, the application should so state. The items to be included in 
these categories should be the same as those defined in the applicable 
electric plant and nuclear fuel inventory accounts prescribed by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or an explanation given as to any 
departure therefrom.
    Since the composition of construction cost estimates for production 
and utilization facilities other than nuclear power reactors will vary 
according to the type of facility, no particular format is suggested for 
submitting such estimates. The estimate should, however, be itemized by 
categories of cost in sufficient detail to permit an evaluation of its 
reasonableness.
    2. Source of construction funds. The application should include a 
brief statement of the applicant's general financial plan for financing 
the cost of the facility, identifying the source or sources upon which 
the applicant relies for the necessary construction funds, e.g., 
internal sources such as undistributed earnings and depreciation 
accruals, or external sources such as borrowings.
    3. Applicant's financial statements. The application should also 
include the applicant's latest published annual financial report, 
together with any current interim financial statements that are 
pertinent. If an annual financial report is not published, the balance 
sheet and operating statement covering the latest complete accounting 
year together with all pertinent notes thereto and certification by a 
public accountant should be furnished.

             II. Applicants Which Are Newly Formed Entities

                A. Applications for construction permits

    1. Estimate of construction costs. The information that will 
normally be required of applicants which are newly formed entities will 
not differ in scope from that required of established organizations. 
Accordingly, applicants should submit estimates as described above for 
established organizations.
    2. Source of construction funds. The application should specifically 
identify the source or sources upon which the applicant relies for the 
funds necessary to pay the cost of constructing the facility, and the 
amount to be obtained from each. With respect to each source, the 
application should describe in detail the applicant's legal and 
financial relationships with its stockholders, corporate affiliates, or 
others (such as financial institutions) upon which the applicant is 
relying for financial assistance. If the sources of funds relied upon 
include parent companies or other corporate affiliates, information to 
support the financial capability of each such company or affiliate to 
meet its commitments to the applicant should be set forth in the 
application. This information should be of the same kind and scope as 
would be required if the parent companies or affiliates were in fact the 
applicant. Ordinarily, it will be necessary that copies of agreements or

[[Page 747]]

contracts among the companies be submitted.

As noted earlier in this appendix, an applicant which is a newly formed 
entity will normally not be in a position to submit the usual types of 
balance sheets and income statements reflecting the results of prior 
operations. The applicant should, however, include in its application a 
statement of its assets, liabilities, and capital structure as of the 
date of the application.

                     III. Annual Financial Statement

    Each holder of a construction permit for a production or utilization 
facility of a type described in Sec. 50.21(b) or Sec. 50.22, or a 
testing facility is required by Sec. 50.71(b) to file its annual 
financial report with the Commission at the time of issuance thereof. 
This requirement does not apply to licensees or holders of construction 
permits for medical and research reactors.

                       IV. Additional Information

    The Commission may, from time to time, request the applicant, 
whether an established organization or newly formed entity, to submit 
additional or more detailed information respecting its financial 
arrangements and status of funds if such information is deemed necessary 
to enable the Commiasion to determine an applicant's financial 
qualifications for the license.

                             I. Introduction

    Each applicant for a construction permit is required by 
Sec. 50.34(a) to include in the preliminary safety analysis report a 
discussion of preliminary plans for coping with emergencies. Each 
applicant for an operating license is required by Sec. 50.34(b) to 
include in the final safety analysis report plans for coping with 
emergencies.
    This appendix establishes minimum requirements for emergency plans 
for use in attaining an acceptable state of emergency preparedness. 
These plans shall be described generally in the preliminary safety 
analysis report and submitted as part of the final safety analysis 
report.
    The potential radiological hazards to the public associated with the 
operation of research and test reactors and fuel facilities licensed 
under 10 CFR Parts 50 and 70 involve considerations different than those 
associated with nuclear power reactors. Consequently, the size of 
Emergency Planning Zones<SUP>1 (EPZs) for facilities other than power 
reactors and the degree to which compliance with the requirements of 
this section and sections II, III, IV, and V as necessary will be 
determined on a case-by-case basis.<SUP>2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 EPZs for power reactors are discussed in NUREG-0396; EPA 520/1-78-
016, ``Planning Basis for the Development of State and Local Government 
Radiological Emergency Response Plans in Support of Light Water Nuclear 
Power Plants,'' December 1978. The size of the EPZs for a nuclear power 
plant shall be determined in relation to local emergency response needs 
and capabilities as they are affected by such conditions as demography, 
topography, land characteristics, access routes, and jurisdictional 
boundaries. The size of the EPZs also may be determined on a case-by-
case basis for gas-cooled nuclear reactors and for reactors with an 
authorized power level less than 250 MW thermal. Generally, the plume 
exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power plants with an authorized power 
level greater than 250 MW thermal shall consist of an area about 10 
miles (16 km) in radius and the ingestion pathway EPZ shall consist of 
an area about 50 miles (80 km) in radius.
    <SUP>2 Regulatory Guide 2.6 will be used as guidance for the 
acceptability of research and test reactor emergency response plans.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, in the case of an operating 
license authorizing only fuel loading and/or low power operations up to 
5% of rated power, no NRC or FEMA review, findings, or determinations 
concerning the state of offsite emergency preparedness or the adequacy 
of and the capability to implement State and local offsite emergency 
plans, as defined in this Appendix, are required prior to the issuance 
of such a license.

               II. The Preliminary Safety Analysis Report

    The Preliminary Safety Analysis Report shall contain sufficient 
information to ensure the compatibility of proposed emergency plans for 
both onsite areas and the EPZs, with facility design features, site 
layout, and site location with respect to such considerations as access 
routes, surrounding population distributions, land use, and local 
jurisdictional boundaries for the EPZs in the case of nuclear power 
reactors as well as the

[[Page 748]]

means by which the standards of Sec. 50.47(b) will be met.
    As a minimum, the following items shall be described:
    A. Onsite and offsite organizations for coping with emergencies and 
the means for notification, in the event of an emergency, of persons 
assigned to the emergency organizations.
    B. Contacts and arrangements made and documented with local, State, 
and Federal governmental agencies with responsibility for coping with 
emergencies, including identification of the principal agencies.
    C. Protective measures to be taken within the site boundary and 
within each EPZ to protect health and safety in the event of an 
accident; procedures by which these measures are to be carried out 
(e.g., in the case of an evacuation, who authorizes the evacuation, how 
the public is to be notified and instructed, how the evacuation is to be 
carried out); and the expected response of offsite agencies in the event 
of an emergency.
    D. Features of the facility to be provided for onsite emergency 
first aid and decontamination and for emergency transportation of onsite 
individuals to offsite treatment facilities.
    E. Provisions to be made for emergency treatment at offsite 
facilities of individuals injured as a result of licensed activities.
    F. Provisions for a training program for employees of the licensee, 
including those who are assigned specific authority and responsibility 
in the event of an emergency, and for other persons who are not 
employees of the licensee but whose assistance may be needed in the 
event of a radiological emergency.
    G. A preliminary analysis that projects the time and means to be 
employed in the notification of State and local governments and the 
public in the event of an emergency. A nuclear power plant applicant 
shall perform a preliminary analysis of the time required to evacuate 
various sectors and distances within the plume exposure pathway EPZ for 
transient and permanent populations, noting major impediments to the 
evacuation or taking of protective actions.
    H. A preliminary analysis reflecting the need to include facilities, 
systems, and methods for identifying the degree of seriousness and 
potential scope of radiological consequences of emergency situations 
within and outside the site boundary, including capabilities for dose 
projection using real-time meteorological information and for dispatch 
of radiological monitoring teams within the EPZs; and a preliminary 
analysis reflecting the role of the onsite technical support center and 
of the near-site emergency operations facility in assessing information, 
recommending protective action, and disseminating information to the 
public.

                  III. The Final Safety Analysis Report

    The Final Safety Analysis Report shall contain the plans for coping 
with emergencies. The plans shall be an expression of the overall 
concept of operation; they shall describe the essential elements of 
advance planning that have been considered and the provisions that have 
been made to cope with emergency situations. The plans shall incorporate 
information about the emergency response roles of supporting 
organizations and offsite agencies. That information shall be sufficient 
to provide assurance of coordination among the supporting groups and 
with the licensee.
    The plans submitted must include a description of the elements set 
out in Section IV for the Emergency Planning Zones (EPZs) to an extent 
sufficient to demonstrate that the plans provide reasonable assurance 
that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of 
an emergency.

                     IV. Content of Emergency Plans

    The applicant's emergency plans shall contain, but not necessarily 
be limited to, information needed to demonstrate compliance with the 
elements set forth below, i.e., organization for coping with radiation 
emergencies, assessment action, activation of emergency organization, 
notification procedures, emergency facilities and equipment, training, 
maintaining emergency preparedness, and recovery. In addition, the 
emergency response plans submitted by an applicant for a nuclear power 
reactor operating license shall contain information needed to 
demonstrate compliance with the standards described in Sec. 50.47(b), 
and they will be evaluated against those standards. The nuclear power 
reactor operating license applicant shall also provide an analysis of 
the time required to evacuate and for taking other protective actions 
for various sectors and distances within the plume exposure pathway EPZ 
for transient and permanent populations.

                             A. Organization

    The organization for coping with radiological emergencies shall be 
described, including definition of authorities, responsibilities, and 
duties of individuals assigned to the licensee's emergency organization 
and the means for notification of such individuals in the event of an 
emergency. Specifically, the following shall be included:
    1. A description of the normal plant operating organization.
    2. A description of the onsite emergency response organization with 
a detailed discussion of:
    a. Authorities, responsibilities, and duties of the individual(s) 
who will take charge during an emergency;
    b. Plant staff emergency assignments;

[[Page 749]]

    c. Authorities, responsibilities, and duties on an onsite emergency 
coordinator who shall be in charge of the exchange of information with 
offsite authorities responsible for coordinating and implementing 
offsite emergency measures.
    3. A description, by position and function to be performed, of the 
licensee's headquarters personnel who will be sent to the plant site to 
augment the onsite emergency organization.
    4. Identification, by position and function to be performed, of 
persons within the licensee organization who will be responsible for 
making offsite dose projections, and a description of how these 
projections will be made and the results transmitted to State and local 
authorities, NRC, and other appropriate governmental entities.
    5. Identification, by position and function to be performed, of 
other employees of the licensee with special qualifications for coping 
with emergency conditions that may arise. Other persons with special 
qualifications, such as consultants, who are not employees of the 
licensee and who may be called upon for assistance for emergencies shall 
also be identified. The special qualifications of these persons shall be 
described.
    6. A description of the local offsite services to be provided in 
support of the licensee's emergency organization.
    7. Identification of, and assistance expected from, appropriate 
State, local, and Federal agencies with responsibilities for coping with 
emergencies.
    8. Identification of the State and/or local officials responsible 
for planning for, ordering, and controlling appropriate protective 
actions, including evacuations when necessary.

                          B. Assessment Actions

    The means to be used for determining the magnitude of and for 
continually assessing the impact of the release of radioactive materials 
shall be described, including emergency action levels that are to be 
used as criteria for determining the need for notification and 
participation of local and State agencies, the Commission, and other 
Federal agencies, and the emergency action levels that are to be used 
for determining when and what type of protective measures should be 
considered within and outside the site boundary to protect health and 
safety. The emergency action levels shall be based on in-plant 
conditions and instrumentation in addition to onsite and offsite 
monitoring. These emergency action levels shall be discussed and agreed 
on by the applicant and State and local governmental authorities and 
approved by NRC. They shall also be reviewed with the State and local 
governmental authorities on an annual basis.

                 C. Activation of Emergency Organization

    The entire spectrum of emergency conditions that involve the 
alerting or activating of progressively larger segments of the total 
emergency organization shall be described. The communication steps to be 
taken to alert or activate emergency personnel under each class of 
emergency shall be described. Emergency action levels (based not only on 
onsite and offsite radiation monitoring information but also on readings 
from a number of sensors that indicate a potential emergency, such as 
the pressure in containment and the response of the Emergency Core 
Cooling System) for notification of offsite agencies shall be described. 
The existence, but not the details, of a message authentication scheme 
shall be noted for such agencies. The emergency classes defined shall 
include: (1) notification of unusual events, (2) alert, (3) site area 
emergency, and (4) general emergency. These classes are further 
discussed in NUREG-0654; FEMA-REP-1.

                       D. Notification Procedures

    1. Administrative and physical means for notifying local, State, and 
Federal officials and agencies and agreements reached with these 
officials and agencies for the prompt notification of the public and for 
public evacuation or other protective measures, should they become 
necessary, shall be described. This description shall include 
identification of the appropriate officials, by title and agency, of the 
State and local government agencies within the EPZs.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 See footnote 1 to section I.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Provisions shall be described for yearly dissemination to the 
public within the plume exposure pathway EPZ of basic emergency planning 
information, such as the methods and times required for public 
notification and the protective actions planned if an accident occurs, 
general information as to the nature and effects of radiation, and a 
listing of local broadcast stations that will be used for dissemination 
of information during an emergency. Signs or other measures shall also 
be used to disseminate to any transient population within the plume 
exposure pathway EPZ appropriate information that would be helpful if an 
accident occurs.
    3. A licensee shall have the capability to notify responsible State 
and local governmental agencies within 15 minutes after declaring an 
emergency. The licensee shall demonstrate that the State/local officials 
have the capability to make a public notification decision promptly on 
being informed by the licensee of an emergency condition.

[[Page 750]]

By February 1, 1982, each nuclear power reactor licensee shall 
demonstrate that administrative and physical means have been established 
for alerting and providing prompt instructions to the public within the 
plume exposure pathway EPZ. The four-month period in 10 CFR 50.54(s)(2) 
for the correction of emergency plan deficiencies shall not apply to the 
initial installation of this public notification system that is required 
by February 1, 1982. The four-month period will apply to correction of 
deficiencies identified during the initial installation and testing of 
the prompt public notification systems as well as those deficiencies 
discovered thereafter. The design objective of the prompt public 
notification system shall be to have the capability to essentially 
complete the initial notification of the public within the plume 
exposure pathway EPZ within about 15 minutes. The use of this 
notification capability will range from immediate notification of the 
public (within 15 minutes of the time that State and local officials are 
notified that a situation exists requiring urgent action) to the more 
likely events where there is substantial time available for the State 
and local governmental officials to make a judgment whether or not to 
activate the public notification system. Where there is a decision to 
activate the notification system, the State and local officials will 
determine whether to activate the entire notification system 
simultaneously or in a graduated or staged manner. The responsibility 
for activating such a public notification system shall remain with the 
appropriate governmental authorities.

                  E. Emergency Facilities and Equipment

    Adequate provisions shall be made and described for emergency 
facilities and equipment, including:
    1. Equipment at the site for personnel monitoring;
    2. Equipment for determining the magnitude of and for continuously 
assessing the impact of the release of radioactive materials to the 
environment;
    3. Facilities and supplies at the site for decontamination of onsite 
individuals;
    4. Facilities and medical supplies at the site for appropriate 
emergency first aid treatment;
    5. Arrangements for the services of physicians and other medical 
personnel qualified to handle radiation emergencies on-site;
    6. Arrangements for transportation of contaminated injured 
individuals from the site to specifically identified treatment 
facilities outside the site boundary;
    7. Arrangements for treatment of individuals injured in support of 
licensed activities on the site at treatment facilities outside the site 
boundary;
    8. A licensee onsite technical support center and a licensee near-
site emergency operations facility from which effective direction can be 
given and effective control can be exercised during an emergency;
    9. At least one onsite and one offsite communications system; each 
system shall have a backup power source.
    All communication plans shall have arrangements for emergencies, 
including titles and alternates for those in charge at both ends of the 
communication links and the primary and backup means of communication. 
Where consistent with the function of the governmental agency, these 
arrangements will include:
    a. Provision for communications with contiguous State/local 
governments within the plume exposure pathway EPZ. Such communications 
shall be tested monthly.
    b. Provision for communications with Federal emergency response 
organizations. Such communications systems shall be tested annually.
    c. Provision for communications among the nuclear power reactor 
control room, the onsite technical support center, and the near-site 
emergency operations facility; and among the nuclear facility, the 
principal State and local emergency operations centers, and the field 
assessment teams. Such communications systems shall be tested annually.
    d. Provisions for communications by the licensee with NRC 
Headquarters and the appropriate NRC Regional Office Operations Center 
from the nuclear power reactor control room, the onsite technical 
support center, and the near-site emergency operations facility. Such 
communications shall be tested monthly.

                              F. Training.

    1. The program to provide for: (a) The training of employees and 
exercising, by periodic drills, of radiation emergency plans to ensure 
that employees of the licensee are familiar with their specific 
emergency response duties, and (b) The participation in the training and 
drills by other persons whose assistance may be needed in the event of a 
radiation emergency shall be described. This shall include a description 
of specialized initial training and periodic retraining programs to be 
provided to each of the following categories of emergency personnel:
    i. Directors and/or coordinators of the plant emergency 
organization;
    ii. Personnel responsible for accident assessment, including control 
room shift personnel;
    iii Radiological monitoring teams;
    iv. Fire control teams (fire brigades);
    v. Repair and damage control teams;
    vi. First aid and rescue teams;
    vii. Medical support personnel;
    viii. Licensee's headquarters support personnel;
    ix. Security personnel.

[[Page 751]]

    In addition, a radiological orientation training program shall be 
made available to local services personnel; e.g., local emergency 
services/Civil Defense, local law enforcement personnel, local news 
media persons.
    2. The plan shall describe provisions for the conduct of emergency 
preparedness exercises as follows: Exercises shall test the adequacy of 
timing and content of implementing procedures and methods, test 
emergency equipment and communications networks, test the public 
notification system, and ensure that emergency organization personnel 
are familiar with their duties.<SUP>3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Use of site specific simulators or computers is acceptable for 
any exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    a. A full participation <SUP>4 exercise which tests as much of the 
licensee, State and local emergency plans as is reasonably achievable 
without mandatory public participation shall be conducted for each site 
at which a power reactor is located. This exercise shall be conducted 
within two years before the issuance of the first operating license for 
full power (one authorizing operation above 5% of rated power) of the 
first reactor and shall include participation by each State and local 
government within the plume exposure pathway EPZ and each state within 
the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ. If the full participation exercise 
is conducted more than one year prior to issuance of an operating 
licensee for full power, an exercise which tests the licensee's onsite 
emergency plans shall be conducted within one year before issuance of an 
operating license for full power. This exercise need not have State or 
local government participation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ ``Full participation'' when used in conjunction with emergency 
preparedness exercises for a particular site means appropriate offsite 
local and State authorities and licensee personnel physically and 
actively take part in testing their integrated capability to adequately 
assess and respond to an accident at a commercial nuclear power plant. 
``Full participation'' includes testing major observable portions of the 
onsite and offsite emergency plans and mobilization of state, local and 
licensee personnel and other resources in sufficient numbers to verify 
the capability to respond to the accident scenario.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    b. Each licensee at each site shall conduct an exercise of its 
onsite emergency plan every 2 years. The exercise may be included in the 
full participation biennial exercise required by paragraph 2.c. of this 
section. In addition, the licensee shall take actions necessary to 
ensure that adequate emergency response capabilities are maintained 
during the interval between biennial exercises by conducting drills, 
including at least one drill involving a combination of some of the 
principal functional areas of the licensee's onsite emergency response 
capabilities. The principal functional areas of emergency response 
include activities such as management and coordination of emergency 
response, accident assessment, protective action decisionmaking, and 
plant system repair and corrective actions. During these drills, 
activation of all of the licensee's emergency response facilities 
(Technical Support Center (TSC), Operations Support Center (OSC), and 
the Emergency Operations Facility (EOF)) would not be necessary, 
licensees would have the opportunity to consider accident management 
strategies, supervised instruction would be permitted, operating staff 
would have the opportunity to resolve problems (success paths) rather 
than have controllers intervene, and the drills could focus on onsite 
training objectives.
    c. Offsite plans for each site shall be exercised biennially with 
full participation by each offsite authority having a role under the 
plan. Where the offsite authority has a role under a radiological 
response plan for more than one site, it shall fully participate in one 
exercise every two years and shall, at least, partially participate 
<SUP>5 in other offsite plan exercises in this period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ ``Partial participation'' when used in conjunction with 
emergency preparedness exercises for a particular site means appropriate 
offsite authorities shall actively take part in the exercise sufficient 
to test direction and control functions; i.e., (a) protective action 
decision making related to emergency action levels, and (b) 
communication capabilities among affected State and local authorities 
and the licensee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    d. A State should fully participate in the ingestion pathway portion 
of exercises at least once every six years. In States with more than one 
site, the State should rotate this participation from site to site.
    e. Licensees shall enable any State or local Government located 
within the plume exposure pathway EPZ to participate in the licensee's 
drills when requested by such State or local Government.
    f. Remedial exercises will be required if the emergency plan is not 
satisfactorily tested during the biennial exercise, such that NRC, in 
consultation with FEMA, cannot find reasonable assurance that adequate 
protective measures can be taken in the event of a radiological 
emergency. The extent of State and local participation in remedial 
exercises must be sufficient to show that appropriate corrective 
measures have been taken regarding the elements of the plan not properly 
tested in the previous exercises.

[[Page 752]]

    g. All training, including exercises, shall provide for formal 
critiques in order to identify weak or deficient areas that need 
correction. Any weaknesses or deficiencies that are identified shall be 
corrected.
    h. The participation of State and local governments in an emergency 
exercise is not required to the extent that the applicant has identified 
those governments as refusing to participate further in emergency 
planning activities, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.47(c)(1). In such cases, an 
exercise shall be held with the applicant or licensee and such 
governmental entities as elect to participate in the emergency planning 
process.

                  G. Maintaining Emergency Preparedness

    Provisions to be employed to ensure that the emergency plan, its 
implementing procedures, and emergency equipment and supplies are 
maintained up to date shall be described.

                               H. Recovery

    Criteria to be used to determine when, following an accident, 
reentry of the facility would be appropriate or when operation could be 
resumed shall be described.

                       V. Implementing Procedures

    No less than 180 days prior to the scheduled issuance of an 
operating license for a nuclear power reactor or a license to possess 
nuclear material the applicant's detailed implementing procedures for 
its emergency plan shall be submitted to the Commission as specified in 
Sec. 50.4. Licensees who are authorized to operate a nuclear power 
facility shall submit any changes to the emergency plan or procedures to 
the Commission, as specified in Sec. 50.4, within 30 days of such 
changes.

                   VI. Emergency Response Data System

    1. The Emergency Response Data System (ERDS) is a direct near real-
time electronic data link between the licensee's onsite computer system 
and the NRC Operations Center that provides for the automated 
transmission of a limited data set of selected parameters. The ERDS 
supplements the existing voice transmission over the Emergency 
Notification System (ENS) by providing the NRC Operations Center with 
timely and accurate updates of a limited set of parameters from the 
licensee's installed onsite computer system in the event of an 
emergency. When selected plant data are not available on the licensee's 
onsite computer system, retrofitting of data points is not required. The 
licensee shall test the ERDS periodically to verify system availability 
and operability. The frequency of ERDS testing will be quarterly unless 
otherwise set by NRC based on demonstrated system performance.
    2. Except for Big Rock Point and all nuclear power facilities that 
are shut down permanently or indefinitely, onsite hardware shall be 
provided at each unit by the licensee to interface with the NRC 
receiving system. Software, which will be made available by the NRC, 
will assemble the data to be transmitted and transmit data from each 
unit via an output port on the appropriate data system. The hardware and 
software must have the following characteristics:
    a. Data points, if resident in the in-plant computer systems, must 
be transmitted for four selected types of plant conditions: Reactor core 
and coolant system conditions; reactor containment conditions; 
radioactivity release rates; and plant meteorological tower data. A 
separate data feed is required for each reactor unit. While it is 
recognized that ERDS is not a safety system, it is conceivable that a 
licensee's ERDS interface could communicate with a safety system. In 
this case, appropriate isolation devices would be required at these 
interfaces.\6\ The data points, identified in the following parameters 
will be transmitted:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See 10 CFR 50.55a(h) Protection Systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) For pressurized water reactors (PWRs), the selected plant 
parameters are: (1) Primary coolant system: pressure, temperatures (hot 
leg, cold leg, and core exit thermocouples), subcooling margin, 
pressurizer level, reactor coolant charging/makeup flow, reactor vessel 
level, reactor coolant flow, and reactor power; (2) Secondary coolant 
system: Steam generator levels and pressures, main feedwater flows, and 
auxiliary and emergency feedwater flows; (3) Safety injection: High- and 
low-pressure safety injection flows, safety injection flows 
(Westinghouse), and borated water storage tank level; (4) Containment: 
pressure, temperatures, hydrogen concentration, and sump levels; (5) 
Radiation monitoring system: Reactor coolant radioactivity, containment 
radiation level, condenser air removal radiation level, effluent 
radiation monitors, and process radiation monitor levels; and (6)

      Appendix F to Part 50--Policy Relating to the Siting of Fuel 
       Reprocessing Plants and Related Waste Management Facilities

    1. Public health and safety considerations relating to licensed fuel 
reprocessing plants do not require that such facilities be located on 
land owned and controlled by the Federal Government. Such plants, 
including the facilities for the temporary storage of highlevel 
radioactive wastes, may be located on privately owned property.
    2. A fuel reprocessing plant's inventory of high-level liquid 
radioactive wastes will be limited to that produced in the prior 5 
years. (For the purpose of this statement of policy, ``high-level liquid 
radioactive wastes'' means those aqueous wastes resulting from the 
operation of the first cycle solvent extraction system, or equivalent, 
and the concentrated wastes from subsequent extraction cycles, or 
equivalent, in a facility for reprocessing irradiated reactor fuels.) 
High-level liquid radioactive wastes shall be converted to a dry solid 
as required to comply with this inventory limitation, and placed in a 
sealed container prior to transfer to a Federal repository in a shipping 
cask meeting the requirements of 10 CFR Part 71. The dry solid shall be 
chemically, thermally, and radiolytically stable to the extent that the 
equilibrium pressure in the sealed container will not exceed the safe 
operating pressure for that container during the period from canning 
through a minimum of 90 days after receipt (transfer of physical 
custody) at the Federal repository. All of these high-level radioactive 
wastes shall be transferred to a Federal repository no later than 10 
years following separation of fission products from the irradiated fuel. 
Upon receipt, the Federal repository will assume permanent custody of 
these radioactive waste materials although industry will pay the Federal 
Government a charge which together with interest on unexpended balances 
will be designed to defray all costs of disposal and perpetual 
surveillance. The Department of Energy will take title to the 
radioactive waste material upon transfer to a Federal repository. Before 
retirement of the reprocessing plant from operational status and before 
termination of licensing pursuant to Sec. 50.82, transfer of all

[[Page 754]]

such wastes to a Federal repository shall be completed. Federal 
repositories, which will be limited in number, will be designated later 
by the Commission.
    3. Disposal of high-level radioactive fission product waste material 
will not be permitted on any land other than that owned and controlled 
by the Federal Government.
    4. A design objective for fuel reprocessing plants shall be to 
facilitate decontamination and removal of all significant radioactive 
wastes at the time the facility is permanently decommissioned. Criteria 
for the extent of decontamination to be required upon decommissioning 
and license termination will be developed in consultation with competent 
groups. Opportunity will be afforded for public comment before such 
criteria are made effective.
    5. Applicants proposing to operate fuel reprocessing plants, in 
submitting information concerning financial qualifications as required 
by Sec. 50.33(f), shall include information enabling the Commission to 
determine whether the applicant is financially qualified, among other 
things, to provide for the removal and disposal of radioactive wastes, 
during operation and upon decommissioning of the facility, in accordance 
with the Commission's regulations, including the requirements set out in 
this appendix.
    6. With respect to fuel reprocessing plants already licensed, the 
licenses will be appropriately conditioned to carry out the purposes of 
the policy stated above with respect to high-level radioactive fission 
product wastes generated after installation of new equipment for interim 
storage of liquid wastes, or after installation of equipment required 
for solidification without interim liquid storage. In either case, such 
equipment shall be installed at the earliest practicable date, taking 
into account the time required for design, procurement and installation 
thereof. With respect to such plants, the application of the policy 
stated in this appendix to existing wastes and to wastes generated prior 
to the installation of such equipment, will be the subject of a further 
rulemaking proceeding.

         Appendix G to Part 50--Fracture Toughness Requirements

I. Introduction and scope.
II. Definitions.
III. Fracture toughness tests.
IV. Fracture toughness requirements.

                        I. Introduction and Scope

    This appendix specifies fracture toughness requirements for ferritic 
materials of pressure-retaining components of the reactor coolant 
pressure boundary of light water nuclear power reactors to provide 
adequate margins of safety during any condition of normal operation, 
including anticipated operational occurrences and system hydrostatic 
tests, to which the pressure boundary may be subjected over its service 
lifetime.
    The ASME Code forms the basis for the requirements of this appendix. 
``ASME Code'' means the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code. If no section is specified, the reference is 
to Section III, Division 1, ``Rules for Construction of Nuclear Power 
Plant Components.'' ``Section XI'' means Section XI, Division 1, ``Rules 
for Inservice Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components.'' If no 
edition or addenda are specified, the ASME Code edition and addenda and 
any limitations and modifications thereof, which are specified in 
Sec. 50.55a, are applicable.
    The sections, editions and addenda of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code specified in Sec. 50.55a have been approved for 
incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register. A 
notice of any changes made to the material incorporated by reference 
will be published in the Federal Register. Copies of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code may be purchased from the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, United Engineering Center, 345 East 47th Street, 
New York, NY 10017, and are available for inspection at the NRC Library, 
11545 Rockville Pike, Two White Flint North, Rockville, MD 20852-2738.
    The requirements of this appendix apply to the following materials:
    A. Carbon and low-alloy ferritic steel plate, forgings, castings, 
and pipe with specified minimum yield strengths not over 50,000 psi (345 
MPa), and to those with specified minimum yield strengths greater than 
50,000 psi (345 MPa) but not over 90,000 psi (621 MPa) if qualified by 
using methods equivalent to those described in paragraph G-2110 of 
Appendix G of Section XI of the latest edition and addenda of the ASME 
Code incorporated by reference into Sec. 50.55a(b)(2).
    B. Welds and weld heat-affected zones in the materials specified in 
paragraph I.A. of this appendix.
    C. Materials for bolting and other types of fasteners with specified 
minimum yield strengths not over 130,000 psi (896 MPa).

    Note: The adequacy of the fracture toughness of other ferritic 
materials not covered in this section must be demonstrated to the 
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, on an individual case 
basis.

                             II. Definitions

    A. Ferritic material means carbon and low-alloy steels, higher alloy 
steels including all stainless alloys of the 4xx series, and maraging 
and precipitation hardening steels

[[Page 755]]

with a predominantly body-centered cubic crystal structure.
    B. System hydrostatic tests means all preoperational system leakage 
and hydrostatic pressure tests and all system leakage and hydrostatic 
pressure tests performed during the service life of the pressure 
boundary in compliance with the ASME Code, Section XI.
    C. Specified minimum yield strength means the minimum yield strength 
(in the unirradiated condition) of a material specified in the 
construction code under which the component is built under Sec. 50.55a.
    D. RT<INF>NDT means the reference temperature of the material, for 
all conditions.
    (i) For the pre-service or unirradiated condition, RT<INF>NDT is 
evaluated according to the procedures in the ASME Code, Paragraph NB-
2331.
    (ii) For the reactor vessel beltline materials, RT<INF>NDT must 
account for the effects of neutron radiation.
    E. RT<INF>NDT means the transition temperature shift, or change in 
RT<INF>NDT, due to neutron radiation effects, which is evaluated as the 
difference in the 30 ft-lb (41 J) index temperatures from the average 
Charpy curves measured before and after irradiation.
    F. Beltline or Beltline region of reactor vessel means the region of 
the reactor vessel (shell material including welds, heat affected zones, 
and plates or forgings) that directly surrounds the effective height of 
the active core and adjacent regions of the reactor vessel that are 
predicted to experience sufficient neutron radiation damage to be 
considered in the selection of the most limiting material with regard to 
radiation damage.

                      III. Fracture Toughness Tests

    A. To demonstrate compliance with the fracture toughness 
requirements of Section IV of this appendix, ferritic materials must be 
tested in accordance with the ASME Code and, for the beltline materials, 
the test requirements of Appendix H of this part. For a reactor vessel 
that was constructed to an ASME Code earlier than the Summer 1972 
Addenda of the 1971 Edition (under Sec. 50.55a), the fracture toughness 
data and data analyses must be supplemented in a manner approved by the 
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, to demonstrate 
equivalence with the fracture toughness requirements of this appendix.
    B. Test methods for supplemental fracture toughness tests described 
in paragraph IV.A.1.b of this appendix must be submitted to and approved 
by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, prior to testing.
    C. All fracture toughness test programs conducted in accordance with 
paragraphs III.A and III.B must comply with ASME Code requirements for 
calibration of test equipment, qualification of test personnel, and 
retention of records of these functions and of the test data.

                   IV. Fracture Toughness Requirements

    A. The pressure-retaining components of the reactor coolant pressure 
boundary that are made of ferritic materials must meet the requirements 
of the ASME Code, supplemented by the additional requirements set forth 
below, for fracture toughness during system hydrostatic tests and any 
condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational 
occurrences. Reactor vessels may continue to be operated only for that 
service period within which the requirements of this section are 
satisfied. For the reactor vessel beltline materials, including welds, 
plates and forgings, the values of RT<INF>NDT and Charpy upper-shelf 
energy must account for the effects of neutron radiation, including the 
results of the surveillance program of Appendix H of this part. The 
effects of neutron radiation must consider the radiation conditions 
(i.e., the fluence) at the deepest point on the crack front of the flaw 
assumed in the analysis.

        1. Reactor Vessel Charpy Upper-Shelf Energy Requirements

    a. Reactor vessel beltline materials must have Charpy upper-shelf 
energy,<SUP>1 in the transverse direction for base material and along 
the weld for weld material according to the ASME Code, of no less than 
75 ft-lb (102 J) initially and must maintain Charpy upper-shelf energy 
throughout the life of the vessel of no less than 50 ft-lb (68 J), 
unless it is demonstrated in a manner approved by the Director, Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, that lower values of Charpy upper-shelf 
energy will provide margins of safety against fracture equivalent to 
those required by Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code. This 
analysis must use the latest edition and addenda of the ASME Code 
incorporated by reference into Sec. 50.55a(b)(2) at the time the 
analysis is submitted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Defined in ASTM E 185-79 and -82 which are incorporated by 
reference in Appendix H to Part 50.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    b. Additional evidence of the fracture toughness of the beltline 
materials after exposure to neutron irradiation may be obtained from 
results of supplemental fracture toughness tests for use in the analysis 
specified in section IV.A.1.a.
    c. The analysis for satisfying the requirements of section IV.A.1 of 
this appendix must be submitted, as specified in Sec. 50.4, for review 
and approval on an individual case basis at least three years prior to 
the date when the predicted Charpy upper-shelf energy will no longer 
satisfy the requirements of section IV.A.1 of this appendix, or on a

[[Page 756]]

schedule approved by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.

   2. Pressure-Temperature Limits and Minimum Temperature Requirements

    a. Pressure-temperature limits and minimum temperature requirements 
for the reactor vessel are given in Table 3, and are defined by the 
operating condition (i.e., hydrostatic pressure and leak tests, or 
normal operation including anticipated operational occurrences), the 
vessel pressure, whether or not fuel is in the vessel, and whether the 
core is critical. In Table 3, the vessel pressure is defined as a 
percentage of the preservice system hydrostatic test pressure. The 
appropriate requirements on both the pressure-temperature limits and the 
minimum permissible temperature must be met for all conditions.
    b. The pressure-temperature limits identified as ``ASME Appendix G 
limits'' in Table 3 require that the limits must be at least as 
conservative as limits obtained by following the methods of analysis and 
the margins of safety of Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code.
    c. The minimum temperature requirements given in Table 3 pertain to 
the controlling material, which is either the material in the closure 
flange or the material in the beltline region with the highest reference 
temperature. As specified in Table 3, the minimum temperature 
requirements and the controlling material depend on the operating 
condition (i.e., hydrostatic pressure and leak tests, or normal 
operation including anticipated operational occurrences), the vessel 
pressure, whether fuel is in the vessel, and whether the core is 
critical. The metal temperature of the controlling material, in the 
region of the controlling material which has the least favorable 
combination of stress and temperature, must exceed the appropriate 
minimum temperature requirement for the condition and pressure of the 
vessel specified in Table 1.
    d. Pressure tests and leak tests of the reactor vessel that are 
required by Section XI of the ASME Code must be completed before the 
core is critical.
    B. If the procedures of Section IV.A. of this appendix do not 
indicate the existence of an equivalent safety margin, the reactor 
vessel beltline may be given a thermal annealing treatment to recover 
the fracture toughness of the material, subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 50.66. The reactor vessel may continue to be operated only for that 
service period within which the predicted fracture toughness of the 
beltline region materials satisfies the requirements of Section IV.A. of 
this appendix using the values of RT<INF>NDT and Charpy upper-shelf 
energy that include the effects of annealing and subsequent irradiation.

  Appendix H to Part 50--Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program 
                              Requirements

I. Introduction
II. Definitions
III. Surveillance Program Criteria
IV. Report of Test Results

                             I. Introduction

    The purpose of the material surveillance program required by this 
appendix is to monitor changes in the fracture toughness properties of 
ferritic materials in the reactor vessel beltline region of light water 
nuclear power reactors which result from exposure of these materials to 
neutron irradiation and the thermal environment. Under the program, 
fracture toughness test data are obtained from material specimens 
exposed in surveillance capsules, which are withdrawn periodically from 
the reactor vessel. These data will be used as described in Section IV 
of Appendix G to Part 50.
    ASTM E 185-73, -79, and -82, ``Standard Practice for Conducting 
Surveillance Tests for Light-Water Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor 
Vessels,'' which are referenced in the following paragraphs, have been 
approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal 
Register. Copies of ASTM E 185-73, -79, and -82, may be purchased from 
the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, 
Philadelphia, PA 19103 and are available for inspection at the NRC 
Library, 11545 Rockville Pike, Two White Flint North, Rockville, MD 
20852-2738.

                             II. Definitions

    All terms used in this Appendix have the same meaning as in Appendix 
G.

                   III. Surveillance Program Criteria

    A. No material surveillance program is required for reactor vessels 
for which it can be conservatively demonstrated by analytical methods 
applied to experimental data and tests performed on comparable vessels, 
making appropriate allowances for all uncertainties in the measurements, 
that the peak neutron fluence at the end of the design life of the 
vessel will not exceed 10<SUP>17 n/cm<SUP>2 (E > 1 MeV).
    B. Reactor vessels that do not meet the conditions of paragraph 
III.A of this appendix must have their beltline materials monitored by a 
surveillance program complying with ASTM E 185, as modified by this 
appendix.
    1. The design of the surveillance program and the withdrawal 
schedule must meet the requirements of the edition of ASTM E 185 that is 
current on the issue date of the ASME Code to which the reactor vessel 
was purchased. Later editions of ASTM E 185 may be used, but including 
only those editions through 1982. For each capsule withdrawal, the test 
procedures and reporting requirements must meet the requirements of ASTM 
E 185-82 to the extent practicable for the configuration of the 
specimens in the capsule.
    2. Surveillance specimen capsules must be located near the inside 
vessel wall in the beltline region so that the specimen irradiation 
history duplicates, to the extent practicable within the physical 
constraints of the system, the neutron spectrum, temperature history, 
and maximum neutron fluence experienced by the reactor vessel inner 
surface. If the capsule holders are attached to the vessel wall or to 
the vessel cladding, construction and inservice inspection of the 
attachments and attachment welds must be done according to the 
requirements for permanent structural attachments to reactor vessels 
given in Sections III and XI of the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code). The design and 
location of the capsule holders must permit insertion of replacement 
capsules. Accelerated irradiation capsules may be used in addition to 
the required number of surveillance capsules.
    3. A proposed withdrawal schedule must be submitted with a technical 
justification as specified in Sec. 50.4. The proposed schedule must be 
approved prior to implementation.
    C. Requirements for an Integrated Surveillance Program.
    1. In an integrated surveillance program, the representative 
materials chosen for surveillance for a reactor are irradiated in one or 
more other reactors that have similar design and operating features. 
Integrated surveillance programs must be approved by the Director, 
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, on a case-by-case basis. Criteria 
for approval include the following:
    a. The reactor in which the materials will be irradiated and the 
reactor for which the materials are being irradiated must have 
sufficiently similar design and operating features to permit accurate 
comparisons of the predicted amount of radiation damage.
    b. Each reactor must have an adequate dosimetry program.
    c. There must be adequate arrangement for data sharing between 
plants.
    d. There must be a contingency plan to assure that the surveillance 
program for each reactor will not be jeopardized by operation at reduced 
power level or by an extended outage of another reactor from which data 
are expected.
    e. There must be substantial advantages to be gained, such as 
reduced power outages or reduced personnel exposure to radiation, as a 
direct result of not requiring surveillance capsules in all reactors in 
the set.

[[Page 759]]

    2. No reduction in the requirements for number of materials to be 
irradiated, specimen types, or number of specimens per reactor is 
permitted.
    3. After (the effective date of this section), no reduction in the 
amount of testing is permitted unless previously authorized by the 
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.

                       IV. Report of Test Results

    A. Each capsule withdrawal and the test results must be the subject 
of a summary technical report to be submitted, as specified in 
Sec. 50.4, within one year of the date of capsule withdrawal, unless an 
extension is granted by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation.
    B. The report must include the data required by ASTM E 185, as 
specified in paragraph III.B.1 of this appendix, and the results of all 
fracture toughness tests conducted on the beltline materials in the 
irradiated and unirradiated conditions.
    C. If a change in the Technical Specifications is required, either 
in the pressure-temperature limits or in the operating procedures 
required to meet the limits, the expected date for submittal of the 
revised Technical Specifications must be provided with the report.

   Appendix I to Part 50--Numerical Guides for Design Objectives and 
 Limiting Conditions for Operation to Meet the Criterion ``As Low as is 
 Reasonably Achievable'' for Radioactive Material in Light-Water-Cooled 
                     Nuclear Power Reactor Effluents

    SECTION I. Introduction. Section 50.34a provides that an application 
for a permit to construct a nuclear power reactor shall include a 
description of the preliminary design of equipment to be installed to 
maintain control over radioactive materials in gaseous and liquid 
effluents produced during normal conditions, including expected 
occurrences. In the case of an application filed on or after January 2, 
1971, the application must also identify the design objectives, and the 
means to be employed, for keeping levels of radioactive material in 
effluents to unrestricted areas as low as practicable.
    Section 50.36a contains provisions designed to assure that releases 
of radioactive material from nuclear power reactors to unrestricted 
areas during normal conditions, including expected occurrences, are kept 
as low as practicable.
    Sec. II. Guides on design objectives for light-water-cooled nuclear 
power reactors licensed under 10 CFR Part 50. The guides on design 
objectives set forth in this section may be used by an applicant for a 
permit to construct a light-water-cooled nuclear power reactor as 
guidance in meeting the requirements of Sec. 50.34a(a). The applicant 
shall provide reasonable assurance that the following design objectives 
will be met.
    A. The calculated annual total quantity of all radioactive material 
above background <SUP>1 to be released from each light-water-cooled 
nuclear power reactor to unrestricted areas will not result in an 
estimated annual dose or dose commitment from liquid effluents for any 
individual in an unrestricted area from all pathways of exposure in 
excess of 3 millirems to the total body or 10 millirems to any organ.

    <SUP>1 Here and elsewhere in this appendix background means 
radioactive materials in the environment and in the effluents from 
light-water-cooled power reactors not generated in, or attributable to, 
the reactors of which specific account is required in determining design 
objectives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    B.1. The calculated annual total quantity of all radioactive 
material above background to be released from each light-water-cooled 
nuclear power reactor to the atmosphere will not result in an estimated 
annual air dose from gaseous effluents at any location near ground level 
which could be occupied by individuals in unrestricted areas in excess 
of 10 millirads for gamma radiation or 20 millirads for beta radiation.
    2. Notwithstanding the guidance of paragraph B.1:
    (a) The Commission may specify, as guidance on design objectives, a 
lower quantity of radioactive material above background to be released 
to the atmosphere if it appears that the use of the design objectives in 
paragraph B.1 is likely to result in an estimated annual external dose 
from gaseous effluents to any individual in an unrestricted area in 
excess of 5 millirems to the total body; and
    (b) Design objectives based upon a higher quantity of radioactive 
material above background to be released to the atmosphere than the 
quantity specified in paragraph B.1 will be deemed to meet the 
requirements for keeping levels of radioactive material in gaseous 
effluents as low as is reasonably achievable if the applicant provides 
reasonable assurance that the proposed higher quantity will not result 
in an estimated annual external dose from gaseous effluents to any 
individual in unrestricted areas in excess of 5 millirems to the total 
body or 15 millirems to the skin.
    C. The calculated annual total quantity of all radioactive iodine 
and radioactive material in particulate form above background to

[[Page 760]]

be released from each light-water-cooled nuclear power reactor in 
effluents to the atmosphere will not result in an estimated annual dose 
or dose commitment from such radioactive iodine and radioactive material 
in particulate form for any individual in an unrestricted area from all 
pathways of exposure in excess of 15 millirems to any organ.
    D. In addition to the provisions of paragraphs A, B, and C above, 
the applicant shall include in the radwaste system all items of 
reasonably demonstrated technology that, when added to the system 
sequentially and in order of diminishing cost-benefit return, can for a 
favorable cost-benefit ratio effect reductions in dose to the population 
reasonably expected to be within 50 miles of the reactor. As an interim 
measure and until establishment and adoption of better values (or other 
appropriate criteria), the values $1000 per total body man-rem and $1000 
per man-thyroid-rem (or such lesser values as may be demonstrated to be 
suitable in a particular case) shall be used in this cost-benefit 
analysis. The requirements of this paragraph D need not be complied with 
by persons who have filed applications for construction permits which 
were docketed on or after January 2, 1971, and prior to June 4, 1976, if 
the radwaste systems and equipment described in the preliminary or final 
safety analysis report and amendments thereto satisfy the Guides on 
Design Objectives for Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Reactors proposed 
in the Concluding Statement of Position of the Regulatory Staff in 
Docket-RM-50-2 dated February 20, 1974, pp. 25-30, reproduced in the 
Annex to this Appendix I.
    Sec. III. Implementation. A.1. Conformity with the guides on design 
objectives of Section II shall be demonstrated by calculational 
procedures based upon models and data such that the actual exposure of 
an individual through appropriate pathways is unlikely to be 
substantially underestimated, all uncertainties being considered 
together. Account shall be taken of the cumulative effect of all sources 
and pathways within the plant contributing to the particular type of 
effluent being considered. For determination of design objectives in 
accordance with the guides of Section II, the estimations of exposure 
shall be made with respect to such potential land and water usage and 
food pathways as could actually exist during the term of plant 
operation: Provided, That, if the requirements of paragraph B of Section 
III are fulfilled, the applicant shall be deemed to have complied with 
the requirements of paragraph C of Section II with respect to 
radioactive iodine if estimations of exposure are made on the basis of 
such food pathways and individual receptors as actually exist at the 
time the plant is licensed.
    2. The characteristics attributed to a hypothetical receptor for the 
purpose of estimating internal dose commitment shall take into account 
reasonable deviations of individual habits from the average. The 
applicant may take account of any real phenomenon or factors actually 
affecting the estimate of radiation exposure, including the 
characteristics of the plant, modes of discharge of radioactive 
materials, physical processes tending to attenuate the quantity of 
radioactive material to which an individual would be exposed, and the 
effects of averaging exposures over times during which determining 
factors may fluctuate.
    B. If the applicant determines design objectives with respect to 
radioactive iodine on the basis of existing conditions and if potential 
changes in land and water usage and food pathways could result in 
exposures in excess of the guideline values of paragraph C of Section 
II, the applicant shall provide reasonable assurance that a monitoring 
and surveillance program will be performed to determine:
    1. The quantities of radioactive iodine actually released to the 
atmosphere and deposited relative to those estimated in the 
determination of design objectives;
    2. Whether changes in land and water usage and food pathways which 
would result in individual exposures greater than originally estimated 
have occurred; and
    3. The content of radioactive iodine and foods involved in the 
changes, if and when they occur.
    SEC. IV. Guides on technical specifications for limiting conditions 
for operation for light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors licensed 
under 10 CFR part 50. The guides on limiting conditions for operation 
for light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors set forth below may be 
used by an applicant for a license to operate a light-water-cooled 
nuclear power reactor or a licensee who has submitted a certification of 
permanent cessation of operations under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) as guidance in 
developing technical specifications under Sec. 50.36a(a) to keep levels 
of radioactive materials in effluents to unrestricted areas as low as is 
reasonably achievable.
    Section 50.36a(b) provides that licensees shall be guided by certain 
considerations in establishing and implementing operating procedures 
specified in technical specifications that take into account the need 
for operating flexibility and at the same time assure that the licensee 
will exert his best effort to keep levels of radioactive material in 
effluents as low as is reasonably achievable. The guidance set forth 
below provides additional and more specific guidance to licensees in 
this respect.
    Through the use of the guides set forth in this section it is 
expected that the annual release of radioactive material in effluents 
from light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors can generally be 
maintained within the levels set forth as numerical guides for design 
objectives in Section II.

[[Page 761]]

    At the same time, the licensee is permitted the flexibility of 
operations, compatible with considerations of health and safety, to 
assure that the public is provided a dependable source of power even 
under unusual conditions which may temporarily result in releases higher 
than numerical guides for design objectives but still within levels that 
assure that the average population exposure is equivalent to small 
fractions of doses from natural background radiation. It is expected 
that in using this operational flexibility under unusual conditions, the 
licensee will exert his best efforts to keep levels of radioactive 
material in effluents within the numerical guides for design objectives.
    A. If the quantity of radioactive material actually released in 
effluents to unrestricted areas from a light-water-cooled nuclear power 
reactor during any calendar quarter is such that the resulting radiation 
exposure, calculated on the same basis as the respective design 
objective exposure, would exceed one-half the design objective annual 
exposure derived pursuant to Sections II and III, the licensee shall: 
<SUP>2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2 Section 50.36a(a)(2) requires the licensee to submit certain 
reports to the Commission with regard to the quantities of the principal 
radionuclides released to unrestricted areas. It also provides that, on 
the basis of such reports and any additional information the Commission 
may obtain from the licensee and others, the Commission may from time to 
time require the license to take such action as the Commission deems 
appropriate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Make an investigation to identify the causes for such release 
rates;
    2. Define and initiate a program of corrective action; and
    3. Report these actions as specified in Sec. 50.4, within 30 days 
from the end of the quarter during which the release occurred.
    B. The licensee shall establish an appropriate surveillance and 
monitoring program to:
    1. Provide data on quantities of radioactive material released in 
liquid and gaseous effluents to assure that the provisions of paragraph 
A of this section are met;
    2. Provide data on measurable levels of radiation and radioactive 
materials in the environment to evaluate the relationship between 
quantities of radioactive material released in effluents and resultant 
radiation doses to individuals from principal pathways of exposure; and
    3. Identify changes in the use of unrestricted areas (e.g., for 
agricultural purposes) to permit modifications in monitoring programs 
for evaluating doses to individuals from principal pathways of exposure.
    C. If the data developed in the surveillance and monitoring program 
described in paragraph B of Section III or from other monitoring 
programs show that the relationship between the quantities of 
radioactive material released in liquid and gaseous effluents and the 
dose to individuals in unrestricted areas is significantly different 
from that assumed in the calculations used to determine design 
objectives pursuant to Sections II and III, the Commission may modify 
the quantities in the technical specifications defining the limiting 
conditions in a license to operate a light-water-cooled nuclear power 
reactor or a license whose holder has submitted a certification of 
permanent cessation of operations under Sec. 50.82(a)(1).
    Sec. V. Effective dates. A. The guides for limiting conditions for 
operation set forth in this appendix shall be applicable in any case in 
which an application was filed on or after January 2, 1971, for a permit 
to construct a light-water-cooled nuclear power reactor.
    B. For each light-water-cooled nuclear power reactor constructed 
pursuant to a permit for which application was filed prior to January 2, 
1971, the holder of the permit or a license, authorizing operation of 
the reactor shall, within a period of twelve months from June 4, 1975, 
file with the Commission:
    1. Such information as is necessary to evaluate the means employed 
for keeping levels of radioactivity in effluents to unrestricted areas 
as low as is reasonably achievable, including all such information as is 
required by Sec. 50.34a (b) and (c) not already contained in his 
application; and
    2. Plans and proposed technical specifications developed for the 
purpose of keeping releases of radioactive materials to unrestricted 
areas during normal reactor operations, including expected operational 
occurrences, as low as is reasonably achievable.

                                reactors

    A. For radioactive material above background <SUP>1 in liquid 
effluents to be released to unrestricted areas:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1 ``Background,'' means the quantity of radioactive material in 
the effluent from light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors at a site 
that did not originate in the reactors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. The calculated annual total quantity of all radioactive material 
from all light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors at a site should not 
result in an annual dose or dose commitment to the total body or to any 
organ of an individual in an unrestricted area from all pathways of 
exposure in excess of 5 millirems; and
    2. The calculated annual total quantity of radioactive material, 
except tritium and dissolved gases, should not exceed 5 curies for each 
light-water-cooled reactor at a site.

[[Page 762]]

    3. Notwithstanding the guidance in paragraph A.2, for a particular 
site, if an applicant for a permit to construct a light-water-cooled 
nuclear power reactor has proposed baseline in-plant control measures 
<SUP>2 to reduce the possible sources of radioactive material in liquid 
effluent releases and the calculated quantity exceeds the quantity set 
forth in paragraph A.2, the requirements for design objectives for 
radioactive material in liquid effluents may be deemed to have been met 
provided:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>2 Such measures may include treatment of clear liquid waste 
streams (normally tritiated, nonaerated, low conductivity equipment 
drains and pump seal leakoff), dirty liquid waste streams (normally 
nontritiated, aerated, high conductivity building sumps, floor and 
sample station drains), steam generator blowdown streams, chemical waste 
streams, low purity and high purity liquid streams (resin regenerate and 
laboratory wastes), as appropriate for the type of reactor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    a. The applicant submits, as specified in Sec. 50.4, an evaluation 
of the potential for effects from long-term buildup on the environment 
in the vicinity of the site of radioactive material, with a radioactive 
half-life greater than one year, to be released; and
    b. The provisions of paragraph A.1 are met.
    B. For radioactive material above background in gaseous effluents

atmosphere by all light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors at a site:
    1. The calculated annual air dose due to gamma radiation at any 
location near ground level which could be occupied by individuals at or 
beyond the boundary of the site should not exceed 10 millirads; and
    2. The calculated annual air dose due to beta radiation at any 
location near ground level which could be occupied by individuals at or 
beyond the boundary of the site should not exceed 20 millirads.
    3. Notwithstanding the guidance in paragraphs B.1 and B.2, for a 
particular site:
    a. The Commission may specify, as guidance on design objectives, a 
lower quantity of radioactive material above background in gaseous 
effluents to be released to the atmosphere if it appears that the use of 
the design objectives described in paragraphs B.1 and B.2 is likely to 
result in an annual dose to an individual in an unrestricted area in 
excess of 5 millirems to the total body or 15 millirems to the skin; or
    b. Design objectives based on a higher quantity of radioactive 
material above background in gaseous effluents to be released to the 
atmosphere than the quantity specified in paragraphs B.1 and B.2 may be 
deemed to meet the requirements for keeping levels of radioactive 
material in gaseous effluents as low as practicable if the applicant 
provides reasonable assurance that the proposed higher quantity will not 
result in annual doses to an individual in an unrestricted area in 
excess of 5 millirems to the total body or 15 millirems to the skin.
    C. For radioactive iodine and radioactive material in particulate 
form above background released to the atmosphere:
    1. The calculated annual total quantity of all radioactive iodine 
and radioactive material in particulate form from all light-water-cooled 
nuclear power reactors at a site should not result in an annual dose or 
dose commitment to any organ of an individual in an unrestricted area 
from all pathways of exposure in excess of 15 millirems. In determining 
the dose or dose commitment the portion thereof due to intake of 
radioactive material via the food pathways may be evaluated at the 
locations where the food pathways actually exist; and
    2. The calculated annual total quantity of iodine-131 in gaseous 
effluents should not exceed 1 curie for each light-water-cooled nuclear 
power reactor at a site.
    3. Notwithstanding the guidance in paragraphs C.1 and C.2 for a 
particular site, if an applicant for a permit to construct a light-
water-cooled nuclear power reactor has proposed baseline in-plant 
control measures <SUP>3 to reduce the possible sources of radioactive 
iodine releases, and the calculated annual quantities taking into 
account such control measures exceed the design objective quantities set 
forth in paragraphs C.1 and C.2, the requirements for design objectives 
for radioactive iodine and radioactive material in particulate form in 
gaseous effluents may be deemed to have been met provided the calculated 
annual total quantity of all radioactive iodine and radioactive material 
in particulate form that may be released in gaseous effluents does not 
exceed four times the quantity calculated pursuant to paragraph C.1.

    <SUP>3 Such in-plant control measures may include treatment of steam 
generator blowdown tank exhaust, clean steam supplies for turbine gland 
seals, condenser vacuum systems, containment purging exhaust and 
ventilation exhaust systems and special design features to reduce 
contaminated steam and liquid leakage from valves and other sources such 
as sumps and tanks, as appropriate for the type of reactor.

                       Water-Cooled Power Reactors

    This appendix includes two options, A and B, either of which can be 
chosen for meeting the requirements of this appendix.

                             I. Introduction

    One of the conditions of all operating licenses for water-cooled 
power reactors as specified in Sec. 50.54(o) is that primary reactor 
containments shall meet the containment leakage test requirements set 
forth in this appendix. These test requirements provide for 
preoperational and periodic verification by tests of the leak-tight 
integrity of the primary reactor containment, and systems and components 
which penetrate containment of water-cooled power reactors, and 
establish the acceptance criteria for such tests. The purposes of the 
tests are to assure that (a) leakage through the primary reactor 
containment and systems and components penetrating primary containment 
shall not exceed allowable leakage rate values as specified in the 
technical specifications or associated bases and (b) periodic 
surveillance of reactor containment penetrations and isolation valves is 
performed so that proper maintenance and repairs are made during the 
service life of the containment, and systems and components penetrating 
primary containment. These test requirements may also be used for 
guidance in establishing appropriate containment leakage test 
requirements in technical specifications or associated bases for other 
types of nuclear power reactors.

                        II. Explanation of Terms

    A. ``Primary reactor containment'' means the structure or vessel 
that encloses the components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, 
as defined in Sec. 50.2(v), and serves as an essentially leak-tight 
barrier against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity to the 
environment.
    B. ``Containment isolation valve'' means any valve which is relied 
upon to perform a containment isolation function.
    C. ``Reactor containment leakage test program'' includes the 
performance of Type A, Type B, and Type C tests, described in II.F, 
II.G, and II.H, respectively.
    D. ``Leakage rate'' for test purposes is that leakage which occurs 
in a unit of time, stated as a percentage of weight of the original 
content of containment air at the leakage rate test pressure that 
escapes to the outside atmosphere during a 24-hour test period.
    E. ``Overall integrated leakage rate'' means that leakage rate which 
obtains from a summation of leakage through all potential leakage paths 
including containment welds, valves, fittings, and components which 
penetrate containment.
    F. ``Type A Tests'' means tests intended to measure the primary 
reactor containment overall integrated leakage rate (1) after the 
containment has been completed and is ready for operation, and (2) at 
periodic intervals thereafter.
    G. ``Type B Tests'' means tests intended to detect local leaks and 
to measure leakage across each pressure-containing or leakage-limiting 
boundary for the following primary reactor containment penetrations:
    1. Containment penetrations whose design incorporates resilient 
seals, gaskets, or sealant componds, piping penetrations fitted with 
expansion bellows, and electrical penetrations fitted with flexible 
metal seal assemblies.
    2. Air lock door seals, including door operating mechanism 
penetrations which are part of the containment pressure boundary.
    3. Doors with resilient seals or gaskets except for seal-welded 
doors.
    4. Components other than those listed in II.G.1, II.G.2, or II.G.3 
which must meet the acceptance criteria in III.B.3.
    H. ``Type C Tests'' means tests intended to measure containment 
isolation valve leakage rates. The containment isolation valves included 
are those that:
    1. Provide a direct connection between the inside and outside 
atmospheres of the primary reactor containment under normal operation, 
such as purge and ventilation, vacuum relief, and instrument valves;
    2. Are required to close automatically upon receipt of a containment 
isolation signal in response to controls intended to effect containment 
isolation;
    3. Are required to operate intermittently under postaccident 
conditions; and
    4. Are in main steam and feedwater piping and other systems which 
penetrate containment of direct-cycle boiling water power reactors.
    I. Pa (p.s.i.g.) means the calculated peak containment internal 
pressure related to the design basis accident and specified either in

[[Page 764]]

the technical specification or associated bases.
    J. Pt (p.s.i.g.) means the containment vessel reduced test pressure 
selected to measure the integrated leakage rate during periodic Type A 
tests.
    K. La (percent/24 hours) means the maximum allowable leakage rate at 
pressure Pa as specified for preoperational tests in the technical 
specifications or associated bases, and as specified for periodic tests 
in the operating license.
    L. Ld (percent/24 hours) means the design leakage rate at pressure, 
Pa, as specified in the technical specifications or associated bases.
    M. Lt (percent/24 hours) means the maximum allowable leakage rate at 
pressure Pt derived from the preoperational test data as specified in 
III.A.4.(a)(iii).
    N. Lam, Ltm (percent/24 hours) means the total measured containment 
leakage rates at pressure Pa and Pt, respectively, obtained from testing 
the containment with components and systems in the state as close as 
practical to that which would exist under design basis accident 
conditions (e.g., vented, drained, flooded or pressurized).
    O. ``Acceptance criteria'' means the standard against which test 
results are to be compared for establishing the functional acceptability 
of the containment as a leakage limiting boundary.

                    III. Leakage Testing Requirements

    A program consisting of a schedule for conducting Type A, B, and C 
tests shall be developed for leak testing the primary reactor 
containment and related systems and components penetrating primary 
containment pressure boundary.
    Upon completion of construction of the primary reactor containment, 
including installation of all portions of mechanical, fluid, electrical, 
and instrumentation systems penetrating the primary reactor containment 
pressure boundary, and prior to any reactor operating period, 
preoperational and periodic leakage rate tests, as applicable, shall be 
conducted in accordance with the following:
    A. Type A test--1. Pretest requirements. (a) Containment inspection 
in accordance with V. A. shall be performed as a prerequisite to the 
performance of Type A tests. During the period between the initiation of 
the containment inspection and the performance of the Type A test, no 
repairs or adjustments shall be made so that the containment can be 
tested in as close to the ``as is'' condition as practical. During the 
period between the completion of one Type A test and the initiation of 
the containment inspection for the subsequent Type A test, repairs or 
adjustments shall be made to components whose leakage exceeds that 
specified in the technical specification as soon as practical after 
identification. If during a Type A test, including the supplemental test 
specified in III.A.3.(b), potentially excessive leakage paths are 
identified which will interfere with satisfactory completion of the 
test, or which result in the Type A test not meeting the acceptance 
criteria III.A.4.(b) or III.A.5.(b), the Type A test shall be terminated 
and the leakage through such paths shall be measured using local leakage 
testing methods. Repairs and/or adjustments to equipment shall be made 
and Type A test performed. The corrective action taken and the change in 
leakage rate determined from the tests and overall integrated leakage 
determined from local leak and Type A tests shall be included in the 
summary report required by V.B.
    (b) Closure of containment isolation valves for the Type A test 
shall be accomplished by normal operation and without any preliminary 
exercising or adjustments (e.g., no tightening of valve after closure by 
valve motor). Repairs of maloperating or leaking valves shall be made as 
necessary. Information on any valve closure malfunction or valve leakage 
that require corrective action before the test, shall be included in the 
summary report required by V.B.
    (c) The containment test conditions shall stabilize for a period of 
about 4 hours prior to the start of a leakage rate test.
    (d) Those portions of the fluid systems that are part of the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary and are open directly to the containment 
atmosphere under post-accident conditions and become an extension of the 
boundary of the containment shall be opened or vented to the containment 
atmosphere prior to and during the test. Portions of closed systems 
inside containment that penetrate containment and rupture as a result of 
a loss of coolant accident shall be vented to the containment 
atmosphere. All vented systems shall be drained of water or other fluids 
to the extent necessary to assure exposure of the system containment 
isolation valves to containment air test pressure and to assure they 
will be subjected to the post accident differential pressure. Systems 
that are required to maintain the plant in a safe condition during the 
test shall be operable in their normal mode, and need not be vented. 
Systems that are normally filled with water and operating under post-
accident conditions, such as the containment heat removal system, need 
not be vented. However, the containment isolation valves in the systems 
defined in III.A.1.(d) shall be tested in accordance with III.C. The 
measured leakage rate from these tests shall be included in the summary 
report required by V.B.
    2. Conduct of tests. Preoperational leakage rate tests at either 
reduced or at peak pressure, shall be conducted at the intervals 
specified in III.D.

[[Page 765]]

    3. Test Methods. (a) All Type A tests shall be conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of the American National Standards N45.4-
1972, ``Leakage Rate Testing of Containment Structures for Nuclear 
Reactors,'' March 16, 1972. In addition to the Total time and Point-to-
Point methods described in that standard, the Mass Point Method, when 
used with a test duration of at least 24 hours, is an acceptable method 
to use to calculate leakage rates. A typical description of the Mass 
Point method can be found in the American National Standard ANSI/ANS 
56.8-1987, ``Containment System Leakage Testing Requirements,'' January 
20, 1987. Incorporation of ANSI N45.4-1972 by reference was approved by 
the Director of the Federal Register. Copies of this standard, as well 
as ANSI/ANS-56.8-1987, ``Containment System Leakage Testing 
Requirements'' (dated January 20, 1987) may be obtained from the 
American Nuclear Society, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, 
IL 60525. A copy of each of these standards is available for inspection 
at the NRC Library, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852-
2738.
    (b) The accuracy of any Type A test shall be verified by a 
supplemental test. An acceptable method is described in Appendix C of 
ANSI N45.4-1972. The supplemental test method selected shall be 
conducted for sufficient duration to establish accurately the change in 
leakage rate between the Type A and supplemental test. Results from this 
supplemental test are acceptable provided the difference between the 
supplemental test data and the Type A test data is within 0.25 La (or 
0.25 Lt). If results are not within 0.25 La (or 0.25 Lt), the reason 
shall be determined, corrective action taken, and a successful 
supplemental test performed.
    (c) Test leakage rates shall be calculated using absolute values 
corrected for instrument error.
    4. Preoperational leakage rate tests. (a) Test pressure--(1) Reduced 
pressure tests. (i) An initial test shall be performed at a pressure Pt, 
not less than 0.50 Pa to measure a leakage rate Ltm.
    (ii) A second test shall be performed at pressure Pa to measure a 
leakage rate Lam.
    (iii) The leakage characteristics yielded by measurements Ltm and 
Lam shall establish the maximum allowable test leakage rate Lt of not 
more than La (Ltm/Lam). In the event Ltm/Lam is greater than 0.7, Lt 
shall be specified as equal to La (Pt/Pa). <SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Such inservice inspections are required by Sec. 50.55a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Peak pressure tests. A test shall be performed at pressure Pa to 
measure the leakage rate Lam.
    (b) Acceptance criteria--(1) Reduced pressure tests. The leakage 
rate Ltm shall be less than 0.75 Lt.
    (2) Peak pressure tests. The leakage rate Lam shall be less than 
0.75 La and not greater than Ld.
    5. Periodic leakage rate tests--(a) Test pressure. (1) Reduced 
pressure tests shall be conducted at Pt;
    (2) Peak pressure tests shall be conducted at Pa.
    (b) Acceptance criteria--(1) Reduced pressure tests. The leakage 
rate Ltm shall be less than 0.75 Lt. If local leakage measurements are 
taken to effect repairs in order to meet the acceptance criteria, these 
measurements shall be taken at a test pressure Pt.
    (2) Peak pressure tests. The leakage rate Lam shall be less than 
0.75 La. If local leakage measurements are taken to effect repairs in 
order to meet the acceptance criteria, these measurements shall be taken 
at a test pressure Pa.
    6. Additional requirements. (a) If any periodic Type A test fails to 
meet the applicable acceptance criteria in III.A.5.(b), the test 
schedule applicable to subsequent Type A tests will be reviewed and 
approved by the Commission.
    (b) If two consecutive periodic Type A tests fail to meet the 
applicable acceptance criteria in III.A.5(b), notwithstanding the 
periodic retest schedule of III.D., a Type A test shall be performed at 
each plant shutdown for refueling or approximately every 18 months, 
whichever occurs first, until two consecutive Type A tests meet the 
acceptance criteria in III.A.5(b), after which time the retest schedule 
specified in III.D. may be resumed.
    B. Type B tests--1. Test methods. Acceptable means of performing 
preoperation and periodic Type B tests include:
    (a) Examination by halide leak-detection method (or by other 
equivalent test methods such as mass spectrometer) of a test chamber, 
pressurized with air, nitrogen, or pneumatic fluid specified in the 
technical specifications or associated bases and constructed as part of 
individual containment penetrations.
    (b) Measurement of the rate of pressure loss of the test chamber of 
the containment penetration pressurized with air, nitrogen, or pneumatic 
fluid specified in the technical specifications or associated bases.
    (c) Leakage surveillance by means of a permanently installed system 
with provisions for continuous or intermittent pressurization of 
individual or groups of containment penetrations and measurement of rate 
of pressure loss of air, nitrogen, or pneumatic fluid specified in the 
technical specification or associated bases through the leak paths.
    2. Test pressure. All preoperational and periodic Type B tests shall 
be performed by

[[Page 766]]

local pneumatic pressurization of the containment penetrations, either 
individually or in groups, at a pressure not less than Pa.
    3. Acceptance criteria. (See also Type C tests.) (a) The combined 
leakage rate of all penetrations and valves subject to Type B and C 
tests shall be less than 0.60 La, with the exception of the valves 
specified in III.C.3.
    (b) Leakage measurements obtained through component leakage 
surveillance systems (e.g., continuous pressurization of individual 
containment components) that maintains a pressure not less than Pa at 
individual test chambers of containment penetrations during normal 
reactor operation, are acceptable in lieu of Type B tests.
    C. Type C tests--1. Test method. Type C tests shall be performed by 
local pressurization. The pressure shall be applied in the same 
direction as that when the value would be required to perform its safety 
function, unless it can be determined that the results from the tests 
for a pressure applied in a different direction will provide equivalent 
or more conservative results. The test methods in III.B.1 may be 
substituted where appropriate. Each valve to be tested shall be closed 
by normal operation and without any preliminary exercising or 
adjustments (e.g., no tightening of valve after closure by valve motor).
    2. Test pressure. (a) Valves, unless pressurized with fluid (e.g., 
water, nitrogen) from a seal system, shall be pressurized with air or 
nitrogen at a pressure of Pa.
    (b) Valves, which are sealed with fluid from a seal system shall be 
pressurized with that fluid to a pressure not less than 1.10 Pa.
    3. Acceptance criterion. The combined leakage rate for all 
penetrations and valves subject to Type B and C tests shall be less than 
0.60 La. Leakage from containment isolation valves that are sealed with 
fluid from a seal system may be excluded when determining the combined 
leakage rate: Provided, That;
    (a) Such valves have been demonstrated to have fluid leakage rates 
that do not exceed those specified in the technical specifications or 
associated bases, and
    (b) The installed isolation valve seal-water system fluid inventory 
is sufficient to assure the sealing function for at least 30 days at a 
pressure of 1.10 Pa.
    D. Periodic retest schedule--1. Type A test. (a) After the 
preoperational leakage rate tests, a set of three Type A tests shall be 
performed, at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service 
period. The third test of each set shall be conducted when the plant is 
shutdown for the 10-year plant inservice inspections. <SUP>2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2 Such inservice inspections are required by Sec. 50.55a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Permissible periods for testing. The performance of Type A tests 
shall be limited to periods when the plant facility is non-operational 
and secured in the shutdown condition under the administrative control 
and in accordance with the safety procedures defined in the license.
    2. Type B tests. (a) Type B tests, except tests for air locks, shall 
be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient 
intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years. If opened 
following a Type A or B test, containment penetrations subject to Type B 
testing shall be Type B tested prior to returning the reactor to an 
operating mode requiring containment integrity. For primary reactor 
containment penetrations employing a continuous leakage monitoring 
system, Type B tests, except for tests of air locks, may, 
notwithstanding the test schedule specified under III.D.1., be performed 
every other reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals 
greater than 3 years.
    (b)(i) Air locks shall be tested prior to initial fuel loading and 
at 6-month intervals thereafter at an internal pressure not less than 
P<INF>a.
    (ii) Air locks opened during periods when containment integrity is 
not required by the plant's Technical Specifications shall be tested at 
the end of such periods at not less than P<INF>a.
    (iii) Air locks opened during periods when containment integrity is 
required by the plant's Technical Specifications shall be tested within 
3 days after being opened. For air lock doors opened more frequently 
than once every 3 days, the air lock shall be tested at least once every 
3 days during the period of frequent openings. For air lock doors having 
testable seals, testing the seals fulfills the 3-day test requirements. 
In the event that the testing for this 3-day interval cannot be at 
P<INF>a, the test pressure shall be as stated in the Technical 
Specifications. Air lock door seal testing shall not be substituted for 
the 6-month test of the entire air lock at not less than P<INF>a.
    (iv) The acceptance criteria for air lock testing shall be stated in 
the Technical Specifications.
    3. Type C tests. Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor 
shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.

                    IV. Special Testing Requirements

    A. Containment modification. Any major modification, replacement of 
a component which is part of the primary reactor containment boundary, 
or resealing a seal-welded door, performed after the preoperational 
leakage rate test shall be followed by either a Type A, Type B, or Type 
C test, as applicable for the area affected by the modification. The 
measured leakage from this test shall be

[[Page 767]]

included in the summary report required by V.B. The acceptance criteria 
of III.A.5.(b), III.B.3., or III.C.3., as appropriate, shall be met. 
Minor modifications, replacements, or resealing of seal-welded doors, 
performed directly prior to the conduct of a scheduled Type A test do 
not require a separate test.
    B. Multiple leakage barrier or subatmospheric containments. The 
primary reactor containment barrier of a multiple barrier or 
subatmospheric containment shall be subjected to Type A tests to verify 
that its leakage rate meets the requirements of this appendix. Other 
structures of multiple barrier or subatmospheric containments (e.g., 
secondary containments for boiling water reactors and shield buildings 
for pressurized water reactors that enclose the entire primary reactor 
containment or portions thereof) shall be subject to individual tests in 
accordance with the procedures specified in the technical 
specifications, or associated bases.

                  V. Inspection and Reporting of Tests

    A. Containment inspection. A general inspection of the accessible 
interior and exterior surfaces of the containment structures and 
components shall be performed prior to any Type A test to uncover any 
evidence of structural deterioration which may affect either the 
containment structural integrity or leak-tightness. If there is evidence 
of structural deterioration, Type A tests shall not be performed until 
corrective action is taken in accordance with repair procedures, non 
destructive examinations, and tests as specified in the applicable code 
specified in Sec. 50.55a at the commencement of repair work. Such 
structural deterioration and corrective actions taken shall be included 
in the summary report required by V.B.
    B. Recordkeeping of test results. 1. The preoperational and periodic 
tests must be documented in a readily available summary report that will 
be made available for inspection, upon request, at the nuclear power 
plant. The summary report shall include a schematic arrangement of the 
leakage rate measurement system, the instrumentation used, the 
supplemental test method, and the test program selected as applicable to 
the preoperational test, and all the subsequent periodic tests. The 
report shall contain an analysis and interpretation of the leakage rate 
test data for the Type A test results to the extent necessary to 
demonstrate the acceptability of the containment's leakage rate in 
meeting acceptance criteria.
    2. For each periodic test, leakage test results from Type A, B, and 
C tests shall be included in the summary report. The summary report 
shall contain an analysis and interpretation of the Type A test results 
and a summary analysis of periodic Type B and Type C tests that were 
performed since the last type A test. Leakage test results from type A, 
B, and C tests that failed to meet the acceptance criteria of 
III.A.5(b), III.B.3, and III.C.3, respectively, shall be included in a 
separate accompanying summary report that includes an analysis and 
interpretation of the test data, the least squares fit analysis of the 
test data, the instrumentation error analysis, and the structural 
conditions of the containment or components, if any, which contributed 
to the failure in meeting the acceptance criteria. Results and analyses 
of the supplemental verification test employed to demonstrate the 
validity of the leakage rate test measurements shall also be included.

                             I. Introduction

    One of the conditions required of all operating licenses for light-
water-cooled power reactors as specified in Sec. 50.54(o) is that 
primary reactor containments meet the leakage-rate test requirements in 
either Option A or B of this appendix. These test requirements ensure 
that (a) leakage through these containments or systems and components 
penetrating these containments does not exceed allowable leakage rates 
specified in the Technical Specifications and (b) integrity of the 
containment structure is maintained during its service life. Option B of 
this appendix identifies the performance-based requirements and criteria 
for preoperational and subsequent periodic leakage-rate testing.<SUP>3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Specific guidance concerning a performance-based leakage-test 
program, acceptable leakage-rate test methods, procedures, and analyses 
that may be used to implement these requirements and criteria are 
provided in Regulatory Guide 1.163, ``Performance-Based Containment 
Leak-Test Program.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             II. Definitions

    Performance criteria means the performance standards against which 
test results are to be compared for establishing the acceptability of 
the containment system as a leakage-limiting boundary.
    Containment system means the principal barrier, after the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary, to prevent the release of quantities of 
radioactive material that would have a significant radiological effect 
on the health of the public.

[[Page 768]]

    Overall integrated leakage rate means the total leakage rate through 
all tested leakage paths, including containment welds, valves, fittings, 
and components that penetrate the containment system.
    La (percent/24 hours) means the maximum allowable leakage rate at 
pressure Pa as specified in the Technical Specifications.
    Pa (p.s.i.g) means the calculated peak containment internal pressure 
related to the design basis loss-of-coolant accident as specified in the 
Technical Specifications.

            III. Performance-Based Leakage-Test Requirements

                             A. Type A Test

    Type A tests to measure the containment system overall integrated 
leakage rate must be conducted under conditions representing design 
basis loss-of-coolant accident containment peak pressure. A Type A test 
must be conducted (1) after the containment system has been completed 
and is ready for operation and (2) at a periodic interval based on the 
historical performance of the overall containment system as a barrier to 
fission product releases to reduce the risk from reactor accidents. A 
general visual inspection of the accessible interior and exterior 
surfaces of the containment system for structural deterioration which 
may affect the containment leak-tight integrity must be conducted prior 
to each test, and at a periodic interval between tests based on the 
performance of the containment system. The leakage rate must not exceed 
the allowable leakage rate (La) with margin, as specified in the 
Technical Specifications. The test results must be compared with 
previous results to examine the performance history of the overall 
containment system to limit leakage.

                          B. Type B and C Tests

    Type B pneumatic tests to detect and measure local leakage rates 
across pressure retaining, leakage-limiting boundaries, and Type C 
pneumatic tests to measure containment isolation valve leakage rates, 
must be conducted (1) prior to initial criticality, and (2) periodically 
thereafter at intervals based on the safety significance and historical 
performance of each boundary and isolation valve to ensure the integrity 
of the overall containment system as a barrier to fission product 
release to reduce the risk from reactor accidents. The performance-based 
testing program must contain a performance criterion for Type B and C 
tests, consideration of leakage-rate limits and factors that are 
indicative of or affect performance, when establishing test intervals, 
evaluations of performance of containment system components, and 
comparison to previous test results to examine the performance history 
of the overall containment system to limit leakage. The tests must 
demonstrate that the sum of the leakage rates at accident pressure of 
Type B tests, and pathway leakage rates from Type C tests, is less than 
the performance criterion (La) with margin, as specified in the 
Technical Specification.

                            IV. Recordkeeping

    The results of the preoperational and periodic Type A, B, and C 
tests must be documented to show that performance criteria for leakage 
have been met. The comparison to previous results of the performance of 
the overall containment system and of individual components within it 
must be documented to show that the test intervals established for the 
containment system and components within it are adequate. These records 
must be available for inspection at plant sites.
    If the test results exceed the performance criteria (La) as defined 
in the plant Technical Specifications, those exceedances must be 
assessed for Emergency Notification System reporting under Secs. 50.72 
(b)(1)(ii) and Sec. 50.72 (b)(2)(i), and for a Licensee Event Report 
under Sec. 50.73 (a)(2)(ii).

                             V. Application

                            A. Applicability

    The requirements in either or both Option B, III.A for Type A tests, 
and Option B, III.B for Type B and C tests, may be adopted on a 
voluntary basis by an operating nuclear power reactor licensee as 
specified in Sec. 50.54 in substitution of the requirements for those 
tests contained in Option A of this appendix. If the requirements for 
tests in Option B, III.A or Option B, III.B are implemented, the 
recordkeeping requirements in Option B, IV for these tests must be 
substituted for the reporting requirements of these tests contained in 
Option A of this appendix.

                            B. Implementation

    1. Specific exemptions to Option A of this appendix that have been 
formally approved by the AEC or NRC, according to 10 CFR 50.12, are 
still applicable to Option B of this appendix if necessary, unless 
specifically revoked by the NRC.
    2. A licensee or applicant for an operating license may adopt Option 
B, or parts thereof, as specified in Section V.A of this Appendix, by 
submitting its implementation plan and request for revision to technical 
specifications (see paragraph B.3 below) to the Director of the Office 
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
    3. The regulatory guide or other implementation document used by a 
licensee, or applicant for an operating license, to develop a 
performance-based leakage-testing program must be included, by general 
reference, in

[[Page 769]]

the plant technical specifications. The submittal for technical 
specification revisions must contain justification, including supporting 
analyses, if the licensee chooses to deviate from methods approved by 
the Commission and endorsed in a regulatory guide.
    4. The detailed licensee programs for conducting testing under 
Option B must be available at the plant site for NRC inspection.

              Appendix K to Part 50--ECCS Evaluation Models

    I. Required and Acceptable Features of Evaluation Models.
    II. Required Documentation.

      I. Required and Acceptable Features of the Evaluation Models

                   A. Sources of heat during the LOCA.

    For the heat sources listed in paragraphs 1 to 4 below it shall be 
assumed that the reactor has been operating continuously at a power 
level at least 1.02 times the licensed power level (to allow for such 
uncertainties as instrumentation error), with the maximum peaking factor 
allowed by the technical specifications. A range of power distribution 
shapes and peaking factors representing power distributions that may 
occur over the core lifetime shall be studied and the one selected 
should be that which results in the most severe calculated consequences, 
for the spectrum of postulated breaks and single failures analyzed.
    1. The Initial Stored Energy in the Fuel. The steady-state 
temperature distribution and stored energy in the fuel before the 
hypothetical accident shall be calculated for the burn-up that yields 
the highest calculated cladding temperature (or, optionally, the highest 
calculated stored energy.) To accomplish this, the thermal conductivity 
of the UO<INF>2 shall be evaluated as a function of burn-up and 
temperature, taking into consideration differences in initial density, 
and the thermal conductance of the gap between the UO<INF>2 and the 
cladding shall be evaluated as a function of the burn-up, taking into 
consideration fuel densification and expansion, the composition and 
pressure of the gases within the fuel rod, the initial cold gap 
dimension with its tolerances, and cladding creep.
    2. Fission Heat. Fission heat shall be calculated using reactivity 
and reactor kinetics. Shutdown reactivities resulting from temperatures 
and voids shall be given their minimum plausible values, including 
allowance for uncertainties, for the range of power distribution shapes 
and peaking factors indicated to be studied above. Rod trip and 
insertion may be assumed if they are calculated to occur.
    3. Decay of Actinides. The heat from the radioactive decay of 
actinides, including neptunium and plutonium generated during operation, 
as well as isotopes of uranium, shall be calculated in accordance with 
fuel cycle calculations and known radioactive properties. The actinide 
decay heat chosen shall be that appropriate for the time in the fuel 
cycle that yields the highest calculated fuel temperature during the 
LOCA.
    4. Fission Product Decay. The heat generation rates from radioactive 
decay of fission products shall be assumed to be equal to 1.2 times the 
values for infinite operating time in the ANS Standard (Proposed 
American Nuclear Society Standards-- ``Decay Energy Release Rates 
Following Shutdown of Uranium-Fueled Thermal Reactors.'' Approved by 
Subcommittee ANS-5, ANS Standards Committee, October 1971). This 
standard has been approved for incorporation by reference by the 
Director of the Federal Register. A copy of the standard is available 
for inspection at the NRC Library, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, 
Maryland 20852-2738. The fraction of the locally generated gamma energy 
that is deposited in the fuel (including the cladding) may be different 
from 1.0; the value used shall be justified by a suitable calculation.
    5. Metal--Water Reaction Rate. The rate of energy release, hydrogen 
generation, and cladding oxidation from the metal/water reaction shall 
be calculated using the Baker-Just equation (Baker, L., Just, L.C., 
``Studies of Metal Water Reactions at High Temperatures, III. 
Experimental and Theoretical Studies of the Zirconium-Water Reaction,'' 
ANL-6548, page 7, May 1962). This publication has been approved for 
incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register. A 
copy of the publication is available for inspection at the NRC Library, 
11545 Rockville Pike, Two White Flint North, Rockville, Maryland 20852-
2738. The reaction shall be assumed not to be steam limited. For rods 
whose cladding is calculated to rupture during the LOCA, the inside of 
the cladding shall be assumed to react after the rupture. The 
calculation of the reaction rate on the inside of the cladding shall 
also follow the Baker-Just equation, starting at the time when the 
cladding is calculated to rupture, and extending around the cladding 
inner circumference and axially no less that 1.5 inches each way from 
the location of the rupture, with the reaction assumed not to be steam 
limited.
    6. Reactor Internals Heat Transfer. Heat transfer from piping, 
vessel walls, and non-fuel internal hardware shall be taken into 
account.

[[Page 770]]

    7. Pressurized Water Reactor Primary-to-Secondary Heat Transfer. 
Heat transferred between primary and secondary systems through heat 
exchangers (steam generators) shall be taken into account. (Not 
applicable to Boiling Water Reactors.)

 B. Swelling and Rupture of the Cladding and Fuel Rod Thermal Parameters

    Each evaluation model shall include a provision for predicting 
cladding swelling and rupture from consideration of the axial 
temperature distribution of the cladding and from the difference in 
pressure between the inside and outside of the cladding, both as 
functions of time. To be acceptable the swelling and rupture 
calculations shall be based on applicable data in such a way that the 
degree of swelling and incidence of rupture are not underestimated. The 
degree of swelling and rupture shall be taken into account in 
calculations of gap conductance, cladding oxidation and embrittlement, 
and hydrogen generation.
    The calculations of fuel and cladding temperatures as a function of 
time shall use values for gap conductance and other thermal parameters 
as functions of temperature and other applicable time-dependent 
variables. The gap conductance shall be varied in accordance with 
changes in gap dimensions and any other applicable variables.

                          C. Blowdown Phenomena

    1. Break Characteristics and Flow. a. In analyses of hypothetical 
loss-of-coolant accidents, a spectrum of possible pipe breaks shall be 
considered. This spectrum shall include instantaneous double-ended 
breaks ranging in cross-sectional area up to and including that of the 
largest pipe in the primary coolant system. The analysis shall also 
include the effects of longitudinal splits in the largest pipes, with 
the split area equal to the cross-sectional area of the pipe.
    b. Discharge Model. For all times after the discharging fluid has 
been calculated to be two-phase in composition, the discharge rate shall 
be calculated by use of the Moody model (F.J. Moody, ``Maximum Flow Rate 
of a Single Component, Two-Phase Mixture,'' Journal of Heat Transfer, 
Trans American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 87, No. 1, February, 
1965). This publication has been approved for incorporation by reference 
by the Director of the Federal Register. A copy of this publication is 
available for inspection at the NRC Library, 11545 Rockville Pike, 
Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738. The calculation shall be conducted with 
at least three values of a discharge coefficient applied to the 
postulated break area, these values spanning the range from 0.6 to 1.0. 
If the results indicate that the maximum clad temperature for the 
hypothetical accident is to be found at an even lower value of the 
discharge coefficient, the range of discharge coefficients shall be 
extended until the maximum clad temperatures calculated by this 
variation has been achieved.
    c. End of Blowdown. (Applies Only to Pressurized Water Reactors.) 
For postulated cold leg breaks, all emergency cooling water injected 
into the inlet lines or the reactor vessel during the bypass period 
shall in the calculations be subtracted from the reactor vessel 
calculated inventory. This may be executed in the calculation during the 
bypass period, or as an alternative the amount of emergency core cooling 
water calculated to be injected during the bypass period may be 
subtracted later in the calculation from the water remaining in the 
inlet lines, downcomer, and reactor vessel lower plenum after the bypass 
period. This bypassing shall end in the calculation at a time designated 
as the ``end of bypass,'' after which the expulsion or entrainment 
mechanisms responsible for the bypassing are calculated not to be 
effective. The end-of-bypass definition used in the calculation shall be 
justified by a suitable combination of analysis and experimental data. 
Acceptable methods for defining ``end of bypass'' include, but are not 
limited to, the following: (1) Prediction of the blowdown calculation of 
downward flow in the downcomer for the remainder of the blowdown period; 
(2) Prediction of a threshold for droplet entrainment in the upward 
velocity, using local fluid conditions and a conservative critical Weber 
number.
    d. Noding Near the Break and the ECCS Injection Points. The noding 
in the vicinity of and including the broken or split sections of pipe 
and the points of ECCS injection shall be chosen to permit a reliable 
analysis of the thermodynamic history in these regions during blowdown.
    2. Frictional Pressure Drops. The frictional losses in pipes and 
other components including the reactor core shall be calculated using 
models that include realistic variation of friction factor with Reynolds 
number, and realistic two-phase friction multipliers that have been 
adequately verified by comparison with experimental data, or models that 
prove at least equally conservative with respect to maximum clad 
temperature calculated during the hypothetical accident. The modified 
Baroczy correlation (Baroczy, C. J., ``A Systematic Correlation for Two-
Phase Pressure Drop,'' Chem. Enging. Prog. Symp. Series, No. 64, Vol. 
62, 1965) or a combination of the Thom correlation (Thom, J.R.S., 
``Prediction of Pressure Drop During Forced Circulation Boiling of 
Water,'' Int. J. of Heat & Mass Transfer, 7, 709-724, 1964) for 
pressures equal to or greater than 250 psia and the Martinelli-Nelson 
correlation (Martinelli, R. C. Nelson, D.B., ``Prediction of Pressure 
Drop During Forced Circulation Boiling of Water,'' Transactions of ASME, 
695-702, 1948) for pressures lower than 250 psia is

[[Page 771]]

acceptable as a basis for calculating realistic two-phase friction 
multipliers.
    3. Momentum Equation. The following effects shall be taken into 
account in the conservation of momentum equation: (1) temporal change of 
momentum, (2) momentum convection, (3) area change momentum flux, (4) 
momentum change due to compressibility, (5) pressure loss resulting from 
wall friction, (6) pressure loss resulting from area change, and (7) 
gravitational acceleration. Any omission of one or more of these terms 
under stated circumstances shall be justified by comparative analyses or 
by experimental data.
    4. Critical Heat Flux. a. Correlations developed from appropriate 
steady-state and transient-state experimental data are acceptable for 
use in predicting the critical heat flux (CHF) during LOCA transients. 
The computer programs in which these correlations are used shall contain 
suitable checks to assure that the physical parameters are within the 
range of parameters specified for use of the correlations by their 
respective authors.
    b. Steady-state CHF correlations acceptable for use in LOCA 
transients include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) W 3. L. S. Tong, ``Prediction of Departure from Nucleate Boiling 
for an Axially Non-uniform Heat Flux Distribution,'' Journal of Nuclear 
Energy, Vol. 21, 241-248, 1967.

Bundles, ASME, New York, 1969.

Uniformly Heated Annuli and Its Uses for Predicting Burnout in Uniformly 
Heated Rod Bundles,'' AEEW-R 463, 1966.

Heat Flux for Water in the Pressure Range 150 to 725 psia,'' IN-1412, 
Idaho Nuclear Corporation, July 1970.
    c. Correlations of appropriate transient CHF data may be accepted 
for use in LOCA transient analyses if comparisons between the data and 
the correlations are provided to demonstrate that the correlations 
predict values of CHF which allow for uncertainty in the experimental 
data throughout the range of parameters for which the correlations are 
to be used. Where appropriate, the comparisons shall use statistical 
uncertainty analysis of the data to demonstrate the conservatism of the 
transient correlation.
    d. Transient CHF correlations acceptable for use in LOCA transients 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) GE transient CHF. B. C. Slifer, J. E. Hench, ``Loss-of-Coolant 
Accident and Emergency Core Cooling Models for General Electric Boiling 
Water Reactors,'' NEDO-10329, General Electric Company, Equation C-32, 
April 1971.
    e. After CHF is first predicted at an axial fuel rod location during 
blowdown, the calculation shall not use nucleate boiling heat transfer 
correlations at that location subsequently during the blowdown even if 
the calculated local fluid and surface conditions would apparently 
justify the reestablishment of nucleate boiling. Heat transfer 
assumptions characteristic of return to nucleate boiling (rewetting) 
shall be permitted when justified by the calculated local fluid and 
surface conditions during the reflood portion of a LOCA.
    5. Post-CHF Heat Transfer Correlations. a. Correlations of heat 
transfer from the fuel cladding to the surrounding fluid in the post-CHF 
regimes of transition and film boiling shall be compared to applicable 
steady-state and transient-state data using statistical correlation and 
uncertainty analyses. Such comparison shall demonstrate that the 
correlations predict values of heat transfer co-efficient equal to or 
less than the mean value of the applicable experimental heat transfer 
data throughout the range of parameters for which the correlations are 
to be used. The comparisons shall quantify the relation of the 
correlations to the statistical uncertainty of the applicable data.
    b. The Groeneveld flow film boiling correlation (equation 5.7 of 
D.C. Groeneveld, ``An Investigation of Heat Transfer in the Liquid 
Deficient Regime,'' AECL-3281, revised December 1969) and the 
Westinghouse correlation of steady-state transition boiling 
(``Proprietary Redirect/Rebuttal Testimony of Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation,'' USNRC Docket RM-50-1, page 25-1, October 26, 1972) are 
acceptable for use in the post-CHF boiling regimes. In addition, the 
transition boiling correlation of McDonough, Milich, and King (J.B. 
McDonough, W. Milich, E.C. King, ``An Experimental Study of Partial Film 
Boiling Region with Water at Elevated Pressures in a Round Vertical 
Tube,'' Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series, Vol. 57, No. 32, 
pages 197-208, (1961) is suitable for use between nucleate and film 
boiling. Use of all these correlations is restricted as follows:
    (1) The Groeneveld correlation shall not be used in the region near 
its low-pressure singularity,
    (2) The first term (nucleate) of the Westinghouse correlation and 
the entire McDonough, Milich, and King correlation

[[Page 772]]

shall not be used during the blowdown after the temperature difference 
between the clad and the saturated fluid first exceeds 300 deg. F,
    (3) Transition boiling heat transfer shall not be reapplied for the 
remainder of the LOCA blowdown, even if the clad superheat returns below 
300 deg. F, except for the reflood portion of the LOCA when justified by 
the calculated local fluid and surface conditions.
    c. Evaluation models approved after October 17, 1988, which make use 
of the Dougall-Rohsenow flow film boiling correlation (R.S. Dougall and 
W.M. Rohsenow, ``Film Boiling on the Inside of Vertical Tubes with 
Upward Flow of Fluid at Low Qualities,'' MIT Report Number 9079 26, 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, September 1963) may not use this correlation 
under conditions where nonconservative predictions of heat transfer 
result. Evaluation models that make use of the Dougall-Rohsenow 
correlation and were approved prior to October 17, 1988, continue to be 
acceptable until a change is made to, or an error is corrected in, the 
evaluation model that results in a significant reduction in the overall 
conservatism in the evaluation model. At that time continued use of the 
Dougall-Rohsenow correlation under conditions where nonconservative 
predictions of heat transfer result will no longer be acceptable. For 
this purpose, a significant reduction in the overall conservatism in the 
evaluation model would be a reduction in the calculated peak fuel 
cladding temperature of at least 50  deg.F from that which would have 
been calculated on October 17, 1988, due either to individual changes or 
error corrections or the net effect of an accumulation of changes or 
error corrections.
    6. Pump Modeling. The characteristics of rotating primary system 
pumps (axial flow, turbine, or centrifugal) shall be derived from a 
dynamic model that includes momentum transfer between the fluid and the 
rotating member, with variable pump speed as a function of time. The 
pump model resistance used for analysis should be justified. The pump 
model for the two-phase region shall be verified by applicable two-phase 
pump performance data. For BWR's after saturation is calculated at the 
pump suction, the pump head may be assumed to vary linearly with 
quality, going to zero for one percent quality at the pump suction, so 
long as the analysis shows that core flow stops before the quality at 
pump suction reaches one percent.
    7. Core Flow Distribution During Blowdown. (Applies only to 
pressurized water reactors.)
    a. The flow rate through the hot region of the core during blowdown 
shall be calculated as a function of time. For the purpose of these 
calculations the hot region chosen shall not be greater than the size of 
one fuel assembly. Calculations of average flow and flow in the hot 
region shall take into account cross flow between regions and any flow 
blockage calculated to occur during blowdown as a result of cladding 
swelling or rupture. The calculated flow shall be smoothed to eliminate 
any calculated rapid oscillations (period less than 0.1 seconds).
    b. A method shall be specified for determining the enthalpy to be 
used as input data to the hot channel heatup analysis from quantities 
calculated in the blowdown analysis, consistent with the flow 
distribution calculations.

          D. Post-Blowdown Phenomena; Heat Removal by the ECCS

    1. Single Failure Criterion. An analysis of possible failure modes 
of ECCS equipment and of their effects on ECCS performance must be made. 
In carrying out the accident evaluation the combination of ECCS 
subsystems assumed to be operative shall be those available after the 
most damaging single failure of ECCS equipment has taken place.
    2. Containment Pressure. The containment pressure used for 
evaluating cooling effectiveness during reflood and spray cooling shall 
not exceed a pressure calculated conservatively for this purpose. The 
calculation shall include the effects of operation of all installed 
pressure-reducing systems and processes.
    3. Calculation of Reflood Rate for Pressurized Water Reactors. The 
refilling of the reactor vessel and the time and rate of reflooding of 
the core shall be calculated by an acceptable model that takes into 
consideration the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of the core and 
of the reactor system. The primary system coolant pumps shall be assumed 
to have locked impellers if this assumption leads to the maximum 
calculated cladding temperature; otherwise the pump rotor shall be 
assumed to be running free. The ratio of the total fluid flow at the 
core exit plane to the total liquid flow at the core inlet plane 
(carryover fraction) shall be used to determine the core exit flow and 
shall be determined in accordance with applicable experimental data (for 
example, ``PWR FLECHT (Full Length Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer) 
Final Report,'' Westinghouse Report WCAP-7665, April 1971; ``PWR Full 
Length Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer (FLECHT) Group I Test Report,'' 
Westinghouse Report WCAP-7435, January 1970; ``PWR FLECHT (Full Length 
Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer) Group II Test Report,'' Westinghouse 
Report WCAP-7544, September 1970; ``PWR FLECHT Final Report 
Supplement,'' Westinghouse Report WCAP-7931, October 1972).
    The effects on reflooding rate of the compressed gas in the 
accumulator which is discharged following accumulator water discharge 
shall also be taken into account.
    4. Steam Interaction with Emergency Core Cooling Water in 
Pressurized Water Reactors. The thermal-hydraulic interaction between

[[Page 773]]

steam and all emergency core cooling water shall be taken into account 
in calculating the core reflooding rate. During refill and reflood, the 
calculated steam flow in unbroken reactor coolant pipes shall be taken 
to be zero during the time that accumulators are discharging water into 
those pipes unless experimental evidence is available regarding the 
realistic thermal-hydraulic interaction between the steam and the 
liquid. In this case, the experimental data may be used to support an 
alternate assumption.
    5. Refill and Reflood Heat Transfer for Pressurized Water Reactors. 
a. For reflood rates of one inch per second or higher, reflood heat 
transfer coefficients shall be based on applicable experimental data for 
unblocked cores including FLECHT results (``PWR FLECHT (Full Length 
Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer) Final Report,'' Westinghouse Report 
WCAP-7665, April 1971). The use of a correlation derived from FLECHT 
data shall be demonstrated to be conservative for the transient to which 
it is applied; presently available FLECHT heat transfer correlations 
(``PWR Full Length Emergency Cooling Heat Transfer (FLECHT) Group I Test 
Report,'' Westinghouse Report WCAP-7544, September 1970; ``PWR FLECHT 
Final Report Supplement,'' Westinghouse Report WCAP-7931, October 1972) 
are not acceptable. Westinghouse Report WCAP-7665 has been approved for 
incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register. A 
copy of this report is available for inspection at the NRC Library, 
11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738. New correlations 
or modifications to the FLECHT heat transfer correlations are acceptable 
only after they are demonstrated to be conservative, by comparison with 
FLECHT data, for a range of parameters consistent with the transient to 
which they are applied.
    b. During refill and during reflood when reflood rates are less than 
one inch per second, heat transfer calculations shall be based on the 
assumption that cooling is only by steam, and shall take into account 
any flow blockage calculated to occur as a result of cladding swelling 
or rupture as such blockage might affect both local steam flow and heat 
transfer.
    6. Convective Heat Transfer Coefficients for Boiling Water Reactor 
Fuel Rods Under Spray Cooling. Following the blowdown period, convective 
heat transfer shall be calculated using coefficients based on 
appropriate experimental data. For reactors with jet pumps and having 
fuel rods in a 7 x 7 fuel assembly array, the following convective 
coefficients are acceptable:
    a. During the period following lower plenum flashing but prior to 
the core spray reaching rated flow, a convective heat transfer 
coefficient of zero shall be applied to all fuel rods.
    b. During the period after core spray reaches rated flow but prior 
to reflooding, convective heat transfer coefficients of 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 
and 1.5 Btu-hr<SUP>-1-ft<SUP>-2 deg.F<SUP>-1 shall be applied to the 
fuel rods in the outer corners, outer row, next to outer row, and to 
those remaining in the interior, respectively, of the assembly.
    c. After the two-phase reflooding fluid reaches the level under 
consideration, a convective heat transfer coefficient of 25 Btu-
hr<SUP>-1-ft<SUP>-2 deg.F<SUP>-1 shall be applied to all fuel rods.
    7. The Boiling Water Reactor Channel Box Under Spray Cooling. 
Following the blowdown period, heat transfer from, and wetting of, the 
channel box shall be based on appropriate experimental data. For 
reactors with jet pumps and fuel rods in a 7 x 7 fuel assembly array, 
the following heat transfer coefficients and wetting time correlation 
are acceptable.
    a. During the period after lower plenum flashing, but prior to core 
spray reaching rated flow, a convective coefficient of zero shall be 
applied to the fuel assembly channel box.
    b. During the period after core spray reaches rated flow, but prior 
to wetting of the channel, a convective heat transfer coefficient of 5 
Btu-hr<SUP>-1-ft<SUP>-2- deg.F<SUP>-1 shall be applied to both sides of 
the channel box.
    c. Wetting of the channel box shall be assumed to occur 60 seconds 
after the time determined using the correlation based on the Yamanouchi 
analysis (``Loss-of-Coolant Accident and Emergency Core Cooling Models 
for General Electric Boiling Water Reactors,'' General Electric Company 
Report NEDO-10329, April 1971). This report was approved for 
incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register. A 
copy of the report is available for inspection at the NRC Library, 11545 
Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738.

                       II. Required Documentation

    1. a. A description of each evaluation model shall be furnished. The 
description shall be sufficiently complete to permit technical review of 
the analytical approach including the equations used, their 
approximations in difference form, the assumptions made, and the values 
of all parameters or the procedure for their selection, as for example, 
in accordance with a specified physical law or empirical correlation.
    b. A complete listing of each computer program, in the same form as 
used in the evaluation model, must be furnished to the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission upon request.
    2. For each computer program, solution convergence shall be 
demonstrated by studies of system modeling or noding and calculational 
time steps.
    3. Appropriate sensitivity studies shall be performed for each 
evaluation model, to

evaluate the effect on the calculated results of variations in noding, 
phenomena assumed in the calculation to predominate, including pump 
operation or locking, and values of parameters over their applicable 
ranges. For items to which results are shown to be sensitive, the 
choices made shall be justified.
    4. To the extent practicable, predictions of the evaluation model, 
or portions thereof, shall be compared with applicable experimental 
information.
    5. General Standards for Acceptability--Elements of evaluation 
models reviewed will include technical adequacy of the calculational 
methods, including: For models covered by Sec. 50.46(a)(1)(ii), 
compliance with required features of section I of this Appendix K; and, 
for models covered by Sec. 50.46(a)(1)(i), assurance of a high level of 
probability that the performance criteria of Sec. 50.46(b) would not be 
exceeded.

Appendix M to Part 50--Standardization of Design; Manufacture of Nuclear 
  Power Reactors; Construction and Operation of Nuclear Power Reactors 
               Manufactured Pursuant to Commission License

    Section 101 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 
Sec. 50.10 require a Commission license to transfer or receive in 
interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, possess, 
use, import, or export any production or utilization facility. The 
regulations in the part require the issuance of a construction permit by 
the Commission before commencement of construction of a production or 
utilization facility, and the issuance of an operating license before 
operation of the facility. The provisions of this part relating to the 
facility licensing process are, in general, predicated on the assumption 
that the facility will be assembled and constructed on the site at which 
it is to be operated. In those circumstances, both facility design and 
site-related issues can be considered in the initial, construction 
permit stage of the licensing process.
    However, under the Atomic Energy Act, a license may be sought and 
issued authorizing the manufacture of facilities but not their 
construction and installation at the sites on which the facilities are 
to be operated. Prior to the ``commencement of construction'', as 
defined in Sec. 50.10(c), of a facility (manufactured pursuant to such a 
Commission license) on the site at which it is to operate--that is 
preparation of the site and installation of the facility--a construction 
permit that, among other things, reflects approval of the site on which 
the facility is to be operated, must be issued by the Commission. This 
appendix sets out the particular requirements and provisions applicable 
to such situations where nuclear power reactors to be manufactured 
pursuant to a Commission license and subsequently installed at the site 
pursuant to a Commission construction permit, are of the type described 
in Sec. 50.22. It thus codifies one approach to the standardization of 
nuclear power reactors.
    1. Except as otherwise specified in this appendix or as the context 
otherwise indicates, the provisions in this part applicable to 
construction permits, including the requirement in Sec. 50.58 for review 
of the application by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and 
the holding of a public hearing, apply in context, with respect to 
matters of radiological health and safety, environmental protection, and 
the common defense and security, to licenses pursuant to this Appendix M 
to manufacture nuclear power reactors (manufacturing licenses) to be 
operated at sites not identified in the license application.

[[Page 777]]

    2. An application for a manufacturing license pursuant to this 
Appendix M must be submitted, as specified in Sec. 50.4, and meet all 
the requirements of Secs. 50.34(a) (1)-(9) and 50.34a (a) and (b), 
except that the preliminary safety analysis report shall be designated 
as a ``design report'' and any required information or analyses relating 
to site matters shall be predicated on postulated site parameters which 
must be specified in the application. The application must also include 
information pertaining to design features of the proposed reactor(s) 
that affect plans for coping with emergencies in the operation of the 
reactor(s).
    3. An applicant for a manufacturing license pursuant to this 
Appendix M shall submit with his application an environmental report as 
required of applicants for construction permits in accordance with 
Subpart A of Part 51 of this chapter, provided, however, that such 
report shall be directed at the manufacture of the reactor(s) at the 
manufacturing site; and, in general terms, at the construction and 
operation of the reactor(s) at an hypothetical site or sites having 
characteristics that fall within the postulated site parameters. The 
related draft and final environmental impact statement prepared by the 
Commission's regulatory staff will be similarly directed.
    4. (a) Sections 50.10 (b) and (c), 50.12(b), 50.23, 50.30(d), 
50.34(a)(10), 50.34a(c), 50.35 (a) and (c), 50.40(a), 50.45, 50.55(d), 
50.56, and Appendix J do not apply to manufacturing licenses. Appendices 
E and H apply to manufacturing licenses only to the extent that the 
requirements of these appendixes involve facility design features.
    (b) The financial information submitted pursuant to Sec. 50.33(f) 
and Appendix C shall be directed at a demonstration of the financial 
qualifications of the applicant for the manufacturing license to carry 
out the manufacturing activity for which the license is sought.
    5. The Commission may issue a license to manufacture one or more 
nuclear power reactors to be operated at sites not identified in the 
license application if the Commission finds that:
    (a) The applicant has described the proposed design of and the site 
parameters postulated for the reactor(s), including, but not limited to, 
the principal architectural and engineering criteria for the design, and 
has identified the major features or components incorporated therein for 
the protection of the health and safety of the public.
    (b) Such further technical or design information as may be required 
to complete the design report and which can reasonably be left for later 
consideration, will be supplied in a supplement to the design report.
    (c) Safety features or components, if any, which require research 
and development have been described by the applicant and the applicant 
has identified, and there will be conducted a research and development 
program reasonably designed to resolve any safety questions associated 
with such features or components; and
    (d) On the basis of the foregoing, there is reasonable assurance 
that (i) such safety questions will be satisfactorily resolved before 
any of the proposed nuclear power reactor(s) are removed from the 
manufacturing site and (ii) taking into consideration the site criteria 
contained in Part 100 of this chapter, the proposed reactor(s) can be 
constructed and operated at sites having characteristics that fall 
within the site parameters postulated for the design of the reactor(s) 
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.
    (e) The applicant is technically and financially qualified to design 
and manufacture the proposed nuclear power reactor(s).
    (f) The issuance of a license to the applicant will not be inimical 
to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the 
public.
    (g) On the basis of the evaluations and analyses of the 
environmental effects of the proposed action required by Subpart A of 
Part 51 of this chapter and paragraph 3 of this Appendix, the action 
called for is the issuance of the license.

     Note: When an applicant has supplied initially all of the technical 
information required to complete the application, including the final 
design of the reactor(s), the findings required for the issuance of the 
license will be appropriately modified to reflect that fact.

    6. Each manufacturing license issued pursuant to this appendix will 
specify the number of nuclear power reactors authorized to be 
manufactured and the latest date for the completion of the manufacture 
of all such reactors. Upon good cause shown, the Commission will extend 
such completion date for a reasonable period of time.
    7. The holder of a manufacturing license issued pursuant to this 
Appendix M shall submit to the Commission the final design of the 
nuclear power reactor(s) covered by the license as soon as such design 
has been completed. Such submittal shall be in the form of an 
application for amendment of the manufacturing license.
    8. The prohibition in Sec. 50.10(c) against commencement of 
construction of a production or utilization facility prior to issuance 
of a construction permit applies to the transport of a nuclear power 
reactor(s) manufactured pursuant to a license issued pursuant to this 
appendix from the manufacturing facility to the site at which the 
reactor(s) will be installed and operated. In addition, such nuclear 
power reactor(s) shall not be removed from the manufacturing site until 
the final design of the reactor(s) has been approved by

[[Page 778]]

the Commission in accordance with paragraph 7.
    9. An application for a permit to construct a nuclear power 
reactor(s) which is the subject of an application for a manufacturing 
license pursuant to this Appendix M need not contain such information or 
analyses as have previously been submitted to the Commission in 
connection with the application for a manufacturing license, but shall 
contain, in addition to the information and analyses otherwise required 
by Secs. 50.34(a) and 50.34a, sufficient information to demonstrate that 
the site on which the reactor(s) is to be operated falls within the 
postulated site parameters specified in the relevant manufacturing 
license application.
    10. The Commission may issue a permit to construct a nuclear power 
reactor(s) which is the subject of an application for a manufacturing 
license pursuant to this Appendix M if the Commission (a) finds that the 
site on which the reactor is to be operated falls within the postulated 
site parameters specified in the relevant application for a 
manufacturing license and (b) makes the findings otherwise required by 
this part. In no event will a construction permit be issued until the 
relevant manufacturing license has been issued.
    11. An operating license for a nuclear power reactor(s) that has 
been manufactured under a Commission license issued pursuant to this 
Appendix M may be issued by the Commission pursuant to Sec. 50.57 and 
Subpart A of Part 51 of this chapter except that the Commission shall 
find, pursuant to Sec. 50.57(a)(1), that construction of the reactor(s) 
has been substantially completed in conformity with both the 
manufacturing license and the construction permit and the applications 
therefor, as amended, and the provisions of the Act, and the rules and 
regulations of the Commission. Notwithstanding the other provisions of 
this paragraph, no application for an operating license for a nuclear 
power reactor(s) that has been manufactured under a Commission license 
issued pursuant to this Appendix M will be docketed until the 
application for an amendment to the relevant manufacturing license 
required by paragraph 7 has been docketed.
    12. In making the findings required by this part for the issuance of 
a construction permit or an operating license for a nuclear power 
reactor(s) that has been manufactured under a Commission license issued 
pursuant to this appendix, or an amendment to such a manufacturing 
license, construction permit, or operating license, the Commission will 
treat as resolved those matters which have been resolved at an earlier 
stage of the licensing process, unless there exists significant new 
information that substantially affects the conclusion(s) reached at the 
earlier stage or other good cause.

 Appendix N to Part 50--Standardization of Nuclear Power Plant Designs: 
 Licenses to Construct and Operate Nuclear Power Reactors of Duplicate 
                        Design at Multiple Sites

    Section 101 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 
Sec. 50.10 of this part require a Commission license to transfer or 
receive in interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, 
possess, use, import or export any production or utilization facility. 
The regulations in this part require the issuance of a construction 
permit by the Commission before commencement of construction of a 
production or utilization facility, except as provided in Sec. 50.10(e), 
and the issuance of an operating license before operation of the 
facility.
    The Commission's regulations in Part 2 of this chapter specifically 
provide for the holding of hearings on particular issues separately from 
other issues involved in hearings in licensing proceedings (Sec. 2.761a, 
Appendix A, section I(c)), and for the consolidation of adjudicatory 
proceedings and of the presentations of parties in adjudicatory 
proceedings such as licensing proceedings (Secs. 2.715a, 2.716).
    This appendix sets out the particular requirements and provisions 
applicable to situations in which applications are filed by one or more 
applicants for licenses to construct and operate nuclear power reactors 
of essentially the same design to be located at different sites.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 If the design for the power reactor(s) proposed in a particular 
application is not identical to the others, that application may not be 
processed under this appendix and Subpart D of Part 2 of this chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Except as otherwise specified in this appendix or as the context 
otherwise indicates, the provisions of this part applicable to 
construction permits and operating licenses, including the requirement 
in Sec. 50.58 for review of the application by the Advisory Committee on 
Reactor Safeguards and the holding of public hearings, apply to 
construction permits and operating licenses subject to this Appendix N.
    2. Applications for construction permits submitted pursuant to this 
Appendix must include the information required by Secs. 50.33, 50.33a, 
50.34(a) and 50.34a (a) and (b) and be submitted as specified in 
Sec. 50.4. The applicant

[[Page 779]]

shall also submit the information required by Sec. 51.50 of this 
chapter.
    For the technical information required by Secs. 50.34(a) (1) through 
(5) and (8) and 50.34a (a) and (b), reference may be made to a single 
preliminary safety analysis of the design<SUP>2 which, for the purposes 
of Sec. 50.34(a)(1) includes one set of site parameters postulated for 
the design of the reactors, and an analysis and evaluation of the 
reactors in terms of such postulated site parameters. Such single 
preliminary safety analysis shall also include information pertaining to 
design features of the proposed reactors that affect plans for coping 
with emergencies in the operation of the reactors, and shall describe 
the quality assurance program with respect to aspects of design, 
fabrication, procurement and construction that are common to all of the 
reactors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2 As used in this appendix, the design of a nuclear power reactor 
included in a single referenced safety analysis report means the design 
of those structures, systems and components important to radiological 
health and safety and the common defense and security.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Applications for operating licenses submitted pursuant to this 
Appendix N shall include the information required by Secs. 50.33, 
50.34(b) and (c), and 50.34a(c). The applicant shall also submit the 
information required by Sec. 51.53 of this chapter. For the technical 
information required by Secs. 50.34(b)(2) through (5) and 50.34a(c), 
reference may be made to a single final safety analysis of the design.

   Appendix O to Part 50--Standardization of Design: Staff Review of 
                            Standard Designs

    This appendix sets out procedures for the filing, staff review and 
referral to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards of standard 
designs for a nuclear power reactor of the type described in Sec. 50.22 
or major portions thereof.
    1. Any person may submit a proposed preliminary or final standard 
design for a nuclear power reactor of the type described in Sec. 50.22 
to the regulatory staff for its review. Such a submittal may consist of 
either the preliminary or final design for the entire reactor facility 
or the preliminary or final design of major portions thereof.
    2. The submittal for review of the standard design must be made in 
the same manner and in the same number of copies as provided in 
Secs. 50.4 and 50.30 for license applications.
    3. The submittal for review of the standard design shall include the 
information described in Sec. 50.33(a) through (d) and the applicable 
technical information required by Secs. 50.34(a) and (b), as 
appropriate, and 50.34a (other than that required by Secs. 50.34(a) (6) 
and (10), 50.34(b)(1), (6)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v) and 50.34(b) (7) and 
(8)). The submittal shall also include a description, analysis and 
evaluation of the interfaces between the submitted design and the 
balance of the nuclear power plant. With respect to the requirements of 
Secs. 50.34(a)(1), the submittal for review of a standard design shall 
include the site parameters postulated for the design, and an analysis 
and evaluation of the design in terms of such postulated site 
parameters. The information submitted pursuant to Sec. 50.34(a)(7) shall 
be limited to the quality assurance program to be applied to the design, 
procurement and fabrication of the structures, systems, and components 
for which design review has been requested and the information submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 50.34(a)(9) shall be limited to the qualifications of 
the person submitting the standard design to design the reactor or major 
portion thereof. The submittal shall also include information pertaining 
to design features that affect plans for coping with emergencies in the 
operation of the reactor or major portion thereof.
    4. Once the regulatory staff has initiated a technical review of a 
submittal under this appendix, the submittal will be referred to the 
Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) for a review and report.
    5. Upon completion of their review of a submittal under this 
appendix, the regulatory staff shall publish in the Federal Register a 
determination as to whether or not the preliminary or final design is 
acceptable, subject to such conditions as may be appropriate, and make 
available in the Public Document Room an analysis of the design in the 
form of a report. An approved design shall be utilized by and relied 
upon by the regulatory staff and the ACRS in their review of any 
individual facility license application which incorporates by reference 
a design approved in accordance with this paragraph unless there exists 
significant new information which substantially affects the earlier 
determination or other good cause.
    6. The determination and report by the regulatory staff shall not 
constitute a commitment to issue a permit or license, or in any way 
affect the authority of the Commission, Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Appeal Panel, Atomic Safety and Licensing Panel, and other presiding 
officers in any proceeding under Subpart G of Part 2 of this chapter.
    7. The Commission may, on its own initiative or in response to a 
petition for rule making, approve the design in a rulemaking proceeding 
and in that event, the approved design will be subject to challenge only 
as provided in Sec. 2.758 of this chapter. An environmental impact 
statement may be prepared for such a rule making action in accordance 
with Secs. 51.20(b)(13) and 51.85 of this

[[Page 780]]

chapter. If an environmental impact statement is prepared, the 
Commission may require the petitioner for rulemaking to submit 
information to the Commission to aid the Commission in the preparation 
of the environmental impact statement.
    8. Information requests to the approval holder regarding an approved 
design shall be evaluated prior to issuance to ensure that the burden to 
be imposed on respondents is justified in view of the potential safety 
significance of the issue to be addressed in the requested information. 
Each such evaluation performed by the NRC staff shall be in accordance 
with 10 CFR 50.54(f) and shall be approved by the Executive Director for 
Operations or his or her designee prior to issuance of the request.

Appendix Q to Part 50--Pre-Application Early Review of Site Suitability 
                                 Issues

    This appendix sets out procedures for the filing, Staff review, and 
referral to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards of requests for 
early review of one or more site suitability issues relating to the 
construction and operation of certain utilization facilities separately 
from and prior to the submittal of applications for construction permits 
for the facilities. The appendix also sets out procedures for the 
preparation and issuance of Staff Site Reports and for their 
incorporation by reference in applications for the construction and 
operation of certain utilization facilities. The utilization facilities 
are those which are subject to Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter and are of 
the type specified in Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 or are 
testing facilities. This appendix does not apply to proceedings 
conducted pursuant to Subpart F of Part 2 of this chapter.
    1. Any person may submit information regarding one or more site 
suitability issues to the Commission's Staff for its review separately 
from and prior to an application for a construction permit for a 
facility. Such a submittal shall be accompanied by any fee required by 
Part 170 of this chapter and shall consist of the portion of the 
information required of applicants for construction permits by 
Secs. 50.33(a)-(c) and (e), and, insofar as it relates to the issue(s) 
of site suitability for which early review is sought, by 
Secs. 50.34(a)(1) and 50.30(f), except that information with respect to 
operation of the facility at the projected initial power level need not 
be supplied.
    2. The submittal for early review of site suitability issue(s) must 
be made in the same manner and in the same number of copies as provided 
in Secs. 50.4 and 50.30 for license applications. The submittal must 
include sufficient information concerning a range of postulated facility 
design and operation parameters to enable the Staff to perform the 
requested review of site suitability issues. The submittal must contain 
suggested conclusions on the issues of site suitability submitted for 
review and must be accompanied by a statement of the bases or the 
reasons for those conclusions. The submittal must also list, to the 
extent possible, any long-range objectives for ultimate development of 
the site, state whether any site selection process was used in preparing 
the submittal, describe any site selection process used, and explain 
what consideration, if any, was given to alternative sites.
    3. The Staff shall publish a notice of docketing of the submittal in 
the Federal Register, and shall send a copy of the notice of docketing 
to the Governor or other appropriate official of the State in which the 
site is located. This notice shall identify the location of the site, 
briefly describe the site suitability issue(s) under review, and invite 
comments from Federal, State, and local agencies and interested persons 
within 120 days of publication or such other time as may be specified, 
for consideration by the staff in connection with the initiation or 
outcome of the review and, if appropriate by the ACRS, in connection 
with the outcome of their review. The person requesting review shall 
serve a copy of the submittal on the Governor or other appropriate 
official of the State in which the site is located, and on the chief 
executive of the municipality in which the site is located or, if the 
site is not located in a municipality, on the chief executive of the 
county. The portion of the submittal containing information required of 
applicants for construction permits by Secs. 50.33(a)-(c) and (e) and 
50.34(a)(1) will be referred to the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS) for a review and report. There will be no referral to 
the ACRS unless early review of the site safety issues under 
Sec. 50.34(a)(1) is requested.
    4. Upon completion of review by the staff and, if appropriate by the 
ACRS, of a submittal under this appendix, the staff shall prepare a 
Staff Site Report which shall identify the location of the site, state 
the site suitability issues reviewed, explain the nature and scope of 
the review, state the conclusions of the staff regarding the issues 
reviewed and state the reasons for those conclusions. Upon issuance of a 
Staff Site Report, the Staff shall publish a notice of the availability 
of the report in the Federal Register and shall place copies of the 
report in the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20555, and in a Local Public Document Room(s) located 
near the site identified in the Staff

[[Page 781]]

Site Report. The Staff shall also send a copy of the report to the 
Governor or other appropriate official of the State in which the site is 
located, and to the chief executive of the municipality in which the 
site is located or, if the site is not located in a municipality, to the 
chief executive of the county.
    5. Any Staff Site Report prepared and issued in accordance with this 
appendix may be incorporated by reference, as appropriate, in an 
application for a construction permit for a utilization facility which 
is subject to Sec. 51.20(b) of this chapter and is of the type specified 
in Sec. 50.21(b) (2) or (3) or Sec. 50.22 of this chapter or is a 
testing facility. The conclusions of the Staff Site Report will be 
reexamined by the staff where five years or more have elapsed between 
the issuance of the Staff Site Report and its incorporation by reference 
in a construction permit application.
    6. Issuance of a Staff Site Report shall not constitute a commitment 
to issue a permit or license, to permit on-site work under 
Sec. 50.10(e), or in any way affect the authority of the Commission, 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Panel, Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Board, and other presiding officers in any proceeding under Subpart F 
and/or G of Part 2 of this chapter.
    7. The staff will not conduct more than one review of site 
suitability issues with regard to a particular site prior to the full 
construction permit review required by Subpart A of Part 51 of this 
chapter. The staff may decline to prepare and issue a Staff Site Report 
in response to a submittal under this appendix where it appears that, 
(a) in cases where no review of the relative merits of the submitted 
site and alternative sites under Subpart A of Part 51 of this chapter is 
requested, there is a reasonable likelihood that further Staff review 
would identify one or more preferable alternative sites and the Staff 
review of one or more site suitability issues would lead to an 
irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources prior to the 
submittal of the analysis of alternative sites in the Environmental 
Report that would prejudice the later review and decision on alternative 
sites under Subpart F and/or G of Part 2 and Subpart A of Part 51 of 
this chapter; or (b) in cases where, in the judgment of the Staff, early 
review of any site suitability issue or issues would not be in the 
public interest, considering (1) the degree of likelihood that any early 
findings on those issues would retain their validity in later reviews, 
(2) the objections, if any, of cognizant state or local government 
agencies to the conduct of an early review on those issues, and (3) the 
possible effect on the public interest of having an early, if not 
necessarily conclusive, resolution of those issues.

    Appendix R to Part 50--Fire Protection Program for Nuclear Power 
              Facilities Operating Prior to January 1, 1979

                        I. Introduction and Scope

    This appendix applies to licensed nuclear power electric generating 
stations that were operating prior to January 1, 1979, except to the 
extent set forth in Sec. 50.48(b) of this part. With respect to certain 
generic issues for such facilities it sets forth fire protection 
features required to satisfy Criterion 3 of Appendix A to this part.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Clarification and guidance with respect to permissible 
alternatives to satisfy Appendix A to BTP APCSB 9.5-1 has been provided 
in four other NRC documents:
    ``Supplementary Guidance on Information Needed for Fire Protection 
Evaluation,'' dated October 21, 1976;
    ``Sample Technical Specification,'' dated May 12, 1977;
    ``Nuclear Plant Fire Protection Functional Responsibilities, 
Administrative Control and Quality Assurance,'' dated June 14, 1977;
    ``Manpower Requirements for Operating Reactors,'' dated May 11, 
1978.

    A Fire Protection Safety Evaluation Report that has been issued for 
each operating plant states how these guidelines were applied to each 
facility and identifies open fire protection issues that will be 
resolved when the facility satisfies the appropriate requirements of 
Appendix R to Part 50.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Criterion 3 of Appendix A to this part specifies that ``Structures, 
systems, and components important to safety shall be designed and 
located to minimize, consistent with other safety requirements, the 
probability and effect of fires and explosions.''
    When considering the effects of fire, those systems associated with 
achieving and maintaining safe shutdown conditions assume major 
importance to safety because damage to them can lead to core damage 
resulting from loss of coolant through boiloff.
    The phrases ``important to safety,'' or ``safety-related,'' will be 
used throughout this Appendix R as applying to all safety functions. The 
phrase ``safe shutdown'' will be used throughout this appendix as 
applying to both hot and cold shutdown functions.
    Because fire may affect safe shutdown systems and because the loss 
of function of systems used to mitigate the consequences of design basis 
accidents under postfire conditions does not per se impact public 
safety,

[[Page 782]]

the need to limit fire damage to systems required to achieve and 
maintain safe shutdown conditions is greater than the need to limit fire 
damage to those systems required to mitigate the consequences of design 
basis accidents. Three levels of fire damage limits are established 
according to the safety functions of the structure, system, or 
component:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Safety function                     Fire damage limits      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hot Shutdown...........................  One train of equipment         
                                          necessary to achieve hot      
                                          shutdown from either the      
                                          control room or emergency     
                                          control station(s) must be    
                                          maintained free of fire damage
                                          by a single fire, including an
                                          exposure fire.<SUP>1               
Cold Shutdown..........................  Both trains of equipment       
                                          necessary to achieve cold     
                                          shutdown may be damaged by a  
                                          single fire, including an     
                                          exposure fire, but damage must
                                          be limited so that at least   
                                          one train can be repaired or  
                                          made operable within 72 hours 
                                          using onsite capability.      
Design Basis Accidents.................  Both trains of equipment       
                                          necessary for mitigation of   
                                          consequences following design 
                                          basis accidents may be damaged
                                          by a single exposure fire.    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Exposure Fire. An exposure fire is a fire in a given area that      
  involves either in situ or transient combustibles and is external to  
  any structures, systems, or components located in or adjacent to that 
  same area. The effects of such fire (e.g., smoke, heat, or ignition)  
  can adversely affect those structures, systems, or components         
  important to safety. Thus, a fire involving one train of safe shutdown
  equipment may constitute an exposure fire for the redundant train     
  located in the same area, and a fire involving combustibles other than
  either redundant train may constitute an exposure fire to both        
  redundant trains located in the same area.                            

    The most stringent fire damage limit shall apply for those systems 
that fall into more than one category. Redundant systems used to 
mitigate the consequences of other design basis accidents but not 
necessary for safe shutdown may be lost to a single exposure fire. 
However, protection shall be provided so that a fire within only one 
such system will not damage the redundant system.

                        II. General Requirements

    A. Fire protection program. A fire protection program shall be 
established at each nuclear power plant. The program shall establish the 
fire protection policy for the protection of structures, systems, and 
components important to safety at each plant and the procedures, 
equipment, and personnel required to implement the program at the plant 
site.
    The fire protection program shall be under the direction of an 
individual who has been delegated authority commensurate with the 
responsibilities of the position and who has available staff personnel 
knowledgeable in both fire protection and nuclear safety.
    The fire protection program shall extend the concept of defense-in-
depth to fire protection in fire areas important to safety, with the 
following objectives:
    <bullet> To prevent fires from starting;
    <bullet> To detect rapidly, control, and extinguish promptly those 
fires that do occur;
    <bullet> To provide protection for structures, systems, and 
components important to safety so that a fire that is not promptly 
extinguished by the fire suppression activities will not prevent the 
safe shutdown of the plant.
    B. Fire hazards analysis. A fire hazards analysis shall be performed 
by qualified fire protection and reactor systems engineers to (1) 
consider potential in situ and transient fire hazards; (2) determine the 
consequences of fire in any location in the plant on the ability to 
safely shut down the reactor or on the ability to minimize and control 
the release of radioactivity to the environment; and (3) specify 
measures for fire prevention, fire detection, fire suppression, and fire 
containment and alternative shutdown capability as required for each 
fire area containing structures, systems, and components important to 
safety in accordance with NRC guidelines and regulations.
    C. Fire prevention features. Fire protection features shall meet the 
following general requirements for all fire areas that contain or 
present a fire hazard to structures, systems, or components important to 
safety.
    1. In situ fire hazards shall be identified and suitable protection 
provided.
    2. Transient fire hazards associated with normal operation, 
maintenance, repair, or modification activities shall be identified and 
eliminated where possible. Those transient fire hazards that can not be 
eliminated shall be controlled and suitable protection provided.
    3. Fire detection systems, portable extinguishers, and standpipe and 
hose stations shall be installed.
    4. Fire barriers or automatic suppression systems or both shall be 
installed as necessary to protect redundant systems or components 
necessary for safe shutdown.
    5. A site fire brigade shall be established, trained, and equipped 
and shall be on site at all times.
    6. Fire detection and suppression systems shall be designed, 
installed, maintained, and tested by personnel properly qualified by 
experience and training in fire protection systems.
    7. Surveillance procedures shall be established to ensure that fire 
barriers are in place and that fire suppression systems and components 
are operable.
    D. Alternative or dedicated shutdown capability. In areas where the 
fire protection features cannot ensure safe shutdown capability in the 
event of a fire in that area, alternative or dedicated safe shutdown 
capability shall be provided.

[[Page 783]]

                       III. Specific Requirements

    A. Water supplies for fire suppression systems. Two separate water 
supplies shall be provided to furnish necessary water volume and 
pressure to the fire main loop.
    Each supply shall consist of a storage tank, pump, piping, and 
appropriate isolation and control valves. Two separate redundant 
suctions in one or more intake structures from a large body of water 
(river, lake, etc.) will satisfy the requirement for two separated water 
storage tanks. These supplies shall be separated so that a failure of 
one supply will not result in a failure of the other supply.
    Each supply of the fire water distribution system shall be capable 
of providing for a period of 2 hours the maximum expected water demands 
as determined by the fire hazards analysis for safety-related areas or 
other areas that present a fire exposure hazard to safety-related areas.
    When storage tanks are used for combined service-water/fire-water 
uses the minimum volume for fire uses shall be ensured by means of 
dedicated tanks or by some physical means such as a vertical standpipe 
for other water service. Administrative controls, including locks for 
tank outlet valves, are unacceptable as the only means to ensure minimum 
water volume.
    Other water systems used as one of the two fire water supplies shall 
be permanently connected to the fire main system and shall be capable of 
automatic alignment to the fire main system. Pumps, controls, and power 
supplies in these systems shall satisfy the requirements for the main 
fire pumps. The use of other water systems for fire protection shall not 
be incompatible with their functions required for safe plant shutdown. 
Failure of the other system shall not degrade the fire main system.
    B. Sectional isolation valves. Sectional isolation valves such as 
post indicator valves or key operated valves shall be installed in the 
fire main loop to permit isolation of portions of the fire main loop for 
maintenance or repair without interrupting the entire water supply.
    C. Hydrant isolation valves. Valves shall be installed to permit 
isolation of outside hydrants from the fire main for maintenance or 
repair without interrupting the water supply to automatic or manual fire 
suppression systems in any area containing or presenting a fire hazard 
to safety-related or safe shutdown equipment.
    D. Manual fire suppression. Standpipe and hose systems shall be 
installed so that at least one effective hose stream will be able to 
reach any location that contains or presents an exposure fire hazard to 
structures, systems, or components important to safety.
    Access to permit effective functioning of the fire brigade shall be 
provided to all areas that contain or present an exposure fire hazard to 
structures, systems, or components important to safety.
    Standpipe and hose stations shall be inside PWR containments and BWR 
containments that are not inerted. Standpipe and hose stations inside 
containment may be connected to a high quality water supply of 
sufficient quantity and pressure other than the fire main loop if plant-
specific features prevent extending the fire main supply inside 
containment. For BWR drywells, standpipe and hose stations shall be 
placed outside the dry well with adequate lengths of hose to reach any 
location inside the dry well with an effective hose stream.
    E. Hydrostatic hose tests. Fire hose shall be hydrostatically tested 
at a pressure of 150 psi or 50 psi above maximum fire main operating 
pressure, whichever is greater. Hose stored in outside hose houses shall 
be tested annually. Interior standpipe hose shall be tested every three 
years.
    F. Automatic fire detection. Automatic fire detection systems shall 
be installed in all areas of the plant that contain or present an 
exposure fire hazard to safe shutdown or safety-related systems or 
components. These fire detection systems shall be capable of operating 
with or without offsite power.
    G. Fire protection of safe shutdown capability. 1. Fire protection 
features shall be provided for structures, systems, and components 
important to safe shutdown. These features shall be capable of limiting 
fire damage so that:
    a. One train of systems necessary to achieve and maintain hot 
shutdown conditions from either the control room or emergency control 
station(s) is free of fire damage; and
    b. Systems necessary to achieve and maintain cold shutdown from 
either the control room or emergency control station(s) can be repaired 
within 72 hours.
    2. Except as provided for in paragraph G.3 of this section, where 
cables or equipment, including associated non-safety circuits that could 
prevent operation or cause maloperation due to hot shorts, open 
circuits, or shorts to ground, of redundant trains of systems necessary 
to achieve and maintain hot shutdown conditions are located within the 
same fire area outside of primary containment, one of the following 
means of ensuring that one of the redundant trains is free of fire 
damage shall be provided:
    a. Separation of cables and equipment and associated non-safety 
circuits of redundant trains by a fire barrier having a 3-hour rating. 
Structural steel forming a part of or supporting such fire barriers 
shall be protected to provide fire resistance equivalent to that 
required of the barrier;
    b. Separation of cables and equipment and associated non-safety 
circuits of redundant

[[Page 784]]

trains by a horizontal distance of more than 20 feet with no intervening 
combustible or fire hazards. In addition, fire detectors and an 
automatic fire suppression system shall be installed in the fire area; 
or
    c. Enclosure of cable and equipment and associated non-safety 
circuits of one redundant train in a fire barrier having a 1-hour 
rating, In addition, fire detectors and an automatic fire suppression 
system shall be installed in the fire area;
    Inside noninerted containments one of the fire protection means 
specified above or one of the following fire protection means shall be 
provided:
    d. Separation of cables and equipment and associated non-safety 
circuits of redundant trains by a horizontal distance of more than 20 
feet with no intervening combustibles or fire hazards;
    e. Installation of fire detectors and an automatic fire suppression 
system in the fire area; or
    f. Separation of cables and equipment and associated non-safety 
circuits of redundant trains by a noncombustible radiant energy shield.
    3. Alternative or dedicated shutdown capability and its associated 
circuits, \2\ independent of cables, systems or components in the area, 
room or zone under consideration, shall be provided:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Alternative shutdown capability is provided by rerouting, 
relocating or modificating of existing systems; dedicated shutdown 
capability is provided by installing new structures and systems for the 
function of post-fire shutdown.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    a. Where the protection of systems whose function is required for 
hot shutdown does not satisfy the requirement of paragraph G.2 of this 
section; or
    b. Where redundant trains of systems required for hot shutdown 
located in the same fire area may be subject to damage from fire 
suppression activities or from the rupture or inadvertent operation of 
fire suppression systems.
    In addition, fire detection and a fixed fire suppression system 
shall be installed in the area, room, or zone under consideration.
    H. Fire brigade. A site fire brigade trained and equipped for fire 
fighting shall be established to ensure adequate manual fire fighting 
capability for all areas of the plant containing structures, systems, or 
components important to safety. The fire brigade shall be at least five 
members on each shift. The brigade leader and at least two brigade 
members shall have sufficient training in or knowledge of plant safety-
related systems to understand the effects of fire and fire suppressants 
on safe shutdown capability. The qualification of fire brigade members 
shall include an annual physical examination to determine their ability 
to perform strenuous fire fighting activities. The shift supervisor 
shall not be a member of the fire brigade. The brigade leader shall be 
competent to assess the potential safety consequences of a fire and 
advise control room personnel. Such competence by the brigade leader may 
be evidenced by possession of an operator's license or equivalent 
knowledge of plant safety-related systems.
    The minimum equipment provided for the brigade shall consist of 
personal protective equipment such as turnout coats, boots, gloves, hard 
hats, emergency communications equipment, portable lights, portable 
ventilation equipment, and portable extinguishers. Self-contained 
breathing apparatus using full-face positive-pressure masks approved by 
NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health--approval 
formerly given by the U.S. Bureau of Mines) shall be provided for fire 
brigade, damage control, and control room personnel. At least 10 masks 
shall be available for fire brigade personnel. Control room personnel 
may be furnished breathing air by a manifold system piped from a storage 
reservoir if practical. Service or rated operating life shall be a 
minimum of one-half hour for the self-contained units.
    At least a 1-hour supply of breathing air in extra bottles shall be 
located on the plant site for each unit of self-contained breathing 
appratus. In addition, an onsite 6-hour supply of reserve air shall be 
provided and arranged to permit quick and complete replenishment of 
exhausted air supply bottles as they are returned. If compressors are 
used as a source of breathing air, only units approved for breathing air 
shall be used and the compressors shall be operable assuming a loss of 
offsite power. Special care must be taken to locate the compressor in 
areas free of dust and contaminants.
    I. Fire brigade training. The fire brigade training program shall 
ensure that the capability to fight potential fires is established and 
maintained. The program shall consist of an initial classroom 
instruction program followed by periodic classroom instruction, fire 
fighting practice, and fire drills:
    1. Instruction
    a. The initial classroom instruction shall include:
    (1) Indoctrination of the plant fire fighting plan with specific 
identification of each individual's responsibilities.
    (2) Identification of the type and location of fire hazards and 
associated types of fires that could occur in the plant.
    (3) The toxic and corrosive characteristics of expected products of 
combustion.
    (4) Identification of the location of fire fighting equipment for 
each fire area and familiarization with the layout of the plant, 
including access and egress routes to each area.

[[Page 785]]

    (5) The proper use of available fire fighting equipment and the 
correct method of fighting each type of fire. The types of fires covered 
should include fires in energized electrical equipment, fires in cables 
and cable trays, hydrogen fires, fires involving flammable and 
combustible liquids or hazardous process chemicals, fires resulting from 
construction or modifications (welding), and record file fires.
    (6) The proper use of communication, lighting, ventilation, and 
emergency breathing equipment.
    (7) The proper method for fighting fires inside buildings and 
confined spaces.
    (8) The direction and coordination of the fire fighting activities 
(fire brigade leaders only).
    (9) Detailed review of fire fighting strategies and procedures.
    (10) Review of the latest plant modifications and corresponding 
changes in fire fighting plans.

    Note: Items (9) and (10) may be deleted from the training of no more 
than two of the non-operations personnel who may be assigned to the fire 
brigade.

    b. The instruction shall be provided by qualified individuals who 
are knowledgeable, experienced, and suitably trained in fighting the 
types of fires that could occur in the plant and in using the types of 
equipment available in the nuclear power plant.
    c. Instruction shall be provided to all fire brigade members and 
fire brigade leaders.
    d. Regular planned meetings shall be held at least every 3 months 
for all brigade members to review changes in the fire protection program 
and other subjects as necessary.
    e. Periodic refresher training sessions shall be held to repeat the 
classroom instruction program for all brigade members over a two-year 
period. These sessions may be concurrent with the regular planned 
meetings.
    2. Practice
    Practice sessions shall be held for each shift fire brigade on the 
proper method of fighting the various types of fires that could occur in 
a nuclear power plant. These sessions shall provide brigade members with 
experience in actual fire extinguishment and the use of emergency 
breathing apparatus under strenuous conditions encountered in fire 
fighting. These practice sessions shall be provided at least once per 
year for each fire brigade member.
    3. Drills
    a. Fire brigade drills shall be performed in the plant so that the 
fire brigade can practice as a team.
    b. Drills shall be performed at regular intervals not to exceed 3 
months for each shift fire brigade. Each fire brigade member should 
participate in each drill, but must participate in at least two drills 
per year.
    A sufficient number of these drills, but not less than one for each 
shift fire brigade per year, shall be unannounced to determine the fire 
fighting readiness of the plant fire brigade, brigade leader, and fire 
protection systems and equipment. Persons planning and authorizing an 
unannounced drill shall ensure that the responding shift fire brigade 
members are not aware that a drill is being planned until it is begun. 
Unannounced drills shall not be scheduled closer than four weeks.
    At least one drill per year shall be performed on a ``back shift'' 
for each shift fire brigade.
    c. The drills shall be preplanned to establish the training 
objectives of the drill and shall be critiqued to determine how well the 
training objectives have been met. Unannounced drills shall be planned 
and critiqued by members of the management staff responsible for plant 
safety and fire protection. Performance deficiencies of a fire brigade 
or of individual fire brigade members shall be remedied by scheduling 
additional training for the brigade or members. Unsatisfactory drill 
performance shall be followed by a repeat drill within 30 days.
    d. At 3-year intervals, a randomly selected unannounced drill must 
be critiqued by qualified individuals independent of the licensee's 
staff. A copy of the written report from these individuals must be 
available for NRC review and shall be retained as a record as specified 
in section III.I.4 of this appendix.
    e. Drills shall as a minimum include the following:
    (1) Assessment of fire alarm effectiveness, time required to notify 
and assemble fire brigade, and selection, placement and use of 
equipment, and fire fighting strategies.
    (2) Assessment of each brigade member's knowledge of his or her role 
in the fire fighting strategy for the area assumed to contain the fire. 
Assessment of the brigade member's conformance with established plant 
fire fighting procedures and use of fire fighting equipment, including 
self-contained emergency breathing apparatus, communication equipment, 
and ventilation equipment, to the extent practicable.
    (3) The simulated use of fire fighting equipment required to cope 
with the situation and type of fire selected for the drill. The area and 
type of fire chosen for the drill should differ from those used in the 
previous drill so that brigade members are trained in fighting fires in 
various plant areas. The situation selected should simulate the size and 
arrangement of a fire that could reasonably occur in the area selected, 
allowing for fire development due to the time required to respond, to 
obtain equipment, and organize for the fire, assuming loss of automatic 
suppression capability.

[[Page 786]]

    (4) Assessment of brigade leader's direction of the fire fighting 
effort as to thoroughness, accuracy, and effectiveness.
    4. Records
    Individual records of training provided to each fire brigade member, 
including drill critiques, shall be maintained for at least 3 years to 
ensure that each member receives training in all parts of the training 
program. These records of training shall be available for NRC review. 
Retraining or broadened training for fire fighting within buildings 
shall be scheduled for all those brigade members whose performance 
records show deficiencies.
    J. Emergency lighting. Emergency lighting units with at least an 8-
hour battery power supply shall be provided in all areas needed for 
operation of safe shutdown equipment and in access and egress routes 
thereto.
    K. Administrative controls. Administrative controls shall be 
established to minimize fire hazards in areas containing structures, 
systems, and components important to safety. These controls shall 
establish procedures to:
    1. Govern the handling and limitation of the use of ordinary 
combustible materials, combustible and flammable gases and liquids, high 
efficiency particulate air and charcoal filters, dry ion exchange 
resins, or other combustible supplies in safety-related areas.
    2. Prohibit the storage of combustibles in safety-related areas or 
establish designated storage areas with appropriate fire protection.
    3. Govern the handling of and limit transient fire loads such as 
combustible and flammable liquids, wood and plastic products, or other 
combustible materials in buildings containing safety-related systems or 
equipment during all phases of operating, and especially during 
maintenance, modification, or refueling operations.
    4. Designate the onsite staff member responsible for the inplant 
fire protection review of proposed work activities to identify potential 
transient fire hazards and specify required additional fire protection 
in the work activity procedure.
    5. Govern the use of ignition sources by use of a flame permit 
system to control welding, flame cutting, brazing, or soldering 
operations. A separate permit shall be issued for each area where work 
is to be done. If work continues over more than one shift, the permit 
shall be valid for not more than 24 hours when the plant is operating or 
for the duration of a particular job during plant shutdown.
    6. Control the removal from the area of all waste, debris, scrap, 
oil spills, or other combustibles resulting from the work activity 
immediately following completion of the activity, or at the end of each 
work shift, whichever comes first.
    7. Maintain the periodic housekeeping inspections to ensure 
continued compliance with these administrative controls.
    8. Control the use of specific combustibles in safety-related areas. 
All wood used in safety-related areas during maintenance, modification, 
or refueling operations (such as lay-down blocks or scaffolding) shall 
be treated with a flame retardant. Equipment or supplies (such as new 
fuel) shipped in untreated combustible packing containers may be 
unpacked in safety-related areas if required for valid operating 
reasons. However, all combustible materials shall be removed from the 
area immediately following the unpacking. Such transient combustible 
material, unless stored in approved containers, shall not be left 
unattended during lunch breaks, shift changes, or other similar periods. 
Loose combustible packing material such as wood or paper excelsior, or 
polyethylene sheeting shall be placed in metal containers with tight-
fitting self-closing metal covers.
    9. Control actions to be taken by an individual discovering a fire, 
for example, notification of control room, attempt to extinguish fire, 
and actuation of local fire suppression systems.
    10. Control actions to be taken by the control room operator to 
determine the need for brigade assistance upon report of a fire or 
receipt of alarm on control room annunciator panel, for example, 
announcing location of fire over PA system, sounding fire alarms, and 
notifying the shift supervisor and the fire brigade leader of the type, 
size, and location of the fire.
    11. Control actions to be taken by the fire brigade after 
notification by the control room operator of a fire, for example, 
assembling in a designated location, receiving directions from the fire 
brigade leader, and discharging specific fire fighting responsibilities 
including selection and transportation of fire fighting equipment to 
fire location, selection of protective equipment, operating instructions 
for use of fire suppression systems, and use of preplanned strategies 
for fighting fires in specific areas.
    12. Define the strategies for fighting fires in all safety-related 
areas and areas presenting a hazard to safety-related equipment. These 
strategies shall designate:
    a. Fire hazards in each area covered by the specific prefire plans.
    b. Fire extinguishants best suited for controlling the fires 
associated with the fire hazards in that area and the nearest location 
of these extinguishants.
    c. Most favorable direction from which to attack a fire in each area 
in view of the ventilation direction, access hallways, stairs, and doors 
that are most likely to be free of fire, and the best station or 
elevation for fighting the fire. All access and egress routes

[[Page 787]]

that involve locked doors should be specifically identified in the 
procedure with the appropriate precautions and methods for access 
specified.
    d. Plant systems that should be managed to reduce the damage 
potential during a local fire and the location of local and remote 
controls for such management (e.g., any hydraulic or electrical systems 
in the zone covered by the specific fire fighting procedure that could 
increase the hazards in the area because of overpressurization or 
electrical hazards).
    e. Vital heat-sensitive system components that need to be kept cool 
while fighting a local fire. Particularly hazardous combustibles that 
need cooling should be designated.
    f. Organization of fire fighting brigades and the assignment of 
special duties according to job title so that all fire fighting 
functions are covered by any complete shift personnel complement. These 
duties include command control of the brigade, transporting fire 
suppression and support equipment to the fire scenes, applying the 
extinguishant to the fire, communication with the control room, and 
coordination with outside fire departments.
    g. Potential radiological and toxic hazards in fire zones.
    h. Ventilation system operation that ensures desired plant air 
distribution when the ventilation flow is modified for fire containment 
or smoke clearing operations.
    i. Operations requiring control room and shift engineer coordination 
or authorization.
    j. Instructions for plant operators and general plant personnel 
during fire.
    L. Alternative and dedicated shutdown capability. 1. Alternative or 
dedicated shutdown capability provided for a specific fire area shall be 
able to (a) achieve and maintain subcritical reactivity conditions in 
the reactor; (b) maintain reactor coolant inventory; (c) achieve and 
maintain hot standby \3\ conditions for a PWR (hot shutdown \3\ for a 
BWR); (d) achieve cold shutdown conditions within 72 hours; and (e) 
maintain cold shutdown conditions thereafter. During the postfire 
shutdown, the reactor coolant system process variables shall be 
maintained within those predicted for a loss of normal a.c. power, and 
the fission product boundary integrity shall not be affected; i.e., 
there shall be no fuel clad damage, rupture of any primary coolant 
boundary, of rupture of the containment boundary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ As defined in the Standard Technical Specifications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The performance goals for the shutdown functions shall be:
    a. The reactivity control function shall be capable of achieving and 
maintaining cold shutdown reactivity conditions.
    b. The reactor coolant makeup function shall be capable of 
maintaining the reactor coolant level above the top of the core for BWRs 
and be within the level indication in the pressurizer for PWRs.
    c. The reactor heat removal function shall be capable of achieving 
and maintaining decay heat removal.
    d. The process monitoring function shall be capable of providing 
direct readings of the process variables necessary to perform and 
control the above functions.
    e. The supporting functions shall be capable of providing the 
process cooling, lubrication, etc., necessary to permit the operation of 
the equipment used for safe shutdown functions.
    3. The shutdown capability for specific fire areas may be unique for 
each such area, or it may be one unique combination of systems for all 
such areas. In either case, the alternative shutdown capability shall be 
independent of the specific fire area(s) and shall accommodate postfire 
conditions where offsite power is available and where offsite power is 
not available for 72 hours. Procedures shall be in effect to implement 
this capability.
    4. If the capability to achieve and maintain cold shutdown will not 
be available because of fire damage, the equipment and systems 
comprising the means to achieve and maintain the hot standby or hot 
shutdown condition shall be capable of maintaining such conditions until 
cold shutdown can be achieved. If such equipment and systems will not be 
capable of being powered by both onsite and offsite electric power 
systems because of fire damage, an independent onsite power system shall 
be provided. The number of operating shift personnel, exclusive of fire 
brigade members, required to operate such equipment and systems shall be 
on site at all times.
    5. Equipment and systems comprising the means to achieve and 
maintain cold shutdown conditions shall not be damaged by fire; or the 
fire damage to such equipment and systems shall be limited so that the 
systems can be made operable and cold shutdown can be achieved within 72 
hours. Materials for such repairs shall be readily available on site and 
procedures shall be in effect to implement such repairs. If such 
equipment and systems used prior to 72 hours after the fire will not be 
capable of being powered by both onsite and offsite electric power 
systems because of fire damage, an independent onsite power system shall 
be provided. Equipment and systems used after 72 hours may be powered by 
offsite power only.
    6. Shutdown systems installed to ensure postfire shutdown capability 
need not be designed to meet seismic Category I criteria, single failure 
criteria, or other design basis accident criteria, except where required 
for

[[Page 788]]

other reasons, e.g., because of interface with or impact on existing 
safety systems, or because of adverse valve actions due to fire damage.
    7. The safe shutdown equipment and systems for each fire area shall 
be known to be isolated from associated non-safety circuits in the fire 
area so that hot shorts, open circuits, or shorts to ground in the 
associated circuits will not prevent operation of the safe shutdown 
equipment. The separation and barriers between trays and conduits 
containing associated circuits of one safe shutdown division and trays 
and conduits containing associated circuits or safe shutdown cables from 
the redundant division, or the isolation of these associated circuits 
from the safe shutdown equipment, shall be such that a postulated fire 
involving associated circuits will not prevent safe shutdown. \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ An acceptable method of complying with this alternative would be 
to meet Regulatory Guide 1.75 position 4 related to associated circuits 
and IEEE Std 384-1974 (Section 4.5) where trays from redundant safety 
divisions are so protected that postulated fires affect trays from only 
one safety division.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    M. Fire barrier cable penetration seal qualification. Penetration 
seal designs shall utilize only noncombustible materials and shall be 
qualified by tests that are comparable to tests used to rate fire 
barriers. The acceptance criteria for the test shall include:
    1. The cable fire barrier penetration seal has withstood the fire 
endurance test without passage of flame or ignition of cables on the 
unexposed side for a period of time equivalent to the fire resistance 
rating required of the barrier;
    2. The temperature levels recorded for the unexposed side are 
analyzed and demonstrate that the maximum temperature is sufficiently 
below the cable insulation ignition temperature; and
    3. The fire barrier penetration seal remains intact and does not 
allow projection of water beyond the unexposed surface during the hose 
stream test.
    N. Fire doors. Fire doors shall be self-closing or provided with 
closing mechanisms and shall be inspected semiannually to verify that 
automatic hold-open, release, and closing mechanisms and latches are 
operable.
    One of the following measures shall be provided to ensure they will 
protect the opening as required in case of fire:
    1. Fire doors shall be kept closed and electrically supervised at a 
continuously manned location;
    2. Fire doors shall be locked closed and inspected weekly to verify 
that the doors are in the closed position;
    3. Fire doors shall be provided with automatic hold-open and release 
mechanisms and inspected daily to verify that doorways are free of 
obstructions; or
    4. Fire doors shall be kept closed and inspected daily to verify 
that they are in the closed position.
    The fire brigade leader shall have ready access to keys for any 
locked fire doors.
    Areas protected by automatic total flooding gas suppression systems 
shall have electrically supervised self-closing fire doors or shall 
satisfy option 1 above.
    O. Oil collection system for reactor coolant pump. The reactor 
coolant pump shall be equipped with an oil collection system if the 
containment is not inerted during normal operation. The oil collection 
system shall be so designed, engineered, and installed that failure will 
not lead to fire during normal or design basis accident conditions and 
that there is reasonable assurance that the system will withstand the 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake. \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Regulatory Guide 1.29--``Seismic Design Classification'' 
paragraph C.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Such collection systems shall be capable of collecting lube oil from 
all potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the reactor 
coolant pump lube oil systems. Leakage shall be collected and drained to 
a vented closed container that can hold the entire lube oil system 
inventory. A flame arrester is required in the vent if the flash point 
characteristics of the oil present the hazard of fire flashback. Leakage 
points to be protected shall include lift pump and piping, overflow 
lines, lube oil cooler, oil fill and drain lines and plugs, flanged 
connections on oil lines, and lube oil reservoirs where such features 
exist on the reactor coolant pumps. The drain line shall be large enough 
to accommodate the largest potential oil leak.

Appendix S to Part 50--Earthquake Engineering Criteria for Nuclear Power 
                                 Plants

                           General Information

    This appendix applies to applicants for a design certification or 
combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter or a construction 
permit or operating license pursuant to part 50 of this chapter on or 
after January 10, 1997. However, for either an operating license 
applicant or holder whose construction permit was issued prior to 
January 10, 1997, the earthquake engineering criteria in Section VI of 
Appendix A to 10 CFR part 100 continues to apply.

[[Page 789]]

                             I. Introduction

    (a) Each applicant for a construction permit, operating license, 
design certification, or combined license is required by Sec. 50.34 
(a)(12), (b)(10), and General Design Criterion 2 of Appendix A to this 
part to design nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components 
important to safety to withstand the effects of natural phenomena, such 
as earthquakes, without loss of capability to perform their safety 
functions. Also, as specified in Sec. 50.54(ff), nuclear power plants 
that have implemented the earthquake engineering criteria described 
herein must shut down if the criteria in Paragraph IV(a)(3) of this 
appendix are exceeded.
    (b) These criteria implement General Design Criterion 2 insofar as 
it requires structures, systems, and components important to safety to 
withstand the effects of earthquakes.

                                II. Scope

    The evaluations described in this appendix are within the scope of 
investigations permitted by Sec. 50.10(c)(1).

                            III. Definitions

    As used in these criteria:
    Combined license means a combined construction permit and operating 
license with conditions for a nuclear power facility issued pursuant to 
Subpart C of Part 52 of this chapter.
    Design Certification means a Commission approval, issued pursuant to 
Subpart B of Part 52 of this chapter, of a standard design for a nuclear 
power facility. A design so approved may be referred to as a ``certified 
standard design.''
    The Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion (OBE) is the vibratory 
ground motion for which those features of the nuclear power plant 
necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health and 
safety of the public will remain functional. The Operating Basis 
Earthquake Ground Motion is only associated with plant shutdown and 
inspection unless specifically selected by the applicant as a design 
input.
    A response spectrum is a plot of the maximum responses 
(acceleration, velocity, or displacement) of idealized single-degree-of-
freedom oscillators as a function of the natural frequencies of the 
oscillators for a given damping value. The response spectrum is 
calculated for a specified vibratory motion input at the oscillators' 
supports.
    The Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion (SSE) is the vibratory 
ground motion for which certain structures, systems, and components must 
be designed to remain functional.
    The structures, systems, and components required to withstand the 
effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion or surface 
deformation are those necessary to assure:
    (1) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary;
    (2) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition; or
    (3) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents that could result in potential offsite exposures comparable to 
the guideline exposures of Sec. 50.34(a)(1).
    Surface deformation is distortion of geologic strata at or near the 
ground surface by the processes of folding or faulting as a result of 
various earth forces. Tectonic surface deformation is associated with 
earthquake processes.

                  IV. Application To Engineering Design

    The following are pursuant to the seismic and geologic design basis 
requirements of Sec. 100.23 of this chapter:
    (a) Vibratory Ground Motion.
    (1) Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion.
    (i) The Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion must be characterized 
by free-field ground motion response spectra at the free ground surface. 
In view of the limited data available on vibratory ground motions of 
strong earthquakes, it usually will be appropriate that the design 
response spectra be smoothed spectra. The horizontal component of the 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion in the free-field at the 
foundation level of the structures must be an appropriate response 
spectrum with a peak ground acceleration of at least 0.1g.
    (ii) The nuclear power plant must be designed so that, if the Safe 
Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion occurs, certain structures, systems, 
and components will remain functional and within applicable stress, 
strain, and deformation limits. In addition to seismic loads, applicable 
concurrent normal operating, functional, and accident-induced loads must 
be taken into account in the design of these safety-related structures, 
systems, and components. The design of the nuclear power plant must also 
take into account the possible effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake 
Ground Motion on the facility foundations by ground disruption, such as 
fissuring, lateral spreads, differential settlement, liquefaction, and 
landsliding, as required in Sec. 100.23 of this chapter.
    (iii) The required safety functions of structures, systems, and 
components must be assured during and after the vibratory ground motion 
associated with the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion through 
design, testing, or qualification methods.
    (iv) The evaluation must take into account soil-structure 
interaction effects and the expected duration of vibratory motion. It is

[[Page 790]]

permissible to design for strain limits in excess of yield strain in 
some of these safety-related structures, systems, and components during 
the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion and under the postulated 
concurrent loads, provided the necessary safety functions are 
maintained.
    (2) Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion.
    (i) The Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion must be 
characterized by response spectra. The value of the Operating Basis 
Earthquake Ground Motion must be set to one of the following choices:
    (A) One-third or less of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion 
design response spectra. The requirements associated with this Operating 
Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in Paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I ) can be 
satisfied without the applicant performing explicit response or design 
analyses, or
    (B) A value greater than one-third of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake 
Ground Motion design response spectra. Analysis and design must be 
performed to demonstrate that the requirements associated with this 
Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in Paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I) 
are satisfied. The design must take into account soil-structure 
interaction effects and the duration of vibratory ground motion.
    (I) When subjected to the effects of the Operating Basis Earthquake 
Ground Motion in combination with normal operating loads, all 
structures, systems, and components of the nuclear power plant necessary 
for continued operation without undue risk to the health and safety of 
the public must remain functional and within applicable stress, strain, 
and deformation limits.
    (3) Required Plant Shutdown. If vibratory ground motion exceeding 
that of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion or if significant 
plant damage occurs, the licensee must shut down the nuclear power 
plant. If systems, structures, or components necessary for the safe 
shutdown of the nuclear power plant are not available after the 
occurrence of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion, the licensee 
must consult with the Commission and must propose a plan for the timely, 
safe shutdown of the nuclear power plant. Prior to resuming operations, 
the licensee must demonstrate to the Commission that no functional 
damage has occurred to those features necessary for continued operation 
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public and the 
licensing basis is maintained.
    (4) Required Seismic Instrumentation. Suitable instrumentation must 
be provided so that the seismic response of nuclear power plant features 
important to safety can be evaluated promptly after an earthquake.
    (b) Surface Deformation. The potential for surface deformation must 
be taken into account in the design of the nuclear power plant by 
providing reasonable assurance that in the event of deformation, certain 
structures, systems, and components will remain functional. In addition 
to surface deformation induced loads, the design of safety features must 
take into account seismic loads and applicable concurrent functional and 
accident-induced loads. The design provisions for surface deformation 
must be based on its postulated occurrence in any direction and azimuth 
and under any part of the nuclear power plant, unless evidence indicates 
this assumption is not appropriate, and must take into account the 
estimated rate at which the surface deformation may occur.
    (c) Seismically Induced Floods and Water Waves and Other Design 
Conditions. Seismically induced floods and water waves from either 
locally or distantly generated seismic activity and other design 
conditions determined pursuant to Sec. 100.23 of this chapter must be 
taken into account in the design of the nuclear power plant so as to 
prevent undue risk to the health and safety of the public.
