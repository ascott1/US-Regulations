                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 403.111  How must funds be used under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program and the Postsecondary and Adult Vocational Education Programs?

    (a)(1) Each eligible recipient that receives an award under 
Sec. 403.112, Sec. 403.113, or Sec. 403.116 shall use funds under that 
award to improve vocational education programs.
    (2) Projects assisted with funds awarded under Sec. 403.112,

    (i) Provide for the full participation of individuals who are 
members of special populations by providing the supplementary and other 
services required by Sec. 403.190(b) necessary for them to succeed in 
vocational education; and

    Cross-Reference: See appendix A to part 403 and Secs. 403.190(c) and 
403.193(e).

    (ii) Operate at a limited number of sites or with respect to a 
limited number of program areas.
    (3) If an eligible recipient that receives an award under 
Sec. 403.112, Sec. 403.113, or Sec. 403.116 meets the requirements in

    (b) Each eligible recipient that receives an award under 
Sec. 403.112, Sec. 403.113, or Sec. 403.116 shall give priority for 
assistance under those sections to sites or program areas that serve the 
highest concentrations of individuals who are members of special 
populations.

    Examples: Methods by which an eligible recipient may give priority 
to sites or program areas that serve the highest concentrations of 
individuals who are members of special populations include, but are not 
limited to, the following:

    Example 1: Method to give priority to a limited number of sites. 
Based on data from the preceding fiscal year--
    (a) First, a local educational agency ranks each site based on the 
percentage of the site's total enrollment of students who are members of 
special populations.
    (b) Second, the local educational agency establishes a funding cut-
off point for sites above the district-wide percentage of special 
populations enrollment. The local educational agency funds sites above 
the cut-off point but does not fund sites below that point.
    Example 2: Method to give priority to a limited number of program 
areas. Based on data from the preceding fiscal year--
    (a) First, a postsecondary institution ranks each program area based 
on the percentage of the program area's total enrollment of students who 
are members of special populations.
    (b) Second, the postsecondary institution establishes a funding cut-
off point for program areas that rank above the institution-

[[Page 42]]

wide average percentage of special populations enrollment. The 
postsecondary institution funds projects in a program area that is above 
the cut-off point but does not fund projects in program areas below that 
point.
    Example 3: Method to give priority to a limited number of sites. 
Based on data from the preceding fiscal year--
    (a) First, an LEA or postsecondary institution identifies a site 
with a high concentration of special populations;
    (b) Second, the LEA or postsecondary institution identifies a 
program area at the site (such as health occupations) in which the 
participation rate for members of special populations has been lower 
than the overall rate of participation for members of special 
populations at the site; and
    (c) Third, the LEA or postsecondary institution funds a project at 
the site designed to improve the participation rate of members of 
special populations in that program area.

    Note to examples in Sec. 403.111: Absolute counts of special

Sec. 403.112  How does a State allocate funds under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program to local educational agencies?

    (a) Reservation of funds. From the portion of its allotment under 
Sec. 403.180(b)(1) for the basic programs, each fiscal year a State may 
reserve funds for the Secondary School Vocational Education Program.
    (b) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section and Sec. 401.119, a State shall distribute funds reserved 
for the Secondary School Vocational Education Program to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) according to the following formula:
    (1) From 70 percent of the amount reserved, an LEA must be allocated 
an amount that bears the same relationship to the 70 percent as the 
amount the LEA was allocated under section 1005 of chapter 1 (20 U.S.C. 
2711) in the fiscal or program year preceding the fiscal or program year 
in which the allocation is made bears to the total amount received under 
section 1005 of chapter 1 by all LEAs in the State in that preceding 
year.
    (2) From 20 percent of the amount reserved, an LEA must be allocated 
an amount that bears the same relationship to the 20 percent as the 
number of students with disabilities who have individualized education 
programs under section 614(a)(5) of the IDEA served by the LEA in the 
fiscal or program year preceding the fiscal or program year in which the 
allocation is made bears to the total number of those students served by 
all LEAs in the State in that preceding year.
    (3) From 10 percent of the amount reserved, an LEA must be allocated 
an amount that bears the same relationship to the 10 percent as the 
number of students enrolled in schools and adults enrolled in vocational 
education training programs under the jurisdiction of the LEA in the 
fiscal or program year preceding the fiscal or program year in which the 
allocation is made bears to the number of students enrolled in schools 
in kindergarten through 12th grade and adults enrolled in vocational 
education training programs under the jurisdiction of all LEAs in the 
State in that preceding year.

    Example: Assume that a State has reserved $5,000,000 of its basic 
programs funds under Title II of the Act for secondary school programs.
    (a)(1) All LEAs in the State were allocated a total of $80,000,000 
under section 1005 of Chapter 1 in the preceding fiscal year. Of that 
amount, school district ``A'' was allocated $400,000.
    (2) The allocation for school district ``A'' is calculated by 
multiplying $3,500,000 (70 percent of $5,000,000) by .005 of the State 
total ($400,000<divide>$80,000,000). The allocation for school district 
``A'' would be $17,500 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (b)(1) All LEAs in a State served a total of 100,000 students with 
disabilities who have individualized education programs under section 
614(a)(5) of the IDEA in the preceding fiscal year. Of that total, 
school district ``A'' served 400 of those students in the preceding 
fiscal year.
    (2) The allocation for school district ``A'' is calculated by 
multiplying $1,000,000 (20 percent of $5,000,000) by .004 of the State 
total (400<divide>100,000). The allocation for school district ``A'' 
would be $4,000 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c)(1) All LEAs in a State enrolled a total of 1,000,000 students 
(including adults enrolled in vocational education training programs in 
those LEAs) in the preceding fiscal year. Of that number school district 
``A'' enrolled 3,500 of those students in the preceding fiscal year.
    (2) The allocation for school district ``A'' is calculated by 
multiplying 500,000 (10 percent of $5,000,000) by .0035 of the State 
total (3,500<divide>1,000,000). The allocation for school district ``A'' 
would be $1,750 under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

    (c) Exception to the general rule. In applying the provisions in 
paragraph (b) of this section, a State may not distribute funds to an 
LEA that operates only elementary schools, but shall instead distribute 
funds that would have been allocated for those ineligible LEAs as 
follows:
    (1) If an LEA that operates only elementary schools sends its 
graduating students to a single local or regional educational agency 
that provides secondary school services to secondary school students in 
the same attendance area, a State shall distribute to that local or 
regional educational agency any amounts under paragraph (b) of this 
section that would otherwise have been allocated to LEAs operating only 
elementary schools.
    (2) If an LEA that operates only elementary schools sends its 
graduating

[[Page 44]]

students to two or more local or regional educational agencies that 
provide secondary school services to secondary students in the same 
attendance area, the State shall distribute to those local or regional 
educational agencies an amount based on the proportionate number of 
students each agency received in the previous year from the LEA that 
operates only elementary schools.
    (d)(1) Minimum grant amount. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section, an LEA is not eligible for a grant under the Secondary 
School Vocational Education Program unless the amount allocated to the 
LEA under paragraph (b) of this section is not less than $15,000.
    (2)(i) An LEA may enter into a consortium with one or more LEAs for 
the purpose of providing services under the Secondary School Vocational 
Education Program in order to meet the minimum grant requirement in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) A consortium arrangement under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section must serve primarily as a structure for operating joint projects 
that provide services to all participating local educational agencies.
    (iii) A project operated by a consortium must meet the size, scope, 
and quality requirement of Sec. 403.111(c)(1).
    Example: Under the distribution formula for the Secondary School 
Vocational Education Program, three LEAs earn $5,000 each (which is less 
than the $15,000 minimum grant amount for each LEA). The LEAs form a 
consortium in order to receive an award. One of the LEAs is designated 
as the fiscal agent for the consortium and receives the $15,000 award 
for the consortium. The consortium may operate and fund with the $15,000 
a project or projects for the benefit of all participating LEAs. The 
fiscal agent of the consortium may not subgrant back to the 
participating LEAs the amounts they contributed to the consortium.
    (3) A State may waive paragraph (d)(1) of this section in any case 
in which the LEA--
    (i) Is located in a rural, sparsely populated area;
    (ii) Demonstrates that it is unable to enter into a consortium for 
purposes of providing services under the Secondary School Vocational 
Education Program; and
    (iii) Demonstrates that the projects to be assisted meet the size, 
scope, and quality requirements in Sec. 403.111(c)(1).
    (4) Any amounts that are not distributed by reason of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section must be redistributed in accordance with the 
provisions in paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 403.113  How does a State allocate funds under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program to area vocational education schools and intermediate 
          educational agencies?

    (a) A State shall distribute funds reserved under Sec. 403.112(a) 
directly to the appropriate area vocational education school or 
intermediate educational agency in any case in which--
    (1) The area vocational education school or intermediate educational 
agency and an LEA--
    (i) Have formed or will form a consortium for the purpose of 
receiving funds reserved under Sec. 403.112(a); or
    (ii) Have entered into or will enter into a cooperative arrangement 
for the purpose of receiving funds reserved under Sec. 403.112(a); and
    (2)(i) The area vocational education school or intermediate 
educational agency serves a proportion of students with disabilities and 
students who are economically disadvantaged that is approximately equal 
to or greater than the proportion of those students attending the 
secondary schools under the jurisdiction of all of the LEAs sending 
students to the area vocational education school or the intermediate 
educational agency; or
    (ii) The area vocational education school or intermediate 
educational agency demonstrates that it is unable to meet the criterion 
in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section due to the lack of interest by 
students with disabilities and students who are economically 
disadvantaged in attending vocational education programs in that area 
vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.

[[Page 45]]

    (b) If an area vocational education school or intermediate 
educational agency meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, then the amount that would otherwise be allocated to the LEA 
may be distributed to the area vocational education school, the 
intermediate educational agency, and the LEA--
    (1) Based on each school's or entity's relative share of students 
with disabilities and students who are economically disadvantaged who 
are attending vocational education programs that meet the requirements 
of Sec. 403.111 (based, if practicable, on the average enrollment for 
the prior 3 years); or
    (2) On the basis of an agreement between the LEA and the area 
vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and 
Secs. 403.114 and 403.115, prior to distributing funds to any LEA that 
would receive an allocation that is not sufficient to conduct a program 
that meets the requirements of Sec. 403.111(c), a State shall encourage 
the LEA to--
    (1) Form a consortium or enter a cooperative agreement with an area 
vocational education school or intermediate educational agency offering 
programs that meet the requirements of Sec. 403.111(c), and that are 
accessible to economically disadvantaged students and students with 
disabilities that would be served by the LEA; and
    (2) Transfer its allocation to an area vocational education school 
or intermediate educational agency.
    (d) If an LEA's allocation under Sec. 403.112 meets the minimum 
grant requirement in Sec. 403.112(d), and the allocation is distributed 
in part to an area vocational education school or an intermediate 
educational agency pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
the LEA may retain the amount not distributed to the area vocational 
education school or an intermediate educational agency even though that 
amount is less than the minimum grant required by Sec. 403.112(d).

<R05>
Sec. 403.114  How does a State determine the number of economically disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs under the Secondary School 
          Vocational Education Program?

    (a) For the purposes of Sec. 403.113, a State may determine the 
number of economically disadvantaged students attending vocational 
education programs on any of the following bases:
    (1) Eligibility for one of the following:
    (i) Free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Act 
(42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.).
    (ii) The program for aid to Families with Dependent Children under 
part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601).
    (iii) Benefits under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011).
    (iv) To be counted for purposes of section 1005 of chapter 1.
    (v) Participation in programs assisted under title II of the JTPA.
    (2) Receipt of a Pell grant or assistance under a comparable State 
program of need-based financial assistance.
    (3) Status of an individual who is determined by the Secretary to be 
low-income according to the latest available data from the Department of 
Commerce or the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty 
Guidelines.
    (4) Other indices of economic status, including estimates of those 
indices, if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary 
that those indices are more representative of the number of economically 
disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs. The 
Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether other indices of 
economic status are more representative of the number of economically 
disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs, taking 
into consideration, for example, the statistical reliability of any data 
submitted by a grantee as well as the general acceptance of the indices 
by other agencies in the State or local area.
    (b) If a State elects to use more than one factor described in 
paragraph (a) of

[[Page 46]]

this section for purposes of determining the number of economically 
disadvantaged students enrolled in vocational education programs, the 
State shall ensure that the data used are not duplicative.

Sec. 403.115  What appeal procedures must be established under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program?

    The State board shall establish an appeals procedure for resolution 
of any dispute arising between an LEA and an area vocational education 
school or an intermediate educational agency with respect to the 
allocation procedures described in Secs. 403.112 and 403.113, including 
the decision of an LEA to leave a consortium.

    For the purposes of Secs. 403.116, 403.118, and 403.120 the 
following definitions apply:
    (a) Eligible institution means an institution of higher education, 
an LEA serving adults, or an area vocational education school serving 
adults that offers or will offer a program that meets the requirements 
of Sec. 403.111 and seeks to receive assistance under Sec. 403.116.
    (b)(1) Institution of higher education means an educational 
institution in any State that--
    (i) Admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of

leading to a degree or certificate upon completion of that training;
    (iv) Is a public or other nonprofit institution; and
    (v) Is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or 
association approved by the Secretary for this purpose or, if not so 
accredited--
    (A) Is an institution with respect to which the Secretary has 
determined that there is satisfactory assurance, considering the 
resources available to the institution, the period of time, if any, 
during which it has operated, the effort it is making to meet 
accreditation standards, and the purpose for which this determination is

Program in Sec. 403.91, or the Program for Criminal Offenders in 
Sec. 403.101, respectively, is less than the amount reserved for that 
program in FY 1990 (funds from the FY 1990 appropriation awarded in the 
States FY 1991 grant), a State shall subtract any amount necessary to 
satisfy the $250,000 minimum for State administration or any of the 
``hold-harmless'' amounts from the total basic programs award received 
by the State.
    (2) The State shall reserve $250,000 for administration and shall 
reserve for any program not meeting the ``hold-harmless'' requirement an 
amount necessary to meet that requirement.
    (3) The State shall reserve from the remainder of the basic program 
award an amount for each of the remaining programs that is proportionate

    Example 1: (a) A State receives a basic programs award of 
$4,000,000. Five percent of the basic programs award equals $200,000, 
which is $50,000 less than the $250,000 minimum that may be reserved for 
State administration. To determine the amount of funds that will be 
reserved for each program under title II, parts A, B, and C of the Act, 
the State first subtracts $250,000 for State administration from the 
$4,000,000 basic programs award ($4,000,000-$250,000=$3,750,000).
    (b) Second, the State determines the amount that would have been 
reserved for each of the programs under title II, parts A, B, and C of 
the Act in the absence of a shortfall in the set-aside amount for 
administration, as follows:

3.0% x $4,000,000=                                    $120,000  for Sex Equity Programs.

7.5% x $4,000,000=                                     300,000  for Programs for Single Parents, Displaced      
                                                                 Homemakers, and Single Pregnant Women.         
8.5% x $4,000,000=                                     340,000  for State Programs and State Leadership         
                                                                 Activities.                                    
1.0% x $4,000,000=                                      40,000  for Programs for Criminal Offenders.            
75% x $4,000,000=                                    3,000,000  for part C of title II.                         
                                                  -------------                                                 
                                                     3,800,000                                                  
                                                                                                                

    (c) Third, the State converts each of these amounts into a 
percentage by dividing each amount by the sum of the amounts the 
programs would have received in the absence of a shortfall ($3,800,000) 
and multiplies the remaining basic programs award ($3,750,000) by these 
percentages to determine the amount to reserve for each program under 
parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act, as follows:

($120,000/$3,800,000) x $3,750,000=                   $118,421  for Sex Equity Programs.                        
($300,000/$3,800,000) x $3,750,000=                    296,053  for Programs for Single Parents, Displaced      
                                                                 Homemakers, and Single Pregnant Women.         
($340,000/$3,800,000) x $3,750,000=                    335,526  for State Programs and State Leadership         
                                                                 Activities.                                    
($40,000/$3,800,000) x $3,750,000=                      39,474  for Programs for Criminal Offenders.            
($3,000,000/$3,800,000) x $3,750,000=                2,960,526  for part C of title II.                         
                                                  -------------                                                 
                                                     3,750,000                                                  
                                                                                                                

    This example assumes that amounts reserved meet the ``hold-
harmless'' requirement of section 102(c)(1) of the Act.
    Example 2: A State's seven percent reserve from its FY 1992 grant 
for the Program for Single Parents, Displaced Homemakers, and Single 
Pregnant Women is $1,400,000 and the amount reserved for that program 
from its FY 1991 grant was $1,581,000. Therefore, the amount of FY 1992 
funds reserved for that program is $181,000 less than the amount 
reserved in FY 1991. The State received a basic programs award of 
$20,000,000 in FY 1992. The other programs under title II, part B meet 
the ``hold-harmless'' requirement in Sec. 403.180(a)(1), and the amount 
reserved for State administration exceeds $250,000. The State determines 
the amount of funds to be reserved for each program under title II, 
parts A, B, and C of the Act as follows:
    (a) First, the State subtracts $1,581,000 from the $20,000,000 total 
basic programs award ($20,000,000-$1,581,000=$18,419,000).
    (b) Second, the State determines the amount that would have been 
reserved for each of the programs under parts A, B, and C of title II of 
the Act in the absence of a shortfall in the set-aside amount for the 
Program for Single Parents, Displaced Homemakers, and Single Pregnant 
Women, as follows:

5.0% x $20,000,000=                                 $1,000,000  for administration.                             
3.5% x $20,000,000=                                    700,000  for Sex Equity Programs.                        
8.5% x $20,000,000=                                  1,700,000  for State Programs and State Leadership         
                                                                 Activities.                                    
1.0% x $20,000,000=                                    200,000  for Programs for Criminal Offenders.            
75.0% x $20,000,000=                                15,000,000  for part C of title II.                         
                                                  -------------                                                 
                                                    18,600,000                                                  
                                                                                                                

    (c) Third, the State converts each of these amounts into a 
percentage by dividing each amount by the sum of the amounts the 
programs would have earned in the absence of a shortfall ($18,600,000) 
and multiplies the remaining basic programs award ($18,419,000)

[[Page 57]]

by these percentages to determine the amount to reserve for each program 
under parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act, as follows:

($1,000,000/$18,600,000) x $18,419,000=               $990,269  for administration.                             
($700,000/$18,600,000) x $18,419,000=                  693,188  for Sex Equity Programs.                        
($1,700,000/$18,600,000) x $18,419,000=              1,683,457  for State Programs and State Leadership         
                                                                 Activities.                                    
($200,000/$18,600,000) x $18,419,000=                  198,054  for Programs for Criminal Offenders.            
($15,000,000/$18,600,000) x $18,419,000=            14,854,032  for part C of title II.                         
                                                  -------------                                                 
                                                    18,419,000                                                  
                                                                                                                

    This example assumes that amounts reserved for the Sex Equity 
Program and Programs for Criminal Offenders meet the ``hold-harmless'' 
requirement of section 102(c) (1) and (2) of the Act.
    Example 3: A State's one percent reserved from its FY 1992 grant for 
Programs for Criminal Offenders is $200,000 and the amount reserved for 
that program under section 202(6) of the CDPVEA plus other amounts 
obligated for projects, services, and activities for criminal offenders 
in correctional institutions from its FY 1991 grant from the FY 1990 
appropriations totals $250,000. Therefore, the amount of FY 1992 funds 
reserved for that program is $50,000 less than the amount reserved and 
obligated for that program in FY 1991. The State received a basic 
programs award of $20,000,000 in FY 1992. The other programs under title 
II, part B meet the ``hold-harmless requirement of Sec. 403.180(a)(1) 
and the amount reserved for State administration exceeds $250,000. The 
State determines the amount of funds to be reserved for each program 
under title II, parts A, B, and C of the Act as follows:
    (a) First, the State subtracts $250,000 from the
$20,000,000 total basic programs award 
($20,000,000-$250,000=$19,750,000).
    (b) Second, the State determines the amount that would have been 
reserved for each of the programs under parts A, B, and C of title II of 
the Act in the absence of a shortfall in the set-aside amount for the 
Programs for Criminal Offenders, as follows:

5.0% x 20,000,000=                                  $1,000,000  for administration.                             
3.5% x 20,000,000=                                     700,000  for Sex Equity Programs.                        
7.0% x 20,000,000=                                   1,400,000  for Programs for Single Parents, Displaced      
                                                                 Homemakers, and Single Pregnant Women.         
8.5% x 20,000,000=                                   1,700,000  for State Programs and State Leadership         
                                                                 Activities.                                    
75.0% x 20,000,000=                                 15,000,000  for part C of title II.                         
                                                  -------------                                                 
                                                    19,800,000                                                  
                                                                                                                

    (c) Third, the State converts each of these amounts into a 
percentage by dividing each amount by the sum of the amounts the 
programs would have earned in the absence of a shortfall ($19,800,000) 
and multiplies the remaining basic programs award ($19,750,000) by these 
percentages to determine the amount to reserve for each program under 
parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act, as follows:

($1,000,000/$19,800,000) x $19,750,000=                  $997,475  for administration.                          
($700,000/$19,800,000) x $19,750,000=                    $698,232  for Sex Equity Programs.                     
($1,400,000/$19,800,000) x $19,750,000=                $1,396,465  for Programs for Single Parents, Displaced   
                                                                    Homemakers, and Single Pregnant Women.      
($1,700,000/$19,800,000) x $19,750,000=                $1,695,707  for State Programs and State Leadership      
                                                                    Activities.                                 
($15,000,000/$19,800,000) x $19,750,000=              $14,962,121  for part C of title II.                      
                                               -------------------

    This example assumes that amounts reserved for the Sex Equity 
Program and for the Program for Single Parents, Displaced Homemakers, 
and Single Pregnant Women meet the ``hold-harmless'' requirement of 
sections 102(c) (1) and (2) of the Act.

    (d) The procedure for meeting the ratable reduction provision in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section is as follows:
    (1) If a State's basic programs award under title II of the Act for 
FY 1992 or in future years is less than that State's basic grant amount 
in FY 1991, a State shall determine the percentage that the basic 
programs award is of the FY 1991 basic programs award.
    (2) The State shall multiply the amounts reserved in FY 1991 for 
each of the three programs covered by the ``hold-harmless'' provisions 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by this percentage.
    (3) The State shall compare the amounts that would be reserved for 
these programs in FY 1992 to determine if these amounts are less than 
the ratably reduced hold-harmless amounts, and if so, shall proceed with 
the calculation required by paragraph (c) of this section except using 
the ratably reduced ``hold-harmless'' amounts.

Sec. 403.181  What are the cost-sharing requirements applicable to the basic programs?

    (a) A State shall match, from non-Federal sources and on a dollar-
for-dollar basis, the funds reserved for administration of the State 
plan under Sec. 403.180(b)(4).
    (b) The matching requirement under paragraph (a) of this section may 
be applied overall, rather than line-by-line, to State administrative 
expenditures.
    (c) A State shall provide from non-Federal sources for State 
administration under the Act an amount that is not less than the amount 
provided by the State from non-Federal sources for State administrative 
costs for the preceding fiscal or program year.

    Example for paragraph (b): From the five percent reserved for the 
administration of the State plan, a State must reserve $60,000 to carry 
out the provisions in Sec. 403.13. The $60,000 must be matched, but the 
matching funds need not be used for the activities described in 
Sec. 403.13.

2nd Sess. 103-104 (1990))


<R05>
Sec. 403.182  What is the maintenance of fiscal effort requirement?

    The Secretary may not make a payment under the Act to a State for 
any fiscal year unless the Secretary determines that the fiscal effort 
per student, or the aggregate expenditures of that State, from State 
sources, for vocational education for the fiscal year (or program year) 
preceding the fiscal year (or program year) for which the determination 
is made, at least equaled its effort or expenditures for vocational 
education for the second preceding fiscal year (or program year).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 2463(a))


<R05>
Sec. 403.183  Under what circumstances may the Secretary waive the maintenance of effort requirement?

    (a) The Secretary may waive the maintenance of effort requirement in 
Sec. 403.182 for a State for one year only if--
    (1) The Secretary determines that a waiver would be equitable due to 
exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the State's 
ability to maintain fiscal effort; and
    (2) The State has decreased its expenditures for vocational 
education from non-Federal sources by no more than five percent.
    (b) For purposes of this section, ``exceptional or uncontrollable 
circumstances'' include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) A natural disaster.
    (2) An unforeseen and precipitous decline in financial resources.
    (c) The Secretary does not consider tax initiatives or referenda to 
be exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 403.184  How does a State request a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement?

    A State seeking a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement in 
Sec. 403.182 shall--
    (a) Submit to the Secretary a request for a waiver; and
    (b) Include in the request--
    (1) The reason for the request;
    (2) Information that demonstrates that a waiver is justified; and
    (3) Any additional information the Secretary may require.

<R05>
Sec. 403.185  How does the Secretary compute maintenance of effort in the event of a waiver?

    If a State has been granted a waiver of the maintenance of effort 
requirement that allows it to receive a grant for a fiscal year, the 
Secretary determines whether the State has met that requirement for the 
grant to be awarded for the year after the year of the waiver by 
comparing the amount spent for vocational education from non-Federal 
sources in the first preceding fiscal year (or program year) with the 
amount spent in the third preceding fiscal year (or program year).

    Example: Because exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances 
prevented a State from maintaining its level of fiscal effort in a 
program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989) at the level of its 
fiscal effort in program year 1988 (July 1, 1987-June 30, 1988), the 
Secretary granted the State a waiver of the maintenance of effort 
requirement that permits the State to receive its fiscal year 1990 grant 
(a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1990 from funds

Appendix A to Part 403--Examples for 34 CFR 403.111(a) and 403.111(c)(3)

    Illustration of providing full participation under 34 CFR 
403.111(a). An educationally disadvantaged student is enrolled in a 
course that is part of a vocational education program and is having 
trouble understanding a math concept (e.g., negative numbers) necessary 
to succeed in the course. To ensure the student's full participation in 
the course, a local educational agency may use funds awarded under 
Sec. 403.112 as needed to provide tutoring in negative numbers to enable 
the student to understand the concept well enough to complete the 
vocational education course.

[[Page 69]]

    Illustrations of providing equitable participation under 34 CFR 
403.111(c)(3). Example 1: An area vocational education school conducts 
an informal meeting to provide the information required in 
Sec. 403.193(a) regarding the area vocational education school's 
vocational education programs, to parents of students who are members of 
special populations in a local educational agency whose allocation was 
distributed to the area vocational education school under Sec. 403.113. 
The area vocational education school conducts the meeting at a time and 
in a location convenient for these parents and students. At the meeting, 
the area vocational education school provides a staff person to assist 
students or their parents to complete any forms necessary to enroll in 
the area vocational education school's vocational education program.
    Example 2: A hearing-impaired student in a local educational agency 
could participate in the vocational education program only if an 
interpreter is provided for that student. The local educational agency 
cannot refuse to admit the student because of the need for an 
interpreter.

   Appendix B to Part 403--Examples for 34 CFR 403.194--Comparability 
                              Requirements

    Methods by which a local educational agency can demonstrate its 
compliance with the comparability requirements in 34 CFR 403.194(a) 
include the following:
    Example 1: The local educational agency files with the State board a 
written assurance that it has established and implemented--
    (a) A district-wide salary schedule;
    (b) A policy to ensure equivalence among secondary schools or sites 
in teachers, administrators, and auxiliary personnel; and
    (c) A policy to ensure equivalency among secondary schools or sites 
in the provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies.
    Example 2: The local educational agency establishes and implements 
other procedures for ensuring comparability, such as the following:
    (a) Comparing the average number of students per instructional staff 
in each secondary school or site served with Federal funds awarded under 
the State plan with the average number of students per instructional 
staff in secondary schools or sites not served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan. A served school is considered comparable 
if its average does not exceed 110 percent of the average of schools or 
sites in the local educational agency not served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan; or
    (b) Comparing the average instructional staff salary expenditures 
per student in each secondary school or site served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan with the average instructional staff salary 
expenditure per student in schools or sites in the local educational 
agency not served with Federal funds awarded under the State plan. A 
served school is considered comparable if its average is at least 90 
percent of the average of schools or sites not served with Federal funds 
awarded under the State plan.

[[Page 130]]

1, 1989 from funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1989 appropriation);
    (3) 85 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal 
year 1990 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1990 from 
funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1990 appropriation);
    (4) 80 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal 
year 1991 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1991 from 
funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1991 appropriation); and
    (5) 75 percent of the costs of programs carried out with the fiscal

grant thereafter.
    (b) The Federal share for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Virgin Islands is 100 percent.
    (c) The Secretary determines the non-Federal share of expenditures

<R05>
Sec. 461.42  What is the maintenance of effort requirement?

    (a) Basic standard. (1)(i) Except as provided in Sec. 461.43, a 
State is eligible for a grant from appropriations for any fiscal year 
only if the Secretary determines that the State has expended for adult 
education from non-Federal sources during the second preceding fiscal 
year (or program year) an amount not less than the amount expended 
during the third preceding fiscal year (or program year).
    (ii) The Secretary determines maintenance of effort on a per student 
expenditure basis or on a total expenditure basis.
    (2) For purposes of determining maintenance of effort, the ``second 
preceding fiscal year (or program year)'' is the fiscal year (or program 
year) two years prior to the year of the grant for which the Secretary 
is determining the State's eligibility. The ``third preceding fiscal 
year (or program year)'' is the fiscal year (or program year) three 
years prior to the year of the grant for which the Secretary is 
determining the State's eligibility.

                                 Example

    Computation based on fiscal year. If a State chooses to use the 
fiscal year as the basis for its maintenance of effort computations, the 
Secretary determines whether a State is eligible for the fiscal year 
1992 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1992 from funds 
appropriated in the fiscal year 1992 appropriation) by comparing 
expenditures from the second preceding fiscal year--fiscal year 1990 
(October 1, 1989-September 30, 1990)--with expenditures from the third 
preceding fiscal year--fiscal year 1989 (October 1, 1988-September 30, 
1989). If there has been no decrease in expenditures from fiscal year 
1989 to fiscal year 1990, the State has maintained effort and is 
eligible for its fiscal year 1992 grant.
    Computation based on program year. If a State chooses to use a 
program year running from July 1 to June 30 as the basis for its 
maintenance of effort computation, the Secretary determines whether a 
State is eligible for funds for the fiscal year 1992 grant by comparing 
expenditures from the second preceding program year--program year 1990 
(July 1, 1989-June 30, 1990)--with expenditures from the third preceding 
program year--program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989). If there 
has been no decrease in expenditures from program year 1989 to program 
year 1990, the State has maintained effort and is eligible for its 
fiscal year 1992 grant.
    (b) Expenditures to be considered. In determining a State's 
compliance with the maintenance of effort requirement, the Secretary 
considers the expenditures described in Sec. 461.41(c).

[[Page 131]]


<R05>
Sec. 461.43  Under what circumstances may the Secretary waive the maintenance of effort requirement?

    (a) The Secretary may waive, for one year only, the maintenance of 
effort requirement in Sec. 461.42 if the Secretary determines that a 
waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable 
circumstances. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (1) A natural disaster.
    (2) An unforeseen and precipitous decline in financial resources.
    (b) The Secretary does not consider a tax initiative or referendum 
to be an exceptional or uncontrollable circumstance.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1209(b)(2))


<R05>
Sec. 461.44  How does a State request a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement?

    An SEA seeking a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement in 
Sec. 461.42 shall--
    (a) Submit to the Secretary a request for a waiver; and
    (b) Include in the request--(1) The reason for the request; and
    (2) Any additional information the Secretary may require.

<R05>
Sec. 461.45  How does the Secretary compute maintenance of effort in the event of a waiver?

    If a State has been granted a waiver of the maintenance of effort 
requirement that allows it to receive a grant from appropriations for a 
fiscal year, the Secretary determines whether the State has meet that 
requirement for the grant to be awarded for the year after the year of 
the waiver by comparing the amount spent for adult education from non-
Federal sources in the second preceding fiscal year (or program year) 
with the amount spent in the fourth preceding fiscal year (or program 
year.)

                                 Example

    Because exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances prevented a 
State from maintaining effort in fiscal year 1990 (October 1, 1989-
September 30, 1990) or in program year 1990 (July 1, 1989-June 30, 1990) 
at the level of fiscal year 1989 (October 1, 1988-September 30, 1989) or 
program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989), respectively, the 
Secretary grants the State a waiver of the maintenance of effort 
requirement that permits the State to receive its fiscal year 1992 grant 
(a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1992 from funds 
appropriated in the fiscal year 1992 appropriation). In order to 
determine whether a State has met the maintenance of effort requirement 
and therefore is eligible to receive its fiscal year 1993 grant (the 
grant to be awarded for the year after the year of the waiver), the 
Secretary compares the State's expenditures from the second preceding 
fiscal year (or program year--fiscal year 1991 (October 1, 1990-
September 30, 1991) or program year 1991 (July 1, 1990-June 30, 1991)--
with expenditures from the fourth preceding fiscal year--fiscal year 
1989 (October 1, 1988-September 30, 1989) or program year 1989 (July 1, 
1988-June 30, 1989). If the expenditures from fiscal year (or program

    This part establishes the rules and procedures that the Secretary 
uses to determine whether an educational institution qualifies in whole 
or in part as an eligible institution of higher education under the 
Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). An eligible institution 
of higher education may apply to participate in programs authorized by 
the HEA (HEA programs).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1088, 1094, 1099b, 1099c, and 1141)

Sec. 600.2  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to terms used in this part:
    Accredited: The status of public recognition that a nationally 
recognized accrediting agency grants to an institution or educational 
program that meets the agency's established requirements.
    Award year: The period of time from July 1 of one year through June 
30 of the following year.
    Branch Campus: A location of an institution that is geographically 
apart and independent of the main campus of the institution. The 
Secretary considers a location of an institution to be independent of 
the main campus if the location--
    (1) Is permanent in nature;
    (2) Offers courses in educational programs leading to a degree, 
certificate, or other recognized educational credential;
    (3) Has its own faculty and administrative or supervisory 
organization; and

or internship in a 60-minute period; or

[[Page 170]]

    (3) Sixty minutes of preparation in a correspondence course.
    Correspondence course: (1) A ``home study'' course provided by an 
institution under which the institution provides instructional 
materials, including examinations on the materials, to students who are 
not physically attending classes at the institution. When students 
complete a portion of the instructional materials, the students take the 
examinations that relate to that portion of the materials, and return 
the examinations to the institution for grading.
    (2) A home study course that provides instruction in whole or in 
part through the use of video cassettes or video discs in an award year 
is a correspondence course unless the institution also delivers the 
instruction on the cassette or disc to students physically attending 
classes at the institution during the same award year.
    (3) A course at an institution that may otherwise satisfy the 
definition of a ``telecommunications course'' is a correspondence course 
if the sum of telecommunications and other correspondence courses 
offered by that institution equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total 
courses offered at that institution.
    (4) If a course is part correspondence and part residential 
training, the Secretary considers the course to be a correspondence 
course.
    Educational program: A legally authorized postsecondary program of 
organized instruction or study that leads to an academic, professional, 
or vocational degree, or certificate, or other recognized educational 
credential. However, the Secretary does not consider that an institution 
provides an educational program if the institution does not provide 
instruction itself (including a course of independent study), but merely 
gives credit for one or more of the following: instruction provided by 
other institutions or schools; examinations provided by agencies or 
organizations; or other accomplishments such as ``life experience.''
    Eligible institution: An institution that--
    (1) Qualifies as--

PLUS, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (Federal SLS), and Federal 
Consolidation Loan programs, in which lenders use their own funds to 
make loans to enable students or their parents to pay the costs of the 
students' attendance at eligible institutions. The Federal Stafford 
Loan, Federal PLUS, Federal SLS, and Federal Consolidation Loan programs 
are defined in 34 CFR part 668.
    Incarcerated student: A student who is serving a criminal sentence 
in a Federal, State, or local penitentiary, prison, jail, reformatory, 
work farm, or other similar correctional institution. A student is not 
considered incarcerated if that student is in a half-way house or home 
detention or is sentenced to serve only weekends.
    Legally authorized: The legal status granted to an institution 
through a charter, license, or other written document issued by the 
appropriate agency or official of the State in which the institution is 
physically located.
    Nationally recognized accrediting agency: An agency or association 
that the Secretary recognizes as a reliable authority to determine the 
quality of education or training offered by an institution or a program 
offered by an institution. The Secretary recognizes these agencies and 
associations under the provisions of 34 CFR part 602 and publishes a 
list of the recognized agencies in the Federal Register.
    Nonprofit institution: An institution that--
    (1) Is owned and operated by one or more nonprofit corporations or 
associations, no part of the net earnings of which benefits any private 
shareholder or individual;
    (2) Is legally authorized to operate as a nonprofit organization by

agency, recognized by the Secretary to grant that status, has accorded 
an unaccredited public or private nonprofit institution that is 
progressing toward accreditation within a reasonable period of time.
    Recognized equivalent of a high school diploma: The following are 
the equivalent of a high school diploma--
    (1) A General Education Development Certificate (GED);
    (2) A State certificate received by a student after the student has 
passed a State-authorized examination that the State recognizes as the 
equivalent of a high school diploma;
    (3) An academic transcript of a student who has successfully 
completed at least a two-year program that is acceptable for full credit 
toward a bachelor's degree; or

that leads to at least an associate degree or its equivalent and who has 
not completed high school but who excelled academically in high school,

has met the formalized, written policies of the institution for 
admitting such students.
    Recognized occupation: An occupation that is--
    (1) Listed in an ``occupational division'' of the latest edition of 
the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, published by the U.S. Department 
of Labor; or

principally through the use of television, audio, or computer 
transmission, including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, 
microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, computer conferencing, or 
video cassettes or discs. The term does not include a course that is 
delivered using video cassettes or disc recordings unless that course is 
delivered to students physically attending classes at an institution 
providing the course during the same award year. If the course does not 
qualify as a telecommunications course it is considered to be a 
correspondence course, as provided for in paragraph (c) of the 
definition of correspondence course in this section.
    Title IV, HEA program: Any of the student financial assistance 
programs listed in 34 CFR 668.1(c).

school diploma, and the institution does not provide a four-year or two-
year educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree or an 
associate degree, respectively;
    (2) The institution, or an affiliate of the institution that has the 
power, by contract or ownership interest, to direct or cause the 
direction of the management of policies of the institution--
    (A) Files for relief in bankruptcy, or
    (B) Has entered against it an order for relief in bankruptcy; or
    (3) The institution, its owner, or its chief executive officer--
    (i) Has pled guilty to, has pled nolo contendere to, or is found 
guilty of, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of 
title IV, HEA program funds; or
    (ii) Has been judicially determined to have committed fraud 
involving title IV, HEA program funds.
    (b) Special provisions regarding correspondence courses and 
students--(1) Treatment of telecommunications courses. For purposes of 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, the Secretary considers 
a telecommunications course to be a correspondence course if the sum of 
telecommunications courses and other correspondence courses the 
institution provided during that award year equaled or exceeded 50 
percent of the total number of courses it provided during that year.
    (2) Calculating the number of courses. For purposes of paragraphs 
(a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section--
    (i) A correspondence course may be a complete educational program 
offered by correspondence, or one course provided by correspondence in 
an on-campus (residential) educational program;
    (ii) A course must be considered as being offered once during an 
award year regardless of the number of times it is offered during that

[[Page 176]]

    (iii) A course that is offered both on campus and by correspondence 
must be considered two courses for the purpose of determining the total 
number of courses the institution provided during an award year.
    (3) Exceptions. (i) The provisions contained in paragraphs (a)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to an institution that 
qualifies as a ``technical institute or vocational school used 
exclusively or principally for the provision of vocational education to 
individuals who have completed or left high school and who are available 
for study in preparation for entering the labor market'' under section 
521(4)(C) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology 
Education Act.
    (ii) The Secretary waives the limitation contained in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section for an institution that offers a 2-year 
associate-degree or a 4-year bachelor's-degree program if the students 
enrolled in the institution's correspondence courses receive no more 
than 5 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by students 
at that institution.
    (c) Special provisions regarding incarcerated students--(1) 
Exception. The Secretary may waive the prohibition contained in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, upon the application of an 
institution, if the institution is a nonprofit institution that provides 
four-year or two-year educational programs for which it awards 
bachelor's or associate degrees, respectively.
    (2) If the nonprofit institution that applies for a waiver consists 
solely of four-year or two-year educational programs for which it offers 
bachelor's or associate degrees, respectively, or both types of 
programs, the Secretary waives the prohibition contained in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section for the entire institution.
    (3) If the nonprofit institution that applies for a waiver does not 
consist solely of four-year or two-year educational programs for which 
it offers bachelor's or associate degrees, respectively, or both types 
of programs, the Secretary waives the prohibition contained in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section--
    (i) For the four-year and two-year programs that lead, respectively, 
to bachelor's and associate degrees; and
    (ii) For the other programs the institution offers, if the 
incarcerated regular students enrolled in those other programs have a 
completion rate of 50 percent or greater.
    (d) Special provision for a nonprofit institution if more than 50 
percent of its enrollment consists of students who do not have a high 
school diploma or its equivalent. (1) Subject to the provisions 
contained in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the Secretary 
waives the limitation contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section 
for a nonprofit institution if that institution demonstrates to the 
Secretary's satisfaction that it exceeds that limitation because it 
serves, through contracts with Federal, State, or local government 
agencies, significant numbers of students who do not have a high school 
diploma or its recognized equivalent.
    (2) Number of critical students. The Secretary grants a waiver under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section only if no more than 40 percent of the 
institution's enrollment of regular students consists of students who--
    (i) Do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent; and
    (ii) Are not served through contracts described in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section.
    (3) Contracts with Federal, State, or local government agencies. For 
purposes of granting a waiver under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
the contracts referred to must be with Federal, State, or local 
government agencies for the purpose of providing job training to low-
income individuals who are in need of that training. An example of such 
a contract is a job training contract under the Job Training Partnership 
Act (JPTA).
    (e) Special provisions. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)of this 
section, when counting regular students, the institution shall--
    (i) Count each regular student without regard to the full-time or 
part-time nature of the student's attendance (i.e., ``head count'' 
rather than ``full-time equivalent'');
    (ii) Count a regular student once regardless of the number of times 
the

[[Page 177]]

student enrolls during an award year; and
    (iii) Determine the number of regular students who enrolled in the 
institution during the relevant award year by--
    (A) Calculating the number of regular students who enrolled during 
that award year; and
    (B) Excluding from the number of students in paragraph 
(e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the number of regular students who 
enrolled but subsequently withdrew or were expelled from the institution 
and were entitled to receive a 100 percent refund of their tuition and 
fees less any administrative fee that the institution is permitted to 
keep under its fair and equitable refund policy.
    (2) For the purpose of calculating a completion rate under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section, the institution shall--
    (i) Determine the number of regular incarcerated students who 
enrolled in the other programs during the last completed award year;
    (ii) Exclude from the number of regular incarcerated students 
determined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the number of those 
students who enrolled but subsequently withdrew or were expelled from 
the institution and were entitled to receive a 100 percent refund of 
their tuition and fees, less any administrative fee the institution is 
permitted to keep under the institution's fair and equitable refund 
policy;
    (iii) Exclude from the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of 
this section, the number of those regular incarcerated students who 
remained enrolled in the programs at the end of the applicable award 
year;
    (iv) From the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this 
section, determine the number of regular incarcerated students who 
received a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational 
credential awarded for successfully completing the program during the 
applicable award year; and
    (v) Divide the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this 
section by the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section 
and multiply by 100.
    (f)(1) If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under this 
section, the waiver extends indefinitely provided that the institution 
satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year.
    (2) If an institution fails to satisfy the waiver requirements for 
an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that 
award year.
    (g)(1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any 
applicable waiver or exception under this section, the institution shall 
substantiate the required calculations by having the certified public 
accountant who prepares its audited financial statement under 34 CFR 
668.15 or its title IV, HEA program compliance audit under 34 CFR 668.23 
report on the accuracy of those determinations.
    (2) The certified public accountant's report must be based on 
performing an ``attestation engagement'' in accordance with the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA's) Statement on 
Standards for Attestation Engagements. The certified public accountant 
shall include that attestation report with or as part of the audit 
report referenced in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (3) The certified public accountant's attestation report must 
indicate whether the institution's determinations regarding paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section and any relevant waiver or exception under 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section are accurate; i.e., fairly 
presented in all material respects.
    (h) Notice to the Secretary. An institution shall notify the 
Secretary--
    (1) By July 31 following the end of an award year if it falls within 
one of the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a)(1)of this section, or 
fails to continue to satisfy a waiver or exception granted under this 
section; or
    (2) Within 10 days if it falls within one of the prohibitions 
contained in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
    (i) Regaining eligibility. (1) If an institution loses its 
eligibility because of one of the prohibitions contained in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, to regain its eligibility, it must demonstrate--
    (i) Compliance with all eligibility requirements;

[[Page 178]]

    (ii) That it did not fall within any of the prohibitions contained 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for at least one award year; and
    (iii) That it changed its administrative policies and practices to 
ensure that it will not fall within any of the prohibitions contained in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (2) If an institution loses its eligibility because of one of the 
prohibitions contained in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, 
this loss is permanent. The institution's eligibility cannot be 
reinstated.

Sec. 600.8   Treatment of a branch campus.

    A branch campus of an eligible institution must be in existence for

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1099c)


<R05>
Sec. 600.9   Written agreement between an eligible institution and another institution or organization.

    (a) Without losing its eligibility under this part, an eligible 
institution may enter into a written agreement with another eligible 
institution under which the latter institution provides all or a part of 
the educational program of students enrolled in the former institution 
if the former institution gives credit to students enrolled in that 
contracted program on the same basis as if it provided that program 
itself.
    (b) Without losing its eligibility under this part, an eligible 
institution may enter into a written agreement with an institution or 
organization that is not an eligible institution under which the latter 
institution or organization provides a part of the educational program 
of students enrolled in the eligible institution if--
    (1) The eligible institution gives credit to students enrolled in 
that contracted program on the same basis as if it provided that program 
itself;
    (2) The ineligible institution or organization--
    (i) Has not been terminated from participation in the title-IV, HEA

accrediting agency, guarantor, or SPRE, or by the Secretary; and
    (3) The ineligible institution or organization provides--
    (i) Not more than 25 percent of the educational program of a student 
enrolled in the eligible institution; or
    (ii) More than 25 percent but not more than 50 percent of the 
educational program of a student enrolled in the eligible institution so 
long as--
    (A) The eligible institution and the ineligible institution or 
organization are not owned or controlled by the same individual, 
partnership, or corporation; and
    (B) The eligible institution's accrediting agency or, if the 
eligible institution is a public postsecondary vocational educational 
institution, the relevant State agency listed in the Federal Register in 
accordance with 34 CFR part 603, specifically determines that the 
institution's agreement meets the agency's standards for the contracting 
out of educational services.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1094)


<R05>
Sec. 600.10   Date, extent, duration, and consequence of eligibility.

    (a) Date of eligibility. (1) If the Secretary determines that an 
applicant institution satisfies all the statutory and regulatory 
eligibility requirements, the Secretary considers the institution to be 
an eligible institution as of the date--
    (i) The Secretary signs the institution's program participation 
agreement described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, for purposes of 
participating in any title IV, HEA program; and
    (ii) The Secretary receives all the information necessary to make 
that determination for purposes other than participating in any title 
IV, HEA program.

[[Page 179]]

    (2) For purposes of participating in a title IV, HEA program, if an 
eligible institution seeks eligibility for a location or educational 
program not previously designated eligible, and the Secretary determines 
that the location or educational program satisfies all the statutory and 
regulatory eligibility requirements, the Secretary considers the 
location or program to be eligible to participate in that title IV, HEA 
program as of the date the Secretary certifies that location or program 
to so participate.
    (b) Extent of eligibility. (1) If the Secretary determines that the 
entire applicant institution, including all its locations and all its 
educational programs, satisfies the applicable requirements of this 
part, the Secretary extends eligibility to all educational programs and 
locations identified on the institution's application for eligibility.
    (2) If the Secretary determines that only certain educational 
programs or certain locations of an applicant institution satisfy the 
applicable requirements of this part, the Secretary extends eligibility 
only to those educational programs and locations that meet those 
requirements and identifies the eligible educational programs and 
locations in the eligibility notice sent to the institution under 
Sec. 600.21.
    (3) Eligibility does not extend to any location that an institution 
establishes after it receives its eligibility designation if the 
institution provides at least 50 percent of an educational program at 
that location, unless--
    (i) The institution has notified the Secretary of that location in 
accordance with Sec. 600.30(a)(3); and
    (ii) The Secretary does not require the institution to submit an 
eligibility application for that location under Sec. 600.21(c).
    (c) Subsequent additions of educational programs. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if an eligible institution 
adds an educational program after it has been designated as an eligible 
institution by the Secretary, the institution must apply to the 
Secretary to have that additional program designated as an eligible 
program of that institution.
    (2) An eligible institution that adds an educational program after 
it has been designated as an eligible institution by the Secretary does 
not have to apply to the Secretary to have that additional program 
designated as an eligible program of that institution if the additional 
program--
    (i) Leads to an associate, baccalaureate, professional, or graduate 
degree; or
    (ii)(A) Prepares students for gainful employment in the same or 
related recognized occupation as an educational program that has 
previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution by 
the Secretary; and
    (B) Is at least 8 semester hours, 12 quarter hours, or 600 clock 
hours.
    (3) If an institution incorrectly determines under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section that an educational program satisfies the applicable 
statutory and regulatory eligibility provisions without applying to the 
Secretary for approval, the institution is liable to repay to the 
Secretary all HEA program funds received by the institution for that 
educational program, and all the title IV, HEA program funds received by 
or on behalf of students who were enrolled in that educational program.
    (d) Duration of eligibility. (1) If an institution participates in 
the title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary's designation of the 
institution as an eligible institution under the title IV, HEA programs 
expires when the institution's program participation agreement, as 
described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, expires.
    (2) If an institution participates in an HEA program other than a 
title IV, HEA program, the Secretary's designation of the institution as 
an eligible institution, for purposes of that non-title IV, HEA program, 
does not expire as long as the institution continues to satisfy the 
statutory and regulatory requirements governing its eligibility.
    (e) Consequence of eligibility. (1) If, as a part of its 
institutional eligibility application, an institution indicates that it 
wishes to participate in a title IV, HEA program and the Secretary 
determines that the institution satisfies the applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements governing institutional eligibility, the 
Secretary will

[[Page 180]]

determine whether the institution satisfies the standards of 
administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 34 
CFR part 668, subpart B.
    (2) If, as part of its institutional eligibility application, an 
institution indicates that it does not wish to participate in any title 
IV, HEA program and the Secretary determines that the institution 
satisfies the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements governing 
institutional eligibility, the institution is eligible to apply to 
participate in any HEA program listed by the Secretary in the 
eligibility notice it receives under Sec. 600.21. However, the 
institution is not eligible to participate in those programs, or receive 
funds under those programs, merely by virtue of its designation as an 
eligible institution under this part.

Sec. 600.11  Special rules regarding institutional accreditation or preaccreditation.

    (a) Change of accrediting agencies. For purposes of 
Secs. 600.4(a)(5)(i), 600.5(a)(6), and 600.6(a)(5)(i), the Secretary 
does not recognize the accreditation or preaccreditation of an otherwise 
eligible institution if that institution is in the process of changing 
its accrediting agency, unless the institution provides to the 
Secretary--
    (1) All materials related to its prior accreditation or 
preaccreditation; and
    (2) Materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing its 
accrediting agency.
    (b) Multiple accreditation. The Secretary does not recognize the 
accreditation or preaccreditation of an otherwise eligible institution 
if that institution is accredited or preaccredited as an institution by 
more than one accrediting agency, unless the institution--
    (1) Provides to each such accrediting agency and the Secretary the 
reasons for that multiple accreditation or preaccreditation;
    (2) Demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for that multiple 
accreditation or preaccreditation; and
    (3) Designates to the Secretary which agency's accreditation or 
preaccreditation the institution uses to establish its eligibility under 
this part.
    (c) Loss of accreditation or preaccreditation. (1) An institution 
may not be considered eligible for 24 months after it has had its 
accreditation or preaccreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise 
terminated for cause, unless the accrediting agency that took that 
action rescinds that action.
    (2) An institution may not be considered eligible for 24 months 
after it has withdrawn voluntarily from its accreditation or 
preaccreditation status under a show-cause or suspension order issued by 
an accrediting agency, unless that agency rescinds its order.
    (d) Religious exception. (1) If an otherwise eligible institution 
loses its accreditation or preaccreditation, the Secretary considers the 
institution to be accredited or preaccredited for purposes of complying 
with the provisions of Secs. 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6 if the Secretary 
determines that its loss of accreditation or preaccreditation--
    (i) Is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the 
institution; and
    (ii) Is not related to its failure to satisfy the accrediting 
agency's standards.
    (2) If the Secretary considers an unaccredited institution to be 
accredited or preaccredited under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, the Secretary will consider that unaccredited institution 
to be accredited or preaccredited for a period sufficient to allow the 
institution to obtain alternative accreditation or preaccreditation, 
except that period may not exceed 18 months.

reported change affects the institution's eligibility, and the effective 
date of that change.
    (d) The institution's failure to inform the Secretary of the

Sec. 600.31  Change in ownership resulting in a change of control.

    (a) General. (1) An institution that undergoes a change in ownership 
that results in a change of control ceases to qualify as an eligible 
institution upon the change in ownership and control. A change in 
ownership that results in a change in control includes any change by 
which a person who has or thereby acquires an ownership interest in the 
entity that owns this institution or the parent corporation of that 
entity, acquires or loses the ability to control the institution.
    (2) In order to reestablish eligibility and to resume participation 
in the title IV, HEA programs, the institution must demonstrate to the 
Secretary that after the change in ownership and control--
    (i) The institution satisfies all the applicable requirements 
contained in Secs. 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6, except that if the 
institution is a proprietary institution of higher education or 
postsecondary vocational institution, it need not have been in existence 
for two years before seeking eligibility; and
    (ii) The institution qualifies to be certified to participate under 
34 CFR part 668, subpart B.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to terms used in 
this section:
    Closely-held corporation. Closely-held corporation (including the 
term close corporation) means--
    (1) A corporation that qualifies under the law of the State of its 
incorporation as a closely-held corporation; or
    (2) If the State of incorporation has no definition of closely-held 
corporation, a corporation the stock of which --
    (i) Is held by no more than 30 persons; and
    (ii) Has not been and is not planned to be publicly offered.
    Control. Control (including the terms controlling, controlled by and 
under common control with) means the possession, direct or indirect, of 
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and 
policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting 
securities, by contract, or otherwise.
    Ownership. Ownership or ownership interest means a legal or 
beneficial interest in an entity, or a right to share in the profits 
derived from the operation of an entity. The term does not include the 
interests of a mutual fund that is regularly and publicly traded, of an 
institutional investor, or of a profit-sharing plan in which all 
employees of an entity may participate.
    Parent. The parent or parent corporation of a specified corporation 
is the corporation or partnership that controls the specified 
corporation directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
    Person. Person includes a legal person (corporation or partnership) 
or an individual.
    Wholly-owned subsidiary. A wholly-owned subsidiary is one 
substantially all of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by 
its parent together with the parent's other wholly-owned subsidiaries.
    (c) Standards for identifying changes of ownership and control--(1) 
Closely-held corporation. A change in ownership and control occurs 
when--
    (i) A person acquires more than 50 percent of the total outstanding 
voting stock of the corporation;
    (ii) A person who holds an ownership interest in the corporation 
acquires control of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock 
of the corporation; or
    (iii) A person who holds or controls 50 percent or more of the total 
outstanding stock of the corporation ceases to hold or control that 
proportion of the stock of the corporation.
    (2) Publicly-traded corporation required to be registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A change in ownership and 
control occurs when a change of control of the corporation takes place 
that gives rise to the obligation to file a Form 8K with the SEC

[[Page 184]]

notifying that agency of the change in control.
    (3) Other corporations. A change in ownership and control of a 
corporation that is neither closely-held nor required to be registered 
with the SEC occurs when--
    (i) A person who has or acquires an ownership interest acquires both 
control of at least 25 percent of the total outstanding voting stock of 
the corporation and control of the corporation;
    (ii) A person who holds both ownership or control of at least 25 
percent of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and 
control of the corporation, ceases to own or control that proportion of 
the stock of the corporation, or to control the corporation; or
    (iii) For a membership corporation, a person who is or becomes a 
member acquires or loses control of 25 percent of the voting interests 
of the corporation and control of the corporation.
    (4) Partnership or sole proprietorship. A change in ownership and 
control occurs when a person who has or acquires an ownership interest 
acquires or loses control as described in this section.
    (5) Parent corporation. An institution that is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary changes ownership and control when the parent corporation 
changes ownership and control as described in this section.
    (6) Nonprofit corporation or association. An institution that is 
owned by a nonprofit corporation or association changes ownership and 
control when a change specifically described in this paragraph (c) takes 
place.
    (7) Public institution. Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this 
section, an institution owned and operated by a governmental entity 
changes ownership and control only when the ownership of the institution 
is transferred to a different governmental entity or to another person.
    (d) Covered transactions. For the purposes of this section, a change 
in ownership of an institution that results in a change of control may 
include, but is not limited to--
    (1) The sale of the institution;
    (2) The transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the 
institution or its parent corporation;
    (3) The merger of two or more eligible institutions;
    (4) The division of one institution into two or more institutions;
    (5) The transfer of the liabilities of an institution to its parent 
corporation;
    (6) A transfer of assets that comprise a substantial portion of the 
educational business of the institution, except where the transfer 
consists exclusively in the granting of a security interest in those 
assets; or
    (7) A conversion of the institution from a for-profit to a nonprofit 
institution.
    (e) Excluded transactions. A change in ownership and control 
otherwise subject to this section does not include a transfer of 
ownership and control upon the retirement or death of the owner, to--
    (1) A member of the owner's family, as described in Sec. 600.30(f);
    (2) A person with an ownership interest in the institution who has 
been involved in management of the institution for at least two years 
preceding the transfer.
    (f) Transfers subject to contingency. An institution may submit and 
have considered an application for a designation of eligibility and for 
certification under 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, only when the transfer 
has been completed. A transfer is complete for purposes of this section 
when the transfer is otherwise final but is subject to the condition 
subsequent that the institution obtain approval from the Secretary, the 
accrediting agency, or State licensing authority after the transfer. A 
transfer otherwise complete is not considered incomplete or contingent 
where the transferor retains a interest in the stock or assets of the 
institution or its owner solely for purposes of security.

or regulatory requirements that define that educational program as part 
of an eligible institution, the Secretary may in accordance with the 
procedural provisions described in paragraph (a) of this section--

institution as a whole or as to any of its locations or educational 
programs is initiated in accordance with 34 CFR 668.86(b) and becomes

that date a request for a hearing or written material that demonstrates 
that the termination and limitation should not take place.
    (2) Once a termination under this section becomes final, the 
termination is effective with respect to any commitment, delivery, or 
disbursement of funds provided under an applicable title IV, HEA program 
by the institution--
    (i) Made to students enrolled in the ineligible institution, 
location, or educational program; and

limitation is effective with regard to any commitment, delivery, or 
disbursement of funds under the applicable title IV, HEA program by the 
institution--
    (i) Made after the date on which the limitation became final; and
    (ii) Made to students enrolled in the ineligible institution, 
location, or educational program.

disbursements.
    (e) If the Secretary undertakes to terminate the eligibility of an 
institution, location, or program under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section:
    (1) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of 
accreditation or preaccreditation, the sole issue is whether the 
institution, location, or program has the requisite accreditation or 
preaccreditation. The presiding official has no authority to consider 
challenges to the action of the accrediting agency.
    (2) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of legal 
authorization, the sole issue is whether the institution, location, or 
program has the requisite legal authorization. The presiding official 
has no authority to consider challenges to the action of a State agency 
in removing the legal authorization.
    (3) If the basis for the loss of eligibility for title IV, HEA 
program purposes is a notice under 34 CFR part 667 from a SPRE to the 
Secretary of the SPRE's determination that the institution shall not be 
eligible to participate in the title IV, HEA programs, the sole issue is 
whether the SPRE notified the Secretary of that determination. The 
presiding official has no authority to

consider any challenge to the SPRE's determination.

Sec. 600.56  Duration of eligibility determination.

    (a) The eligibility of a foreign institution under this subpart 
expires four years after the date of the Secretary's determination that 
the institution is eligible to apply for participation, except that the 
Secretary may specify a shorter period of eligibility. In the case of a

institution loses its eligibility under this subpart E, an otherwise 
eligible student, continuously enrolled at the institution before the 
loss of eligibility, may receive an FFEL program loan for attendance at 
that institution for the academic year succeeding the academic year in 
which that institution lost its eligibility, if the student actually 
received an FFEL program loan for attendance at the institution for a 
period during which the institution was eligible under this subpart E.

    (4) If the institution or program does not bring itself into 
compliance within the specified period, the agency must take adverse 
action unless the agency extends the period for achieving compliance for 
good cause.
    (d) An accrediting agency shall have a reasonable basis for 
determining that the information it relies on for making the assessments 
described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is accurate.
    (e) An accrediting agency that has established and applies the 
standards in paragraph (b) of this section may establish any additional

or preaccreditation of the institution; and
    (B) A State agency that has suspended, revoked, or terminated the

    (iii) If the agency grants accreditation or preaccreditation to a 
program notwithstanding the actions described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of 
this section, the agency provides to the Secretary a thorough

previous action by a recognized institutional accrediting agency or the 
State does not preclude the agency's grant of accreditation or 
preaccreditation; and
    (iv) If a recognized institutional accrediting agency takes adverse 
action with respect to the institution offering the program or places 
the institution on public probationary status, the agency promptly 
reviews its accreditation or preaccreditation of the program to

accreditation or preaccreditation status of an institution or program 
and any adverse actions it has taken against an accredited or

<R05>
Sec. 603.24   Criteria for State agencies.

    The following are the criteria which the Secretary will utilize in 
designating a State agency as a reliable authority to assess the quality 
of public postsecondary vocational education in its respective State.
    (a) Functional aspects. The functional aspects of the State agency 
must be shown by:
    (1) Its scope of operations. The agency:
    (i) Is statewide in the scope of its operations and is legally 
authorized to approve public postsecondary vocational institutions or 
programs;
    (ii) Clearly sets forth the scope of its objectives and activities, 
both as to kinds and levels of public postsecondary vocational 
institutions or programs covered, and the kinds of operations performed;
    (iii) Delineates the process by which it differentiates among and 
approves programs of varying levels.
    (2) Its organization. The State agency:
    (i) Employs qualified personnel and uses sound procedures to carry 
out its operations in a timely and effective manner;
    (ii) Receives adequate and timely financial support, as shown by its 
appropriations, to carry out its operations;
    (iii) Selects competent and knowledgeable persons, qualified by 
experience and training, and selects such persons in accordance with 
nondiscriminatory practices, (A) to participate on visiting teams, (B) 
to engage in consultative services for the evaluation and approval 
process, and (C) to serve on decision-making bodies.
    (3) Its procedures. The State agency:
    (i) Maintains clear definitions of approval status and has developed 
written procedures for granting, reaffirming, revoking, denying, and 
reinstating approval status;
    (ii) Requires, as an integral part of the approval and reapproval 
process, institutional or program self-analysis and onsite reviews by 
visiting teams, and provides written and consultative guidance to 
institutions or programs and visiting teams.
    (A) Self-analysis shall be a qualitative assessment of the strengths 
and limitations of the instructional program, including the achievement 
of institutional or program objectives, and should involve a 
representative portion of the institution's administrative staff, 
teaching faculty, students, governing body, and other appropriate 
constituencies.
    (B) The visiting team, which includes qualified examiners other than 
agency staff, reviews instructional content, methods and resources, 
administrative management, student services, and facilities. It prepares 
written reports and recommendations for use by the State agency.
    (iii) Reevaluates at reasonable and regularly scheduled intervals 
institutions or programs which it has approved.
    (b) Responsibility and reliability. The responsibility and 
reliability of the State agency will be demonstrated by:

[[Page 208]]

    (1) Its responsiveness to the public interest. The State agency:
    (i) Has an advisory body which provides for representation from 
public employment services and employers, employees, postsecondary 
vocational educators, students, and the general public, including 
minority groups. Among its functions, this structure provides counsel to 
the State agency relating to the development of standards, operating 
procedures and policy, and interprets the educational needs and manpower 
projections of the State's public postsecondary vocational education 
system;
    (ii) Demonstrates that the advisory body makes a real and meaningful 
contribution to the approval process;
    (iii) Provides advance public notice of proposed or revised 
standards or regulations through its regular channels of communications, 
supplemented, if necessary, with direct communication to inform 
interested members of the affected community. In addition, it provides 
such persons the opportunity to comment on the standards or regulations 
prior to their adoption;
    (iv) Secures sufficient qualitative information regarding the 
applicant institution or program to enable the institution or program to 
demonstrate that it has an ongoing program of evaluation of outputs 
consistent with its educational goals;
    (v) Encourages experimental and innovative programs to the extent 
that these are conceived and implemented in a manner which ensures the 
quality and integrity of the institution or program;
    (vi) Demonstrates that it approves only those institutions or 
programs which meet its published standards; that its standards, 
policies, and procedures are fairly applied; and that its evaluations 
are conducted and decisions are rendered under conditions that assure an 
impartial and objective judgment;
    (vii) Regularly reviews its standards, policies and procedures in 
order that the evaluative process shall support constructive analysis, 
emphasize factors of critical importance, and reflect the educational 
and training needs of the student;
    (viii) Performs no function that would be inconsistent with the 
formation of an independent judgment of the quality of an educational 
institution or program;
    (ix) Has written procedures for the review of complaints pertaining 
to institutional or program quality as these relate to the agency's 
standards, and demonstrates that such procedures are adequate to provide 
timely treatment of such complaints in a manner fair and equitable to 
the complainant and to the institution or program;
    (x) Annually makes available to the public (A) its policies for 
approval, (B) reports of its operations, and (C) list of institutions or 
programs which it has approved;
    (xi) Requires each approved school or program to report on changes 
instituted to determine continued compliance with standards or 
regulations;
    (xii) Confers regularly with counterpart agencies that have similar 
responsibilities in other and neighboring States about methods and 
techniques that may be used to meet those responsibilities.
    (2) Its assurances that due process is accorded to institutions or 
programs seeking approval. The State agency:
    (i) Provides for adequate discussion during the on-site visit 
between the visiting team and the faculty, administrative staff, 
students, and other appropriate persons;
    (ii) Furnishes as a result of the evaluation visit, a written report 
to the institution or program commenting on areas of strength, areas 
needing improvement, and, when appropriate, suggesting means of 
improvement and including specific areas, if any, where the institution 
or program may not be in compliance with the agency's standards;
    (iii) Provides the chief executive officer of the institution or 
program with opportunity to comment upon the written report and to file 
supplemental materials pertinent to the facts and conclusions in the 
written report of the visiting team before the agency takes action on 
the report;
    (iv) Provides the chief executive officer of the institution with a 
specific statement of reasons for any adverse

[[Page 209]]

action, and notice of the right to appeal such action before an appeal 
body designated for that purpose;
    (v) Publishes rules of procedure regarding appeals;
    (vi) Continues the approval status of the institution or program 
pending disposition of an appeal;
    (vii) Furnishes the chief executive officer of the institution or 
program with a written decision of the appeal body, including a 
statement of its reasons therefor.
    (c) Capacity to foster ethical practices. The State agency must 
demonstrate its capability and willingness to foster ethical practices 
by showing that it:
    (i) Promotes a well-defined set of ethical standards governing 
institutional or programmatic practices, including recruitment, 
advertising, transcripts, fair and equitable student tuition refunds, 
and student placement services;
    (ii) Maintains appropriate review in relation to the ethical 
practices of each approved institution or program.

purpose of Sec. 6072(a)(2), an applicant institution's average 
educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent 
undergraduate student in the base year must be less than the average 
educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent 
undergraduate student of comparable institutions that offer similar 
institution in that year.
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary determines the average educational and general expenditure per

do not differentiate between graduate and undergraduate E&G expenditures 
by discounting the graduate enrollment using a factor of 2.5 times the 
number of graduate students.
    (b) Each year, the Secretary notifies prospective applicants through 
a notice in the Federal Register of the average educational and general 
expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student at 
comparable institutions that offer similar instruction.

(a) of this section, if the Secretary determines, based upon persuasive 
evidence provided by the institution, that--
    (1) The institution's failure to satisfy the criteria in paragraph 
(a) of this section was due to factors which, if used in determining 
compliance with those criteria, distorted that determination; and
    (2) The institution's designation as an eligible institution under 
this part is otherwise consistent with the purposes of this part.
    (d) For the purpose of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary considers that the following factors may distort an

Number of Pell Grant recipients at the applicant institution during the 
school year immediately preceding that fiscal year.
_______________________________________________________________________
Number of Pell Grant recipients at all applicant institutions during the

Number of graduates of the applicant institution during the school year 
immediately preceding that fiscal year.
_______________________________________________________________________
Number of graduates of all applicant institutions during the school year 
immediately preceding that fiscal year.

The sum of the percentages of those graduates of all applicant 
institutions.

    (4) Adding the amounts obtained in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (b)(1) For each fiscal year, the numerator in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section is calculated by--
    (i) Determining the number of graduates of an applicant institution 
who, within five years of graduating with baccalaureate degrees,

year, each grant is increased on the same basis as it was decreased 
until the grant amount reaches $500,000.
    (d) The amount of any grant that the Secretary determines will not 
be required by a grantee for the period for which the grant was made is

[49 FR 28521, July 21, 1984, as amended at 52 FR 11258, Apr. 8, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 628.31  What selection criteria does the Secretary use in evaluating an application for an endowment challenge grant?

    In evaluating an application for an endowment challenge grant, the 
Secretary uses the following three criteria:
    (a) The Secretary measures the applicant's past efforts to build or 
maintain its existing endowment and quasi-endowment funds by the dollar 
and relative increase in market value to the applicant's existing 
endowment and quasi-endowment funds over the applicant's four fiscal 
years preceding the year of application using the formulas set forth in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.
    (1) In measuring an applicant's dollar increase in its endowment and 
quasi-endowment funds, the Secretary--
    (i) Subtracts from an amount equal to the market value of the 
applicant's endowment and quasi-endowment funds at the end of the four-
year period described in paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal 
to the market value of the applicant's endowment and quasi-endowment 
funds at the beginning of that four-year period; and
    (ii) Divides the result obtained in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section by the applicant's full-time equivalent enrollment at the end of 
the four-year period.
    (2) The Secretary awards points on a sliding scale giving 10 points 
to applicants with the highest dollar increase as calculated in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and no points to applicants with the 
lowest dollar increase.
    (3) In measuring an applicant's relative increase in market value of 
its endowment and quasi-endowment funds, the Secretary--
    (i) Divides an amount equal to the market value of the applicant's 
endowment and quasi-endowment funds at the beginning of the four-year 
period described in paragraph (a) of this section by the applicant's 
full-time equivalent enrollment at the end of the four-year period.
    (ii) Adds $50 to the amount obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section.
    (iii) Divides the result obtained in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section by the amount obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (4)(i) If the amount of endowment per full-time equivalent student 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is $50 or more, the Secretary 
awards points on a sliding scale giving 15 points to applicants with a 
relative increase of 100 percent or more and no points to applicants 
that have had a relative decrease of more than 20 percent.
    (ii) If the amount of endowment per full-time equivalent student 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is less than $50, the 
Secretary awards points on a sliding scale giving 15 points to 
applicants with a relative increase of 100 percent or more and no points 
to applicants that have had no relative increase.
    (5) In measuring the applicant's past effort, the Secretary--
    (i) Excludes real estate from being considered as part of the 
applicant's existing endowment or quasi-endowment fund; and
    (ii) Includes an endowment or quasi-endowment fund operated by a 
foundation if the foundation is tax-exempt and was established for the 
purpose of raising money for the institution.
    (b) The Secretary considers the degree of proposed nongovernmental 
matching funds. (Total: 15 points maximum for the highest proposed 
percentage)
    (1) The Secretary measures the degree to which an applicant proposes 
to match the grant with funds from sources other than a State or local 
government--giving up to 15 points to applicants proposing to obtain the 
largest percentage of matching funds from those nongovermental sources.
    (2) If an applicant is applying for an endowment challenge grant for 
the first time, the Secretary multiplies the maximum number of points 
(i.e., 15 points) on this criterion times the following fraction:


[[Page 239]]

    (3) If an applicant has previously received an endowment challenge 
grant, the Secretary uses the following formula in awarding points under 
this criterion:

    (c) The Secretary considers the need for an endowment challenge 
grant as measured by the applicant's lack of resources.

organizations;
    (ii) Their prior work in the area; and
    (iii) The potential for continuation of the proposed project beyond 
the period of funding (unless the project would be self-terminating);

materials requested or required are relevant to applicable criteria or 
priorities and are reviewed to verify or clarify information about 
projects or applicants in the Secretary's final evaluation of 
applications having equal merit. The Secretary may request or require 
interviews, references, or samples of written materials. Each year the

<R05>
Sec. 647.21  What selection criteria does the Secretary use?

    The Secretary uses the following criteria to evaluate an application 
for a new grant:
    (a) Need (16 Points). The Secretary reviews each application to 
determine the extent to which the applicant can clearly and definitively 
demonstrate the need for a McNair project to serve the target 
population. In particular, the Secretary looks for information that 
clearly defines the target population; describes the academic, financial 
and other problems that prevent potentially eligible project 
participants in the target population from

[[Page 295]]

completing baccalaureate programs and continuing to postbaccalaureate 
programs; and demonstrates that the project's target population is 
underrepresented in graduate education, doctorate degrees conferred and 
careers where a doctorate is a prerequisite.
    (b) Objectives (9 points). The Secretary evaluates the quality of 
the applicant's proposed project objectives on the basis of the extent 
to which they--
    (1) Include both process and outcome objectives relating to the 
purpose of the McNair program stated in Sec. 647.1;
    (2) Address the needs of the target population; and
    (3) Are measurable, ambitious, and attainable over the life of the 
project.
    (c) Plan of Operation (44 points). The Secretary reviews each 
application to determine the quality of the applicant's plans of 
operation, including--
    (1) (4 points) The plan for identifying, recruiting and selecting 
participants to be served by the project, including students enrolled in 
the Student Support Services program;
    (2) (4 points) The plan for assessing individual participant needs 
and for monitoring the academic growth of participants during the period 
in which the student is a McNair participant;
    (3) (5 points) The plan for providing high quality research and 
scholarly activities in which participants will be involved;
    (4) (5 points) The plan for involving faculty members in the design 
of research activities in which students will be involved;
    (5) (5 points) The plan for providing internships, seminars, and 
other educational activities designed to prepare undergraduate students 
for doctoral study;
    (6) (5 points) The plan for providing individual or group services 
designed to enhance a student's successful entry into postbaccalaureate 
education;
    (7) (3 points) The plan to inform the institutional community of the 
goals and objectives of the project;
    (8) (8 points) The plan to ensure proper and efficient 
administration of the project, including, but not limited to matters 
such as financial management, student records management, personnel 
management, the organizational structure, and the plan for coordinating 
the McNair project with other programs for disadvantaged students; and
    (9) (5 points) The follow-up plan that will be used to track the 
academic and career accomplishments of participants after they are no 
longer participating in the McNair project.
    (d) Quality of key personnel (9 points). The Secretary evaluates the 
quality of key personnel the applicant plans to use on the project on 
the basis of the following:
    (1)(i) The job qualifications of the project director.
    (ii) The job qualifications of each of the project's other key 
personnel.
    (iii) The quality of the project's plan for employing highly 
qualified persons, including the procedures to be used to employ members 
of groups underrepresented in higher education, including Blacks, 
Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders (including Native Hawaiians).
    (2) In evaluating the qualifications of a person, the Secretary 
considers his or her experience and training in fields related to the 
objectives of the project.
    (e) Adequacy of the resources and budget (15 points). The Secretary 
evaluates the extent to which--
    (1) The applicant's proposed allocation of resources in the budget 
is clearly related to the objectives of the project;
    (2) Project costs and resources, including facilities, equipment, 
and supplies, are reasonable in relation to the objectives and scope of 
the project; and
    (3) The applicant's proposed commitment of institutional resources 
to the McNair participants, as for example, the commitment of time from

of study, the SEA determines that unusual circumstances justify waiver 
of the full-time attendance requirement, the scholar may enroll part 
time and continue to receive a scholarship payment. The SEA shall 
prorate the payment according to the scholar's enrollment status for the 
academic period during which he or she continues to be enrolled on a 
part-time basis but remains otherwise eligible for the award. For 
example, if a scholar for whom the full-time enrollment requirement is 
waived by the SEA is enrolled as a half-time student for one semester, 
he or she is eligible to receive one-quarter of his or her scholarship 
during that semester.

his or her

[[Page 331]]

scholarship for up to 12 months, beginning on the date the scholar 
otherwise would have enrolled in the institution after the SEA awarded 
his or her scholarship or the date the scholar interrupts enrollment.
    (2) A scholar who postpones or interrupts his or her enrollment at 
an institution of higher education in accordance with standards 
established by the SEA is not eligible to receive scholarship funds 
during the period of postponement or interruption, but is eligible to 
receive scholarship payments on enrollment or re-enrollment at an 
institution of higher education.
    (3) A scholar's periods of postponement or interruption, taken in 
accordance with standards established by the SEA and not in excess of 12 
months, are not considered periods of suspension for the purposes of 
calculating the 12 months provided for suspension prior to termination 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if an 
SEA finds that a scholar fails to meet the requirements of Sec. 654.51 
within an award year, it shall suspend the scholar's eligibility to 
receive scholarship funds until the scholar is able to demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of the SEA that he or she meets these requirements.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a 
scholar's eligibility for a scholarship is terminated when the total of 
his or her suspension periods exceeds 12 months.
    (3) In exceptional circumstances, the SEA may extend the 12-month 
suspension period without terminating a scholar's eligibility under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in accordance with standards 
established by the SEA.
    (c) A scholar who receives an award for a period for which the SEA 
subsequently determines the scholar was ineligible under the 
requirements in Sec. 654.40 or 654.51 shall repay to the SEA the total 
amount of the scholarship funds received for the period during which he 
or she was ineligible.

SEA shall--
    (1) Comply with the criteria, procedures, and assurances in its 
approved participation agreement;
    (2) Disburse the scholarship funds in accordance with Sec. 654.50 to 
the scholar, the institution of higher education in which the scholar

education in which the scholar enrolls;
    (3) Collect any scholarship funds improperly disbursed under 
Sec. 654.50;
    (4) Make reports to the Secretary that the Secretary deems necessary

time of the academic year. In making this determination, the Secretary 
considers circumstances including, but not limited to:
    (i) A demonstration to the satisfaction of the Secretary by the 
institution of unique circumstances that justify granting the request;
    (ii) In the case of a participating institution, demonstration that 
the institution awards, disburses, and delivers, and has since July 23,

weeks of instructional time for an academic year in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that wishes to continue to use a 
reduced number of weeks of instructional time must reapply to the 
Secretary for a reduction whenever the institution is required to apply 
to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA program.
    (d) An institution may demonstrate compliance with paragraphs (b)(3) 
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section by making arrangements that are 
satisfactory to the Secretary to repay any overawards that resulted from 
the improper awarding, disbursing, or delivering of Title IV, HEA

means, if practical.
    (ii) The revocation takes effect on the date that the Secretary 
mails the notice to the institution.
    (iii) The notice states the basis for the revocation, the

is--
    (A) Hand-delivered;
    (B) Mailed; or
    (C) Sent by facsimile transmission.

reconsideration of a revocation and notifies the institution, by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, of the final decision. The 
Secretary also may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means, 
if practical.

Sec. 668.15  Factors of financial responsibility.

    (a) General. To begin and to continue to participate in any Title 
IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that 
the institution is financially responsible under the requirements 
established in this section.

with the requirements of this subpart;
    (3) Is meeting all of its financial obligations, including but not 
limited to--
    (i) Refunds that it is required to make; and
    (ii) Repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred 
in programs administered by the Secretary;
    (4) Is current in its debt payments. The institution is not

at its fiscal year end, as disclosed in a note to its audited financial 
statement; or
    (ii) the institution fails to make a payment in accordance with 
existing debt obligations for more than 120 days, and at least one 
creditor has filed suit to recover those funds;
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in

year of the two-year period. The Secretary may calculate an operating 
loss for an institution by excluding from net income: extraordinary 
gains or losses; income or losses from discontinued operations; prior

principle. For purposes of this section, the calculation of tangible net 
worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles; and
    (C) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible net worth. 
In applying this standard, a positive tangible net worth occurs when the 
institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities. The calculation of 
tangible net worth shall exclude all assets classified as intangible in 
accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles; or
    (ii) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has 
currently issued and outstanding debt obligations that are (without 
insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the 
second highest rating level of credit quality given by a nationally

    (i)(A) Prepares a classified statement of financial position in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or provides the 
required information in notes to the audited financial statements;

ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this section, the acid test ratio 
shall be calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current 
accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities. 
The calculation of the acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or 
uncollateralized related party receivables.
    (C)(1) Has, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a positive 
unrestricted current fund balance or positive unrestricted net assets. 
In calculating the unrestricted current fund balance or the unrestricted 
net assets for an institution, the Secretary may include funds that are 
temporarily restricted in use by the institution's governing body that 
can be transferred to the current unrestricted fund or added to net 
unrestricted assets at the discretion of the governing body; or
    (2) Has not had, an excess of current fund expenditures over current 
fund revenues over both of its 2 latest fiscal years that results in a 
decrease exceeding 10 percent in either the unrestricted current fund 
balance or the unrestricted net assets at the beginning of the first 
year of the 2-year period. The Secretary may exclude from net changes in 
fund balances for the operating loss calculation: Extraordinary gains or 
losses; income or losses from discontinued operations; prior period 
adjustment; and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
principle. In calculating the institution's unrestricted current fund 
balance or the unrestricted net assets, the Secretary may include funds 
that are temporarily restricted in use by the institution's governing 
body that can be transferred to the current unrestricted fund or added 
to net unrestricted assets at the discretion of the governing body; or
    (ii) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has 
currently issued and outstanding debt obligations which are (without 
insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the

guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the second highest 
rating level of credit quality given by a nationally recognized 
statistical rating organization.
    (c) Past performance of an institution or persons affiliated with an

    (2) The institution has--
    (i) Been limited, suspended, terminated, or entered into a 
settlement agreement to resolve a limitation, suspension, or termination 
action initiated by the Secretary or a guaranty agency (as defined in 34 
CFR part 682) within the preceding five years;
    (ii) Had--
    (A) An audit finding, during its two most recent audits of its

HEA programs for any award year covered by the program review;
    (iii) Been cited during the preceding five years for failure to 
submit acceptable audit reports required under this part or individual 
Title IV, HEA program regulations in a timely fashion; or

of this section, if the institution--

[[Page 396]]

    (i) Submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is

recent audited financial statement indicates that--
    (1) All taxes owed by the institution are current;
    (2) The institution's net income, or a change in total net assets, 
before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, has not 
decreased by more than 10 percent from the prior fiscal year, unless the 
institution demonstrates that the decreased net income shown on the 
current financial statement is a result of downsizing pursuant to a 
management-approved business plan;
    (3) Loans and other advances to related parties have not increased 
from the prior fiscal year unless such increases were secured and 
collateralized, and do not exceed 10 percent of the prior fiscal year's 
working capital of the institution;
    (4) The equity of a for-profit institution, or the total net assets 
of a non-profit institution, have not decreased by more than 10 percent 
of the prior year's total equity;
    (5) Compensation for owners or other related parties (including 
bonuses, fringe benefits, employee stock option allowances, 401k 
contributions, deferred compensation allowances) has not increased from 
the prior year at a rate higher than for all other employees;
    (6) The institution has not materially leveraged its assets or 
income by becoming a guarantor on any new loan or obligation on behalf

baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that--
    (i) There is no reasonable doubt as to its continued solvency and 
ability to deliver quality educational services;
    (ii) It is current in its payment of all current liabilities, 
including student refunds, repayments to the Secretary, payroll, and 
payment of trade creditors and withholding taxes; and
    (iii) It has substantial equity in institution-occupied facilities, 
the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its failure to meet the 
acid test ratio requirement.

[[Page 397]]

    (4) The Secretary may determine an institution to be financially 
responsible even if the institution is not otherwise financially 
responsible under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if--
    (i) The institution notifies the Secretary, in accordance with 34 
CFR 600.30, that the person referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section exercises substantial control over the institution; and
    (ii)(A) The person repaid to the Secretary a portion of the 
applicable liability, and the portion repaid equals or exceeds the 
greater of--
    (1) The total percentage of the ownership interest held in the

person or any member or members of that person's family, either alone or 
in combination with one another;
    (2) The total percentage of the ownership interest held in the 
institution or servicer that owes the liability that the person or any

with one another, represents or represented under a voting trust, power 
of attorney, proxy, or similar agreement; or
    (3) Twenty-five percent, if the person or any member of the person's

officer, or other executive officer of the institution or servicer that 
owes the liability, or of an entity holding at least a 25 percent 
ownership interest in the institution that owes the liability;
    (B) The applicable liability described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section is currently being repaid in accordance with a written agreement 
with the Secretary; or
    (C) The institution demonstrates why--
    (1) The person who exercises substantial control over the 
institution should nevertheless be considered to lack that control; or
    (2) The person who exercises substantial control over the 
institution and each member of that person's family nevertheless does 
not or did not exercise substantial control over the institution or 
servicer that owes the liability.
    (e) [Reserved]

    (g) Two-year performance requirement. (1) The Secretary considers an 
institution to have satisfied the requirements in paragraph (d)(1)(C) of 
this section if the independent certified public accountant, or

<R05>
Sec. 668.16  Standards of administrative capability.

    To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA 
program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary that the 
institution is capable of adequately administering that program under 
each of the standards established in this section. The Secretary 
considers an institution to have that administrative capability if the 
institution--
    (a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance with all 
statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, all 
applicable regulatory provisions prescribed under that

[[Page 399]]

statutory authority, and all applicable special arrangements, 
agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of statutes 
applicable to Title IV of the HEA;
    (b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible for 
administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it participates 
and for coordinating those programs with the institution's other Federal 
and non-Federal programs of student financial assistance. The Secretary 
considers an individual to be ``capable'' under this paragraph if the 
individual is certified by the State in which the institution is 
located, if the State requires certification of financial aid 
administrators. The Secretary may consider other factors in determining 
whether an individual is capable, including, but not limited to, the 
individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program training 
provided or approved by the Secretary, and previous experience and 
documented success in administering the Title IV, HEA programs properly;
    (2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to administer the 
Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution participates. The 
Secretary considers the following factors to determine whether an 
institution uses an adequate number of qualified persons--
    (i) The number and types of programs in which the institution 
participates;
    (ii) The number of applications evaluated;
    (iii) The number of students who receive any student financial 
assistance at the institution and the amount of funds administered;
    (iv) The financial aid delivery system used by the institution;
    (v) The degree of office automation used by the institution in the 
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs;
    (vi) The number and distribution of financial aid staff; and
    (vii) The use of third-party servicers to aid in the administration 
of the Title IV, HEA programs;
    (3) Communicates to the individual designated to be responsible for 
administering Title IV, HEA programs, all the information received by 
any institutional office that bears on a student's eligibility for Title 
IV, HEA program assistance; and
    (4) Has written procedures for or written information indicating the 
responsibilities of the various offices with respect to the approval, 
disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, HEA program assistance and the 
preparation and submission of reports to the Secretary;
    (c)(1) Administers Title IV, HEA programs with adequate checks and 
balances in its system of internal controls; and
    (2) Divides the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or 
delivering funds so that no office has responsibility for both functions 
with respect to any particular student aided under the programs. For 
example, the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing or 
delivering funds must be divided so that for any particular student 
aided under the programs, the two functions are carried out by at least 
two organizationally independent individuals who are not members of the 
same family, as defined in Sec. 668.15, or who do not together exercise 
substantial control, as defined in Sec. 668.15, over the institution;
    (d) Establishes and maintains records required under this part and 
the individual Title IV, HEA program regulations;
    (e) For purposes of determining student eligibility for assistance 
under a Title IV, HEA program, establishes, publishes, and applies 
reasonable standards for measuring whether an otherwise eligible student 
is maintaining satisfactory progress in his or her educational program. 
The Secretary considers an institution's standards to be reasonable if 
the standards--
    (1) Are the same as or stricter than the institution's standards for 
a student enrolled in the same educational program who is not receiving 
assistance under a Title IV, HEA program;
    (2) Include the following elements:
    (i) A qualitative component which consists of grades (provided that 
the standards meet or exceed the requirements of Sec. 668.7(c)), work 
projects completed, or comparable factors that are measurable against a 
norm.
    (ii) A quantitative component that consists of a maximum timeframe 
in which a student must complete his or

[[Page 400]]

her educational program. The timeframe must--
    (A) For an undergraduate program, be no longer than 150 percent of 
the published length of the educational program measured in academic 
years, terms, credit hours attempted, clock hours completed, etc. as 
appropriate;
    (B) Be divided into increments, not to exceed the lesser of one 
academic year or one-half the published length of the educational 
program;
    (C) Include a schedule established by the institution designating 
the minimum percentage or amount of work that a student must 
successfully complete at the end of each increment to complete his or 
her educational program within the maximum timeframe; and
    (D) Include specific policies defining the effect of course 
incompletes, withdrawals, repetitions, and noncredit remedial courses on 
satisfactory progress;
    (3) Provide for consistent application of standards to all students 
within categories of students, e.g., full-time, part-time, 
undergraduate, and graduate students, and educational programs 
established by the institution;
    (4) Provide for a determination at the end of each increment by the 
institution as to whether the student has met the qualitative and 
quantitative components of the standards (as provided for in paragraphs 
(e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section);
    (5) Provide specific procedures under which a student may appeal a 
determination that the student is not making satisfactory progress; and
    (6) Provide specific procedures for a student to re-establish that 
he or she is maintaining satisfactory progress.
    (f) Develops and applies an adequate system to identify and resolve 
discrepancies in the information that the institution receives from 
different sources with respect to a student's application for financial 
aid under Title IV, HEA programs. In determining whether the 
institution's system is adequate, the Secretary considers whether the 
institution obtains and reviews--
    (1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents, 
Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration Status, 
and eligibility notification documents presented by or on behalf of each 
applicant;
    (2) Any documents, including any copies of State and Federal income 
tax returns, that are normally collected by the institution to verify 
information received from the student or other sources; and
    (3) Any other information normally available to the institution 
regarding a student's citizenship, previous educational experience, 
documentation of the student's social security number, or other factors 
relating to the student's eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA 
programs;
    (g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the Department of 
Education for investigation--
    (1) After conducting the review of an application provided for under 
paragraph (f) of this section, any credible information indicating that 
an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance may have engaged in 
fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her 
application. The type of information that an institution must refer is 
that which is relevant to the eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, 
HEA program assistance, or the amount of the assistance. Examples of 
this type of information are--
    (i) False claims of independent student status;
    (ii) False claims of citizenship;
    (iii) Use of false identities;
    (iv) Forgery of signatures or certifications; and
    (v) False statements of income; and
    (2) Any credible information indicating that any employee, third-
party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a 
capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs, 
or the receipt of funds under those programs, may have engaged in fraud, 
misrepresentation, conversion or breach of fiduciary responsibility, or 
other illegal conduct involving the Title IV, HEA programs. The type of 
information that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to 
the eligibility and funding of the institution and its students through 
the Title IV, HEA programs;
    (h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling to eligible students 
who

[[Page 401]]

apply for Title IV, HEA program assistance. In determining whether an 
institution provides adequate counseling, the Secretary considers 
whether its counseling includes information regarding--
    (1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered;
    (2) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, delivered, 
or applied to a student's account; and
    (3) The rights and responsibilities of the student with respect to 
enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial aid. This 
information includes the institution's refund policy, its standards of 
satisfactory progress, and other conditions that may alter the student's 
aid package;
    (i) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and financial 
statements required for compliance with the provisions of this part and 
the individual program regulations in a timely manner;
    (j) Shows no evidence of significant problems that affect, as 
determined by the Secretary, the institution's ability to administer a 
Title IV, HEA program and that are identified in--
    (1) Reviews of the institution conducted by the Secretary, the 
Department of Education's Office of Inspector General, nationally 
recognized accrediting agencies, guaranty agencies as defined in 34 CFR 
part 682, State postsecondary review entities designated under 34 CFR 
part 667, the State agency or official by whose authority the 
institution is legally authorized to provide postsecondary education, or 
any other law enforcement agency; or
    (2) Any findings made in any criminal, civil, or administrative 
proceeding;
    (k) Is not, and does not have any principal or affiliate of the 
institution (as those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85) that is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended under Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 (3 CFR, 
1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (2) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 34 CFR 85.305 or

p. 189) or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4;
    (l) For an institution that seeks initial participation in a Title 
IV, HEA program, does not have more than 33 percent of its undergraduate 
regular students withdraw from the institution during the institution's 
latest completed award year. The institution must count all regular 
students who are enrolled during the latest completed award year, except 
those students who, during that period--
    (1) Withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from the 
institution; and
    (2) Were entitled to and actually received in a timely manner, a 
refund of 100 percent of their tuition and fees (less any permitted 
administrative fee) under the institution's refund policy;
    (m)(1) Has a cohort default rate--
    (i) As defined in Sec. 668.17, on loans made under the Federal 
Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs to students for attendance at 
that institution of less than 25 percent for each of the three most 
recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined the 
institution's rate; and
    (ii) As defined in 34 CFR 674.5, on loans made under the Federal 
Perkins Loan Program to students for attendance at that institution that 
does not exceed 15 percent;
    (2)(i) Except that, if the Secretary determines that the institution 
is not administratively capable solely because the institution fails to 
comply with paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the Secretary will 
provisionally certify the institution in accordance with Sec. 668.13(c); 
and
    (ii) The institution may appeal the loss of full participation in a 
Title IV, HEA program under paragraph (m)(1) of this section by 
submitting an appeal in writing to the Secretary in accordance with and 
on the grounds specified in Sec. 668.17;
    (n) Does not otherwise appear to lack the ability to administer the 
Title IV, HEA programs competently; and
    (o) Participates in the electronic processes that the Secretary--
    (1) Provides at no substantial charge to the institution; and

Sec. 668.17  Default reduction measures.

    (a) Default rates. (1) If the FFEL Program cohort default rate, 
Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or if applicable, weighted average 
cohort rate for an institution exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year, 
the Secretary notifies the institution of that rate.
    (2) The Secretary may initiate a proceeding under subpart G of this 
part to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of an institution 
in the Title IV, HEA programs, if the institution has an FFEL Program 
cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or a weighted 
average cohort rate that exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year.
    (3) Unless an institution is subject to loss of eligibility to 
participate in the FFEL Program under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the Secretary initiates a proceeding under subpart G of this part to 
limit, suspend, or terminate an institution's participation in the FFEL 
Program if the institution, for each of the three most recent 
consecutive fiscal years, has any combination of an FFEL Program cohort 
default rate, a Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted average 
cohort rate that is equal to or greater than 25 percent.
    (4) The Secretary may require an institution that meets the criteria 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to submit to the Secretary, 
within a timeframe determined by the Secretary, any reasonable 
information to help the Secretary make a preliminary determination as to 
what action should be taken against the institution.
    (5) The Secretary ceases any limitation, suspension, or termination 
action against an institution under this paragraph if the institution 
satisfactorily demonstrates to the Secretary that, pursuant to an appeal 
that is complete and timely submitted under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the institution meets one of the exceptional mitigating 
circumstances under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (b) End of participation. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) 
of this section, an institution's participation in the FFEL Program ends 
30 calendar days after the date the institution receives notification 
from the Secretary that its FFEL Program cohort default rate for each of 
the three most recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has 
determined the institution's rate, is equal to or greater than 25 
percent.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, an 
institution's participation in the Direct Loan Program ends 30 calendar 
days after the date the institution receives notification from the 
Secretary that for each of the three most recent fiscal years the 
institution has any combination of an FFEL Program cohort default rate, 
Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted average cohort rate that is 
equal to or greater than 25 percent.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, an 
institution's participation in the FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program 
ends under paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section respectively may not 
participate in that program on or after the 30th calendar day after the 
date it receives notification from the Secretary that its FFEL Program 
cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or, if applicable, 
weighted average cohort rate exceeds the thresholds specified in 
paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section and continuing--
    (i) For the remainder of the fiscal year in which the Secretary 
determines that the institution's participation has ended under 
paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section; and
    (ii) For the two subsequent fiscal years.
    (4) An institution whose participation in the FFEL Program or Direct 
Loan Program ends under paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section may not 
participate in that program until the institution satisfies the 
Secretary that the institution meets all requirements

[[Page 403]]

for participation in the FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program and 
executes a new agreement with the Secretary for participation in that 
program following the period described in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (5) Until July 1, 1998, the provisions of paragraph (b) (1) or (2) 
of this section and the provisions of 34 CFR 668.16(m) do not apply to a 
historically black college or university within the meaning of section 
322(2) of the HEA, a tribally controlled community college within the 
meaning of section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College 
Assistance Act of 1978, or a Navajo community college under the Navajo 
Community College Act.
    (6) An institution may, notwithstanding 34 CFR 668.26, continue to 
participate in the FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program until the 
Secretary issues a decision on the institution's appeal if the Secretary 
receives an appeal that is complete, accurate, and timely in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Appeal procedures. (1) An institution may appeal the loss of 
participation in the FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program under paragraph 
(b)(1) or (2) of this section by submitting an appeal in writing to the 
Secretary by the 30th calendar day following the date the institution 
receives notification of the end of participation. An appeal or any 
portion of an appeal under this section will not be accepted after the 
30th calendar day following the date the institution receives 
notification from the Secretary that it has lost its eligibility to 
participate in the FFEL or Direct Loan programs, except that an 
institution may submit an appeal under section (c)(1)(i) of this section 
later than the 30th calendar day if the appeal is submitted in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(8) and the information required by 
paragraph (c)(7) may be submitted in accordance with that paragraph. The 
appeal must include all information required by the Secretary to 
substantiate the appeal and all information must be submitted in a 
format prescribed by the Secretary. The additional 30-day period 
specified in paragraph (c)(7) of this section is an extension for the 
submission of the auditor's statement only and does not affect the date 
by which the appeal data must be submitted. An institution that is 
eligible for an extension under paragraph (c)(8) of this section must 
submit all required data within five working days following the agency's 
response to the institution's request for verification of data. The 
institution may appeal on the grounds that--
    (i)(A) The calculation of the institution's FFEL Program cohort 
default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or, if applicable, 
weighted average cohort rate, for any of the three fiscal years relevant 
to the end of participation is not accurate; and
    (B) A recalculation of the institution's FFEL Program cohort default 
rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted average cohort rate, 
with corrected data verified by the cognizant guaranty agency or 
agencies for the FFEL Program loans, or the Secretary for Direct Loan 
Program loans would produce an FFEL Program cohort default rate, a 
Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted average cohort rate for any 
of those fiscal years that is below the threshold percentage specified 
in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section; or
    (ii) The institution meets one of the following exceptional 
mitigating circumstances:
    (A) The institution has a participation rate index of 0.0375 or 
less. The participation rate index is determined by multiplying the 
institution's FFEL Program cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program 
cohort rate or weighted average cohort rate, by the percentage of the 
institution's regular students, as defined in 34 CFR 600.2, enrolled on 
at least a half-time basis who received a loan made under either the 
FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program for a 12-month period that has ended 
during the six months immediately preceding the fiscal year for which 
the cohort of borrowers used to calculate the institution's rate is 
determined. An institution that has an FFEL Program cohort default rate, 
Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted average cohort rate that 
exceeds 40 percent may not appeal its loss of eligibility under 
paragraphs (b) (1) or (2) of this section on the basis of its 
participation rate index.

[[Page 404]]

    (B) For a 12-month period that has ended during the six months 
immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the cohort of borrowers 
used to calculate the institution's rate is determined, 70 percent or 
more of the institution's regular students, as defined in 34 CFR 600.2, 
are individuals from disadvantaged economic backgrounds, as established 
by documentary evidence submitted by the institution. Such evidence must 
relate to either qualification by those students for an expected family 
contribution (EFC) of zero for any award year that generally coincides 
with the 12-month period, or attribution to those students of an 
adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or spouse, 
if applicable, reported for any award year that generally coincides with 
the 12-month period, of less than the poverty level, as determined under 
criteria established by the Department of Health and Human Services; 
and,
    (1) For a degree-granting institution, 70 percent or more of the 
institution's regular students who were initially enrolled on a full-
time basis and were scheduled to complete their programs during the same 
12-month period the institution has chosen to determine the percentage 
of its students that come from disadvantaged economic backgrounds under 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, completed the educational 
programs in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by 
comparing the number of regular students who were classified as full-
time at their initial enrollment in the institution and were originally 
scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete their programs within 
the relevant 12-month period, with the number of these students who 
received a degree from the institution; transferred from the institution 
to a higher level educational program; or, at the end of the 12-month 
period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory academic progress 
toward completion of their educational programs; or
    (2) For a non-degree-granting institution, the institution had a 
placement rate of 50 percent or more with respect to its former regular 
students who remained in the program beyond the point the students would 
have received a 100 percent tuition refund from the institution. A 
student or former student may not be considered successfully placed if 
the institution is the student's or former student's employer. This rate 
is based on those regular students who were initially enrolled on at 
least a half-time basis and were originally scheduled, at the time of 
enrollment, to complete their educational programs during the same 12-
month period the institution has chosen to determine the percentage of 
its students that come from disadvantaged economic backgrounds under 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. This rate does not include 
those students who are still enrolled and making satisfactory progress 
in the educational programs in which they were originally enrolled on 
the date following 12 months after the date of the student's last day of 
attendance. This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all 
those former regular students who;
    (i) Are employed in an occupation for which the institution provided 
training on the date following 12 months after the date of their last 
day of attendance at the institution; or
    (ii) Were employed in an occupation for which the institution 
provided training for at least 13 weeks before the date following 12 
months after the date of their last day of attendance at the 
institution.
    (2) For purposes of the completion rate and placement rate described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) (1) and (2) of this section, a student is 
originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete the 
educational program on the date when the student will have been enrolled 
in the program for the amount of time normally required to complete the 
program. The ``amount of time normally required to complete the 
program'' for a student who is initially enrolled full-time is the 
period of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, 
catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a full-
time student, or the period of time between the original date of 
enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the 
student's loan application, if any, whichever is

[[Page 405]]

less. The ``amount of time normally required to complete the program'' 
for a student who is initially enrolled less than full-time is the 
amount of time it would take that student to complete the program if the 
student remained enrolled at that level of enrollment.
    (3) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's appeal 
within 45 calendar days after the institution submits a complete appeal 
that addresses the applicable criteria in paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) 
of this section to the Secretary.
    (4) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration of 
written material submitted by the institution. No oral hearing is 
provided.
    (5) The Secretary withdraws the notification of loss of 
participation in the FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program sent to an 
institution under paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, if he 
determines that the institution's appeal satisfies one of the 
exceptional mitigating circumstances specified in paragraph (c)(1) (i) 
or (ii) of this section.
    (6) An institution must include in its appeal a certification, under 
penalty of perjury, by the institution's chief executive officer that 
all information provided by the institution in support of its appeal is 
true and correct.
    (7) An institution that appeals on the grounds that it meets the 
exceptional mitigating circumstances criteria contained in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section must include in its appeal an opinion from an 
independent auditor on management's assertions that the information 
contained in the appeal is complete, accurate, and determined in 
accordance with the requirements of this section. The examination level 
engagement will be performed in accordance with Statement on Standards 
for Attestation Engagements #3. This opinion must be received by the 
Secretary within 60 days following the date the institution receives 
notification of its loss of eligibility under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (8) An institution that appeals under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section will not lose its eligibility to continue to participate during 
the appeal process due to a guaranty agency's failure to comply with 34 
CFR 682.401(b)(14) which requires the agency to respond to an 
institution's request for verification of data within 15 working days, 
provided the institution:
    (i) Requested such verification within 10 working days from the date 
it received notification of its loss of eligibility under paragraph (b) 
of this section; and
    (ii) Provided a copy of the request for verification of data to the 
Secretary at the same time it requested such verification by the 
relevant guaranty agency(ies).
    (d) FFEL Program Cohort Default Rate. (1)(i) For purposes of the 
FFEL Program, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this 
section, the term FFEL Program cohort default rate means--
    (A) For any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former 
students at the institution enter repayment on Federal Stafford loans or 
Federal SLS loans (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal 
Consolidation Loan Program or Direct Consolidation Loan Program that is 
used to repay such loans) received for attendance at the institution, 
the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment 
in that fiscal year on those loans who default before the end of the 
following fiscal year; or
    (B) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's 
current and former students enter repayment on Federal Stafford loans or 
Federal SLS loans (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal 
Consolidation Loan Program or Direct Consolidation Loan Program that is 
used to repay such loans) received for attendance at the institution, 
the percentage of those current and former students who entered 
repayment on such loans in any of the three most recent fiscal years, 
who default before the end of the fiscal year immediately following the 
fiscal year in which they entered repayment.
    (C) In determining the number of students who default before the end 
of that following fiscal year, the Secretary includes only loans for 
which the Secretary or a guaranty agency has paid claims for insurance, 
and Direct Consolidation Loan Program loans that repaid FFEL Program 
loans that entered default.

[[Page 406]]

    (ii)(A) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at 
more than one institution, the student (and his or her subsequent 
repayment or default) is attributed to each institution for attendance 
at which the student received a loan that entered repayment in the 
fiscal year.
    (B) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution, its owner, 
agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or 
individual, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as 
in default for purposes of this definition.
    (C) Any loan that has been rehabilitated under section 428F of the 
HEA before the end of that following fiscal year is not considered as in 
default for purposes of this definition.
    (D) For the purposes of this definition, an SLS loan made in 
accordance with section 428A of the HEA (or a loan made under the 
Federal Consolidation Loan Program or Direct Consolidation Loan Program, 
a portion of which is used to repay a Federal SLS loan) shall not be 
considered to enter repayment until after the borrower has ceased to be 
enrolled in an educational program leading to a degree, certificate, or 
other recognized educational credential at the participating institution 
on at least a half-time basis (as determined by the institution) and 
ceased to be in a period of forbearance or deferment based on such 
enrollment. Each eligible lender of a loan made under section 428A (or a 
loan made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program, a portion of 
which is used to repay a Federal SLS loan) of the HEA shall provide the 
guaranty agency with the information necessary to determine when the 
loan entered repayment for purposes of this definition, and the guaranty 
agency shall provide that information to the Secretary.
    (2) Fiscal year means the period from and including October 1 of a 
calendar year through and including September 30 of the following 
calendar year.
    (e) Direct Loan Program cohort rate. (1) For purposes of the Direct 
Loan Program, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, 
the Secretary calculates Direct Loan Program cohort rates using the 
following formulas:
    (i) For public institutions, private nonprofit institutions, or 
proprietary degree-granting institutions--
    (A) For any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former 
students at the institution enter repayment on a Direct Loan Program 
loan (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal Direct 
Consolidation Loan Program that is used to repay those loans) received 
for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and 
former students who enter repayment in that fiscal year on those loans 
who are in default before the end of the following fiscal year; or
    (B) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's 
current and former students enter repayment on a Direct Loan Program 
loan (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal Direct 
Consolidation Loan Program that is used to repay those loans) received 
for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and 
former students who entered repayment on those loans in any of the three 
most recent fiscal years, who are in default before the end of the 
fiscal year immediately following the year in which they entered 
repayment.
    (ii) For proprietary non-degree-granting institutions--
    (A) For any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former 
students at the institution enter repayment on a Direct Loan Program 
loan (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal Direct 
Consolidation Loan Program that is used to repay those loans) received 
for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and 
former students who enter repayment in that fiscal year on those loans 
who are in default before the end of the following fiscal year, or who, 
before the end of that following fiscal year, have, for 270 days, been 
in repayment under the income-contingent repayment plan with scheduled 
payments that are less than 15 dollars per month and those payments 
result in negative amortization; or
    (B) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's 
current and former students enter repayment on a Direct Loan Program 
loan (or on the

[[Page 407]]

portion of a loan made under the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan 
Program that is used to repay those loans) received for attendance at 
the institution, the percentage of those current and former students who 
entered repayment on those loans in the three most recent fiscal years, 
who are in default before the end of the fiscal year immediately 
following the year in which they entered repayment, or who, before the 
end of that following fiscal year, have for 270 days, been in repayment 
under the income-contingent repayment plan with scheduled payments that 
are less than 15 dollars per month and those payments result in negative 
amortization.
    (2)(i) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at 
more than one institution, the student (and his or her subsequent 
repayment or default) is attributed to each institution for attendance 
at which the student received a loan that entered repayment in the 
fiscal year.
    (ii) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution, its 
owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or 
individual, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as 
in default for purposes of this definition.
    (iii) Any loan on which the borrower has made 12 consecutive monthly 
on-time payments under 34 CFR 685.211(e) before the end of that 
following fiscal year is not considered as in default for purposes of 
this definition.
    (3) For purposes of an institution's Direct Loan cohort rate, a 
Direct Loan Program loan is considered in default when the borrower's or 
endorser's failure to make an installment payment when due has persisted 
for 270 days.
    (f)(1) Weighted average cohort rate. For purposes of an institution 
that has former students entering repayment in a fiscal year on both 
Direct Loan Program and FFEL Program loans, except as provided under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Secretary calculates a weighted 
average cohort rate using the following formulas:
    (i) For public institutions, private nonprofit institutions, or 
proprietary degree-granting institutions--
    (A) For any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former 
students at the institution enter repayment on an FFEL Program or Direct 
Loan Program loan (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal 
Consolidation Loan Program or Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program 
that is used to repay those loans) received for attendance at the 
institution, the percentage of those current and former students who 
enter repayment in that fiscal year on those loans who are in default 
before the end of the following fiscal year; and
    (B) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's 
current and former students enter repayment on an FFEL Program or Direct 
Loan Program loan (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal 
Consolidation Loan Program or Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program 
that is used to repay such loans) received for attendance at the 
institution, the percentage of those current and former students who 
entered repayment on such loans in the three most recent fiscal years, 
who are in default before the end of the fiscal year immediately 
following the year in which they entered repayment.
    (ii) For proprietary non-degree-granting institutions--
    (A) For any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former 
students at the institution enter repayment on an FFEL Program or Direct 
Loan Program loan (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal 
Consolidation Loan or Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program that is 
used to repay those loans) received for attendance at the institution, 
the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment 
in that fiscal year on such loans who are in default before the end of 
the following fiscal year, or who, before the end of that following 
fiscal year, have for 270 days: been in repayment under the income-
contingent repayment plan with scheduled payments that are less than 15 
dollars per month and those payments result in negative amortization; or
    (B) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's 
current and former students enter repayment on an FFEL Program or Direct 
Loan Program loan (or on the portion of a loan made under the Federal 
Consolidation

[[Page 408]]

Loan Program or Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program that is used 
to repay those loans) received for attendance at the institution, the 
percentage of those current and former students who entered repayment on 
those loans in any of the three most recent fiscal years, who are in 
default before the end of the fiscal year immediately following the year 
in which they entered repayment, or who, before the end of that 
following fiscal year, have for 270 days: been in repayment under the 
income-contingent repayment plan with scheduled payments that are less 
than 15 dollars per month and those payments result in negative 
amortization.
    (2)(i) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at 
more than one institution, the student (and his or her subsequent 
repayment or default) is attributed to each institution for attendance 
at which the student received a loan that entered repayment in the 
fiscal year.
    (ii) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution, its 
owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or 
individual, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as 
in default for purposes of this definition.
    (iii) Any Direct Loan Program loan on which the borrower has made 12 
consecutive monthly on-time payments under 34 CFR 685.211(e) or has an 
FFEL Program loan that has been rehabilitated under section 428F of the 
HEA before the end of that following fiscal year is not considered as in 
default for purposes of this definition.
    (3) For purposes of an institution's weighted average cohort rate, a 
Direct Loan Program loan is considered in default when a borrower's or 
endorser's failure to make an installment payment when due has persisted 
for 270 days.
    (g) Applicability of Rates to Institutions. (1)(i) An FFEL Program 
cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted 
average cohort rate of an institution applies to all locations of the 
institution as the institution exists on the first day of the fiscal 
year for which the rate is calculated.
    (ii) An FFEL Program cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort 
rate, or weighted average cohort rate of an institution applies to all 
locations of the institution from the date the institution is notified 
of that rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the 
rate no longer applies.
    (2)(i) For an institution that changes its status from that of a 
location of one institution to that of a free-standing institution, the 
Secretary determines the FFEL Program cohort default rate, Direct Loan 
Program cohort rate, or weighted average cohort rate, based on the 
institution's status as of October 1 of the fiscal year for which the 
rate is being calculated.
    (ii) For an institution that changes its status from that of a free-
standing institution to that of a location of another institution, the 
Secretary determines the FFEL Program cohort default rate, Direct Loan 
Program cohort rate, or weighted average cohort rate, based on the 
combined number of students who enter repayment during the applicable 
fiscal year and the combined number of students who default during the 
applicable fiscal years from both the former free-standing institution 
and the other institution. This rate applies to the new, consolidated 
institution and all of its current locations.
    (iii) For free-standing institutions that merge to form a new, 
consolidated institution, the Secretary determines the FFEL Program 
cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted 
average cohort rate based on the combined number of students who enter 
repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the combined number of 
students who default during the applicable fiscal years from all of the 
institutions that are merging. This rate applies to the new consolidated 
institution.
    (iv) For a location of one institution that becomes a location of 
another institution, the Secretary determines the FFEL Program cohort 
default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted average 
cohort rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment 
during the applicable fiscal year and the number of students who default 
during the applicable fiscal years from both of the institutions in

their entirety, not limited solely to the respective locations.
    (h) Appeal based on allegations of improper loan servicing or 
collection--(1) General. An institution that is subject to loss of 
participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section or has been notified by the Secretary that its cohort default 
rate equals or exceeds 20 percent for the most recent year for which 
data are available may include in its appeal of that loss or rate a 
challenge based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. 
This challenge may be raised in addition to other challenges permitted 
under this section.
    (2) Standard of review. An appeal based on allegations of improper 
loan servicing or collection must be submitted to the Secretary in 
accordance with the requirements of this paragraph. The Secretary 
excludes any loans from the cohort default rate calculation which, due 
to improper servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the 
evidence submitted in support of the institution's timely appeal to the 
Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the 
cohort default rate.
    (3) Procedures. (i) The following procedures apply to appeals from 
cohort default rates issued by the Secretary during Federal fiscal year 
1994 and subsequent years. Upon receiving notice from the Secretary that 
the institution's cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section or that its most recent cohort 
default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent, the institution may appeal 
the calculation of the cohort default rate based on allegations of 
improper loan servicing or collection. The Secretary's notice includes a 
list of all borrowers included in the calculation of the institution's 
cohort default rate.
    (ii) To initiate an appeal under this paragraph, the institution 
must notify, in writing, the Secretary and each guaranty agency that 
guaranteed loans included in the institution's cohort default rate that 
it is appealing the calculation of the cohort default rate. The 
notification must be received by the guaranty agency and the Secretary 
within 10 working days of the date the institution received the 
Secretary's notification. The institution's notification to the guaranty 
agency must include a copy of the list of students provided by the 
Secretary to the institution.
    (iii) Within 15 working days of receiving the notification from an 
institution subject to loss of participation in the FFEL programs under 
paragraph (a)(1), or within 30 calendar days of receiving such 
notification from any other institution that may file a challenge to its 
default rate under this paragraph, the guaranty agency must provide the 
institution with a representative sample of the loan servicing and 
collection records relating to borrowers whose loans were guaranteed by 
the guaranty agency and that were included as defaulted loans in the 
calculation of the institution's cohort default rate. For purposes of 
this section, the term ``loan servicing and collection records'' refers 
only to the records submitted by the lender to the guaranty agency to 
support the lender's submission of a default claim and included in the 
claim file. In selecting the representative sample of records, the 
guaranty agency must use the following procedures:
    (A) The guaranty agency shall list in social security number order 
all loans made to borrowers for attendance at the institution and 
guaranteed by the guaranty agency and included as defaulted loans in the 
calculation of the cohort default rate which is being challenged by the 
institution.
    (B) From the population of loans identified by the guaranty agency, 
the guaranty agency shall identify a sample of the loans. The sample 
must be of a size such that the universe estimate derived from the 
sample is acceptable at a 95 percent confidence level with a plus or 
minus 5 percent confidence interval. The sampling procedure must result 
in a determination of the number of loans that should be excluded from 
the calculation of the cohort default rate under this paragraph.
    (C) Once the sample of loans has been established, the guaranty 
agency shall provide a copy of all servicing and collection records 
relating to each loan in the sample to the institution in hard copy 
format unless the guaranty agency and institution agree that all or

[[Page 410]]

some of the records can be provided in another format.
    (D) The guaranty agency may charge the institution a reasonable fee 
for copying and providing the documents, not to exceed $10 per borrower 
file.
    (E) After compiling the servicing and collection records for the 
loans in the sample, the guaranty agency shall send the records, a list 
of the loans included in the sample, and a description of how the sample 
was chosen to the institution. The guaranty agency shall also send a 
copy of the list of the loans included in the sample, listed in order by 
social security number, and the description of how the sample was chosen 
to the Secretary at the same time the material is sent to the 
institution.
    (F) If the guaranty agency charges the institution a fee for copying 
and providing the documents under paragraph (f)(iii)(D) of this section, 
the guaranty agency is not required to provide the documents to the 
institution until payment is received by the agency. If payment of a fee 
is required, the guaranty agency shall notify the institution, in 
writing, within 15 working days of receipt of the institution's request, 
of the amount of the fee. If the guaranty agency does not receive 
payment of the fee from the institution within 15 working days of the 
date the institution received notice of the fee, the institution shall 
be considered to have waived its right to challenge the calculation of 
its cohort default rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing 
or collection in regard to loans guaranteed by that guaranty agency. The 
guaranty agency shall notify the institution and the Secretary, in 
writing, that the institution has failed to pay the fee and has 
apparently waived its right to challenge the calculation of the cohort 
default rate. The Secretary will determine that an institution which 
does not pay the required fee to the guaranty agency has not met its 
burden of proof in regard to the loans insured by that guaranty agency 
unless the institution proves that the agency's conclusion that the 
institution waived its appeal was incorrect.
    (iv) After receiving the relevant loan servicing and collection 
records from all of the guaranty agencies that insured loans which are 
included in the cohort default rate calculation, the institution has 30 
calendar days to file its appeal with the Secretary. An appeal is 
considered filed when it is received by the Secretary. If the 
institution is also filing an appeal under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section, the institution may delay submitting its appeal under this 
paragraph until the appeal under paragraph (d)(1)(i) is submitted to the 
Secretary. As part of the appeal, the institution must submit the 
following information to the Secretary:
    (A) A list of the loans which the institution alleges would, due to 
improper loan servicing or collection, result in an inaccurate or 
incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.
    (B) Copies of all of the loan servicing or collection records and 
any other evidence relating to a loan that the institution believes has 
been subject to improper servicing or collection. The records must be in 
hard copy or microfiche format.
    (C) A copy of the lists provided by the guaranty agencies under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (D) An explanation of how the alleged improper servicing or 
collection resulted in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the 
cohort default rate.
    (E) A summary of the institution's appeal listing the number of 
loans insured by each guaranty agency that were included in the 
calculation of the institution's cohort default rate and the number of 
loans that would be excluded from the calculation of that rate by 
application of the results of the review of the sample of loans provided 
to the institution to the population of loans for each guaranty agency.
    (F) A certification by an authorized official of the institution 
that all information provided by the institution in the appeal is true 
and correct.
    (v) The Secretary or his designee reviews the information submitted 
by the institution and issues a decision.
    (A) In making a decision under this paragraph the Secretary presumes 
that the information provided by the guaranty agency is correct unless 
the institution provides substantial evidence showing that the 
information maintained by the guaranty agency is not correct.

[[Page 411]]

    (B) If the Secretary finds that the evidence presented by the 
institution shows that some of the loans included in the sample of loan 
records reviewed by the institution should be excluded from calculation 
of the cohort default rate under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the 
Secretary reduces the institution's cohort default rate, in accordance 
with a statistically valid methodology, to reflect the percentage of 
defaulted loans in the sample that should be excluded.
    (vi) The Secretary notifies the institution, in writing, of the 
decision.
    (vii) An institution may not seek judicial review of the Secretary's 
determination of the institution's cohort default rates until the 
Secretary or his designee issues the decision under paragraph (f)(3)(v) 
of this section.
    (viii) For purposes of this paragraph, a default is considered to 
have been due to improper servicing or collection only if the borrower 
did not make a payment on the loan and the institution proves that the 
lender failed to perform one or more of the following activities:
    (A) Send at least one letter (other than the final demand letter) 
urging the borrower or endorser to make payments on the loan if the 
lender was required to send such letters;
    (B) Attempt at least one phone call to the borrower or endorser, if 
such attempts were required;
    (C) Submit a request for preclaims assistance to the guaranty 
agency, if such a request was required;
    (D) Send a final demand letter to the borrower, if required; and
    (E) If required, the lender did not submit a certification (or other 
evidence) that skip tracing was performed.
    (i) Effect of decision. An institution may challenge the calculation 
of a cohort default rate under this section no more than once. The 
Secretary's determination of an institution's appeal of the calculation 
of a cohort default rate is binding on any future appeal by the 
institution. An institution that fails to challenge the calculation of a 
cohort default rate under this section within 10 working days of 
receiving notice of the determination of the cohort default rate is 
prohibited from challenging that rate in any other proceeding before the 
Department.
    (j) Review of default rate data. Effective on October 1, 1994, an 
institution has an opportunity to review and correct the information 
provided to the Secretary by the guaranty agencies for the purpose of 
calculating a cohort default rate on the loans to be included in the 
calculation of the institution's cohort default rate before the final 
rate is calculated.
    (1)(i) Once the Secretary has received the information used in 
calculating the cohort default rates from the guaranty agencies, the 
Secretary calculates draft cohort default rates for each institution.
    (ii) The Secretary sends all institutions with draft cohort default 
rates equal to or in excess of 20 percent, a copy of the information 
provided by the guaranty agencies in regard to loans included in the 
institution's cohort default rate.
    (iii) An institution with a draft cohort default rate less than 20 
percent will receive a notice of the draft default rate and may request 
a copy of the information provided by the guaranty agencies within 10 
working days of receiving the notice from the Secretary. Upon receiving 
the request from the institution, the Secretary will send the 
institution a copy of the information requested. The time frames 
provided in this paragraph will not start until the institution receives 
the information from the Secretary.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving the default rate 
information from the Secretary, the institution must notify the guaranty 
agency of any information included in the default rate data that it 
believes is incorrect. The institution must also provide the guaranty 
agency with evidence that it believes supports its contention that the 
default rate data are incorrect.
    (3) Within 30 days of receiving the institution's challenge under 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the guaranty agency shall respond to 
the institution's challenge. The guaranty agency's response must include 
a response to each allegation of error made by the institution and any 
evidence supporting the agency's position.

[[Page 412]]

    (4) The guaranty agency shall provide a copy of its response to the 
institution to the Secretary and identify any errors in the information 
previously submitted to the Secretary.
    (5) The information used to calculate cohort default rates will be 
changed to reflect allegations of error made by an institution, 
confirmed by the guaranty agency and accepted by the Secretary prior to 
releasing final cohort default rates.
    (6) The draft default rate issued by the Secretary under paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section may not be considered public information and may 
not be otherwise voluntarily released by the Secretary or the guaranty 
agency.
    (7) An institution may not appeal a cohort default rate under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section on the basis of any alleged errors in 
the default rate information unless errors were identified by the 
institution in a challenge to its preliminary default rate under 
paragraph (h) of this section.

Sec. 668.20  Limitations on remedial coursework that is eligible for Title IV, HEA program assistance.

    (a) A noncredit or reduced credit remedial course is a course of 
study designed to increase the ability of a student to pursue a course 
of study leading to a certificate or degree.
    (1) A noncredit remedial course is one for which no credit is given 
toward a certificate or degree; and
    (2) A reduced credit remedial course is one for which reduced credit 
is given toward a certificate or degree.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, in 
determining a student's enrollment status and cost of attendance, an 
institution shall include any noncredit or reduced credit remedial 
course in which the student is enrolled. The institution shall attribute 
the number of credit or clock hours to a noncredit or reduced credit 
remedial course by--
    (1) Calculating the number of classroom and homework hours required 
for that course;

[[Page 414]]

    (2) Comparing those hours with the hours required for nonremedial 
courses in a similar subject; and
    (3) Giving the remedial course the same number of credit or clock 
hours it gives the nonremedial course with the most comparable classroom 
and homework requirements.
    (c) In determining a student's enrollment status under the title IV, 
HEA programs or a student's cost of attendance under the campus-based, 
Stafford Loan, PLUS, and SLS programs, an institution may not take into 
account any noncredit or reduced credit remedial course if--
    (1) That course is part of a program of instruction leading to a 
high school diploma or the recognized equivalent of a high school 
diploma, even if the course is necessary to enable the student to 
complete a degree or certificate program;
    (2) The educational level of instruction provided in the noncredit 
or reduced credit remedial course is below the level needed to pursue 
successfully the degree or certificate program offered by that 
institution after one year in that remedial course; or
    (3) Except for a course in English as a second language, the 
educational level of instruction provided in that course is below the 
secondary level. For purposes of this section, the Secretary considers a 
course to be below the secondary level if any of the following entities 
determine that course to be below the secondary level:
    (i) The State agency that legally authorized the institution to 
provide postsecondary education.
    (ii) In the case of an accredited or preaccredited institution, the 
nationally recognized accrediting agency or association that accredits 
or preaccredits the institution.
    (iii) In the case of a public postsecondary vocational institution 
that is approved by a State agency recognized for the approval of public 
postsecondary vocational education, the State agency recognized for the 
approval of public postsecondary vocational education that approves the 
institution.
    (iv) The institution.
    (d) Except as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, an 
institution may not take into account more than one academic year's 
worth of noncredit or reduced credit remedial coursework in 
determining--
    (1) A student's enrollment status under the title IV, HEA programs; 
and
    (2) A student's cost of attendance under the campus-based, Stafford 
Loan, PLUS, and SLS programs.
    (e) One academic year's worth of noncredit or reduced credit 
remedial coursework is equivalent to--
    (1) Thirty semester or 45 quarter hours; or
    (2) Nine hundred clock hours.
    (f) Courses in English as a second language do not count against the 
one-year academic limitation contained in paragraph (d) of this section.

    (a)(1) If a student officially withdraws, drops out, or is expelled 
before his or her first day of class of a payment period, all funds paid 
to the student for that payment period for institutional or 
noninstitutional costs under the Pell Grant, SEOG, ICL, and Perkins Loan 
programs are an overpayment.
    (2) The institution shall return that overpayment to the respective 
title IV, HEA programs in the amount that the student received from each 
program.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the Secretary considers that a 
student drops out before his or her first day of class of a payment 
period if the institution is unable to document the student's attendance 
at any class during the payment period.

Sec. 668.22  Institutional refunds and repayments.

    (a) General. (1) An institution shall have a fair and equitable 
refund policy under which the institution makes a refund of unearned 
tuition, fees, room

[[Page 415]]

and board, and other charges to a student who received Title IV, HEA 
program assistance, or whose parent received a Federal PLUS loan or 
Federal Direct PLUS loan on behalf of the student if the student--
    (i) Does not register for the period of enrollment for which the 
student was charged; or
    (ii) Withdraws, drops out, is expelled from the institution, or 
otherwise fails to complete the program on or after his or her first day 
of class of the period of enrollment for which he or she was charged.
    (2) The institution shall provide a clear and conspicuous written 
statement containing its refund policy, including the allocation of 
refunds and repayments to sources of aid to a prospective student prior 
to the earlier of the student's enrollment or the execution of the 
student's enrollment agreement. The institution must make available to 
students upon request examples of the application of this policy and 
inform students of the availability of these examples in the written 
statement. The institution shall make its policy known to currently 
enrolled students. The institution shall include in its statement the 
procedures that a student must follow to obtain a refund, but the 
institution shall return the portion of a refund allocable to the Title 
IV, HEA programs in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section 
whether the student follows those procedures or not. If the institution 
changes its refund policy, the institution shall ensure that all 
students are made aware of the new policy.
    (3) The institution shall publish the costs of required supplies and 
equipment and shall substantiate to the Secretary upon request that the 
costs are reasonably related to the cost of providing the supplies and 
equipment to students.
    (b) Fair and equitable refund policy. (1) For purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, an institution's refund policy is fair and 
equitable if the policy provides for a refund of at least the larger of 
the amount provided under--
    (i) The requirements of applicable State law;
    (ii) The specific refund standards established by the institution's 
nationally recognized accrediting agency if those standards are approved 
by the Secretary;
    (iii) The pro rata refund calculation described in paragraph (c) of 
this section, for any student attending the institution for the first 
time whose withdrawal date is on or before the 60 percent point in time 
in the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged; or
    (iv) For purposes of determining a refund when the pro rata refund 
calculation under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section does not apply, 
and no standards for a refund under State law under paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
and no standards established by the institution's accrediting agency 
under (b)(1)(ii) of this section exist, the larger of--
    (A) The Federal refund calculation contained in paragraph (d) of 
this section; or
    (B) The institution's refund policy.
    (2) For purposes of the calculation of a pro rata refund under 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, ``the 60 percent point in time in 
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' is--
    (i) In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit 
hours, the point in calendar time when 60 percent of the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged, as defined in 
paragraph (e) of this section, has elapsed; and
    (ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured in clock 
hours, the point in time when the student completes 60 percent of the 
clock hours scheduled for the period of enrollment for which the student 
is charged, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) The institution must determine which policy under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section provides for the largest refund to that student.
    (4) For all refund calculations other than the pro rata refund 
calculation under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, an institution 
must subtract the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment from the 
amount the institution may retain in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section.
    (c) Pro Rata refund. (1) ``Pro rata refund,'' as used in this 
section, means a refund by an institution to a student

[[Page 416]]

attending that institution for the first time of not less than that 
portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges assessed 
the student by the institution equal to the portion of the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains on the 
withdrawal date, rounded downward to the nearest 10 percent of that 
period, less any unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment for the 
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged.
    (2) A ``scheduled cash payment'' is the amount of institutional 
charges that is not paid for by financial aid for the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged exclusive of--
    (i) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA program 
assistance that the student has been awarded that is payable to the 
student even though the student has withdrawn;
    (ii) Late disbursements of loans made under the Federal Stafford 
Loan, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in accordance with 34 CFR 
682.207(d), and allowable late disbursements of unsubsidized Federal 
Stafford loans and loans made under the Federal Direct Student Loan 
Program in accordance with 34 CFR 685.303(d); and
    (iii) Late disbursements of State student financial assistance, for 
which the student is still eligible in spite of having withdrawn, made 
in accordance with the applicable State's written late disbursement 
policies. The late disbursement must be made within 60 days after the 
student's date of withdrawal, as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section, or the institution must--
    (A) Recalculate the refund in accordance with this section, 
including recalculating the student's unpaid charges in accordance with 
this paragraph without consideration of the State's late disbursement 
amount; and
    (B) Return any additional refund amounts due as a result of the 
recalculation in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (3) The ``unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment'' is computed by 
subtracting the amount paid by the student for the period of enrollment 
for which the student has been charged from the scheduled cash payment 
for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged.
    (4) An institution may exclude from the calculation of a pro rata 
refund under this paragraph a reasonable administrative fee not to

charges assessed the student; or
    (ii) One hundred dollars.
    (5)(i) For purposes of this section, ``other charges assessed the 
student by the institution'' include, but are not limited to, charges 
for any equipment (including books and supplies) issued by an 
institution to the student if the institution specifies in the 
enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the student 
actually obtains or if the institution refers the student to a vendor 
operated by the institution or an entity affiliated or related to the 
institution.
    (ii) The institution may exclude from the calculation of a pro rata 
refund under this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of 
unreturnable equipment issued to the student in accordance with

the student in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section if 
the student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing 
for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date of the 
student's withdrawal. For example, equipment is not considered to be 
returned in good condition and, therefore, is unreturnable, if the 
equipment cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and 
sanitary reasons. The institution must clearly and conspicuously 
disclose in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of 
equipment, including equipment that is unreturnable. The institution 
must notify the student in writing prior to enrollment that return of 
the specific equipment involved will be required within 20 days of the 
student's withdrawal.

attending at least one class; or
    (B) Completes the period of enrollment for which he or she has been 
charged.

enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains'' is 
determined--

hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising the period of 
enrollment for which the student has been charged into the number of 
weeks remaining in that period as of the student's withdrawal date;
    (ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured in clock 
hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours comprising the period

for which the student was charged, the institution must follow the 
provisions under Sec. 668.21 for the treatment of Federal Perkins Loan, 
FSEOG, and Federal Pell Grant Program funds, the provisions under 
Sec. 682.604(d)(3) or (4) for the treatment of FFEL Program funds, and

equipment prescribed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (4) For purposes of this section--
    (i) ``Room'' charges do not include charges that are passed through 
the institution from an entity that is not under the control of, related 
to, or affiliated with the institution; and
    (ii) ``Other charges assessed the student by the institution'' do 
not include fees for group health insurance, if this insurance is

    (e) Period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. (1) 
For purposes of this section, ``the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged,'' means the actual period for which an 
institution charges a student, except that the minimum period must be--
    (i) In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit 
hours or clock hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other 
academic terms, the semester, trimester, quarter or other academic term;

assessed the student for the period of enrollment or any portion of that 
period

[[Page 419]]

of enrollment when calculating the refund.
    (f) Overpayments. (1) An institution shall determine whether a 
student has received an overpayment for noninstitutional costs for the 
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged if--
    (i) The student officially withdraws, drops out, or is expelled, on 
or after his or her first day of class of that period; and
    (ii) The student received Title IV, HEA program assistance other 
than from the FWS, Federal Stafford loan, Federal PLUS, Federal SLS, 
Federal Direct Stafford, or Federal Direct PLUS Program for that period.
    (2)(i) To determine if the student owes an overpayment, the 
institution shall subtract the noninstitutional costs that the student 
incurred for that portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged from the amount of all assistance (other than 
from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, Federal SLS Program, 
Federal Direct Stafford, or Federal Direct PLUS) that the institution 
disbursed to the student.
    (ii) Noninstitutional costs may include, but are not limited to, 
room and board for which the student does not contract with the 
institution, books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous 
expenses.
    (g) Repayments to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional refunds 
and overpayments. (1)(i) An institution shall return a portion of the

    (ii) The portion of the refund that an institution shall return to 
the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of assistance that 
the student received under the Title IV, HEA programs other than under

been charged.
    (2) For purposes of this section, for all refund calculations other 
than the pro rata refund calculation required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section--
    (i) An institutional refund means the amount paid for institutional 
charges for the period of enrollment for which the student has been

for which the student has been charged that the student was actually 
enrolled at the institution;
    (ii) An institution may not include any unpaid amount of a scheduled 
cash payment in determining the amount that the institution may retain 
for institutional charges. A scheduled cash payment is the amount of 
institutional charges that has not been paid by financial aid for the

section, or the institution must--
    (1) Recalculate the refund in accordance with this section, 
including recalculating the student's unpaid charges in accordance with 
this paragraph without consideration of the State late disbursement 
amount; and
    (2) Return any additional refund amounts due as a result of the 
recalculation in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section;
    (iii) In determining the amount that the institution may retain for 
the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been 
charged

[[Page 420]]

during which the student was actually enrolled, an institution shall--
    (A) Compute the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment by 
subtracting the amount paid by the student for that period of enrollment 
for which the student has been charged from the scheduled cash payment 
for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged; and
    (B) Subtract the unpaid amount of the scheduled cash payment from 
the amount that may be retained by the institution according to the 
institution's refund policy; and
    (iv) An institution shall return the total amount of Title IV, HEA 
program assistance (other than amounts received from the FWS Program) 
paid for institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which 
the student has been charged if the unpaid amount of the student's 
scheduled cash payment is greater than or equal to the amount that may 
be retained by the institution under the institution's refund policy.
    (3)(i) A student must repay to the institution or to the Title IV, 
HEA programs a portion of the overpayment as determined according to 
paragraph (f) of this section. The institution shall make every 
reasonable effort to contact the student and recover the overpayment in 
accordance with program regulations (34 CFR parts 673, 690, and 691).
    (ii) The portion of the overpayment that the student or the 
institution (if the institution recovers the overpayment) shall return 
to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of assistance 
received under the Title IV, HEA programs other than the FWS, Federal 
Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, Federal SLS, Federal Direct Stafford, or 
Federal Direct PLUS Program for the period of enrollment for which the 
student has been charged.
    (iii) Unless otherwise provided for in applicable program 
regulations--
    (A) If the amount of the overpayment is less than $100, the student 
is considered not to owe an overpayment, and the institution is not 
required to contact the student or recover the overpayment; and
    (B) If an institution demonstrates that the total amount of a refund 
would be $25 or less, the institution is not required to pay the refund, 
provided that the institution has obtained written authorization from 
the student in the enrollment agreement to retain any amount of the 
refund that would be allocated to the Title IV, HEA loan programs.
    (h) Allocation of refunds and overpayments. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if a student who received Title IV, 
HEA program assistance (other than assistance under the FWS Program) is 
owed a refund calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, or if a student who received Title IV, HEA program assistance 
(other than assistance under the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal 
PLUS, Federal SLS, Federal Direct Stafford, or Federal Direct PLUS 
Program) must repay an overpayment calculated in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section, an institution shall allocate that refund 
and any overpayment collected from the student in the following order:
    (i) To eliminate outstanding balances on unsubsidized Federal 
Stafford loans received by the student for the period of enrollment for

    (xii) To the student.
    (2) The institution must apply the allocation policy described in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section consistently to all students who have

    (iv) The amount of the Title IV, HEA program portion of the refund 
allocated to the Title IV, HEA programs other than the FWS, Federal

to the appropriate program account or accounts by the institution within 
30 days of the date that the student officially withdraws, is expelled, 
or the institution determines that a student has unofficially withdrawn.
    (v) The amount of the Title IV, HEA program portion of the 
overpayment allocated to the Title IV, HEA programs other than the FWS, 
Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, Federal SLS, Federal Direct

consists predominantly of correspondence courses, the student's 
withdrawal date is normally the date of the last lesson submitted by the 
student, if the student failed to submit the subsequent lesson in

However, if the student establishes in writing, within 60 days of the 
date of the last lesson that he or she submitted, a desire to continue 
in the program and an understanding that the required lessons must be 
submitted on time, the institution may restore that student to ``in

HEA programs involves every aspect of the servicer's administration of 
that program for that institution.
    (2) A third-party servicer that contracts with more than one 
participating institution may submit a compliance audit report that 
covers the servicer's administration of the title IV, HEA programs for 
all institutions with which the servicer contracts.
    (3) A third-party servicer must submit annually to the Secretary its 
compliance audit no later than six months after the last day of the

    (d) Audited financial statements. (1) General. To enable the 
Secretary to make a determination of financial responsibility, an 
institution must, to the extent requested by the Secretary, submit to 
the Secretary a set of financial statements for its latest complete 
fiscal year, as well as any other documentation the Secretary deems 
necessary to make that determination. Financial statements submitted to 
the Secretary must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and audited by an independent 
auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing 
standards, and other guidance contained in the Office of Management and 
Budget Circular A-133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and 
Other Nonprofit Organizations''; Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments''; or in audit

Office of Inspector General , whichever is applicable. As part of these 
financial statements, the institution must include a detailed 
description of related entities based on the definition of a related 
entity as set

[[Page 424]]

forth in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 57. The 
disclosure requirements under this provision extend beyond those of SFAS 
57 to include all related parties and a level of detail that would 
enable to Secretary to readily identify the related party. Such 
information may include, but is not limited to, the name, location and a 
description of the related entity including the nature and amount of any 
transactions between the related party and the institution, financial or 
otherwise, regardless of when they occurred.
    (2) Submission of additional financial statements. To the extent 
requested by the Secretary in determining whether an institution is 
financially responsible, the Secretary may also require the submission 
of audited consolidated financial statements, audited full consolidating 
financial statements, audited combined financial statements or the 
audited financial statements of one or more related parties that have 
the ability, either individually or collectively, to significantly 
influence or control the institution, as determined by the Secretary.
    (3) Audited financial statements for foreign institutions. A foreign 
institution must submit--
    (i) Audited financial statements prepared in accordance with the 
generally accepted accounting principles of the institution's home 
country, if the institution received less than $500,000 U.S. in title 
IV, HEA program funds during its most recently completed fiscal year; or
    (ii) Audited financial statements translated to meet the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, if the institution 
received $500,000 U.S. or more in title IV, HEA program funds during its 
most recently completed fiscal year.
    (4) Disclosure of title IV HEA program revenue. A proprietary 
institution must disclose in a footnote to its financial statement audit

funds that the institution received during the fiscal year covered by 
that audit. The revenue percentage must be calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 600.5(d).

party servicer that enters into a contract with a lender or guaranty 
agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or guaranty agency's 
programs, as provided under 34 CFR part 682, must submit annually an 
audited financial statement. This financial statement must be prepared 
on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with 
generally accepted government auditing standards and other guidance 
contained in audit guides issued by the Department of Education's Office 
of Inspector General.
    (e) Access to records. (1) An institution or a third-party servicer 
that has a compliance or financial statement audit conducted under this 
section must--
    (i) Give the Secretary and the Inspector General access to records 
or other documents necessary to review that audit, including the right 
to obtain copies of those records or documents; and
    (ii) Require an individual or firm conducting the audit to give the 
Secretary and the Inspector General access to records, audit work 
papers, or other documents necessary to review that audit, including the 
right to obtain copies of those records, work papers, or documents.
    (2) An institution must give the Secretary and the Inspector General 
access to records or other documents necessary to review a third-party 
servicer's compliance or financial statement audit, including the right 
to obtain copies of those records or documents.
    (f) Notification of questioned expenditures or compliance. (1) As a 
result of a Federal audit or an audit performed at the direction of an 
institution or third-party servicer, if the auditor questions an 
expenditure made by the institution or servicer, or questions the 
institution's or servicer's compliance with an applicable requirement 
(including the lack of proper documentation), the Secretary notifies the 
institution or servicer of the questioned expenditure or compliance.

[[Page 425]]

    (2) If the institution or servicer believes that the questioned 
expenditure or compliance was proper, the institution or servicer shall 
notify the Secretary in writing of the institution's or servicer's 
position and the reasons for that position.
    (3) The institution's or servicer's response must be based on an 
attestation engagement performed by the institution's or servicer's 
auditor in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of 
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and must be 
received by the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's 
notification to the institution or servicer.
    (g) Determination of liabilities. (1) Based on the audit finding and 
the institution's or third-party servicer's response, the Secretary 
determines the amount of liability, if any, owed by the institution or 
servicer and instructs the institution or servicer as to the manner of 
repayment.
    (2) If the Secretary determines that a third-party servicer owes a 
liability for its administration of an institution's title IV, HEA 
programs, the servicer must notify each institution under whose contract 
the servicer owes a liability of that determination. The servicer must 
also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the 
same service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed.
    (h) Repayments. (1) An institution or third-party servicer that must 
repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay those funds 
at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the 
Secretary's notification, unless--
    (i) The institution or servicer files an appeal under the procedures 
established in subpart H of this part; or
    (ii) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g)(1) of this section--
    (i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted surety or 
has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary questions 
expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements and identifies 
liabilities, then the Secretary may determine that deferring recourse to 
the surety or guarantee is not appropriate because--
    (A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers affected by 
the act or omission giving rise to the liability outweighs the 
importance of deferring collection action until completion of available 
appeal proceedings; or
    (B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete 
assurance that recourse to that protection will be fully available 
through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or
    (ii) The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR 
part 30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures of this section.
    (3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in 
the Secretary's notification, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to 
the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or 
third-party servicer must repay those funds at the direction of the 
Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this 
part unless--
    (i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or
    (ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is 
appropriate pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (4) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the 
institution's third-party servicer for a violation incurred in servicing 
any aspect of that institution's participation in the title IV, HEA 
programs and remains responsible for that amount until that amount is 
repaid in full.

    (1) The death of a relative of the student;
    (2) An injury or illness of the student; or
    (3) Other special circumstances.
    (d) If a student is not making satisfactory progress at the end of

Sec. 668.36  Social security number.

    (a) (1) Except for residents of the Federated States of Micronesia, 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, the 
Secretary attempts to confirm the social security number a student 
provides on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) under a 
data match with the Social Security Administration. If the Social 
Security Administration confirms that number, the Secretary notifies the 
institution and the student of that confirmation.
    (2) If the student's verified social security number is the same 
number as the one he or she provided on the FAFSA, and the institution 
has no reason to believe that the verified social security number is 
inaccurate, the institution may consider the number to be accurate.
    (3) If the Social Security Administration does not verify the 
student's social security number on the FAFSA, or the institution has 
reason to believe

[[Page 435]]

that the verified social security number is inaccurate, the student can 
provide evidence to the institution, such as the student's social 
security card, indicating the accuracy of the student's social security 
number. An institution must give a student at least 30 days, or until 
the end of the award year, whichever is later, to produce that evidence.
    (4) An institution may not deny, reduce, delay, or terminate a 
student's eligibility for assistance under the title IV, HEA programs 
because verification of that student's social security number is 
pending.
    (b) (1) An institution may not disburse any title IV, HEA program 
funds to a student until the institution is satisfied that the student's 
reported social security number is accurate.
    (2) The institution shall ensure that the Secretary is notified of 
the student's accurate social security number if the student 
demonstrates the accuracy of a social security number that is not the 
number the student included on the FAFSA.
    (c) If the Secretary determines that the social security number 
provided to an institution by a student is incorrect, and that student 
has not provided evidence under paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
indicating the accuracy of the social security number, and a loan has 
been guaranteed for the student under the FFEL program, the institution 
shall notify and instruct the lender and guaranty agency making and 
guaranteeing the loan, respectively, to cease further disbursements of 
the loan, until the Secretary or the institution determines that the 
social security number provided by the student is correct, but the 
guaranty may not be voided or otherwise nullified before the date that 
the lender and the guaranty agency receive the notice.
    (d) Nothing in this section permits the Secretary to take any 
compliance, disallowance, penalty or other regulatory action against--
    (1) Any institution of higher education with respect to any error in 
a social security number, unless the error was the result of fraud on 
the part of the institution; or
    (2) Any student with respect to any error in a social security 
number, unless the error was the result of fraud on the part of the 
student.

    (b) (1) When the Secretary processes a male student's FAFSA, the 
Secretary determines whether the student is registered with the 
Selective Service under a data match with the Selective Service.
    (2) Under the data match, Selective Service reports to the Secretary 
whether its records indicate that the student is registered, and the 
Secretary reports the results of the data match to the student and the 
institution the student is attending.
    (c) (1) If the Selective Service does not confirm through the data 
match, that the student is registered, the student can establish that 
he--
    (i) Is registered;
    (ii) Is not, or was not required to be, registered;
    (iii) Has registered since the submission of the FAFSA; or
    (iv) Meets the conditions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) An institution must give a student at least 30 days, or until

[[Page 436]]

of the award year, whichever is later, to provide evidence to establish 
the condition described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) An institution may determine that a student, who was required 
to, but did not register with the Selective Service, is not ineligible 
to receive title IV, HEA assistance for that reason, if the student can 
demonstrate by submitting clear and unambiguous evidence to the 
institution that--
    (1) He was unable to present himself for registration for reasons 
beyond his control such as hospitalization, incarceration, or 
institutionalization; or
    (2) He is over 26 and when he was between 18 and 26 and required to 
register--
    (i) He did not knowingly and willfully fail to register with the 
Selective Service; or

duty and received a DD Form 214, ``Certificate of Release or Discharge 
from Active Duty,'' showing military service with other than the reserve 
forces and National Guard.
    (e) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, an 
institution may consider that a student did not knowingly and willfully 
fail to register with the Selective Service only if--
    (1) The student submits to the institution an advisory opinion from 
the Selective Service System that does not dispute the student's claim 
that he did not knowingly and willfully fail to register; and
    (2) The institution does not have uncontroverted evidence that the 
student knowingly and willfully failed to register.
    (f) (1) A student who is required to register with the Selective 
Service and has been denied title IV, HEA program assistance because he 
has not proven to the institution that he has registered with Selective 
Service may seek a hearing from the Secretary by filing a request in 
writing with the Secretary. The student must submit with that request--
    (i) A statement that he is in compliance with registration 
requirements;
    (ii) A concise statement of the reasons why he has not been able to 
prove that he is in compliance with those requirements; and

who--
    (i) Asserts that he is in compliance with registration requirements; 
and
    (ii) Files a written request for a hearing in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section within the award year for which he was 
denied title IV, HEA program assistance or within 30 days following the 
end of the payment period, whichever is later.
    (3) An official designated by the Secretary shall conduct any 
hearing held under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The sole purpose of 
this hearing is the determination of compliance with registration 
requirements. At this hearing, the student retains the burden of proving 
compliance, by credible evidence, with the requirements of the Military 
Selective Service Act. The designated official shall not consider 
challenges based on constitutional or other grounds to the requirements 
that a student state and verify, if required, compliance with 
registration requirements, or to those registration requirements 
themselves.
    (g) Any determination of compliance made under this section is final 
unless reopened by the Secretary and revised on the basis of additional 
evidence.
    (h) Any determination of compliance made under this section is 
binding only for purposes of determining eligibility for title IV, HEA 
program assistance.

teams--such as track and field or swimming and diving. Those 
combinations must be reported separately for men's and women's teams.
    (iii)(A) Whether the head coach was male or female and whether the 
head coach was assigned to that team on a full-time or part-time basis.

volunteers who served as head coaches to be head coaches for the 
purposes of this report.

volunteers who served as assistant coaches to be assistant coaches for 
purposes of this report.

aid, including the value of waivers of educational expenses, aggregately 
for men's teams, and aggregately for women's teams.
    (4) The ratio of-(i) Athletically-related student aid awarded male 
athletes; and
    (ii) Athletically-related student aid awarded female athletes.
    (5) The total amount of expenditures on recruiting aggregately for 
all men's teams, and aggregately for all women's teams.
    (6) The total annual revenues generated across all men's teams, and 
the total annual revenues generated across all women's teams. An 
institution may also report those revenues by individual team.
    (7)(i) The average annual institutional salary of the head coaches 
of all men's teams, across all offered sports, and the average annual 
institutional salary of the head coaches of all women's teams, across

    (ii) If a head coach had responsibilities for more than one team and 
the institution does not allocate that coach's salary by team, the 
institution shall divide the salary by the number of teams for which the 
coach had responsibility and allocate the salary among the teams on a 
basis consistent with the coach's responsibilities for the different 
teams.
    (8) The average annual institutional salary of the assistant coaches 
of men's teams, across all offered sports, and the average annual 
institutional salary of the assistant coaches of women's teams, across 
all offered sports.

    Note to paragraph (e): The Secretary interprets the statute to 
require an institution to count all varsity team members as 
participants, and not merely those athletes who take part in a scheduled 
contest. ``Participants'' include all students who practice with the 
varsity team and receive coaching as of the day of the first scheduled 
intercollegiate contest of the designated reporting year, including 
junior varsity team and freshman team players if they are part of the 
overall varsity program. The Secretary believes that a reasonable count 
of participants would also cover all students who receive athletically-
related student aid, including redshirts, injured student athletes, and 
fifth-year team members who have already received a bachelor's degree.

itself that the student will be attending the same school as the 
applicant.
    (d) Untaxed income and benefits. An institution shall require an

Sec. 668.59  Consequences of a change in application information.

    (a) For the Federal Pell Grant Program--
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the 
information on an application changes as a result of the verification 
process, the institution shall require the applicant to resubmit his or 
her application information to the Secretary for corrections if--
    (i) The institution recalculates the applicant's EFC, determines 
that the applicant's EFC changes, and determines that the change in the 
EFC changes the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award; or
    (ii) The institution does not recalculate the applicant's EFC.
    (2) An institution need not require an applicant to resubmit his or 
her application information to the Secretary, recalculate an applicant's 
EFC, or adjust an applicant's Federal Pell Grant award if, as a result 
of the verification process, the institution finds--
    (i) No errors in nondollar items used to calculate the applicant's 
EFC;

[[Page 454]]

    (ii) No dollar amount in excess of $400 as calculated by the net 
difference between the corrected sum of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus 
untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid and the uncorrected sum of Adjusted 
Gross Income (AGI) plus untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid. If no 
Federal Income Tax Return was filed, income earned from work may be used 
in lieu of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).
    (b) For the Federal Pell Grant Program--
    (1) If an institution does not recalculate an applicant's EFC under 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the institution 
shall calculate and disburse the applicant's Pell Grant award on the 
basis of the applicant's original EFC.
    (2)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, if an institution recalculates an applicant's EFC because of a 
change in application information resulting from the verification 
process, the institution shall--
    (A) Require the applicant to resubmit his or her application to the 
Secretary;
    (B) Recalculate the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on the 
basis of the EFC on the corrected SAR or ISIR; and
    (C) Disburse any additional funds under that award only if the 
applicant provides the institution with the corrected SAR or ISIR and 
only to the extent that additional funds are payable based on the 
recalculation.
    (ii) If an institution recalculates an applicant's EFC because of a 
change in application information resulting from the verification 
process and determines that the change in the EFC increases the 
applicant's award, the institution--
    (A) May disburse the applicant's Federal Pell Grant award on the 
basis of the original EFC without requiring the applicant to resubmit 
his or her application information to the Secretary; and
    (B) Except as provided in Sec. 668.60(b), shall disburse any

Ford Federal Direct Loan programs--
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the 
information on an application changes as a result of the verification 
process, the institution shall--
    (i) Recalculate the applicant's EFC; and
    (ii) Adjust the applicant's financial aid package for the campus-
based, and Federal Stafford Loan or William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan 
programs to reflect the new EFC if the new EFC results in an overaward 
of campus-based funds or decreases the applicant's recommended loan 
amount.
    (2) An institution need not recalculate an applicant's EFC or adjust 
his or her aid package if, as a result of the verification process, the 
institution finds--
    (i) No errors in nondollar items used to calculate the applicant's 
EFC;
    (ii) No dollar amount in excess of $400 as calculated by the net 
difference between the corrected sum of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus 
untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid and the uncorrected sum of Adjusted 
Gross Income (AGI) plus untaxed income minus U.S. taxes paid. If no 
Federal Income Tax Return was filed, income earned from work may be used 
in lieu of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).
    (d)(1) If the institution selects an applicant for verification for 
an award year who previously received a loan under the William D. Ford 
Federal Direct Loan Program for that award year, and as a result of 
verification the loan amount is reduced, the institution shall comply 
with the procedures for notifying the borrower and lender specified in 
Sec. 668.61(a).
    (2) If the institution selects an applicant for verification for an 
award year who previously received a loan under the Federal Stafford 
Loan Program for that award year, and as a result of verification the 
loan amount is reduced, the institution shall comply with the procedures 
for notifying the borrower and lender specified in Sec. 668.61(b) and 
Sec. 682.604(h).
    (e) If the applicant has received funds based on information which 
may be incorrect and the institution has made a reasonable effort to 
resolve the alleged discrepancy, but cannot do so, the institution shall 
forward the applicant's

institution may receive a verified ISIR after the applicable deadline 
specified in 34 CFR 690.61 but within an established additional time 
period set by the Secretary through publication of a notice in the 
Federal Register. If the institution receives a verified SAR or ISIR 
during the established additional time period, and the EFC on the two 
SARs or ISIRs are different, payment must be based on the higher of the 
two EFCs.
    (2) If the applicant does not provide to the institution the 
requested documentation and, if necessary, a verified SAR or the 
institution does not receive a verified ISIR, within the additional time 
period referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the applicant--
    (i) Forfeits the Federal Pell Grant for the award year; and
    (ii) Shall return any Federal Pell Grant payments previously

who has been requested to provide documentation until the applicant 
provides the documentation or the Secretary decides that there is no 
longer a need for the documentation.
    (e) If an applicant selected for verification for an award year dies 
before the deadline for completing the verification process without

year, the institution may not--
    (1) Make any further disbursements on behalf of that applicant;
    (2) Certify that applicant's Federal Stafford Loan application or 
process that applicant's Federal Stafford Loan proceeds; or

process that an applicant received Stafford Loan or William D. Ford 
Federal Direct Loan proceeds for an award year in excess of the 
student's financial need for the loan, the institution shall withhold 
and promptly return to the lender or escrow agent any disbursement not 
yet delivered to the student that exceeds the amount of assistance for 
which the student is eligible, taking into account other financial aid 
received by the student. However, instead of returning the entire 
undelivered disbursement, the school may choose to return promptly to 
the lender only the portion of the disbursement for which the student is 
ineligible. In either case, the institution shall provide the lender 
with a written statement describing the reason for the returned loan 
funds.

other material violation of law involving those funds;
    (B) A person who exercises substantial control over the servicer, as 
determined according to Sec. 668.15, has been convicted of, or has pled

HEA program; and

[[Page 460]]

    (ii) The participation in any Title IV, HEA program of any

or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; and
    (ii) Upon learning of the debarment, suspension, or cause for 
debarment or suspension, the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
does not promptly--
    (A) Discontinue the affiliation; or
    (B) Remove the principal from responsibility for any aspect of the 
administration of an institution's or servicer's participation in the

institution or its students, or from a third-party servicer, as 
applicable;

[[Page 461]]

    (2)(i) Withdraw the authority of the institution or servicer, as

disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds; or
    (ii) Withdraw the authority of the institution or servicer, as

aspect of any institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program; 
or

in accordance with a particular procedure.
    (b)(1) An initiating official begins an emergency action against an 
institution or third-party servicer by sending the institution or 
servicer a notice by registered mail, return receipt requested. In an 
emergency action against a third-party servicer, the official also sends 
the notice to each institution that contracts with the servicer. The 
official also may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means 
if practical.
    (2) The emergency action takes effect on the date the initiating 
official mails the notice to the institution or servicer, as applicable.
    (3) The notice states the grounds on which the emergency action is 
based, the consequences of the emergency action, and that the 
institution or servicer, as applicable, may request an opportunity to 
show cause why the emergency action is unwarranted.
    (c)(1) An initiating official takes emergency action against an 
institution or third-party servicer only if that official--
    (i) Receives information, determined by the official to be reliable, 
that the institution or servicer, as applicable, is violating any 
statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any 
regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, or any 
applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation entered into 
under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA;
    (ii) Determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse 
of Title IV, HEA program funds; and
    (iii) Determines that the likelihood of loss from that misuse 
outweighs the importance of awaiting completion of any proceeding that 
may be initiated to limit, suspend, or terminate, as applicable--
    (A) The participation of the institution in one or more Title IV, 
HEA programs; or
    (B) The eligibility of the servicer to contract with any institution 
to administer any aspect of the institution's participation in a Title 
IV, HEA program.
    (2) Examples of violations of a Title IV, HEA program requirement 
that cause misuse and the likely loss of Title IV, HEA program funds

of Title IV, HEA program funds in an amount that exceeds--
    (A) The amount for which students are eligible; or
    (B) The amount of principal, interest, or special allowance payments 
that would have been payable to the holder of a Federal Stafford, 
Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS loan if a refund allocable to that loan had 
been made in the amount and at the time required;
    (ii) Using, offering to make available, or causing the use or 
availability of Title IV, HEA program funds for educational services 
if--
    (A) The institution, servicer, or agents of the institution or

Secs. 668.72, 668.73, or 668.74 related to those services;
    (B) The institution lacks the administrative or financial ability to 
provide those services in full; or
    (C) The institution, or servicer, as applicable, lacks the 
administrative or financial ability to compensate by appropriate refund 
for any portion of an educational program not completed by a student; 
and
    (iii) Engaging in fraud involving the administration of a Title IV, 
HEA program. Examples of fraud include--
    (A) Falsification of any document received from a student or 
pertaining to

[[Page 462]]

a student's eligibility for assistance under a Title IV, HEA program;
    (B) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted by the institution or servicer to the Secretary;
    (C) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
used for or pertaining to--
    (1) The legal authority of an institution to provide postsecondary 
education in the State in which the institution is located; or
    (2) The accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution or any 
of the institution's educational programs or locations;
    (D) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted to a guaranty agency under the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal

servicer pertaining to the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program; and
    (F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
pertaining to the performance of any loan collection activity, including 
activity that is not required by the HEA or applicable program 
regulations.
    (3) If the Secretary begins an emergency action against a third-
party servicer, the Secretary may also begin an emergency action against 
any institution under whose contract a third-party servicer commits the 
violation.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after 
an emergency action becomes effective, an institution or third-party 
servicer, as applicable, may not--
    (i) Make or increase awards or make other commitments of aid to a 
student under the applicable Title IV, HEA program;
    (ii) Disburse either program funds, institutional funds, or other 
funds as assistance to a student under that Title IV, HEA program;
    (iii) In the case of an emergency action pertaining to participation 
in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program--
    (A) Certify an application for a loan under that program;
    (B) Deliver loan proceeds to a student under that program; or
    (C) Retain the proceeds of a loan made under that program that are 
received after the emergency action takes effect; or
    (iv) In the case of an emergency action against a third-party 
servicer, administer any aspect of any institution's participation in 
any Title IV, HEA program.
    (2) If the initiating official withdraws, by an emergency action, 
the authority of the institution or servicer to commit, disburse, 
deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, 
HEA program funds, or the authority of the servicer to administer any 
aspect of any institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program, 
except in accordance with a particular procedure specified in the notice 
of emergency action, the institution or servicer, as applicable, may not 
take any action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section except in 
accordance with the procedure specified in the notice.
    (e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
the Secretary provides the institution or servicer, as soon as 
practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action 
is unwarranted or should be modified.
    (2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity to 
present evidence and argument to a show-cause official. The initiating 
official does not act as the show-cause official for any emergency 
action that the initiating official has begun. The show-cause official 
is authorized to grant relief from the emergency action. The institution 
or servicer may make its presentation in writing or, upon its request, 
at an informal meeting with the show-cause official.
    (3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner in which 
argument and evidence may be presented in order to avoid unnecessary 
delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant, or repetitious 
matter.
    (4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the burden of 
persuading

[[Page 463]]

the show-cause official that the emergency action imposed by the notice 
is unwarranted or should be modified because--
    (i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer, exist;
    (ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss or misuse 
of Title IV, HEA program funds; or
    (iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use 
procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss from the misuse 
described in the notice.
    (5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes the 
emergency action promptly after consideration of any argument and 
evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as applicable, and 
the initiating official.
    (6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, of that official's determination promptly after the 
completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no meeting is requested, 
after the official receives all the material submitted by the 
institution in opposition to the emergency action. In the case of a 
notice to a third-party servicer, the official also notifies each 
institution that contracts with the servicer of that determination. The 
show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or 
modifying the statement of reasons provided in the notice of emergency 
action.
    (f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30 days after 
initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation, suspension, or 
termination proceeding under this part or under 34 CFR part 600 against 
the institution or servicer, as applicable, within that 30-day period, 
in which case the emergency action continues until a final decision is 
issued in that proceeding, as provided in Sec. 668.90(c), as applicable.
    (2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a 
proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, any action 
affecting the emergency action is at the sole discretion of the 
initiating official, or, if a show- cause proceeding is conducted, the 
show-cause official.
    (3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by virtue of 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, may then submit written material to the show-cause official 
to demonstrate that because of facts occurring after the later of the 
notice by the initiating official or the show-cause meeting, 
continuation of the emergency action is unwarranted and the emergency 
action should be modified or ended. The show-cause official considers 
any written material submitted and issues a determination that 
continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action.
    (g) The expiration of an emergency action, or its modification or 
revocation by the show-cause official, does not bar subsequent emergency 
action on a ground other than one specifically identified in the notice 
imposing the prior emergency action. Separate grounds may include 
violation of an agreement or limitation imposed or resulting from the 
prior emergency action.

considering that material, notifies the institution or, in the case of a 
third-party servicer, the servicer and each institution affected by the 
alleged violations that--
    (i) The fine will not be imposed; or

    (a) Scope and consequences.  (1) The Secretary may suspend an 
institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program or the

graduates of any institution that contracts with the servicer.
    (2) If the Secretary begins a suspension proceeding against a third-
party servicer, the Secretary also may begin a fine, limitation,

in Sec. 668.90(b)(2), if the designated department official receives 
from the institution or servicer, as applicable, by that date a request 
for a hearing or written material indicating why the suspension should 
not take place; and
    (iv) In the case of a suspension proceeding against a third-party 
servicer, informs each institution that contracts with the servicer of 
the consequences of the action to the institution.
    (2) If the institution or servicer does not request a hearing, but 
submits written material, the designated department official, after 
considering that material, notifies the institution or, in the case of a 
third-party servicer, the servicer and each institution that contracts 
with the servicer that--
    (i) The proposed suspension is dismissed; or
    (ii) The suspension is effective as of a specified date.
    (3) If the institution or servicer requests a hearing by the time 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the designated 
department official sets the date and place. The date is at least 15 
days after the designated department official receives the request. In 
the case of a hearing for an institution subject to suspension action 
because of its FFEL Program cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program 
cohort rate, or, if applicable, weighted average cohort rate, the 
hearing is set no later than 20 days after the date the designated 
department official receives the request. The suspension does not take 
place until after the requested hearing is held.

limitation or termination proceeding by sending an institution or third-
party servicer a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. In 
the case of a limitation or termination proceeding against a third-party 
servicer, the official also sends the notice to each institution that 
contracts with the servicer. The designated department official may also 
transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means if practical. This 
notice--
    (i) Informs the institution or servicer of the intent of the 
Secretary to limit or terminate the institution's participation or 
servicer's eligibility, as applicable, cites the consequences of that 
action, and identifies the alleged violations that constitute the basis 
for the action, and, in the case of a limitation proceeding, states the 
limits to be imposed;
    (ii)(A) Specifies the proposed effective date of the limitation or 
termination, which is at least 20 days after the date of mailing of the 
notice of intent; or
    (B) In the case of a limitation or termination action based on an 
institution's FFEL Program cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program 
cohort rate, or, if applicable, weighted average cohort rate, the 
proposed effective date of the termination is no more than 30 days after 
the date of the mailing of the notice of intent.
    (iii) Informs the institution or servicer that the limitation or 
termination will not be effective on the date specified in the notice if 
the designated department official receives from the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, by that date a request for a hearing or written 
material indicating why the limitation or termination should not take 
place; and
    (iv) In the case of a limitation or termination proceeding against a 
third-party servicer, informs each institution that contracts with the 
servicer of the consequences of the action to the institution.
    (2) If the institution or servicer does not request a hearing but 
submits written material, the designated department official, after 
considering that material, notifies the institution or, in the case of a 
third-party servicer, the servicer and each institution that contracts 
with the servicer that--
    (i) The proposed action is dismissed;
    (ii) Limitations are effective as of a specified date; or
    (iii) The termination is effective as of a specified date.
    (3) If the institution or servicer requests a hearing by the time 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the designated 
department official sets the date and place. The date is at least 15 
days after the designated department official receives the request. In 
the case of a hearing for an institution subject to limitation or 
termination action because of its FFEL Program cohort default rate, 
Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or, if applicable, weighted average 
cohort rate, the hearing is set no later than 20 days after the date the 
designated department official receives the request. The limitation or 
termination does not take place until after the requested hearing is 
held.
    (4) A hearing official conducts a hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 668.88.
    (c) Expedited proceeding. With the approval of the hearing official 
and the consent of the designated department official and the 
institution or servicer, as applicable, any time schedule specified in 
this section may be shortened.

Sec. 668.90  Initial and final decisions--Appeals.

    (a)(1)(i) A hearing official issues a written initial decision in a 
hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested to--
    (A) The designated department official who began a proceeding 
against an institution or third-party servicer;
    (B) The institution or servicer, as applicable; and
    (C) In the case of a proceeding against a third-party servicer, each 
institution that contracts with the servicer.
    (ii) The hearing official may also transmit the notice by other, 
more expeditious means if practical.
    (iii) The hearing official issues the decision within the latest of 
the following dates:
    (A) The 30th day after the last submission is filed with the hearing 
official.
    (B) The 60th day after the last submission is filed with the hearing 
official if the Secretary, upon request of the hearing official, 
determines that the unusual complexity of the case requires additional 
time for preparation of the decision.
    (C) The 50th day after the last day of the hearing, if the hearing 
official does not request the parties to make any posthearing 
submission.
    (D) For hearings regarding the limitation, suspension, or 
termination of an institution based on an institution's FFEL Program 
cohort default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or, if applicable, 
weighted average cohort rate, the 30th day after the conclusion of the 
hearing.
    (2) The hearing official's initial decision states whether the 
imposition of the fine, limitation, suspension, or termination sought by 
the designated department official is warranted, in whole or in part. If 
the designated department official brought a termination action against 
the institution or servicer, the hearing official may, if appropriate, 
issue an initial decision to fine the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, or, rather than terminating the institution's participation 
or servicer's eligibility, as applicable, impose one or more limitations 
on the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section--
    (i) If, in a termination action against an institution, the hearing 
official finds that the institution has violated the provisions of 
Sec. 668.14(b)(18), the hearing official also finds that termination of 
the institution's participation is warranted;
    (ii) If, in a termination action against a third-party servicer, the 
hearing official finds that the servicer has violated the provisions of 
Sec. 668.82(d)(1), the hearing official also finds that termination of 
the institution's participation or servicer's eligibility, as 
applicable, is warranted;
    (iii) If an action brought against an institution or third-party 
servicer involves its failure to provide surety in the amount specified 
by the Secretary under Sec. 668.15, the hearing official finds that the 
amount of the surety established by the Secretary was appropriate, 
unless the institution can demonstrate that the amount was unreasonable;
    (iv) In a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding 
commenced on the grounds described in Sec. 668.17(a) (2) and (3), if the 
hearing official finds that an institution's FFEL Program cohort default 
rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or, if applicable, weighted 
average cohort rate meets the conditions specified in Sec. 668.17(a) (2) 
and (3) for initiation of limitation, suspension, or termination 
proceedings, the hearing official also finds that the sanction sought by 
the designated department official is warranted, except that the hearing 
official finds that no sanction is warranted if the institution presents 
clear and convincing evidence demonstrating that the FFEL Program cohort 
default rate, Direct Loan Program cohort rate, or weighted average 
cohort rate on which the proposed action is based is not the final rate 
determined by the Department and that the correct rate would result in 
the institution having an FFEL Program cohort default rate, Direct Loan 
Program cohort rate, or weighted average cohort rate that is beneath the 
thresholds that make the institution subject

[[Page 469]]

to limitation, suspension, or termination action.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1085, 1094, 1099c)

    (v) In a termination action taken against an institution or third-
party servicer based on the grounds that the institution or servicer 
failed to comply with the requirements of Sec. 668.23(c)(3), if the 
hearing official finds that the institution or servicer failed to meet 
those requirements, the hearing official finds that the termination is 
warranted;
    (vi) In a termination action against an institution based on the 
grounds that the institution is not financially responsible under 
Sec. 668.15(c)(1), the hearing official finds that the termination is 
warranted unless the institution demonstrates that all applicable 
conditions described in Sec. 668.15(d)(4) have been met; and
    (vii) In a termination action against an institution or third-party 
servicer on the grounds that the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
engaged in fraud involving the administration of any Title IV, HEA 
program, the hearing official finds that the termination action is 
warranted if the hearing official finds that the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, engaged in that fraud. Examples of fraud 
include--
    (A) Falsification of any document received from a student or 
pertaining to a student's eligibility for assistance under a Title IV, 
HEA program;
    (B) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted by the institution or servicer to the Department of Education;
    (C) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
used for or pertaining to--
    (1) The legal authority of an institution to provide postsecondary 
education in the State in which the institution is located; or
    (2) The accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution or any 
of the institution's educational programs or locations;
    (D) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
submitted to a guaranty agency under the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal 
PLUS, and Federal SLS programs, an independent auditor, an eligible 
institution, or a third-party servicer;
    (E) Falsification of any document submitted to a third-party 
servicer by an institution or to an institution by a third-party 
servicer pertaining to the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
HEA program; and
    (F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any document 
pertaining to the performance of any loan collection activity, including 
activity that is not required by the HEA or applicable program 
regulations.
    (4) The hearing official bases findings of fact only on evidence 
considered at the hearing and on matters given judicial notice. If a 
hearing is conducted solely through written submissions, the parties 
must agree to findings of fact.
    (b)(1) In a suspension proceeding, the Secretary reviews the hearing 
official's initial decision and issues a final decision within 20 days 
after the initial decision. The Secretary adopts the initial decision 
unless it is clearly unsupported by the evidence presented at the 
hearing.
    (2) The Secretary notifies the institution or servicer and, in the 
case of a suspension proceeding against a third-party servicer, each 
institution that contracts with the servicer of the final decision. If 
the Secretary suspends the institution's participation or servicer's 
eligibility, the suspension takes effect on the later of--
    (i) The day that the institution or servicer receives the notice; or
    (ii) The date specified in the designated department official's 
original notice of intent to suspend the institution's participation or 
servicer's eligibility.
    (3) A suspension may not exceed 60 days unless a designated 
department official begins a limitation or termination proceeding under 
this subpart before the expiration of that period. In that case, the 
period may be extended until a final decision is issued in that 
proceeding according to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c)(1) In a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding, the hearing 
official's initial decision automatically becomes the Secretary's final 
decision 30 days after the initial decision is issued

[[Page 470]]

and received by both parties unless, within that 30-day period, the 
institution or servicer, as applicable, or the designated department 
official appeals the initial decision to the Secretary.
    (2)(i) A party may appeal the hearing official's initial decision by 
submitting to the Secretary, within 30 days after the party receives the 
initial decision, a brief or other written statement that explains why 
the party believes that the Secretary should reverse or modify the 
decision of the hearing official.
    (ii) At the time the party files its appeal submission, the party 
shall provide a copy of that submission to the opposing party.
    (iii) The opposing party shall submit its brief or other responsive 
statement to the Secretary, with a copy to the appellant, within 30 days 
after the opposing party receives the appellant's brief or written 
statement.
    (iv) The appealing party may submit proposed findings of fact or 
conclusions of law. However, the proposed findings of fact must be 
supported by--
    (A) The evidence introduced into the record at the hearing;
    (B) Stipulations of the parties if the hearing consisted of written 
submissions; or
    (C) Matters that may be judicially noticed.
    (v) Neither party may introduce new evidence on appeal.
    (vi) The initial decision of the hearing official imposing a fine or 
limiting or terminating the institution's participation or servicer's 
eligibility does not take effect pending the appeal.
    (vii) The Secretary renders a final decision. The Secretary may 
delegate to a designated department official the functions described in 
paragraph (c)(2) (vii) through (ix) of this section.
    (viii) In rendering a final decision, the Secretary considers only 
evidence introduced into the record at the hearing and facts agreed to 
by the parties if the hearing consisted only of written submissions and 
matters that may be judicially noticed.
    (ix) If the hearing official finds that a termination is warranted 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary may affirm, 
modify, or reverse the initial decision, or may remand the case to the 
hearing official for further proceedings consistent with the Secretary's 
decision. If the Secretary affirms the initial decision without issuing 
a statement of reasons, the Secretary adopts the opinion of the hearing 
official as the decision of the Secretary. If the Secretary modifies, 
remands, or reverses the initial decision, in whole or in part, the 
Secretary's decision states the reasons for the action taken.

previously and had failed to make the appropriate corrections to the 
system; and
    (ii) The financial loss of Title IV, HEA program funds was

Sec. 668.98  Interlocutory appeals to the Secretary from rulings of a hearing official.

    (a) A ruling by a hearing official may not be appealed to the 
Secretary until the issuance of an initial decision, except that the 
Secretary may, at any time prior to the issuance of the initial 
decision, grant a review of a ruling upon either a certification by a 
hearing official of the ruling to the Secretary for review or the filing 
of a petition for review of a ruling by one or both of the parties, if--
    (1) That ruling involves a controlling question of substantive or 
procedural law; and
    (2) The immediate resolution of the question will materially advance 
the final disposition of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an 
inadequate remedy.
    (b)(1) A petition for interlocutory review of an interim ruling must 
include the following:
    (i) A brief statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of 
the issue on which review is sought.
    (ii) A statement of the issue.
    (iii) A statement of the reasons showing that the ruling complained 
of involves a controlling question of substantive or procedural law and 
why immediate review of the ruling will materially advance the 
disposition of the case, or why subsequent review will be an inadequate 
remedy.
    (2) A petition may not exceed ten pages, double-spaced, and must be 
filed with a copy of the ruling and any findings and opinions relating 
to the ruling.
    (c) A copy of the petition must be provided to the hearing official 
at the time of filing with the secretary, and a copy of a petition or

the hearing official. A copy of the statement must be served on all 
parties by certified mail, return receipt requested.

official has certified or stated to the Secretary that review of the 
ruling is appropriate. The Secretary may order a stay of proceedings at 
any time after the filing of a request for interlocutory review.
    (g) The Secretary notifies the parties if a petition or

permanent residents of the United States or in the United States for 
other than a temporary purpose with the intention of becoming citizens 
or permanent residents.
    (b) Student responsibility. At the request of the Secretary or the

criteria and requirements for test approval, the Secretary notifies the 
test publisher of the Secretary's decision, and the reasons why the test 
did not meet those criteria and requirements.
    (3) The test publisher may request that the Secretary reevaluate the 
Secretary's decision. Such a request must be accompanied by--

years from the date of the Secretary's written notice to the test 
publisher.

review and approval under Sec. 668.144 at least six months before the 
date on which the test approval is scheduled to expire;
    (e) The approval of a test may be withdrawn if the Secretary 
determines that the publisher violated any terms of the agreement 
described in Sec. 668.150, or that the information the publisher 
submitted as a basis for approval of the test was inaccurate;
    (f) If the Secretary revokes approval of a previously approved test, 
the Secretary publishes a notice of that revocation in the Federal 
Register. The revocation becomes effective 120 days from the date the

Sec. 668.149  Special provisions for the approval of assessment procedures for special populations for whom no tests are reasonably available.

    If no test is reasonably available for persons with disabilities or 
students whose native language is not English and who are not fluent in 
English, so that no test can be approved under Secs. 668.146 or 668.148 
for these students, the following procedures apply:
    (a) Persons with disabilities. (1) The Secretary considers a 
modified test or testing procedure, or instrument that has been 
scientifically developed specifically for the purpose of evaluating the 
ability to benefit from postsecondary training or education of disabled 
students to be an approved test for purposes of this subpart provided 
that the testing procedure or instrument measures both basic verbal and 
quantitative skills at the secondary school level.
    (2) The Secretary considers the passing scores for these testing 
procedures or instruments to be those recommended by the test developer, 
provided that the test administrator--
    (i) Uses those procedures or instruments;
    (ii) Maintains appropriate documentation, including a description of 
the procedures or instruments, their content domains, technical 
properties, and scoring procedures; and
    (iii) Observes recommended passing scores.

considers a test in a student's native language for a student whose 
native language is not English to be an approved test under this subpart 
if--
    (1) The Secretary has not approved any test in that native language;
    (2) The test was not previously rejected for approval by the 
Secretary;
    (3) The test measures both basic verbal and quantitative skills at 
the secondary school level; and

Sec. 668.150  Agreement between the Secretary and a test publisher.

    (a) If the Secretary approves a test under this subpart, the test 
publisher must enter into an agreement with the Secretary that contains 
the provisions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section before an 
institution may use the test to determine a student's eligibility for 
Title IV, HEA program funds.
    (b) The agreement between a test publisher and the Secretary 
provides that the test publisher shall--
    (1) Allow only test administrators that it certifies to give its 
test;
    (2) Certify test administrators who have--
    (i) The necessary training, knowledge, and skill to test students in 
accordance with the test publisher's testing requirements; and
    (ii) The ability and facilities to keep its test secure against 
disclosure or release;
    (3) Decertify a test administrator for a period that coincides with 
the period for which the publisher's test is approved if the test 
publisher finds that the test administrator--
    (i) Has repeatedly failed to give its test in accordance with the 
publisher's instructions;
    (ii) Has not kept the test secure;
    (iii) Has compromised the integrity of the testing process; or
    (iv) Has given the test in violation of the provisions contained in 
Sec. 668.151;
    (4) Score a test answer sheet that it receives from a test 
administrator;
    (5) If a computer-based test, provide the test administrator with 
software that will:
    (i) Immediately generate a score report for each test taker;
    (ii) Allow the test administrator to send to the test publisher a 
secure write-protected diskette copy of the test taker's performance on 
each test item and the test taker's test scores; and
    (iii) Prohibit any changes in test taker responses or test scores.
    (6) Promptly send to the student and the institution the student 
indicated he or she is attending or scheduled to attend a notice stating 
the student's score for the test and whether or not the student passed 
the test;
    (7) Keep for a period of three years each test answer sheet or 
electronic record forwarded for scoring and all other documents 
forwarded by the test administrator with regard to the test;
    (8) Three years after the date the Secretary approves the test and 
for each subsequent three-year period, analyze the test scores of 
students to determine whether the test scores produce any irregular 
pattern that raises an inference that the tests were not being properly 
administered, and provide the Secretary with a copy of this analysis; 
and
    (9) Upon request, give the Secretary, a guaranty agency, or an 
accrediting agency access to test records or other documents related to 
an audit, investigation, or program review of the institution, test 
publisher, or test administrator.
    (c)(1) The Secretary may terminate an agreement with a test 
publisher if the test publisher fails to carry out the terms of the 
agreement described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Before terminating the agreement, the Secretary gives the test 
publisher the opportunity to show that it has not failed to carry out 
the terms of its agreement.
    (3) If the Secretary terminates an agreement with a test publisher 
under this section, the Secretary notifies institutions through 
publication in the Federal Register when they may no longer use the 
publisher's test(s) for purposes of determining a student's eligibility 
for Title IV, HEA program funds.

students it admits under that process without a high school diploma or 
its equivalent, who enroll in participating institutions have a success 
rate as determined under paragraph (h) of this section that is within 95 
percent of the success rate of students with high school diplomas; and
    (2) The State's process satisfies the requirements contained in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) A State process must require institutions participating in the 
process to provide each student they admit without a high school diploma 
or its recognized equivalent with the following services--

requirements, and student rights;
    (2) Assessment of each student's existing capabilities through means 
other than a single standardized test;
    (3) Tutoring in basic verbal and quantitative skills, if 
appropriate;
    (4) Assistance in developing educational goals;
    (5) Counseling, including counseling regarding the appropriate class 
level for that student given the student's individual's capabilities; 
and
    (6) Follow-up by teachers and counselors regarding the student's 
classroom performance and satisfactory progress toward program 
completion.
    (d) A State process must--
    (1) Monitor on an annual basis each participating institution's 
compliance with the requirements and standards contained in the State's 
process;
    (2) Require corrective action if an institution is found to be in 
noncompliance with the State process requirements; and
    (3) Terminate an institution from the State process if the 
institution refuses or fails to comply with the State process 
requirements.
    (e)(1) The Secretary responds to a State's request for approval of 
its State's process within six months after the Secretary's receipt of 
that request. If the Secretary does not respond by the end of six 
months, the State's process becomes effective.
    (2) An approved State process becomes effective for purposes of 
determining student eligibility for Title IV, HEA program funds under 
this subpart six months after the date on which the State submits the 
process to the Secretary for approval, if the Secretary approves, or 
does not disapprove, the process during that six month period.
    (f) The Secretary approves a State process for a period not to 
exceed five years.
    (g)(1) The Secretary withdraws approval of a State process if the 
Secretary determines that the State process violated any terms of this 
section or that the information that the State submitted as a basis for 
approval of the State process was inaccurate.
    (2) The Secretary provides a State with the opportunity to contest a 
finding that the State process violated any terms of this section or 
that the information that the State submitted as a basis for approval of 
the State process was inaccurate.

                       Subpart K--Cash Management

    Source: 61 FR 60603, Nov. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 668.161  Scope and purpose.

    (a) General. (1) This subpart establishes the rules and procedures 
under which a participating institution requests, maintains, disburses, 
and otherwise manages title IV, HEA program funds. This subpart is 
intended to--
    (i) Promote sound cash management of title IV, HEA program funds by 
an institution;
    (ii) Minimize the financing costs to the Federal government of 
making title IV, HEA program funds available to a student or an 
institution; and
    (iii) Minimize the costs that accrue to a student under a title IV, 
HEA loan program.
    (2) The rules and procedures that apply to an institution under this 
subpart also apply to a third-party servicer.
    (3) As used in this subpart--
    (i) The title IV, HEA programs include only the Federal Pell Grant, 
FSEOG, Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, Direct Loan, and FFEL programs;
    (ii) The term ``parent'' means a parent borrower under the PLUS 
programs;
    (iii) With regard to the FFEL Programs, the term ``disburse'' means 
the same as deliver loan proceeds under 34 CFR Part 682 of the FFEL 
Program regulations; and
    (iv) A day is a calendar day unless otherwise specified.
    (4) FWS Program. An institution must follow the disbursement 
procedures in 34 CFR 675.16 for paying a student his or her wages under 
the FWS Program instead of the disbursement procedures and requirements 
under this subpart.
    (b) Federal interest in title IV, HEA program funds. Except for 
funds received by an institution for administrative expenses and for 
funds used for the Job Location and Development Program under the FWS 
Programs, funds received by an institution under the title IV, HEA 
programs are held in trust for the intended student beneficiaries and 
the Secretary. FFEL program funds are also held in trust for the lenders 
and guaranty agencies, in addition to the student beneficiaries and the 
Secretary, under 34 CFR 682.207. The institution, as a trustee of 
Federal funds, may not use or hypothecate (i.e., use as collateral) 
title IV, HEA program funds for any other purpose.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1094)


<R05>
Sec. 668.162  Requesting funds.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary has sole discretion to determine the 
method

[[Page 495]]

under which the Secretary provides title IV, HEA program funds to an 
institution. In accordance with procedures established by the Secretary, 
the Secretary may provide funds to an institution in advance of the 
institution's need for those funds (advance payment method), by the date 
the institution needs those funds (just-in-time payment method), or by 
reimbursing an institution for disbursements already made to eligible 
students and parents (reimbursement payment method).
    (2) Each time an institution requests funds from the Secretary, the 
institution must identify the amount of funds requested by program and 
fiscal year designation that the Secretary assigned to the authorization 
for those funds.
    (b) Advance payment method. Under the advance payment method--
    (1) An institution submits a request for funds to the Secretary. The 
institution's request for funds may not exceed the amount of funds the 
institution needs immediately for disbursements the institution has made 
or will make to eligible students and parents;
    (2) If the Secretary accepts that request, the Secretary initiates 
an electronic funds transfer (EFT) of that amount to a bank account 
designated by the institution; and
    (3) The institution must disburse the funds requested as soon as 
administratively feasible but no later than three business days 
following the date the institution received those funds.
    (c) Just-in-time payment method. Under the just-in-time payment 
method--
    (1) For each student or parent that an institution determines is 
eligible for title IV, HEA program funds, the institution transmits 
electronically to the Secretary, within a timeframe established by the 
Secretary, records that contain program award information for that 
student or parent. As part of those records, the institution reports the 
date and amount of the disbursements that it will make or has made to 
that student or that student's parent;
    (2) For each record the Secretary accepts for a student or parent, 
the Secretary provides by EFT the corresponding disbursement amount to 
the institution on or before the date reported by the institution for 
that disbursement;
    (3) When the institution receives the funds for each record accepted 
by the Secretary, the institution may disburse those funds based on its 
determination at the time the institution transmitted that record to the 
Secretary that the student is eligible for that disbursement; and
    (4) The institution must report any adjustment to a previously 
accepted record within the time established by the Secretary in a notice 
published in the Federal Register.
    (d) Reimbursement payment method. Under the reimbursement payment 
method--
    (1) An institution must first make disbursements to students and 
parents for the amount of funds those students and parents are eligible 
to receive under the Federal Pell Grant, Direct Loan, and campus-based 
programs before the institution may seek reimbursement from the 
Secretary for those disbursements. The Secretary considers an 
institution to have made a disbursement if the institution has either 
credited a student's account or paid a student or parent directly with 
its own funds;
    (2) An institution seeks reimbursement by submitting to the 
Secretary a request for funds that does not exceed the amount of the 
actual disbursements the institution has made to students and parents 
included in that request;
    (3) As part of the institution's reimbursement request, the 
Secretary requires the institution to--
    (i) Identify the students for whom reimbursement is sought; and
    (ii) Submit to the Secretary or entity approved by the Secretary 
documentation that shows that each student and parent included in the 
request was eligible to receive and has received the title IV, HEA 
program funds for which reimbursement is sought; and
    (4) The Secretary approves the amount of the institution's 
reimbursement request for a student or parent and pays the institution 
that amount, if the Secretary determines with regard to that student or 
parent that the institution--

[[Page 496]]

    (i) Accurately determined the student's eligibility for title IV, 
HEA program funds;
    (ii) Accurately determined the amount of title IV, HEA program funds 
paid to the student or parent; and
    (iii) Submitted the documentation required under paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section.

Sec. 668.163  Maintaining and accounting for funds.

    (a)(1) Bank or investment account. An institution must maintain 
title IV, HEA program funds in a bank or investment account that is 
Federally insured or secured by collateral of value reasonably 
equivalent to the amount of those funds.
    (2) For each bank or investment account that includes title IV, HEA 
program funds, an institution must clearly identify that title IV, HEA 
program funds are maintained in that account by--
    (i) Including in the name of each account the phrase ``Federal 
Funds''; or
    (ii)(A) Notifying the bank or investment company of the accounts 
that contain title IV, HEA program funds and retaining a record of that 
notice; and
    (B) Except for a public institution, filing with the appropriate 
State or municipal government entity a UCC-1 statement disclosing that 
the account contains Federal funds and maintaining a copy of that 
statement.
    (b) Separate bank account. The Secretary may require an institution 
to maintain title IV, HEA program funds in a separate bank or investment 
account that contains no other funds if the Secretary determines that 
the institution failed to comply with--
    (1) The requirements in this subpart;
    (2) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements in subpart B of 
this part; or
    (3) Applicable program regulations.
    (c) Interest-bearing or investment account. (1) An institution must 
maintain the Fund described in Sec. 674.8(a) of the Federal Perkins Loan 
Program regulations in an interest-bearing bank account or investment 
account consisting predominately of low-risk, income-producing 
securities, such as obligations issued or guaranteed by the United 
States. Interest or income earned on Fund proceeds are retained by the 
institution as part of the Fund.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an 
institution must maintain Direct Loan, Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and 
FWS program funds in an interest-bearing bank account or an investment 
account as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) An institution does not have to maintain Direct Loan, Federal 
Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS program funds in an interest-bearing bank 
account or an investment account for an award year if--
    (i) The institution drew down less than a total of $3 million of 
those funds in the prior award year and anticipates that it will not 
draw down more than that amount in the current award year;
    (ii) The institution demonstrates by its cash management practices 
that it will not earn over $250 on those funds during the award year; or
    (iii) The institution requests those funds from the Secretary under 
the just-in-time payment method.
    (4) If an institution maintains Direct Loan, Federal Pell Grant, 
FSEOG, and FWS program funds in an interest-bearing or investment 
account, the institution may keep the initial $250 it earns on those 
funds during an award year. By June 30 of that award year, the 
institution must remit to the Secretary any earnings over $250.
    (d) Accounting and internal control systems and financial records. 
(1) An institution must maintain accounting and internal control systems 
that--
    (i) Identify the cash balance of the funds of each title IV, HEA 
program that are included in the institution's bank or investment 
account as readily as if those program funds were maintained in a 
separate account; and
    (ii) Identify the earnings on title IV, HEA program funds maintained 
in the institution's bank or investment account.
    (2) An institution must maintain its financial records in accordance 
with the provisions under Sec. 668.24.
    (e) Standard of conduct. An institution must exercise the level of 
care and diligence required of a fiduciary with

[[Page 497]]

regard to maintaining and investing title IV, HEA program funds.

<R05>
Sec. 668.164  Disbursing funds.

    (a) Disbursement. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, an institution makes a disbursement of title IV, HEA program 
funds on the date that the institution credits a student's account at 
the institution or pays a student or parent directly with--
    (i) Funds received from the Secretary;
    (ii) Funds received from a lender under the FFEL Programs; or
    (iii) Institutional funds used in advance of receiving title IV, HEA 
program funds.
    (2) If, earlier than 10 days before the first day of classes of a 
payment period, or for a student subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 682.604(c)(5) or Sec. 685.303(b)(4) earlier than 30 days after the 
first day of the payment period, an institution credits a student's 
institutional account with institutional funds in advance of receiving 
title IV, HEA program funds, the Secretary considers that the 
institution makes that disbursement on the 10th day before the first day 
of classes, or the 30th day after the beginning of the payment period 
for a student subject to the requirements of Sec. 682.604(c)(5) or 
Sec. 685.303(b)(4).
    (b) Disbursements by payment period. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an institution must disburse title IV, 
HEA program funds on a payment period basis. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section, an institution may disburse title IV, HEA 
program funds to a student or parent for a payment period only if the 
student is enrolled for classes for that payment period and is eligible 
to receive those funds.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply 
to the disbursement of FWS Program funds.
    (3) For a student enrolled in an eligible program at an institution 
that measures academic progress in clock hours, in determining whether 
the student completes the clock hours in a payment period, an 
institution may include clock hours for which the student has an excused 
absence if--
    (i) The institution has a written policy that permits excused 
absences; and
    (ii) The number of excused absences under the written policy for 
purposes of this paragraph does not exceed the lesser of--
    (A) The policy on excused absences of the institution's accrediting 
agency or, if the institution has more than one accrediting agency, the 
agency designated under 34 CFR part 600.11(b);
    (B) The policy on excused absences of any State agency that licenses 
the institution or otherwise legally authorizes the institution to 
operate in the State; or
    (C) Ten percent of the clock hours in the payment period.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an ``excused 
absence'' is an absence that a student does not have to make up.
    (c) Direct payments. An institution pays a student or parent 
directly by--
    (1) Releasing to the student or parent a check provided by a lender 
to the institution under an FFEL Program;
    (2) Issuing a check or other instrument payable to and requiring the 
endorsement or certification of the student or parent. An institution 
issues a check by--

    (ii) Notifying the student or parent that the check is available for 
immediate pickup;
    (3) Initiating an electronic funds transfer (EFT) to a bank account 
designated by the student or parent; or
    (4) Dispensing cash for which an institution obtains a signed 
receipt from the student or parent.
    (d) Crediting a student's account at the institution.
    (1) Without obtaining the student's or parent's authorization under 
Sec. 668.165, an institution may use title IV, HEA program funds to 
credit a student's account at the institution to satisfy current charges 
for--
    (i) Tuition and fees;
    (ii) Board, if the student contracts with the institution for board; 
and
    (iii) Room, if the student contracts with the institution for room.

[[Page 498]]

    (2) After obtaining the appropriate authorization from a student or 
parent under Sec. 668.165, the institution may use title IV, HEA program 
funds to credit a student's account at the institution to satisfy--
    (i) Current charges that are in addition to the charges described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section that were incurred by the student at 
the institution for educationally related activities; and
    (ii) Minor prior award year charges if these charges are less than 
$100 or if the payment of these charges does not, and will not, prevent 
the student from paying his or her current educational costs.
    (3) If an institution disburses Direct Loan Program funds by 
crediting a student's account at the institution, the institution must 
first credit the student's account with those funds to pay for 
outstanding current and authorized charges.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph, current charges refers to 
charges assessed the student by the institution for--
    (i) The current award year; or
    (ii) The loan period for which an institution certified or 
originated a loan under the FFEL or Direct Loan programs.
    (e) Credit balances. Whenever an institution disburses title IV, HEA 
program funds by crediting a student's account and the total amount of 
all title IV, HEA program funds credited exceeds the amount of tuition 
and fees, room and board, and other authorized charges the institution 
assessed the student, the institution must pay the resulting credit 
balance directly to the student or parent as soon as possible but--
    (1) No later than 14 days after the balance occurred if the credit 
balance occurred after the first day of class of a payment period; or
    (2) No later than 14 days after the first day of class of a payment 
period if the credit balance occurred on or before the first day of 
class of that payment period.
    (f) Early disbursements. Except as provided under paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section--
    (1) If a student is enrolled in a credit-hour educational program 
that is offered in semester, trimester, or quarter academic terms, the 
earliest an institution may disburse title IV, HEA program funds to a 
student or parent for any payment period is 10 days before the first day 
of classes for a payment period.
    (2) If a student is enrolled in a credit-hour educational program 
that is not offered in semester, trimester, or quarter academic terms, 
or in a clock hour educational program the earliest an institution may 
disburse title IV, HEA program funds to a student or parent for any 
payment period is the later of--
    (i) Ten days before the first day of classes of the payment period; 
or
    (ii) The date the student completed the previous payment period for 
which he or she received title IV, HEA program funds, except that this 
provision does not apply to the payment of Direct Loan or FFEL program 
funds under the conditions described in 34 CFR 685.301 (b)(3)(ii), 
(b)(5), and (b)(6) and 34 CFR 682.604 (c)(6)(ii), (c)(7), and (c)(8), 
respectively.
    (3) The earliest an institution may disburse the initial installment 
of a loan under the Direct Loan or FFEL programs to a first-year, first-
time borrower as described in 34 CFR 682.604(c) and 34 CFR 685.303(b)(4) 
is 30 days after the first day of the student's program of study.
    (g) Late disbursements--(1) Ineligible students who may receive a 
late disbursement. An institution may make a late disbursement under 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if the student became ineligible 
solely because--
    (i) For purposes of the Direct Loan and FFEL programs, the student 
is no longer enrolled at the institution as at least a half-time student 
for the loan period; and
    (ii) For purposes of the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and Federal 
Perkins Loan programs, the student is no longer enrolled at the 
institution for the award year.
    (2) Conditions for late disbursements. An institution may disburse 
funds under a title IV, HEA program to an ineligible student and to the 
parent of an

[[Page 499]]

ineligible student as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if, 
before the date the student became ineligible--
    (i) The institution received a SAR from the student or an ISIR from 
the Secretary and the SAR or ISIR has an official expected family 
contribution calculated by the Secretary; and
    (ii)(A) For a Direct Loan Program loan, the institution created the 
electronic origination record for that loan. An institution may not make 
a late second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Subsidized or 
Direct Unsubsidized loan unless the student has graduated or 
successfully completed the period of enrollment for which the loan was 
intended;
    (B) For an FFEL Program loan, the institution certified an 
application for that loan. An institution may not make a late second or 
subsequent disbursement of a Stafford loan unless the student has 
graduated or successfully completed the period of enrollment for which 
the loan was intended;
    (C) For a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan, the student completed 
the first 30 days of his or her program of study if the student was a 
first-year, first-time borrower as described in 34 CFR 682.604(c)(5) or 
685.303(b)(4);
    (D) For a Federal Pell Grant Program award, the institution received 
a valid SAR from the student or a valid ISIR from the Secretary; and
    (E) For a Federal Perkins Loan Program loan or an FSEOG Program 
award, the student was awarded a loan or grant.
    (3) Making a late disbursement. If a student or a parent borrower 
qualifies for a late disbursement under paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of 
this section, the institution--
    (i) May make that late disbursement of title IV, HEA program funds 
only if the funds are used to pay for educational costs that the 
institution determines the student incurred for the period in which the 
student was enrolled and eligible; and
    (ii) Must make the late disbursement no later than 90 days after the 
date that student becomes ineligible under paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 668.165  Notices and authorizations.

    (a) Notices. (1) Before an institution disburses title IV, HEA 
program funds for any award year, the institution must notify a student

parent under Sec. 668.164(e).
    (2) In obtaining the student's or parent's authorization to perform 
an activity described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an 
institution--
    (i) May not require or coerce the student or parent to provide that

period during which the student is enrolled at the institution.
    (4)(i) If a student or parent modifies an authorization, the 
modification takes effect on the date the institution receives the 
modification notice.
    (ii) If a student or parent cancels an authorization to use title 
IV, HEA program funds to pay for authorized charges under

Sec. 668.166   Excess cash.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary considers excess cash to be any 
amount of title IV, HEA program funds, that an institution does not 
disburse to students or parents by the end of the third business day 
following the date the institution received those funds from the 
Secretary. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an 
institution must return promptly to the Secretary any amount of excess 
cash in its account or accounts.
    (2) The provisions in this section do not apply to the title IV, HEA 
program funds that an institution receives from

[[Page 501]]

the Secretary under the just-in-time payment method.
    (b) Excess cash tolerances. (1) If an institution draws down title 
IV, HEA program funds in excess of its immediate cash needs, the 
institution may maintain the excess cash balance in the account the 
institution established under Sec. 668.164 only if--
    (i) In the award year preceding that drawdown, the amount of that 
excess cash balance is less than--
    (A) For a period of peak enrollment at the institution during which 
that drawdown occurs, three percent of its total prior-year drawdowns; 
or
    (B) For any other period, one percent of its total prior-year 
drawdowns; and
    (ii) Within the next seven days, the institution eliminates its 
excess cash balance by disbursing title IV, HEA program funds to 
students or parents for at least the amount of that balance.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a period of peak enrollment at 
an institution occurs when at least 25 percent of the institution's 
students start classes during a given 30-day period. For any award year, 
an institution calculates the percentage of students who started classes 
during a given 30-day period by--
    (i) For the prior award year in which the 30-day period began, 
determining the number of students who started classes during that 
period;
    (ii) Determining the total number of students who started classes 
during the entire award year used in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section;
    (iii) Dividing the number of students in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section by the number of students in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section; and
    (iv) Multiplying the result obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section by 100.
    (3) For the purpose of determining the total amount of title IV, HEA 
program funds under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an institution 
that participates in the Direct Loan Program may include, for the latest 
year for which the Secretary has complete data, the total amount of 
loans guaranteed under the FFEL Program for students attending the 
institution during that year.
    (c) Consequences for maintaining excess cash balances. (1) If the 
Secretary finds that an institution maintains in its account excess cash 
balances greater than those allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Secretary--
    (i) As provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, requires the 
institution to reimburse the Secretary for the costs the Secretary deems 
to have incurred in making those excess funds available to the 
institution; and
    (ii) May initiate a proceeding to fine, limit, suspend, or terminate 
the institution's participation in one or more title IV, HEA programs 
under subpart G of this part.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, upon a finding that an 
institution has maintained excess cash, the Secretary--
    (i) Considers the institution to have issued a check on the date 
that the check cleared the institution's bank account, unless the 
institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it 
issued the check shortly after the institution wrote the check; and
    (ii) Calculates, or requires the institution to calculate, a 
liability for maintaining excess cash balances in accordance with 
procedures established by the Secretary. Under those procedures, the 
Secretary assesses a liability that is equal to the difference between 
the earnings that the excess cash balances would have yielded if 
invested under the applicable current value of funds rate and the actual 
interest earned on those balances. The current value of funds rate is an 
annual percentage rate, published in a Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 
bulletin, that reflects the current value of funds to the Department of 
Treasury based on certain investment rates. The current value of funds 
rate is computed each year by averaging investment rates for the 12-
month period ending every September. The TFM bulletin is published 
annually by the Department of Treasury. Each annual bulletin identifies 
the current value of funds rate and the effective date of that rate.

      Appendix B to Part 668--Standards for Audit of Governmental 
        Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions (GAO)

                    Part III Chapter 3--Independence

    (a) The Third general standard for governmental auditing is: In 
matters relating to the audit work, the audit organization and the 
individual auditors shall maintain an independent attitude.
    (b) This standard places upon the auditor and the audit organization 
the responsibility for maintaining sufficient independence so that their 
opinions, conclusions, judgments, and recommendations will be impartial. 
If the auditor is not sufficiently independent to produce unbiased 
opinions, conclusions, and judgments, he should state in a prominent 
place in the audit report his relationship with the organization or 
officials being audited.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    </SUP>1 If the auditor is not fully independent because he or she is 
an employee of the audited entity, it will be adequate disclosure to so 
indicate. If the auditor is a practicing certified public accountant, 
his or her conduct should be governed by the AICPA ``Statements on 
Auditing Procedure.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The auditor should consider not only whether his or her own 
attitude and beliefs permit him or her to be independent but also 
whether there is anything about his or her situation which would lead 
others to question his or her independence. Both situations deserve 
consideration since it is important not only that the auditor be, in 
fact, independent and impartial but also that other persons will 
consider him or her so.
    (d) There are three general classes of impairments that the auditor 
needs to consider; these are personal, external, and organizational 
impairments. If one or more of these are of such significance as to 
affect the auditor's ability to perform his or her work and report its 
results impartially, he or she should decline to perform the audit or 
indicate in the report that he or she was not fully independent.

                          Personal Impairments

    There are some circumstances in which an auditor cannot be impartial 
because of his or her views or his or her personal situation. These 
circumstances might include:
    1. Relationships of an official, professional, and/or personal 
nature that might cause the auditor to limit the extent or character of 
the inquiry, to limit disclosure, or to weaken his or her findings in 
any way.
    2. Preconceived ideas about the objectives or quality of a 
particular operation or personal likes or dislikes of individuals, 
groups, or objectives of a particular program.
    3. Previous involvement in a decisionmaking or management capacity 
in the operations of the governmental entity or program being audited.
    4. Biases and prejudices, including those induced by political or 
social convictions, which result from employment in or loyalty to a 
particular group, entity, or level of government.
    5. Actual or potential restrictive influence when the auditor 
performs preaudit work and subsequently performs a post audit.
    6. Financial interest, direct or indirect, in an organization or 
facility which is benefiting from the audited programs.

                          External Impairments

    External factors can restrict the audit or impinge on the auditor's 
ability to form independent and objective opinions and conclusions. For 
example, under the following conditions either the audit itself could be 
adversely affected or the auditor would not have complete freedom to 
make an independent judgment.<SUP>2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    </SUP>2 Some of these situations may constitute justifiable 
limitations on the scope of the work. In such cases the limitation 
should be identified in the auditor's report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Interference or other influence that improperly or imprudently 
eliminates, restricts, or modifies the scope or character of the audit.
    2. Interference with the selection or application of audit 
procedures of the selection of activities to be examined.
    3. Denial of access to such sources of information as books, 
records, and supporting documents or denial or opportunity to obtain 
explanations by officials and employees of the governmental 
organization, program, or activity under audit.
    4. Interference in the assignment of personnel to the audit task.
    5. Retaliatory restrictions placed on funds or other resources 
dedicated to the audit operation.
    6. Activity to overrule or significantly influence the auditors 
judgment as to the appropriate content of the audit report.
    7. Influences that place the auditor's continued employment in 
jeopardy for reasons other than competency or the need for audit 
services.
    8. Unreasonable restriction on the time allowed to competently 
complete an audit assignment.

                       Organizational Impairments

    (a) The auditor's independence can be affected by his or her place 
within the organizational structure of governments. Auditors employed by 
Federal, State, or local government units may be subject to policy 
direction from superiors who are involved either

[[Page 507]]

directly or indirectly in the government management process. To achieve 
maximum independence such auditors and the audit organization itself not 
only should report to the highest practicable echelon within their 
government but should be organizationally located outside the line-
management function of the entity under audit.
    (b) These auditors should also be sufficiently removed from 
political pressures to ensure that they can conduct their auditing 
objectively and can report their conclusions completely without fear of 
censure. Whenever feasible they should be under a system which will 
place decisions on compensation, training, job tenure, and advancement 
on a merit basis.
    (c) When independent public accountants or other independent 
professionals are engaged to perform work that includes inquiries into 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, efficiency and economy 
of operations, or achievement of program results, they should be engaged 
by someone other than the officials responsible for the direction of the 
effort being audited. This practice removes the pressure that may result 
if the auditor must criticize the performance of those by whom he or she 
was engaged. To remove this obstacle to independence, governments should 
arrange to have auditors engaged by officials not directly involved in 
operations to be audited.

(51 FR 41921, Nov. 19, 1986)

Appendix C to Part 668--Appendix I, Standards for Audit of Governmental 
        Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions (GAO)

     Qualifications of Independent Auditors Engaged by Governmental 
                              Organizations

    (a) When outside auditors are engaged for assignments requiring the 
expression of an opinion on financial reports of governmental 
organizations, only fully qualified public accountants should be 
employed. The type of qualifications, as stated by the Comptroller 
General, deemed necessary for financial audits of governmental 
organizations and programs is quoted below:
    ``Such audits shall be conducted * * * by independent certified 
public accountants or by independent licensed public accountants, 
licensed on or before December 31, 1970, who are certified or licensed 
by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of 
the United States: Except that independent public accountants licensed 
to practice by such regulatory authority after December 31, 1970, and 
persons who although not so certified or licensed, meet, in the opinion 
of the Secretary, standards of education and experience representative 
of the highest prescribed by the licensing authorities of the several 
States which provide for the continuing licensing of public accountants 
and which are prescribed by the Secretary in appropriate regulations may 
perform such audits until December 31, 1975; Provided, That if the 
Secretary deems it necessary in the public interest, he may prescribe by 
regulations higher standard than those required for the practice of 
public accountancy by the regulatory authorities of the States.''<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    </SUP>1 Letter (B-148144, September 15, 1970) from the Comptroller 
General to the heads of Federal departments and agencies. The reference 
to ``Secretary'' means the head of the department or agency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The standards for examination and evaluation require 
consideration of applicable laws and regulations in the auditor's 
examination. The standards for reporting require a statement in the 
auditor's report regarding any significant instances of noncompliance 
disclosed by his or her examination and evaluation work. What is to be 
included in this statement requires judgment. Significant instances of 
noncompliance, even those not resulting in legal liability to the 
audited entity, should be included. Minor procedural noncompliance need 
not be disclosed.
    (c) Although the reporting standard is generally on an exception 
basis--that only noncompliance need be reported--it should be recognized 
that governmental entities often want positive statements regarding 
whether or not the auditor's tests disclosed instances of noncompliance. 
This is particularly true in grant programs where authorizing agencies 
frequently want assurance in the auditor's report that this matter has 
been considered. For such audits, auditors should obtain an 
understanding with the authorizing agency as to the extent to which such 
positive comments on compliance are desired. When coordinated audits are 
involved, the audit program should specify the extent of comments that 
the auditor is to make regarding compliance.
    (d) When noncompliance is reported, the auditor should place the 
findings in proper perspective. The extent of instances of noncompliance 
should be related to the number of cases examined to provide the reader 
with a basis for judging the prevalence of noncompliance.

           Appendix D to Part 668--Default Reduction Measures

    This appendix describes measures that an institution with a high 
default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs 
should find helpful in reducing defaults. An institution with a fiscal 
year default rate that exceeds the threshold rate for a limitation, 
suspension, or termination action under Sec. 668.17 may avoid that 
sanction

[[Page 508]]

by demonstrating that the institution has implemented the measures 
included in this appendix. Other institutions should strongly consider 
taking these steps as well.
    To reduce defaults, the Secretary recommends that the institution 
take the following measures:

               I. Measures to Reduce Defaults by Dropouts

    1. Revise admission policies and screening practices, consistent 
with applicable State law, to ensure that students enrolled in the 
institution, especially those admitted under ``ability to benefit'' 
criterion or those in need of substantial remedial work, have a 
reasonable expectation of succeeding in their programs of study.
    2. Improve the availability and effectiveness of academic counseling 
and other support services to decrease withdrawal rates, particularly 
with respect to academically high-risk students.
    3. In consultation with the cognizant accrediting body, attempt to 
reduce its withdrawal rate by improving its curricula, facilities, 
materials, equipment, qualifications and size of faculty, and other 
aspects of its educational program.
    4. Increase the frequency of reviews of in-school status of 
borrowers to ensure the institution's prompt recognition of instances in 
which borrowers withdraw without notice to the institution.
    5. Implement a compensation structure for commissioned enrollment 
representatives and salesmen under which a representative or salesman 
earns no more than a nominal commission for enrolling students that 
never attend school, and progressively greater commissions for students 
who remain in school for substantial periods.
    6. Implement a pro rata refund policy, as defined in 34 CFR 
682.606(b)(2) and (c).
    7. Delay certification of a first-time borrower's loan application, 
as described in 34 CFR 682.603(c).
    8. Except in the case of a program of study by correspondence, 
require each first-time student borrower to endorse the loan check at 
the institution, and pick up at the institution any loan proceeds 
remaining after deduction of institutional charges.

II. Measures to Reduce Defaults Related to Borrowers' Difficulty Finding 
                               Employment

    1. Expand its job placement program for its students by, for 
example, increasing contacts with local employers, counseling students 
in job search skills, and exploring with local employers the feasibility 
of establishing internship and cooperative education programs.
    2. In consultation with the cognizant accrediting body, attempt to 
improve its job placement rate and licensing examination pass rate by 
improving its curricula, facilities, materials, equipment, 
qualifications and size of faculty, and other aspects of its educational 
program.
    3. Establish a liaison for job information and placement assistance 
with the local office of the United States Employment Service and the 
Private Industry Council supported by the U.S. Department of Labor.

 III. Measures To Improve Borrowers' Understanding and Respect for the 
                        Loan Repayment Obligation

    1. In cooperation with the lender and in compliance with law, 
including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, if applicable, contact 
each borrower with respect to whom the lender has requested preclaims 
assistance from the guarantee agency to urge the borrower to repay the 
loan and to emphasize the consequences of default listed in item 
III.5(a)(3)(ii), below, by means of telephone contacts and letters sent 
``Forwarding and Address Correction Requested.''
    2. In cooperation with the lender and in compliance with law, 
including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, if applicable, contact 
a borrower during the grace period in order to--
    (i) Remind the borrower of the importance of the repayment 
obligation and of the consequences of default listed in item 
III.5(a)(3)(ii), below, by means of telephone contacts and letters sent 
``Forwarding and Address Correction Requested''; and
    (ii) Update the institution's records regarding the borrower's 
address, telephone number, employer, and employer's address.
    3. At the time of a borrower's admission to the institution, obtain 
information from the borrower regarding references and family members 
beyond those provided on the loan application, to enable the institution 
to provide the lender with a variety of ways to locate a borrower who 
later relocates without notifying the lender.
    4. Require an enrollment representative or salesman to explain 
carefully to a prospective student that, except in the case of a loan 
made or originated by the institution, the student's dissatisfaction 
with, or nonreceipt of, the educational services being offered by the 
institution does not excuse the borrower from repayment of any Stafford 
or SLS loan made to the borrower for enrollment at the institution.
    5. Conduct the following counseling activities in addition to those 
described in 34 CFR Part 682, Subpart F:
    (a) As part of the initial loan counseling provided to a Stafford 
Loan or SLS borrower--
    (1) Provide information to the borrower regarding, and through the 
use of a written test and intensive additional counseling for those who 
fail the test, ensure the borrower's comprehension of, the terms and 
conditions of Stafford and SLS loans, including--

[[Page 509]]

    (i) The stated interest rate on the borrower's loans;
    (ii) The applicable grace period provided to the borrower and the 
approximate date the first installment payment will be due;
    (iii) A description of the charges imposed for failure of the 
borrower to pay all or part of an installment payment when due; and
    (iv) A description of any charges that may be imposed as a 
consequence of default, such as liability for expenses reasonably 
incurred in attempts by the lender or guarantee agency to collect the 
loan, including attorney's fees;
    (2) Explain the borrower's rights and responsibilities in the 
Stafford Loan and SLS programs including--
    (i) The borrower's responsibility to inform his or her lender 
immediately of any change of name, address, telephone number, or Social 
Security number;
    (ii) The borrower's right to deferment, cancellation or postponement 
of repayment, and the procedures for obtaining those benefits;
    (iii) The borrower's responsibility to contact his or her lender in 
a timely manner, before the due date of any payment he or she cannot 
make; and
    (iv) The availability of forbearance under the circumstances and 
procedures described in 34 CFR Part 682;
    (3) Provide to the borrower--
    (i) (A) General information on the average indebtedness of student 
borrowers who have obtained Stafford Loan or SLS program loans for 
attendance at that institution and the average amount of a required 
monthly payment based on that indebtedness; or
    (B) The estimated balance owed by the borrower on Stafford and SLS 
loans, and the average amount of a required monthly payment based on 
that balance; and
    (ii) Detailed information regarding the consequences of the failure 
to repay the loan, including a damaged credit rating for at least 7 
years, loss of generous repayment schedule and deferment options, 
possible seizure of Federal and State income tax refunds due, exposure 
to civil suit, liability for collection costs, possible referral of the 
account to a collection agency, garnishment of wages if the borrower is 
a Federal employee, and loss of eligibility for further Federal Title IV 
student assistance.
    (4) Review the repayment options (e.g., loan consolidation, 
refinancing) available to the borrower;
    (5) Explain the sale of loans by lenders and the use by lenders of 
outside contractors to service loans; and
    (6) Provide general information on budgeting of living expenses and 
other aspects of personal financial management.
    (b) As part of the exit counseling provided to a Stafford Loan or 
SLS borrower--
    (1) Provide the counseling and testing described in paragraph (a) 
for the initial loan counseling;
    (2) Provide a sample loan repayment schedule based on the borrower's 
total loan indebtedness for attendance at that institution;
    (3) Provide the name and address of the borrower's lender(s) 
according to the institution's records;
    (4) Provide guidance on the preparation of correspondence to the 
borrower's lender(s) and completion of deferment forms; and
    (c) Obtain information from the borrower regarding the borrower's 
address, the address of the borrower's next-of-kin, and the name and 
address of the borrower's expected employer.
    6. Use available audio-visual materials, such as videos and films, 
to enhance the effectiveness of its initial and exit counseling.

                               IV. General

    1. Conduct an annual comprehensive self-evaluation of its 
administration of the Title IV programs to identify institutional 
practices that should be modified to reduce defaults, and then implement 
those modifications.

the HEA, respectively.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1070b-3 and 1087bb; 42 U.S.C. 2752)


<R05>
Sec. 673.4  Allocation and reallocation.

The Secretary allocates Federal capital contributions to institutions 
participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program in accordance with 
section 462 of the HEA.
    (2) The Secretary reallocates Federal capital contributions to

    (2) Payments to institutions. The Secretary allocates funds for a 
specific period of time. The Secretary provides an institution its 
allocation in accordance with the payment methods described in 34 CFR 
668.162.
    (3) Unexpended funds. (i) If an institution returns more than 10 
percent of its Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG allocation for an 
award year, the Secretary reduces the institution's allocation for that 
program for the second succeeding award year by the dollar amount 
returned.
    (ii) The Secretary may waive the provision of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of 
this section for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that 
enforcement would be contrary to the interests of the program.
    (iii) The Secretary considers enforcement of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of 
this section to be contrary to the interest of the program only if the 
institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation due to 
circumstances beyond the institution's control that are not expected to 
recur.
    (e) Anticipated collections of Federal Perkins Loan funds. (1) For 
the purposes of calculating an institution's share of any excess 
allocation of Federal Perkins Loan funds, an institution's anticipated 
collections are equal to the amount that was collected by the 
institution during the second year preceding the beginning of the award 
period multiplied by 1.21.
    (2) The Secretary may waive the provision of paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section for any institution that has a cohort default rate that 
does not exceed 7.5 percent.
    (f) Authority to expend FWS funds. Except as specifically provided 
in 34 CFR 675.18(b), (c), and (f), an institution may not use funds

in 34 CFR 668.164(g), an institution shall not use funds allocated or 
reallocated for an award year--

or
    (2) To satisfy any other obligation incurred after the end of the 
designated award year.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1070b-3 and 1087bb, 42 U.S.C. 2752)


<R05>
Sec. 673.5  Overaward.

    (a) Overaward prohibited--(1) Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG 
Programs. An institution may only award or disburse a Federal Perkins 
loan or an FSEOG to a student if that loan or the FSEOG, combined with 
the other resources the student receives, does not exceed the student's 
financial need.
    (2) FWS Program. An institution may only award FWS employment to a 
student if the award, combined with the other resources the student 
receives, does not exceed the student's financial need.
    (b) Awarding and disbursement. (1) When awarding and disbursing a 
Federal Perkins loan or an FSEOG or awarding FWS employment to a 
student, the institution shall take into account those resources it--
    (i) Can reasonably anticipate at the time it awards Federal Perkins 
Loan funds, an FSEOG, or FWS funds to the student;
    (ii) Makes available to its students; or
    (iii) Otherwise knows about.
    (2) If a student receives resources at any time during the award 
period that were not considered in calculating the Federal Perkins Loan 
amount or the FWS or FSEOG award, and the total resources including the 
loan, the FSEOG, or the prospective FWS wages exceed the student's need, 
the overaward is the amount that exceeds need.
    (c) Resources. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the Secretary considers that ``resources'' include, but are not 
limited to, any--
    (i) Funds a student is entitled to receive from a Federal Pell 
Grant;
    (ii) William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans;

[[Page 515]]

    (iii) Federal Family Education Loans;
    (iv) Long-term loans, including Federal Perkins loans made by the 
institution;
    (v) Grants, including FSEOGs, State grants, and ROTC subsistence 
allowances;
    (vi) Scholarships, including athletic scholarships and ROTC 
scholarships;
    (vii) Waivers of tuition and fees;
    (viii) Fellowships or assistantships;
    (ix) Veterans benefits;
    (x) Net earnings from need-based employment; and
    (xi) Insurance programs for the student's education.
    (2) The Secretary does not consider as a resource--
    (i) Any portion of the resources described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section that are included in the calculation of the student's 
expected family contribution (EFC); and
    (ii) Earnings from non-need-based employment.
    (3) The institution may treat a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, a Federal 
PLUS Loan, a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan, a Federal 
Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, or a State-sponsored or private loan as a 
substitute for a student's EFC. However, if the sum of the loan amounts 
received exceeds the student's EFC, the excess is a resource.
    (d) Treatment of resources in excess of need--General. An 
institution shall take the following steps if it learns that a student 
has received additional resources not included in the calculation of 
Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG eligibility that would result in the 
student's total resources exceeding his or her financial need by more 
than $300:
    (1) The institution shall decide whether the student has increased 
financial need that was unanticipated when it awarded financial aid to 
the student. If the student demonstrates increased financial need and 
the total resources do not exceed this increased need by more than $300, 
no further action is necessary.
    (2) If the student's total resources still exceed his or her need by 
more than $300, as recalculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, the institution shall cancel any undisbursed loan or grant 
(other than a Federal Pell Grant).
    (3) Federal Perkins loan and FSEOG overpayment. If the student's 
total resources still exceed his or her need by more than $300, after 
the institution takes the steps required in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of 
this section, the institution shall consider the amount by which the 
resources exceed the student's financial need by more than $300 as an 
overpayment.
    (e) Termination of FWS employment. (1) An institution may fund a 
student's FWS employment with FWS funds only until the amount of the FWS 
award has been earned or until the student's financial need, as 
recalculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, is met.
     (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, an institution may provide additional FWS funding to a student 
whose need has been met until that student's cumulative earnings from 
all need-based employment occurring subsequent to the time his or her 
financial need has been met exceed $300.
    (f) Liability for and recovery of Federal Perkins loans and FSEOG 
overpayments. (1) A student is liable for any Federal Perkins loan or 
FSEOG overpayment made to him or her.
    (2) The institution is also liable for a Federal Perkins loan or 
FSEOG overpayment if the overpayment occurred because the institution 
failed to follow the procedures in this part, 34 CFR Part 668, 34 CFR 
Part 674, or 34 CFR Part 676. The institution shall restore an amount 
equal to the overpayment and any administrative cost allowance claimed 
on that amount to its loan fund for a Federal Perkins loan overpayment 
or to its FSEOG account for an FSEOG overpayment if it cannot collect 
the overpayment from the student.
    (3) If an institution makes a Federal Perkins loan or FSEOG 
overpayment for which it is not liable, it shall help the Secretary 
recover the overpayment by promptly attempting to recover the 
overpayment by sending a written notice to the student requesting 
repayment of the overawarded funds. The notice must state that failure 
to make

[[Page 516]]

that repayment or to make arrangements, satisfactory to the holder of 
the overpayment debt, to pay the overpayment renders the student 
ineligible for further title IV aid until final resolution of the 
overpayment.
    (4) If a student objects to the institution's Federal Perkins loan 
or FSEOG overpayment determination on the grounds that it is erroneous, 
the institution shall consider any information provided by the student 
and determine whether the objection is warranted.
    (5) Referral of FSEOG overpayments. (i) If the student fails to 
repay an FSEOG overpayment or make arrangements, satisfactory to the 
holder of the overpayment debt, to pay the FSEOG overpayment after 
taking the action required by paragraph (f)(3) and, if applicable, 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section, and the Federal share of the FSEOG 
overpayment is $25.00 or more, the institution shall notify the 
Secretary, identifying the Federal share of the FSEOG overpayment, the 
student's name, most recent address, telephone number, and any other 
relevant information. After notifying the Secretary under this section, 
the institution need make no further recovery efforts of FSEOG 
overpayments.
    (ii) If an institution fails in its attempt to collect the 
overpayment and the Federal share of the FSEOG overpayment is less than 
$25.00, the institution need make no further recovery efforts of the 
FSEOG overpayment.

Sec. 673.6  Coordination with BIA grants.

    (a) Coordination of BIA grants with Federal Perkins loans, FWS 
awards, or FSEOGs. To determine the amount of a Federal Perkins loan, 
FWS compensation, or an FSEOG for a student who is also eligible for a 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) education grant, an institution shall 
prepare a package of student aid--
    (1) From resources other than the BIA education grant the student 
has received or is expected to receive; and
    (2) That is consistent in type and amount with packages prepared for 
students in similar circumstances who are not eligible for a BIA 
education grant.
    (b)(1) The BIA education grant, whether received by the student 
before or after the preparation of the student aid package, supplements 
the student aid package specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) No adjustment may be made to the student aid package as long as 
the total of the package and the BIA education grant is less than the 
institution's determination of that student's financial need.
    (c)(1) If the BIA education grant, when combined with other aid in 
the package, exceeds the student's need, the excess must be deducted 
from the other assistance (except for Federal Pell Grants), not from the 
BIA education grant.
    (2) The institution shall deduct the excess in the following 
sequence: loans, work-study awards, and grants other than Federal Pell 
Grants. However, the institution may change the sequence if requested to 
do so by a student and the institution believes the change benefits the 
student.
    (d) To determine the financial need of a student who is also 
eligible for a BIA education grant, a financial aid administrator is 
encouraged to consult with area officials in charge of BIA postsecondary 
financial aid.

provides FWS employment, or awards grants under the FSEOG Program to 
students in that year.
    (b) An institution may charge the administrative cost allowance 
calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for an award 
year against-(1) The Federal Perkins Loan Fund, if the institution 
advances funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program to students in 
that award year;
    (2) The FWS allocation, if the institution provides FWS employment 
to students in that award year; and

[[Page 517]]

    (3) The FSEOG allocation, if the institution awards grants to 
students under the FSEOG program in that award year.
    (c) For any award year, the amount of the administrative costs 
allowance equals--
    (1) Five percent of the first $2,750,000 of the institution's total 
expenditures to students in that award year under the FWS, FSEOG, and 
the Federal Perkins Loan programs; plus
    (2) Four percent of its expenditures to students that are greater 
than $2,750,000 but less than $5,500,000; plus
    (3) Three percent of its expenditures to students that are 
$5,500,000 or more.
    (d) The institution shall not include, when calculating the 
allowance in paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of loans made 
under the Federal Perkins Loan Program that it assigns during the award 
year to the Secretary under section 463(a)(6) of the HEA.
    (e) An institution shall use its administrative costs allowance to 
offset its cost of administering the Federal Pell Grant, FWS, FSEOG, and 
Federal Perkins Loan programs. Administrative costs also include the 
expenses incurred for carrying out the student consumer information 
services requirements of Subpart D of the Student Assistance General 
Provisions regulations, 34 CFR Part 668.
    (f) An institution may use up to 10 percent of the administrative 
costs allowance, as calculated under paragraph (c) of this section, that 
is attributable to the institution's expenditures under the FWS program 
to pay the administrative costs of conducting its program of community 
service. These costs may include the costs of--
    (1) Developing mechanisms to assure the academic quality of a 
student's experience;
    (2) Assuring student access to educational resources, expertise, and 
supervision necessary to achieve community service objectives; and
    (3) Collaborating with public and private nonprofit agencies and 
programs assisted under the National and Community Service Act of 1990 
in the planning, development, and administration of these programs.
    (g) If an institution charges any administrative cost allowance 
against its Federal Perkins Loan Fund, it must charge these costs during 
the same award year in which the expenditures for these costs were made.

Sec. Sec. 674.3-674.4 [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 674.5  Federal Perkins Loan program cohort default rate and penalties.

    (a) Default penalty. If an institution's cohort default rate meets 
the following levels, a default penalty is imposed on the institution as 
follows:
    (1) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 15 
percent, the institution must establish a default reduction plan in 
accordance with Sec. 674.6.
    (2) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 
percent, but is less than 25 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced 
by 10 percent.
    (3) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 
percent, but is less than 30 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced 
by 30 percent.
    (4) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30 
percent, the institution's FCC is reduced to zero.
    (b) Cohort default rate. (1) The term ``cohort default rate'' means, 
for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at 
the institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the 
institution, the percentage of those current and former students who 
enter repayment in that award year on the loans received for attendance 
at that institution who default before the end of the following award 
year.
    (2) In determining the number of students who default before the end 
of the following award year, the Secretary excludes any loans that, due 
to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or 
incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate.
    (3) For any award year in which less than 30 current and former 
students at the institution enter repayment on a loan received for 
attendance at the institution, the ``cohort default rate'' means the 
percentage of those current and former students who entered repayment on 
loans received for attendance at that institution in any of the three 
most recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end 
of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered 
repayment.
    (c) Defaulted loans to be included in the cohort default rate. For 
purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under paragraph (b) of 
this section--
    (1) A borrower must be included only if the borrower's default has 
persisted for at least--
    (i) 240 consecutive days for loans repayable in monthly 
installments; or
    (ii) 270 consecutive days for loans repayable in quarterly 
installments;
    (2) A loan is considered to be in default if a payment is made by 
the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, 
employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with the 
institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower;
    (3)(i) Any loan that is in default, but on which the borrower has 
made satisfactory arrangements to repay the

[[Page 521]]

loan, or any loan that has been rehabilitated before the end of the 
following award year is not considered to be in default for purposes of 
the cohort default rate calculation; and
    (ii) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more 
than one institution, the student and his or her subsequent repayment or 
default are attributed to the institution for attendance at which the 
student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year; and
    (4) Improper servicing or collection means the failure of the 
institution to comply with subpart C of this part.
    (d) Locations of the institution. (1) A cohort default rate of an 
institution applies to all locations of the institution as it exists on 
the first day of the award year for which the rate is calculated.
    (2) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations 
of the institution from the date the institution is notified of that 
rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the rate no 
longer applies.
    (3) For an institution that changes status from a location of one 
institution to a free-standing institution, the Secretary determines the 
cohort default rate based on the institution's status as of July 1 of 
the award year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated.
    (4)(i) For an institution that changes status from a free-standing 
institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary 
determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of 
students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the 
combined number of students who default during the applicable award 
years from both the former free-standing institution and the other 
institution. This cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated 
institution and all of its current locations.
    (ii) For free-standing institutions that merge, the Secretary 
determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of 
students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the 
combined number of students who default during the applicable award 
years from both of the institutions that are merging. This cohort 
default rate applies to the new, consolidated institution.
    (iii) For an institution that changes status from a location of one 
institution to a location of another institution, the Secretary 
determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of 
students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the 
number of students who default during the applicable award years from 
both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to the 
respective locations.
    (5) For an institution that has a change in ownership that results 
in a change in control, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during the 
applicable award year and the combined number of students who default 
during the applicable award years from the institution under both the 
old and new control.
    (e) Satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan. The Secretary 
considers that the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to repay 
the loan when the borrower has--
    (1) Paid the loan in full; or
    (2) Executed a new written repayment agreement; and
    (3) Made one payment each month for six consecutive months.
    (f) Loan rehabilitation. (1) The Secretary considers that the 
borrower has rehabilitated the loan when the borrower has--
    (i) Paid the loan in full; or
    (ii) Executed a new written repayment agreement; and
    (iii) Made one payment each month for 12 consecutive months.
    (2) Within 30 days of the date of the rehabilitation, the 
institution shall report the rehabilitation to any national credit 
bureau.

December 31 of the calendar year in which the cohort default rate was 
calculated--
    (1) A written description of the default reduction plan;
    (2) A statement indicating that the institution agrees to comply 
with the required measures in paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (3) For an institution that is participating in the Federal Family 
Education Loan Program and has in place a default reduction plan for

apply that plan to the Federal Perkins Loan program.
    (b) Required measures. The default reduction plan required under 
this section must include a description of the measures to be taken by 
the institution to reduce defaults. The institution shall explain how it 
plans to implement the following measures:
    (1) Revise admission policies and screening practices, consistent 
with applicable State law, to ensure that students enrolled in the 
institution, especially those who are not high school graduates or those 
who are in need of substantial remedial work, have a reasonable 
expectation of succeeding in their programs of study.
    (2) Improve the availability and effectiveness of academic 
counseling and other support services to decrease withdrawal rates, 
including--
    (i) Providing academic counseling and other support services to 
students on a regular basis, at a time and location that is convenient 
for the students involved;
    (ii) Publicizing the availability of the academic counseling and 
other support services;
    (iii) Establishing procedures to identify academically high-risk 
students and schedule those students for immediate counseling services; 
and
    (iv) Maintaining records identifying those students who receive 
academic counseling.
    (3) Attempt to reduce its withdrawal rate by conforming with that 
accrediting agency's standards of satisfactory progress and with those 
described in 34 CFR 668.14, and improving its curricula, facilities, 
materials, equipment, qualifications and size of faculty, and other 
aspects of its educational program in consultation with its academic 
accrediting agency.
    (4) Increase the frequency of reviews of in-school status of 
borrowers to ensure the institution's prompt recognition of instances in 
which borrowers withdraw without notice to the institution. Reviews must 
be conducted each month.
    (5) Expand its job placement program for its students by--
    (i)(A) Increasing contacts with local employers, counseling students 
in job search skills, and
    (B) Exploring with local employers the feasibility of establishing 
internship and cooperative education programs;
    (ii) Attempting to improve its job placement rate and licensing 
examination pass rate by improving its curricula, facilities, materials, 
equipment, qualifications and size of faculty, and other aspects of its 
educational program in consultation with the cognizant accrediting body; 
and
    (iii) Establishing a liaison for job information and placement 
assistance with the local office of the United States Employment Service 
and the Private Industry Council supported by the U.S. Department of 
Labor.
    (6) Remind the borrower of the importance of the repayment 
obligation and of the consequences of default and update the 
institution's records regarding the borrower's employer and employer's 
address as part of the contacts with the borrower under Sec. 674.42(b).
    (7) Obtain from the borrower at the time of a borrower's admission 
to the institution information regarding references and family members 
beyond those provided on the loan application to provide the institution 
or its agent with a variety of ways to locate a borrower who later 
relocates without notifying the institution.
    (8) Explain to a prospective student that the student's 
dissatisfaction with, or nonreceipt of, the educational services being 
offered by the institution does not excuse the borrower from repayment 
of any Federal Perkins Loan.
    (9) Use a written test and intensive additional counseling for those 
borrowers who fail the test to ensure the borrower's comprehension of 
the terms and conditions of the loan including

[[Page 523]]

those described in Secs. 674.16 and 674.42(a) as part of the initial 
loan counseling and the exit interview.
    (10) During the exit interview provided to a Federal Perkins Loan 
borrower--
    (i) Explain the use by institutions of outside contractors to 
service and collect loans;
    (ii) Provide general information on budgeting of living expenses and 
other aspects of personal financial management; and
    (iii) Provide guidance on the preparation of correspondence to the 
borrower's institution or agent and completion of deferment and 
cancellation forms.
    (11) Use available audio-visual materials such as videos and films 
to enhance the effectiveness of the initial and exit counseling.
    (12) Conduct an annual comprehensive self-evaluation of its 
administration of the title IV programs to identify institutional 
practices that should be modified to reduce defaults, and then implement 
those modifications.
    (13) Delay loan disbursements to first-time borrowers for 30 days 
after enrollment.
    (14) Require first-time borrowers to endorse their loan check at the 
institution and to pick up at the institution any loan proceeds 
remaining after deduction of institutional charges.

Sec. 674.9  Student eligibility.

    A student at an institution of higher education is eligible to

title IV of the HEA. A member of a religious order (an order, community, 
society, agency, or organization) who is pursuing a course of study at 
an institution of higher education is considered to have no financial 
need if that religious order-
    (1) Has as its primary objective the promotion of ideals and beliefs 
regarding a Supreme Being;

substantially beyond the support it provides; and
    (3) Directs the member to pursue the course of study or provides 
subsistence support to its members;

    (2) A preliminary determination of eligibility or ineligibility for 
a Federal Pell Grant by the institution's financial aid administrator 
after applying for a SAR with a Federal Pell Grant Processor;
    (e) Is willing to repay the loan. Failure to meet payment 
obligations on a previous loan is evidence that the student is unwilling 
to repay the loan;
    (f) Provides to the institution a driver's license number, if any, 
at the time of application for the loan;
    (g) Reaffirms any Federal Perkins, Direct, or Defense loan amount 
that previously was written off (if the amount of the write-off exceeded 
$25); and

due to total and permanent disability, obtains a certification from a 
physician that the borrower's condition has improved and that the 
borrower is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; and
    (2) Signs a statement acknowledging that any new Federal Perkins or 
Direct loan the borrower received cannot be canceled in the future on 
the basis of any present impairment, unless that condition substantially 
deteriorates.
    (i) For purposes of this section, reaffirmation means the 
acknowledgment of the loan by the borrower in a legally binding manner. 
The acknowledgement may include, but is not limited to, the borrower--
    (1) Signing a new promissory note or new repayment agreement; or
    (2) Making a payment on the loan.

total financial need of all students at the institution, the institution 
shall offer to those students

Sec. 674.33  Repayment.

    (a) Repayment Plan. 
    (1) The institution shall establish a repayment plan before the 
student ceases to be at least a half-time regular student.
    (2) If the last scheduled payment would be $25 or less the 
institution may combine it with the next-to-last repayment.
    (3) If the installment payment for all loans made to a borrower by 
an institution is not a multiple of $5, the institution may round that 
payment to the next highest dollar amount that is a multiple of $5.
    (4) The institution shall apply any payment on a loan in the 
following order:
    (i) Collection costs.
    (ii) Late charges.
    (iii) Accrued interest.
    (iv) Principal.
    (b) Minimum monthly repayment--(1) Minimum monthly repayment option. 
(i) An institution may require a borrower to pay a minimum monthly 
repayment if--
    (A) The promissory note includes a minimum monthly repayment 
provision specifying the amount of the minimum monthly repayment; and
    (B) The monthly repayment of principal and interest for a 10-year 
repayment period is less than the minimum monthly repayment; or
    (ii) An institution may require a borrower to pay a minimum monthly 
repayment if the borrower has received loans with different interest 
rates at the same institution and the total monthly repayment would 
otherwise be less than the minimum monthly repayment.
    (2) Minimum monthly repayment of loans from more than one 
institution. If a borrower has received loans from more than one 
institution, the following rules apply:
    (i) If the total of the monthly repayments is equal to at least the 
minimum monthly repayment, no institution

[[Page 533]]

may exercise a minimum monthly repayment option.
    (ii) If only one institution exercises the minimum monthly repayment 
option when the monthly repayment would otherwise be less than the 
minimum repayment option, that institution receives the difference 
between the minimum monthly repayment and the repayment owed to the 
other institution.
    (iii) If each institution exercises the minimum repayment option, 
the minimum monthly repayment must be divided among the institutions in 
proportion to the amount of principal advanced by each institution.
    (3) Minimum monthly repayment of both Defense and Direct or Federal 
Perkins loans from one or more institutions. If the total monthly 
repayment is less than $30 and the monthly repayment on a Defense loan 
is less than $15 a month, the amount attributed to the Defense loan may 
not exceed $15 a month.
    (4) Minimum monthly repayment of loans with differing grace periods 
and deferments. If the borrower has received loans with different grace 
periods and deferments, the institution shall treat each note 
separately, and the borrower shall pay the applicable minimum monthly 
payment for a loan that is not in the grace or deferment period.
    (5) Hardship. The institution may reduce the borrower's scheduled 
repayments for a period of not more than one year at a time if--
    (i) It determines that the borrower is unable to make the scheduled 
repayments due to hardship (see Sec. 674.33(c)); and
    (ii) The borrower's scheduled repayment is the minimum monthly 
repayment described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (6) Minimum monthly repayment rates. For the purposes of this 
section, the minimum monthly repayment rate is--
    (i) $15 for a Defense loan;
    (ii) $30 for a Federal Perkins loan made before October 1, 1992, or 
for a Federal Perkins loan made on or after October 1, 1992, to a 
borrower who, on the date the loan is made, has an outstanding balance 
of principal or interest owing on any loan made under this part; or
    (iii) $40 for a Federal Perkins loan made on or after October 1, 
1992, to a borrower who, on the date the loan is made, has no 
outstanding balance of principal or interest owing on any loan made 
under this part.
    (7) The institution shall determine the minimum repayment amount 
under paragraph (b) of this section for loans with repayment installment 
intervals greater than one month by multiplying the amounts in paragraph 
(b) of this section by the number of months in the installment interval.
    (c) Extension of repayment period--(1) Hardship. The institution may 
extend a borrower's repayment period due to prolonged illness or 
unemployment.
    (2) Low-income individual. (i) For Federal Perkins loans and Direct 
loans made on or after October 1, 1980, the institution may extend the 
borrower's repayment period up to 10 additional years beyond the 10-year 
maximum repayment period if the institution determines during the course 
of the repayment period that the borrower is a ``low-income 
individual.'' The borrower qualifies for an extension of the repayment 
period on the basis of low-income status only during the period in which 
the borrower meets the criteria described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) (A) or 
(B) of this section. The term low-income individual means the following:
    (A) For an unmarried borrower without dependents, an individual 
whose total income for the preceding calendar year did not exceed 45 
percent of the Income Protection Allowance for the current award year 
for a family of four with one in college.
    (B) For a borrower with a family that includes the borrower and any 
spouse or legal dependents, an individual whose total family income for 
the preceding calendar year did not exceed 125 percent of the Income 
Protection Allowance for the current award year for a family with one in 
college and equal in size to that of the borrower's family.
    (ii) The institution shall use the Income Protection Allowance 
published annually in accordance with section 478 of the HEA in making 
this determination.
    (iii) The institution shall review the borrower's status annually to 
determine whether the borrower continues

[[Page 534]]

to qualify for an extended repayment period based on his or her status 
as a ``low-income individual.''
    (iv) Upon determining that a borrower ceases to qualify for an 
extended repayment period under this section, the institution shall 
amend the borrower's repayment schedule. The term of the amended 
repayment schedule may not exceed the number of months remaining on the 
original repayment schedule, provided that the institution may not 
include the time elapsed during any extension of the repayment period 
granted under this section in determining the number of months remaining 
on the original repayment schedule.
    (3) Interest continues to accrue during any extension of a repayment 
period.
    (d) Forbearance. (1) Forbearance means the temporary cessation of 
payments, allowing an extension of time for making payments, or 
temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously were scheduled.
    (2) Upon receipt of a written request and supporting documentation, 
the institution shall grant the borrower forbearance of principal and, 
unless otherwise indicated by the borrower, interest renewable at 
intervals of up to 12 months for periods that collectively do not exceed 
three years.
    (3) The terms of forbearance must be agreed upon, in writing, by the 
borrower and the institution.
    (4) In granting a forbearance under this section, an institution 
shall grant a temporary cessation of payments, unless the borrower 
chooses another form of forbearance subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (5) An institution shall grant forbearance if--
    (i) The amount of the payments the borrower is obligated to make on 
title IV loans each month (or a proportional share if the payments are 
due less frequently than monthly) is collectively equal to or greater 
than 20 percent of the borrower's total monthly gross income;
    (ii) The institution determines that the borrower should qualify for 
the forbearance due to poor health or for other acceptable reasons; or
    (iii) The Secretary authorizes a period of forbearance due to a 
national military mobilization or other national emergency.
    (6) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower under paragraph 
(d)(5)(i) of this section, the institution shall require the borrower to 
submit at least the following documentation:
    (i) Evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly 
gross income received by the borrower; and
    (ii) Evidence showing the amount of the monthly payments owed by the 
borrower for the most recent month for the borrower's title IV loans.
    (7) Interest accrues during any period of forbearance.
    (e) Compromise of repayment. (1) An institution may compromise on 
the repayment of a defaulted loan if--
    (i) The institution has fully complied with all due diligence 
requirements specified in subpart C of this part; and
    (ii) The student borrower pays in a single lump-sum payment--
    (A) 90 percent of the outstanding principal balance on the loan 
under this part;
    (B) The interest due on the loan; and
    (C) Any collection fees due on the loan.
    (2) The Federal share of the compromise repayment must bear the same 
relation to the institution's share of the compromise repayment as the 
Federal capital contribution to the institution's loan Fund under this 
part bears to the institution's capital contribution to the Fund.

payments are due less frequently than monthly) that would have been owed 
on a federal postsecondary education loan if the loan had been scheduled 
to be repaid in 10 years from the date the borrower entered repayment, 
regardless of the length of the borrower's actual repayment schedule or 
the actual monthly payment amount (if any) that would be owed during the 
period that the borrower requested an economic hardship deferment.
    (f) To qualify for a deferment for study as part of a graduate

expected to end; and
    (C) Is structured in a way that requires a substantial commitment by 
the borrower to his or her rehabilitation. The Secretary considers a 
substantial commitment by the borrower to be a commitment of time and 
effort that would normally prevent an individual from engaging in full-
time employment either because of the number of hours that must be 
devoted to rehabilitation or because of the nature of the 
rehabilitation.
    (h) The institution may not include the deferment periods described 
in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section when 
determining the 10-year repayment period.
    (i) The borrower need not pay principal and interest does not accrue 
until

six months after completion of any period during which the borrower is 
in deferment under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this

Sec. 674.49  Bankruptcy of borrower.

    (a) General. If an institution receives notice that a borrower has 
filed a petition for relief in bankruptcy, usually by receiving a notice 
of meeting of creditors, the institution and its agents shall 
immediately suspend any collection efforts outside the bankruptcy 
proceeding against the borrower.
    (b) Proof of claim. The institution shall file a proof of claim in 
the bankruptcy proceeding, unless, in the case of a proceeding under 
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the notice of meeting of creditors 
states that the borrower has no assets.
    (c) Borrower's request for determination of dischargeability.
    (1) The institution shall follow the procedures in this paragraph if 
it is properly served with a complaint in a

[[Page 551]]

proceeding under chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, or 
under 11 U.S.C. 1328(b), for a determination of dischargeability under 
11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(B) on the ground that repayment of the loan would 
impose an undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents.
    (2) If more than seven years of the repayment period on the loan, 
excluding periods of deferment granted to the borrower, has passed 
before the borrower filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy, the 
institution may not oppose a determination of dischargeability requested 
under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(B) on the ground of undue hardship.
    (3) If less than seven years of the repayment period on the loan, 
excluding periods of deferment granted to the borrower, has passed 
before the borrower filed the petition for relief, the institution shall 
determine, on the basis of reasonably available information, whether 
repayment of the loan under either the current repayment schedule or any 
adjusted schedule authorized under subpart B or D of this part would 
impose an undue hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents.
    (4) If the institution concludes that repayment would not impose an 
undue hardship, the institution shall determine whether the costs 
reasonably expected to be incurred to oppose discharge will exceed one-
third of the total amount owed on the loan, including principal, 
interest, late charges and collection costs.
    (5) If the expected costs of opposing discharge of such a loan do 
not exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, the 
institution shall--
    (i) Oppose the borrower's request for a determination of 
dischargeability; and
    (ii) If the borrower is in default on the loan, seek a judgment for 
the amount owed on the loan.
    (6) In opposing a request for a determination of dischargeability, 
the institution may compromise a portion of the amount owed on the loan 
if it reasonably determines that the compromise is necessary in order to 
obtain a judgment on the loan.
    (d) Request for determination of non-dischargeability. The 
institution may file a complaint for a determination that a loan 
obligation is not dischargeable and for judgment on the loan if the 
institution would have been required under paragraph (c) of this section 
to oppose a request for a determination of dischargeability with regard 
to that loan.
    (e) Chapter 13 repayment plan. (1) The institution shall follow the 
procedures in this paragraph in response to a repayment plan proposed by 
a borrower who has filed for relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy 
Code.
    (2) The institution is not required to respond to a proposed 
repayment plan, if--
    (i) The borrower proposes under the repayment plan to repay all 
principal, interest, late charges and collection costs on the loan; or
    (ii) The repayment plan makes no provision with regard either to the 
loan obligation or to general unsecured claims.
    (3)(i) If the borrower proposes under the repayment plan to repay 
less than the total amount owed on the loan, the institution shall 
determine from its own records and court documents--
    (A) The amount of the loan obligation dischargeable under the plan 
by deducting the total payments on the loan proposed under the plan from 
the total amount owed;
    (B) Whether the plan or the classification of the loan obligation 
under the proposed plan meets the requirements of section 1325 of the 
Code; and
    (C) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to move for 
conversion or dismissal of the chapter 13 case.
    (ii) If the institution reasonably expects that costs of the 
appropriate actions will not exceed one-third of the dischargeable loan 
debt, the institution shall--
    (A) Object to confirmation of a proposed plan that does not meet the 
requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1325; and
    (B) Move to dismiss or convert a case where grounds can be 
established under 11 U.S.C. 1307.
    (4)(i) The institution shall monitor the borrower's compliance with 
the requirements of the plan confirmed by the court. If the institution 
determines

[[Page 552]]

that the debtor has not made the payments required under the plan, or 
has filed a request for a ``hardship discharge'' under 11 U.S.C. 
1328(b), and the institution holds a loan that entered repayment status 
more than seven years, excluding periods of deferment, before the 
borrower filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy, the institution 
shall determine from its own records and information derived from 
documents filed with the court--
    (A) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1307 to convert or dismiss 
the case; and
    (B) Whether the borrower has demonstrated entitlement to the 
``hardship discharge'' by meeting the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1328(b).
    (ii) If the institution reasonably expects that costs of the 
appropriate actions, when added to the costs already incurred in taking 
actions authorized under this section, will not exceed one-third of the 
dischargeable loan debt, the institution shall--
    (A) Move to dismiss or convert a case where grounds can be 
established under 11 U.S.C. 1307; or
    (B) Oppose the requested discharge where the debtor has not 
demonstrated that the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1328(b) are met.
    (f) Resumption of collection from the borrower. The institution 
shall resume billing and collection action prescribed in this subpart 
after--
    (1) The borrower's petition for relief in bankruptcy has been 
dismissed;
    (2) The borrower has received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. 727, 11 
U.S.C. 1141, or 11 U.S.C. 1228, unless--
    (i) The court has found that repayment of the loan would impose an 
undue hardship on the borrower and the dependents of the borrower; or
    (ii)(A) The loan entered the repayment period more than seven years, 
excluding periods of deferment, before the filing of the petition; and
    (B) The loan is not excepted from discharge under other applicable 
provisions of the Code; or
    (3) The borrower has received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. 1328(a) or 
1328(b), unless--
    (i) The court has found that repayment of the loan would impose an 
undue hardship on the borrower and the dependents of the borrower; or
    (ii)(A) The loan entered the repayment period more than seven years, 
excluding periods of deferment, before the filing of the petition, and
    (B) The borrower's plan approved in the bankruptcy proceeding made 
some provision with regard to either the loan obligation or unsecured 
debts in general.
    (g) Termination of collection and write-off. (1) An institution 
shall terminate all collection action and write off a loan if it 
receives--
    (i) A general order of discharge on a borrower owing a student loan 
obligation which entered the repayment period more than seven years, 
exclusive of periods of deferment, from the date on which a petition for 
relief under chapter 7, 11 or 12 of the Bankruptcy Code was filed; or
    (ii) A judgment that repayment of the debt would constitute an undue 
hardship, and that the debt is therefore dischargeable.
    (iii) A judgment that repayment of the debt would constitute an 
undue hardship, and that the debt is therefore dischargeable.
    (2) If an institution receives a repayment from a borrower after a 
loan has been discharged, it shall deposit that payment in its Fund.

institution to demonstrate that the borrower meets the conditions for 
the cancellation requested.
    (b) Part-time employment. (1)(i) An institution may refuse a request 
for cancellation based on a claim of simultaneously teaching in two or

certifies that a teacher worked full-time for a full academic year.
    (ii) An institution may refuse a request for cancellation based on a 
claim of simultaneous employment as a nurse or medical technician in two

certifies that a nurse or medical technician worked full-time for a full 
year.

[[Page 556]]

                      Subpart A--Purpose and Scope


<R05>
Sec. 682.100  The Federal Family Education Loan programs.

    (a) This part governs the following four programs collectively 
referred to in these regulations as ``the Federal Family Education Loan 
(FFEL) programs,'' in which lenders use their own funds to make loans to 
enable a student or his or her parents to pay the costs of the student's 
attendance at postsecondary schools:
    (1) The Federal Stafford Loan (Stafford) Program, which encourages 
making loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.
    (2) The Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program, as in 
effect for periods of enrollment beginning prior to July 1, 1994, which 
encourages making loans to graduate, professional, independent 
undergraduate, and certain dependent undergraduate students.
    (3) The Federal PLUS (PLUS) Program, which encourages making loans 
to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Before October 17, 1986, 
the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to graduate, 
professional, and independent undergraduate students. Before July 1, 
1993, the PLUS Program also provided for making loans to parents of 
dependent graduate students.
    (4) The Federal Consolidation Loan Program (Consolidation Loan 
Program), which encourages making loans to borrowers for the purpose of 
consolidating their repayment obligations, with respect to loans 
received while they were students, under the Federal Insured Student 
Loan (FISL), Stafford loan, SLS, ALAS (as in effect before October 17, 
1986), PLUS, and Perkins Loan programs, the Health Professions Student 
Loan (HPSL) Program authorized by subpart II of part A of Title VII of 
the Public Health Services Act, Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) 
authorized by subpart I of Part A of Title VII of the Health Services 
Act, and Nursing Student Loan Program loans authorized by subpart II of 
part B of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act.
    (b)(1) Except for the loans guaranteed directly by the Secretary 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a guaranty agency 
guarantees a lender against losses due to default by the borrower on a 
FFEL loan. If the guaranty agency meets certain Federal requirements, 
the guaranty agency is reimbursed by the Secretary for all or part of 
the amount of default claims it pays to lenders.
    (2)(i) The Secretary guarantees lenders against losses--
    (A) Within the Stafford Loan Program, on loans made under Federal 
Insured Student Loan (FISL) Program;
    (B) Within the PLUS Program, on loans made under the Federal PLUS 
Program;
    (C) Within the SLS Program, on loans made under the Federal SLS 
Program; and
    (D) Within the Consolidation Loan Program, on loans made under the 
Federal Consolidation Loan Program.
    (ii) The loan programs listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section 
collectively are referred to in these regulations as the ``Federal 
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs.''
    (iii) The Federal GSL programs are authorized to operate in States 
not served by a guaranty agency program. In addition, the FISL and 
Federal SLS programs are authorized, under limited circumstances, to 
operate in States in which a guaranty agency program does not serve all 
eligible students.

Sec. 682.101  Participation in the FFEL programs.

    (a) Eligible banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, 
pension funds, insurance companies, schools, and State and private 
nonprofit agencies may make loans.
    (b) Eligible educational institutions, including most colleges,

technical, and correspondence schools may participate as schools, 
enabling an eligible student or his or her parents to obtain a loan to 
pay for the student's cost of education.
    (c) Students who meet certain requirements, including enrollment at 
a participating school, may borrow under the Stafford Loan and, prior to 
July 1,

[[Page 580]]

1994, the SLS program. Parents of eligible dependent undergraduate 
students may borrow under the PLUS Program. Borrowers with outstanding 
Stafford, SLS, FISL, Perkins, HPSL, HEAL, ALAS, PLUS, or Nursing Student 
Loan Program loans, or married couples each of whom have eligible loans 
under these programs may borrow under the Consolidation Loan Program.

<R05>
Sec. 682.102  Obtaining and repaying a loan.

    (a) Stafford loan application. Generally, to obtain a Stafford loan, 
a student completes an application and submits it to the school for 
certification. After the school certifies the application, the 
application is submitted to a participating lender. If the lender 
decides to make the loan, the lender obtains a loan guarantee from a 
guaranty agency or the Secretary.
    (b) SLS loan application. Generally, to obtain an SLS loan, a 
student completes an application and submits it to the school for 
certification. After the school certifies the application, the 
application is submitted to a participating lender. If the lender 
decides to make the loan, the lender obtains a loan guarantee from a 
guaranty agency or the Secretary.
    (c) PLUS loan application. Generally, to obtain a PLUS loan, both 
the student and the parent complete an application and submit it to the 
school for certification. After the school certifies the application, 
the application is submitted to a participating lender. If the lender 
decides to make the loan, the lender obtains a loan guarantee from a 
guaranty agency or the Secretary.
    (d) Consolidation loan application. Generally, to obtain a 
Consolidation loan, a borrower completes an application and submits it 
to a lender holding at least one of the borrower's loans to be 
consolidated. If all the holders of loans selected for consolidation by 
the borrower refuse to make a Consolidation loan, the borrower may 
submit the application to any other lender participating in the 
Consolidation Loan Program. In the case of a married couple seeking a 
Consolidation loan, only the holders for one of the applicants must be 
contacted for consolidation. In the case of a married couple seeking a 
Consolidation loan, only the holders for one of the applicants must be 
contacted for consolidation. If a lender decides to make the loan, the 
lender obtains a loan guarantee from a guaranty agency or the Secretary.
    (e) Repaying a loan--(1) General. Generally, the borrower is 
obligated to repay the full amount of the loan, late fees, collection 
costs chargeable to the borrower, and any interest not payable by the 
Secretary. The borrower's obligation to repay is cancelled if the 
borrower dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, or has that 
obligation discharged in bankruptcy. The borrower's obligation to repay 
a PLUS loan is cancelled if the student, on whose behalf the parent 
borrowed, dies. The borrower's obligation to repay all or a portion of 
his or her loan may be cancelled if the borrower is unable to complete 
his or her program of study because the school closed or the borrower's 
eligibility to borrow was falsely certified by the school. The 
obligation to repay all or a portion of a loan may be forgiven for 
borrowers who enter certain areas of the teaching or nursing professions 
or perform certain kinds of national or community service.
    (2) Stafford loan repayment. Generally, a borrower is not required 
to make any principal payments on a Stafford loan during the time the 
borrower is in school. In most cases, the Secretary pays the interest on 
the borrower's behalf during the time the borrower is in school. When 
the borrower ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, a 
grace period begins during which no principal payments are required, and 
the Secretary continues to make interest payments on the borrower's 
behalf. At the end of the grace period, the repayment period begins. 
During the repayment period, the borrower pays both the principal and 
the interest accruing on the loan.
    (3) SLS loan repayment. Generally, the repayment period for an SLS 
loan begins immediately on the day of the last disbursement of the loan 
proceeds by the lender. The first payment of principal and interest on 
an SLS loan is due from the borrower within 60 days

[[Page 581]]

after the loan is fully disbursed unless a borrower who is also a 
Stafford loan borrower, but who has not yet entered repayment on the 
Stafford loan, requests that commencement of repayment on the SLS loan 
be deferred until the borrower's grace period on the Stafford loan 
expires.
    (4) PLUS loan repayment. Generally, the repayment period for a PLUS 
loan begins on the day the loan is disbursed by the lender. The first 
payment of principal and interest on a PLUS loan is due from the 
borrower within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed.
    (5) Consolidation loan repayment. Generally, the repayment period 
for a Consolidation loan begins on the day the loan is disbursed. The 
first payment of principal and interest on a Consolidation loan is due 
from the borrower within 60 days after the borrower's liability on all 
loans being consolidated has been discharged.
    (6) Deferment of repayment. Repayment of principal on a FFEL program 
loan may be deferred under the circumstances described in Sec. 682.210.
    (7) Default. If a borrower defaults on a loan, the guarantor 
reimburses the lender for the amount of its loss. The guarantor then 
collects the amount owed from the borrower.

capacity that involves the administration or receipt of FFEL Program 
funds.
    National credit bureau. A credit bureau with a service area that 
encompasses more than a single region of the country.
    Nonsubsidized Stafford loan. A Stafford loan made prior to October

school and a lender in which the lender delegates to the school, or to

to have ``originated'' a loan made by the lender.
    Origination fee. A fee that the lender is required to pay the 
Secretary to help defray the Secretary's costs of subsidizing the loan. 
The lender may pass this fee on to the Stafford loan borrower. The 
lender must pass this fee on to the SLS or PLUS borrower.

fide academic term established by the school for which institutional

enrollment is also referred to as the loan period.

[[Page 585]]

    Post-deferment grace period. For a loan made prior to October 1, 
1981, a single period of six consecutive months beginning on the day 
following the last day of an authorized deferment period.

day after the expiration of the applicable grace period that follows 
after the student ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis 
and ending no later than 10 years from that date, exclusive of any 
period of deferment or forbearance. However, payments of interest are 
the responsibility of the borrower during the in-school and grace 
period, but may be capitalized by the lender.
    (3) For SLS loans, the period that begins on the date the loan is 
disbursed, or if the loan is disbursed in more than one installment, on 
the date the last disbursement is made and ending no later than 10 years 
from that date, exclusive of any period of deferment or forbearance. The 
first payment of principal is due within 60 days after the loan is fully 
disbursed unless a borrower who is also a Stafford loan borrower but 
who, has not yet entered repayment on the Stafford loan requests that 
commencement of repayment on the SLS loan be delayed until the 
borrower's grace period on the Stafford loan expires. Interest on the 
loan accrues and is due and payable from the date of the first

Consolidation loan, and the unpaid balance on other student loans, 
exclusive of any period of deferment or forbearance.
    Satisfactory repayment arrangement. (1) For purposes of regaining 
eligibility under section 428F(b) of the HEA, the making of six (6) 
consecutive voluntary full monthly payments on a defaulted loan. A 
borrower may only obtain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to 
renewed eligibility once.
    (2) For purposes of consolidating a defaulted loan under 34 CFR 
682.201(c)(1)(iii)(C), the making of three (3) consecutive voluntary 
full monthly payments on a defaulted loan.

reasonable and affordable based on the borrower's total financial 
circumstances. Voluntary payments are those payments made directly by

    (a) Student borrower. Except for a refinanced SLS/PLUS loan made 
under Sec. 682.209 (e) or (f), a student is eligible to receive a 
Stafford loan, and an independent undergraduate student, a graduate or 
professional student, or, subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a 
dependent undergraduate student, is eligible to receive an SLS loan, if

    (1) In the case of an undergraduate student who seeks a Stafford 
loan or SLS loan for the cost of attendance at a school that 
participates in the Pell Grant Program, has received a final 
determination, or, in the case of a student who has filed an application 
with the school for a Pell Grant, a preliminary determination, from the 
school of the student's eligibility or ineligibility for a Pell Grant 
and, if eligible, has applied for the period of enrollment for which the 
loan is sought;
    (2) In the case of any student who, for a period of enrollment that 
begins prior to July 1, 1994, seeks an SLS loan for the cost of 
attendance at a school that participates in the Stafford Loan Program, 
the student must have--

and if determined to have need in excess of $200, have filed an 
application with a lender for a subsidized Stafford loan;
    (ii) Filed an application with a lender for an unsubsidized Stafford 
loan up to the Stafford loan annual maximum unless the school declines 
to certify such an application under section 428(a)(2)(F) of the HEA;

file, after review of the family financial information provided by the 
student and consideration of the student's debt burden, that the 
student's parents likely will be precluded by exceptional circumstances 
(e.g., the student's parent receives only public assistance or 
disability benefits, is incarcerated, or his or her whereabouts are 
unknown) from borrowing under the PLUS Program and the student's family 
is otherwise unable to provide the student's expected family 
contribution. A parent's refusal to borrow a PLUS loan does not 
constitute an exceptional circumstance;
    (4)(i) Reaffirms any FFEL loan amount on which there has been a 
total cessation of collection activity, including all principal and 
interest that has accrued on that amount up to the date of 
reaffirmation.

    (A) Signing a new promissory note or repayment schedule; or
    (B) Making a payment on the loan.
    (5)(i) In the case of a borrower whose previous loan was canceled 
due to total and permanent disability, the student must--
    (A) Obtain a certification from a physician that the borrower is 
able to engage in substantial gainful activity; and

receives cannot be canceled in the future on the basis of any impairment 
present when the new loan is made, unless that impairment substantially 
deteriorates;
    (ii) Signs a statement acknowledging that any new FFEL loan the 
borrower receives cannot be cancelled in the future on the basis of any 
present impairment, unless that condition substantially deteriorates;
    (6) In the case of any student who seeks a loan but does not have a 
certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education or 
the recognized equivalent of such a certificate, the student meets the 
requirements under 34 CFR Part 668.7(b).
    (7) Is not serving in a medical internship or residency program, 
except for an internship in dentistry.
    (b) Parent borrower. (1) A parent borrower, is eligible to receive a 
PLUS

set forth in 34 CFR Part 668;

    (B) For purposes of this section, the lender must obtain a credit 
report on each applicant from at least one national credit bureau. The 
credit report must be secured within a timeframe that would ensure the 
most accurate, current representation of the borrower's credit history 
before the first day of the period of enrollment for which the loan is 
intended.
    (C) Unless the lender determines that extenuating circumstances 
existed, the lender must consider each applicant to have an adverse 
credit history based on the credit report if--
    (1) The applicant is considered 90 or more days delinquent on the 
repayment of a debt;
    (2) The applicant has been the subject of a default determination,

preceding the date of the credit report.
    (D) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the lender from establishing 
more restrictive credit standards to determine whether the applicant has 
an adverse credit history.
    (E) The absence of any credit history is not an indication that the 
applicant has an adverse credit history and is not to be used as a 
reason to deny a PLUS loan to that applicant.
    (F) The lender must retain documentation demonstrating its basis for 
determining that extenuating circumstances existed. This documentation 
may include, but is not limited to, an updated credit report, a 
statement from the creditor that the borrower has made satisfactory 
arrangements to repay the debt, or a satisfactory statement from the 
borrower explaining any delinquencies with outstanding balances of less 
than $500.

includes the individuals described in the definition of ``parent'' in 34

income and assets would have been taken into account when calculating a 
dependent student's expected family contribution.

    (B) Is in repayment status; or
    (C) In a default status and has either made satisfactory repayment

[[Page 589]]

    (v) Agrees to notify the holder of any changes in address; and

default on an FFEL Program loan, the borrower must have made 
satisfactory repayment arrangements.
    (4) A borrower's eligibility to receive a Consolidation loan 
terminates upon receipt of a Consolidation loan except--
    (i) With respect to student loans received after the date the 
Consolidation loan is made; or
    (ii) Eligible loans received prior to the date the Consolidation 
loan was made can be added to the Consolidation loan during the 180-day

paragraphs (a)(1)-(4) of this section.
    (6) Refund of excess interest paid on Stafford loans.
    (i) For a loan with an applicable interest rate of 10 percent made

of 10 percent made from July 23, 1992 through September 30, 1992, to a 
borrower with no outstanding FFEL Program loans--
    (A) If during any calendar quarter, the sum of the average of the 
bond equivalent rates of the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for that 
quarter, plus 3.25 percent, is less than 10 percent, the lender shall 
calculate an adjustment and credit the adjustment as specified under 
paragraph (a)(6)(i)(B) of this section if the borrower's account is not 
more than 30 days delinquent on December 31. The amount of the 
adjustment for a calendar quarter is equal to--
    (1) 10 percent minus the sum of the average of the bond equivalent 
rates of the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for the applicable quarter 
plus 3.25 percent;

(not including unearned interest added to principal); and

    (B) No later than 30 calendar days after the end of the calendar 
year, the holder of the loan shall credit any amounts computed under 
paragraph (a)(6)(i)(A) of this section to--

borrower is eligible for interest benefits;
    (2) The borrower's account to reduce the outstanding principal 
balance as of

[[Page 591]]

the date the holder adjusts the borrower's account, provided that the 
borrower's account was not more than 30 days delinquent on that December 
31; or
    (3) The Secretary, for a borrower who on the last day of the 
calendar year is delinquent for more than 30 days.
    (ii) For a fixed interest rate loan made on or after July 23, 1992 
to a borrower with an outstanding FFEL Program loan--
    (A) If during any calendar quarter, the sum of the average of the 
bond equivalent rates of the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for that 
quarter, plus 3.10 percent, is less than the applicable interest rate, 
the lender shall calculate an adjustment and credit the adjustment to 
reduce the outstanding principal balance of the loan as specified under 
paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(C) of this section if the borrower's account is not 
more than 30 days delinquent on December 31. The amount of an adjustment 
for a calendar quarter is equal to--
    (1) The applicable interest rate minus the sum of the average of the 
bond equivalent rates of the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for the 
applicable quarter plus 3.10 percent;
    (2) Multiplied by the average daily principal balance of the loan 
(not including unearned interest added to principal); and
    (3) Divided by 4;
    (B) For any quarter or portion thereof that the Secretary was 
obligated to pay interest subsidy on behalf of the borrower, the holder 
of the loan shall refund to the Secretary, no later than the end of the 
following quarter, any excess interest calculated in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(A) of this section;
    (C) For any other quarter, the holder of the loan shall, within 30 
days of the end of the calendar year, reduce the borrower's outstanding 
principal by the amount of excess interest calculated under paragraph 
(a)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, provided that the borrower's account was 
not more than 30 days delinquent as of December 31;
    (D) For a borrower who on the last day of the calendar year is 
delinquent for more than 30 days, any excess interest calculated shall 
be refunded to the Secretary; and
    (E) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(6)(ii)(B), (C) and (D) of this 
section, if the loan was disbursed during a quarter, the amount of any 
adjustment refunded to the Secretary or credited to the borrower for 
that quarter shall be prorated accordingly.
    (7) Conversion to Variable Rate.
    (i) A lender or holder shall convert the interest rate on a loan 
under paragraphs (a)(6)(i) or (ii) of this section to a variable rate.
    (ii) The applicable interest rate for each 12-month period beginning 
on July 1 and ending on June 30 preceding each 12-month period is equal 
to the sum of--
    (A) The bond equivalent rate of the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned 
at the final auction prior to June 1; and
    (B) 3.25 percent in the case of a loan described in paragraph 
(a)(6)(i) of this section or 3.10 percent in the case of a loan 
described in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.

(a)(6)(ii) of this section for any period prior to the conversion for 
which a rebate has not been provided under paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section, a lender or holder shall convert the interest rate to a 
variable rate.
    (B) The interest rate for each period shall be reset quarterly and 
the applicable interest rate for the quarter or portion shall equal the 
sum of--
    (1) The average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury 
bills auctioned for the preceding 3-month period; and
    (2) 3.25 percent in the case of loans as specified under paragraph 
(a)(6)(i) of this section or 3.10 percent in the case of loans as 
specified under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (iv)(A) The holder of a loan being converted under paragraph 
(a)(7)(iii)(A) of this section shall complete such conversion on or 
before January 1, 1995.
    (B) The holder shall, not later than 30 days prior to the 
conversion, provide the borrower with--
    (1) A notice informing the borrower that the loan is being converted 
to a variable interest rate;
    (2) A description of the rate to the borrower;
    (3) The current interest rate; and

[[Page 592]]

    (4) An explanation that the variable rate will provide a 
substantially equivalent benefit as the adjustment otherwise provided 
under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
    (v) The notice may be provided as part of the disclosure requirement 
as specified under Sec. 682.205.
    (vi) The interest rate as calculated under this paragraph may not 
exceed the maximum interest rate applicable to the loan prior to the 
conversion.
    (b) Capitalization. (1) A lender may add accrued interest and unpaid 
insurance premiums to the borrower's unpaid principal balance in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This increase in the 
principal balance of a loan is called ``capitalization.''
    (2) A lender may capitalize interest payable by the borrower that 
has accrued--
    (i) During the period from the date the first disbursement was made 
to the beginning date of the in-school period;
    (ii) During the in-school period or grace period, if capitalization 
is expressly authorized by the promissory note (or with the written 
consent of the borrower);
    (iii) During a period of authorized deferment;
    (iv) During a period of authorized forbearance; or
    (v) During the period from the date the first installment payment 
was due until it was made.
    (3) A lender may capitalize accrued interest under paragraphs 
(b)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section no more frequently than 
quarterly, except that capitalization is again permitted when repayment 
is required to begin or resume. A lender may capitalize accrued interest 
under paragraph (b)(2) (i) and (v) of this section only on the date 
repayment of principal is scheduled to begin.
    (4) Under the SLS and PLUS programs, the lender shall require the 
borrower to pay on a monthly or quarterly basis or, with the borrower's 
written consent, capitalize on a quarterly basis interest that has 
accrued during periods in which the borrower--
    (i) Is pursuing a full-time course of study at an eligible 
institution;
    (ii) Is pursuing at least a half-time course of study (as determined 
by the institution) during an enrollment period for which the student 
has obtained a FFEL loan;
    (iii) Is pursuing a course of study pursuant to a graduate 
fellowship program approved by the Secretary; or
    (iv) Is pursuing a rehabilitation training program for disabled 
individuals that is approved by the Secretary.
    (5) For all borrowers who are in a period of deferment, a required 
medical or dental internship forbearance, or the in-school or grace 
period on a nonsubsidized Stafford loan and have agreed to monthly or 
quarterly payments of interest, the lender may capitalize past due 
interest after notification to the borrower that the borrower's failure 
to resolve any delinquency constitutes the borrower's consent to 
capitalization of delinquent interest and all interest that will accrue 
through the remainder of that period.
    (c) Fees for FFEL Program loans. A lender--
    (1) May charge a borrower an origination fee on a subsidized 
Stafford loan not to exceed the maximum rate specified by federal 
statute;
    (2) Shall charge a borrower an origination fee on an unsubsidized

    (4) Shall deduct a pro rata portion of the fee (if charged) from 
each disbursement; and
    (5) Shall refund by a credit against the borrower's loan balance the 
fee previously deducted from the loan that is attributable to each 
disbursement of the loan that is--
    (i) Returned by the school to the lender;
    (ii) Repaid within 120 days of disbursement; or
    (iii) Not delivered within 120 days of disbursement.
    (d) Insurance Premium. A lender may charge the borrower the amount 
of the insurance premium paid by the lender to the guarantor up to 1 
percent of the principal amount of the loan, if that charge is provided 
for in the promissory note.

[[Page 593]]

    (e) Administrative charge for a refinanced PLUS or SLS Loan. A 
lender may charge a borrower up to $100 to cover the administrative 
costs of making a loan to a borrower under Sec. 682.209(e) for the 
purpose of refinancing a PLUS or SLS loan to secure a variable interest 
rate.
    (f) Late charge. (1) If authorized by the borrower's promissory 
note, the lender may require the borrower to pay a late charge under the 
circumstances described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. This charge 
may not exceed six cents for each dollar of each late installment.
    (2) The lender may require the borrower to pay a late charge if the 
borrower fails to pay all or a portion of a required installment payment 
within 15 days after it is due.
    (g) Collection charges. (1) If provided for in the borrower's 
promissory note, and notwithstanding any provisions of State law, the 
lender may require that the borrower or any endorser pay costs incurred 
by the lender or its agents in collecting installments not paid when 
due, including, but not limited to--
    (i) Attorney's fees;
    (ii) Court costs; and
    (iii) Telegrams.
    (2) The costs referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section may

Sec. 682.206  Due diligence in making a loan.

    (a) General. (1) Loan-making duties include processing the loan 
application and other required forms, approving the borrower for a loan, 
determining the loan amount, explaining to the borrower his or her 
rights and responsibilities under the loan, and completing and having 
the borrower sign the promissory note.
    (2) A lender that delegates substantial loan-making duties to a 
school on a loan thereby enters into a loan origination relationship 
with the school in regard to that loan. If that relationship exists, the 
lender may rely in good faith upon statements of the borrower made in 
the loan application process, but may not rely upon statements made by 
the school in that process. A non-school lender that does not have an 
origination relationship with a school with respect to a loan may rely 
in good faith upon statements of both the borrower and the school in the 
loan application process. Except as provided in 34 CFR part 668, subpart 
E, a school lender may rely in good faith upon statements made by the 
borrower in the loan application process.
    (b) Processing forms. Before disbursing a loan, a lender must 
determine that all required forms have been accurately completed by the 
borrower, the student, the school, and the lender. A lender may not ask 
the borrower to sign any form before the borrower has provided on the 
form all information requested from the borrower.
    (c) Approval of borrower and determination of loan amount. (1) A 
lender may make a loan only to an eligible borrower. To the extent 
authorized by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the lender may rely on 
the information provided on the application form or data electronically 
transmitted to the lender by the school, the borrower, and, if the 
borrower is a parent, the student on whose behalf the loan is sought, in 
determining the borrower's eligibility for a loan.
    (2) Except in the case of a Consolidation loan, in determining the 
amount of the loan to be made, the lender must review the data on the 
student's cost of attendance and estimated financial assistance that is 
provided by the school. In no case may the loan amount exceed the 
student's estimated cost of attendance less the sum of--
    (i) The student's estimated financial assistance for the period of 
enrollment for which the loan is intended; and
    (ii) In the case of a Stafford loan that is eligible for interest 
benefits, the borrower's expected family contribution for that period.
    (3) A lender may not approve a loan for more than the borrower 
requests, the student's unmet financial need, or the maximum established 
by Sec. 682.204, whichever is less.
    (d) Promissory note. (1) The lender shall obtain from the borrower 
an executed legally enforceable promissory note for each loan as proof 
of the borrower's indebtedness.
    (2) Without the guarantor's prior approval, a lender may not add any 
clauses to, or modify any provisions of, the most current promissory 
note provided by the guarantor.
    (3) The lender shall give the borrower and any endorser or co-maker 
a copy of each executed note.
    (e) Security, endorsement, and co-makers. (1) A FISL, SLS or Federal 
PLUS loan must be made without security or endorsement.
    (2) A Federal PLUS Program loan and Federal Consolidation Program 
Loan may be made to two eligible borrowers who agree to be jointly and 
severally liable for repayment of the loan as co-makers.
    (3) A Federal Consolidation loan may be made to two eligible spouses 
provided both borrowers agree to be jointly and severally liable for 
repayment of the loan as co-makers.
    (f) Additional requirement for Consolidation loans. (1) Prior to 
disbursement of a Consolidation loan, the lender

[[Page 599]]

shall obtain from the holder of each loan to be consolidated a 
certification with respect to the loan held by the holder that--
    (i) The loan is a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the 
borrower;
    (ii) The loan was made and serviced in compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations; and
    (iii) In the case of a FFEL loan, that the guarantee on the loan is 
in full force and effect.
    (2) The Consolidation loan lender may rely in good faith on the 
certification provided under paragraph (f)(1) of this section by the 
holder of a loan to be consolidated.

financial institution;
    (B) If authorized by the guarantor, electronic funds transfer to a 
account maintained in accordance with Sec. 688.163 by the school as

secured and retained by the school for each FFEL program loan for which 
funds are released from the account. A disbursement made by electronic 
funds transfer must be accompanied by a list of the names, social 
security numbers, and loan amounts of the borrowers who are receiving a 
portion of the disbursement; or
    (C) If the school and the lender agree, a master check from the

names, social security numbers, and loan amounts of the borrowers who 
are receiving a portion of the disbursement;
    (iii) May not disburse loan proceeds earlier than is reasonably 
necessary to meet the student's cost of attendance for the period for 
which the loan is made, and, in no case without the Secretary's prior 
approval, disburse loan proceeds earlier than 30 days prior to the date 
on which the student is scheduled to enroll;
    (iv) Shall require an escrow agent to disburse loan proceeds no 
later than 21 days after the agent receives the proceeds from the

borrowing.
    (2) By a check from the lender that is made co-payable to the

authorization to anyone else. However, the school may present the loan 
check to a financial institution for deposit in an account of the

Sec. 682.208  Due diligence in servicing a loan.

    (a) The loan servicing process includes reporting to national credit 
bureaus, responding to borrower inquiries, and establishing the terms of 
repayment.
    (b)(1) An eligible lender of a FFEL loan shall report to at least 
one national credit bureau--
    (i) The total amount of FFEL loans the lender has made to the 
borrower, within 90 days of each disbursement;
    (ii) The outstanding balance of the loans;
    (iii) Information concerning the repayment status of the loan, 
within 90 days after a change in that status from current to delinquent;
    (iv) The date the loan is fully repaid by, or on behalf of, the 
borrower, or discharged by reason of the borrower's death, bankruptcy, 
or total and permanent disability, within 90 days after that date;
    (v) Other information required by law to be reported.
    (2) An eligible lender that has acquired a FFEL loan shall report to 
at least one national credit bureau the information required by 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)-(v) of this section within 90 days of its 
acquisition of the loan.
    (c)(1) A lender shall respond within 30 days after receipt to any 
inquiry from a borrower or any endorser on a loan.
    (2) When a lender learns that a Stafford loan borrower is no longer 
enrolled at an eligible school on at least a half-time basis, the lender 
shall promptly contact the borrower in order to establish the terms of 
repayment.
    (d) Subject to the rules regarding maximum duration of a repayment 
period and minimum annual payment described in Sec. 682.209(a)(7), (c), 
and (h), nothing in this part is intended to limit a lender's discretion 
in establishing, or, with the borrower's consent, revising a borrower's 
repayment schedule--
    (1) To provide for graduated or income-sensitive repayment terms. 
The Secretary strongly encourages lenders to provide a graduated or 
income-sensitive repayment schedule to a borrower providing for at least 
the payment of interest charges, unless the borrower requests otherwise, 
in order to make the borrower's repayment burden commensurate with his 
or her projected ability to pay; or
    (2) To provide a single repayment schedule for all FFEL program 
loans to the borrower held by the lender.
    (e)(1) If the assignment of a Stafford, PLUS, or SLS loan is to 
result in a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower 
must send subsequent payments, the assignor and assignee of the loan 
shall, no later than 45 days from the date the assignee acquires a 
legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the 
assigned loan, provide, either jointly or separately, a notice to the 
borrower of--
    (i) The assignment;
    (ii) The identity of the assignee;
    (iii) The name and address of the party to whom subsequent payments 
or communications must be sent; and

    (i) The assignment; and
    (ii) The name and address of the assignee, and the telephone number 
of the assignee that can be used to obtain information about the 
repayment of the loan.
    (5) The requirements of this paragraph (e), as to borrower 
notification, apply if the borrower is in a grace period or has entered 
the repayment period.
    (f)(1) Notwithstanding an error by the school or lender, a lender

Sec. 682.209  Repayment of a loan.

    (a) Conversion of a loan to repayment status. (1) For a 
Consolidation loan, the repayment period begins on the date the loan is 
disbursed. The first payment is due within 60 days after the date the 
loan is fully disbursed.
    (2)(i) For a PLUS loan, the repayment period begins on the date of 
the last disbursement made on the loan. Interest accrues and is due and 
payable from the date of the first disbursement of the loan. The last 
payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is fully 
disbursed.
    (ii) For an SLS loan, the repayment period begins on the date the 
loan is disbursed, or, if the loan is disbursed in multiple 
installments, on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Interest 
accrues and is due and payable from the date of the first disbursement 
of the loan. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section 
the first payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is fully 
disbursed.
    (iii) For an SLS borrower who has not yet entered repayment on a 
Stafford loan, the borrower may postpone payment, consistent with the 
grace period on the borrower's Stafford loan.
    (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this 
section, for a Stafford loan the repayment period begins--
    (A) For a borrower with a loan for which the applicable interest 
rate is 7 percent per year, not less than 9 nor more than 12 months 
following the date on which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at 
least a half-time basis at an eligible school. The length of this grace 
period is determined by the lender for loans made under the FISL 
Program, and by the guaranty agency for loans guaranteed by the agency; 
and
    (B) For a borrower with a loan for which the initial applicable 
interest rate is 8 or 9 percent per year, 6 months following the date on 
which the borrower is no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis 
at an eligible school.
    (ii) The first payment on a Stafford loan is due on a date 
established by the lender that is no more than--
    (A) 45 days following the first day that the repayment period 
begins;
    (B) 45 days from the expiration of a deferment or forbearance 
period;
    (C) 45 days following the end of the grace period;
    (D) If the lender first learns after the fact that the borrower has 
entered the

[[Page 603]]

repayment period, no later than 75 days after the date the lender learns 
that the borrower has entered the repayment period; or
    (E) An additional 30 days beyond the periods specified in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(ii)(A)-(a)(3)(ii)(D) of this section in order for the lender to 
comply with the required deadlines contained in Sec. 682.205(c)(1).
    (4) For a borrower of a Stafford loan who is a correspondence 
student, the grace period specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section begins on the earliest of the date--
    (i) The borrower completes the program;
    (ii) The borrower falls 60 days behind the due date for submission 
of a scheduled assignment, according to the schedule required in 
Sec. 682.602. However, a school may grant the borrower one restoration 
to in-school status if the borrower fails to submit a lesson within this 
60-day period after the due date for submission of a particular 
assignment if, within the 60-day period, the borrower declares, in 
writing, an intention to continue in the program and an understanding 
that the required lessons must be submitted on time; or
    (iii) That is 60 days following the latest allowable date 
established by the school for completing the program under the schedule 
required under Sec. 682.602.
    (5) For a Stafford loan, the repayment period begins prior to the 
end of the grace period if the borrower requests in writing and is 
granted a repayment schedule that so provides. In this event, a borrower 
waives the remainder of the grace period.
    (6)(i) The repayment schedule may provide for substantially equal 
installment payments or for installment payments that increase or 
decrease in amount during the repayment period. If the loan has a 
variable interest rate that changes annually, the lender may establish a 
repayment schedule that--
    (A) Provides for adjustments of the amount of the installment 
payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest rate; or
    (B) Contains no provision for an adjustment of the amount of the 
installment payment to reflect annual changes in the variable interest 
rate, but requires the lender to grant a forbearance to the borrower (or 
endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 3 years of payments in 
accordance with Sec. 682.211(j)(5) in cases where the effect of a 
variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule 
would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment 
term.
    (ii) If a graduated or income-sensitive repayment schedule is 
established, it may not provide for any single installment that is more 
than three times greater than any other installment. An agreement as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the 
schedule provides for less than the minimum annual payment amount 
specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Not more than six months prior to the date that the borrower's 
first payment is due, the lender shall offer a choice of a standard, 
graduated, or income-sensitive repayment schedule to a new borrower who 
receives a Stafford or SLS loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 
1993. For purposes of this section, a ``new borrower'' is an individual 
who has no outstanding principal or interest balance on an FFEL Program 
loan as of July 1, 1993 or on the date he or she obtains a loan on or 
after July 1, 1993. This term also includes a borrower who obtains a 
Federal Consolidation Loan on or after July 1, 1993 if the borrower has 
no other outstanding FFEL Program loan when the Consolidation Loan is 
made. The lender shall also offer a choice of repayment schedules to any 
individual whose Consolidation loan application is received by the 
lender on or after January 1, 1993. The Secretary encourages lenders to 
offer the choice of repayment schedules to all other borrowers.
    (iv) The repayment schedule must require that each payment equal at 
least the interest that accrues during the interval between scheduled 
payments.
    (v) The lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan under a 
standard repayment schedule described in paragraph (a)(6)(vi) of this 
section if the borrower--
    (A) Does not select an income-sensitive or a graduated repayment 
schedule within 45 days after being notified

[[Page 604]]

by the lender to choose a repayment schedule; or
    (B) Chooses an income-sensitive repayment schedule, but does not 
provide the documentation requested by the lender under paragraph 
(a)(6)(viii)(C) of this section within the time period specified by the 
lender.
    (vi) Under a standard repayment schedule, the borrower is scheduled 
to pay either--
    (A) The same amount for each installment payment made during the 
repayment period, except that the borrower's final payment may be 
slightly more or less than the other payments; or
    (B) An installment amount that will be adjusted to reflect annual 
changes in the loan's variable interest rate.
    (vii) Under a graduated repayment schedule--
    (A) The amount of the borrower's installment payment is scheduled to 
change (usually by increasing) during the course of the repayment 
period; and
    (B) An agreement as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the 
minimum annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (viii) Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule--
    (A) The amount of the borrower's installment payment is adjusted 
annually, based on the borrower's expected total monthly gross income 
received by the borrower from employment and from other sources during 
the course of the repayment period;
    (B) In general, the lender shall request the borrower to inform the 
lender of his or her income no earlier than 90 days prior to the due 
date of the borrower's initial installment payment and subsequent annual 
payment adjustment under an income-sensitive repayment schedule. The 
income information must be sufficient for the lender to make a 
reasonable determination of what the borrower's payment amount should 
be. If the lender receives late notification that the borrower has 
dropped below half-time enrollment status at a school, the lender may 
request that income information earlier than 90 days prior to the due 
date of the borrower's initial installment payment;
    (C) If the borrower reports income to the lender that the lender 
considers to be insufficient for establishing monthly installment 
payments that would repay the loan within the maximum 10-year repayment 
period, the lender shall require the borrower to submit evidence showing 
the amount of the most recent total monthly gross income received by the 
borrower from employment and from other sources including, if 
applicable, pay statements from employers and documentation of any 
income received by the borrower from other parties;
    (D) The lender shall grant a forbearance to the borrower (or 
endorser, if applicable) for a period of up to 5 years of payments in 
accordance with Sec. 682.211(j)(5) in cases where the effect of 
decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment 
schedule would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum 
repayment term; and
    (E) The lender shall inform the borrower that the loan must be 
repaid within the time limits specified under paragraph (a)(7) of this 
section.
    (ix) For purposes of this section, a lender may require that all 
FFEL loans owed by a borrower to the lender be combined into one account 
and repaid under one repayment schedule. In that event, the word 
``loan'' in this section shall mean all of the borrower's loans that 
were combined by the lender into that account.
    (7)(i) Subject to paragraphs (a)(7) (ii) through (iv) of this 
section, a lender shall allow a borrower at least 5 years, but not more 
than 10 years, to repay a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan, calculated from 
the beginning of the repayment period. Except in the case of a FISL loan 
for a period of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1986, the 
lender shall require a borrower to fully repay a FISL loan within 15 
years after it is made.
    (ii) If the borrower receives an authorized deferment or is granted 
forbearance, as described in Sec. 682.210 or Sec. 682.211 respectively, 
the periods of deferment or forbearance are excluded from determinations 
of the 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods, and from the 12-, 15-,

[[Page 605]]

20-, 25-, and 30-year periods for repayment of a Consolidation loan 
pursuant to Sec. 682.208(h).
    (iii) If the minimum annual repayment required in paragraph (c) of 
this section would result in complete repayment of the loan in less than 
5 years, the borrower is not entitled to the full 5-year period.
    (iv) The borrower may, prior to the beginning of the repayment 
period, request and be granted by the lender a repayment period of less 
than 5 years. Subject to paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, a 
borrower who makes such a request may, by written notice to the lender 
at any time during the repayment period, extend the repayment period to 
a minimum of 5 years.
    (8) If, with respect to the aggregate of all loans held by a lender, 
the total payment made by a borrower for a monthly or similar payment 
period would not otherwise be a multiple of five dollars, the lender may 
round that periodic payment to the next highest whole dollar amount that 
is a multiple of five dollars.
    (b) Payment application and prepayment. (1) The lender may credit 
the entire payment amount first to any late charges accrued or 
collection costs and then to any outstanding interest and then to 
outstanding principal.
    (2)(i) The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of a loan at 
any time without penalty.
    (ii) If the prepayment amount equals or exceeds the monthly payment 
amount under the repayment schedule established for the loan, the lender 
shall apply the prepayment to future installments by advancing the next 
payment due date, unless the borrower requests otherwise. The lender 
must either inform the borrower in advance using a prominent statement 
in the borrower coupon book or billing statement that any additional 
full payment amounts submitted without instructions to the lender as to 
their handling will be applied to future scheduled payments with the 
borrower's next scheduled payment due date advanced consistent with the 
number of additional payments received, or provide a notification to the 
borrower after the payments are received informing the borrower that the 
payments have been so applied and the date of the borrower's next 
scheduled payment due date. Information related to next scheduled 
payment due date need not be provided to borrower's making such 
prepayments while in an in-school, grace, deferment, or forbearance 
period when payments are not due.
    (c) Minimum annual payment. (1)(i) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section, during each year of the repayment period a borrower's 
total payments to all holders of the borrower's FFEL Program loans must 
total at least $600 or the unpaid balance of all loans, including 
interest, whichever amount is less.
    (ii) If the borrower and the lender agree, the amount paid may be 
less.
    (2) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section 
may not result in an extension of the maximum repayment period unless 
forbearance as described in Sec. 682.211, or deferment described in 
Sec. 682.210, has been approved.
    (d) Combined repayment of a borrower's student PLUS and SLS loans 
held by a lender. (1) A lender may, at the request of a student 
borrower, combine the borrower's, student PLUS and SLS loans held by it 
into a single repayment schedule.
    (2) The repayment period on the loans included in the combined 
repayment schedule must be calculated based on the beginning of 
repayment of the most recent included loan.
    (3) The interest rate on the loans included in the new combined 
repayment schedule must be the weighted average of the rates of all 
included loans.
    (e) Refinancing a fixed-rate PLUS or SLS Program loan to secure a 
variable interest rate. (1) Subject to paragraph (g) of this section, a 
lender may, at the request of a borrower, refinance a PLUS or SLS loan 
with a fixed interest rate in order to permit the borrower to obtain a 
variable interest rate.
    (2) A loan made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section--
    (i) Must bear interest at the variable rate described in 
Sec. 682.202(a)(2)(iv); and
    (ii) May not extend the repayment period provided for in paragraph 
(a)(7)(i) of this section.
    (3) The lender may not charge an additional insurance premium on the 
loan, but may charge the borrower an

[[Page 606]]

administrative fee pursuant to Sec. 682.202(e).
    (f) Refinancing of a fixed-rate PLUS or SLS Program loan to secure a 
variable interest rate by discharge of previous loan. (1) Subject to 
paragraph (g) of this section, a borrower who has applied for, but been 
denied, a refinanced loan authorized under paragraph (e) of this section 
by the holder of the borrower's fixed-rate PLUS or SLS loan, may obtain 
a loan from another lender for the purpose of discharging the fixed-rate 
loan and obtaining a variable interest rate.
    (2) A loan made under paragraph (f)(1) of this section--
    (i) Must bear interest at the variable interest rate described in 
Sec. 682.202(a)(2)(iv);
    (ii) May not operate to extend the repayment period provided for in 
paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section; and
    (iii) Must be disbursed to the holder of the fixed-rate loan to 
discharge the borrower's obligation thereon.
    (3) Upon receipt of the proceeds of a loan made under paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section, the holder of the fixed-rate loan shall, within 
five business days, apply the proceeds to discharge the borrower's 
obligation on the fixed-rate loan, and provide the refinancing lender 
with either a copy of the borrower's original promissory note evidencing 
the fixed-rate loan or the holder's written certification that the 
borrower's obligation on the fixed-rate loan has been fully discharged.
    (4) The refinancing lender may charge the borrower an insurance 
premium on a loan made under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, but may 
not charge a fee to cover administrative costs.
    (5) For purposes of deferments under Sec. 682.210, the refinancing 
loan--
    (i) Is considered a PLUS loan if any of the included loans is a PLUS 
loan made to a parent;
    (ii) Is considered an SLS loan if the combined loan does not include 
a PLUS loan made to a parent; or
    (iii) Is considered a loan to a ``new borrower'' as defined in

that date.
    (g) Conditions for refinancing certain loans. (1) A lender may not 
refinance a loan under paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section if that

loan, is uninsured by the Secretary.
    (2)(i) Prior to refinancing a fixed-rate loan under paragraph (f) of 
this section, the lender shall obtain a written statement from the 
holder of the loan certifying that--

    (a) General. (1)(i) A borrower is entitled to have periodic 
installment payments of principal deferred during authorized periods 
after the beginning of the repayment period, pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (ii) With the exception of a deferment authorized under paragraph 
(o) of this section, a borrower may continue to receive a specific type 
of deferment that is limited to a maximum period of time only if the 
total amount of time that the borrower has received the deferment does 
not exceed the maximum time period allowed for the deferment.
    (2)(i) For a loan made before October 1, 1981, the borrower is also 
entitled to have periodic installments of principal deferred during the 
six-month period

[[Page 608]]

(post-deferment grace period) that begins after the completion of each 
deferment period or combination of those periods, except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Once a borrower receives a post-deferment grace period 
following an unemployment deferment, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) 
of this section, the borrower does not qualify for additional post-
deferment grace periods following subsequent unemployment deferments.
    (3) Interest accrues and is paid by the borrower during the 
deferment period and the post-deferment grace period, if applicable, 
unless interest accrues and is paid by the Secretary if--
    (i) In the case of a Stafford loan, the loan was determined to be 
eligible for interest benefits under Sec. 682.301 when the loan was 
made; or
    (ii) In the case of a Consolidation loan for which the application 
was received by an eligible lender on or after January 1, 1993, during 
any period the borrower was eligible for a deferment under section 
428(b)(1)(m).
    (4) As a condition for receiving a deferment, the borrower shall 
request the deferment, and provide the lender with all information and 
documents required to establish eligibility for a specific type of 
deferment.
    (5) An authorized deferment period begins on the date the condition 
entitling the borrower to the deferment first exists, but not more than 
six months before the date the lender receives a request and the 
information and documentation required for the deferment.
    (6) An authorized deferment period ends on the earlier of--
    (i) The date when the condition establishing the borrower's 
eligibility for the deferment ends;
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, the 
date on which, as certified by an authorized official, the borrower's 
eligibility for the deferment is expected to end;
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section, 
the expiration date of the period covered by any certification required 
by this section to be obtained for the deferment;
    (iv) In the case of a student deferment for a Stafford or PLUS loan 
made to a borrower guaranteed by a guaranty agency whose student status 
confirmation report system includes student status reports for each 
borrower with a student deferment, and in the case of an SLS loan made 
to a borrower for a period of enrollment that commences at the same time 
as the deferment, the student's anticipated graduation date as indicated 
on the loan application, and as updated by notice to the lender from the 
school or guaranty agency; or
    (v) The date when the condition providing the basis for the 
borrower's eligibility for the deferment has continued to exist for the 
maximum amount of time allowed for that type of deferment.
    (7) A lender may not deny a borrower a deferment to which the 
borrower is entitled, even though the borrower may be delinquent, but 
not in default, in making required installment payments. The 180- or 
240-day period required to establish default does not run during the 
deferment and post-deferment grace periods. Unless the lender has 
granted the borrower forbearance under Sec. 682.211, when the deferment 
and, if applicable, the post-deferment grace period expire, a borrower 
resumes any delinquency status that existed when the deferment period 
began.
    (8) A borrower whose loan is in default is not eligible for a 
deferment, unless the borrower has made payment arrangements acceptable 
to the lender prior to the payment of a default claim by a guaranty 
agency.
    (9) The borrower promptly must inform the lender when the condition 
entitling the borrower to a deferment no longer exists.
    (10) Authorized deferments are described in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Specific requirements for each deferment are set forth in 
paragraphs (c) through (r) of this section.

deferment if both individuals simultaneously meet the requirements of 
this section for receiving the same, or different deferments.

    (3) For a borrower of a Stafford or SLS loan who has been enrolled 
on at least a half-time basis at an eligible institution during the six 
months preceding the beginning of this deferment, deferment is 
authorized during a period of up to six months during which the borrower 
is--
    (i) (A) Pregnant;

on at least a half-time basis; and
    (iii) In the case of a deferment described in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section for a borrower who is at least half-time but less than 
full-time, a statement from the financial aid administrator of the 
school or other documentation evidencing that the borrower has received, 
or will receive, a Stafford or SLS loan for the period of enrollment for 
which the deferment is sought.
    (2) The lender shall consider a deferment granted on the basis of a 
certified loan application to cover the period lasting until the 
anticipated graduation date appearing on the application, unless and 
until it receives notice that the borrower has ceased the level of study 
(i.e., full-time or half-time) required for the deferment.
    (3) In the case of a Stafford, SLS or PLUS borrower, the lender 
shall treat the certified loan application or other form certified by

expected to end; and
    (C) Is structured in a way that requires a substantial commitment by 
the borrower to his or her rehabilitation. The Secretary considers a 
substantial commitment by the borrower to be a commitment of time and 
effort that normally would prevent an individual from engaging in full-
time employment, either because of the number of hours that must be 
devoted to rehabilitation or because of the nature of the 
rehabilitation. For the purpose of this paragraph, full-time employment 
involves at least 30 hours of work per week and is expected to last at 
least three months.
    (f) Temporary total disability deferment. (1) To qualify for a

basis of a condition that existed before he or she applied for the loan,

borrower temporarily totally disabled, as substantiated by the statement 
required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, after the borrower 
submitted the loan application.

given to a borrower whose spouse or other dependent requires continuous 
nursing or similar services for a period of at least 90 days, the 
borrower shall provide the lender with a statement--
    (i) From a physician, who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and

least 30 hours of work per week and is expected to last at least three 
months.

borrower's permanent or temporary address, specifying the agency's name 
and address and the date of registration.
    (2) A borrower may qualify for an unemployment deferment whether or 
not the borrower has been previously employed.
    (3) An unemployment deferment is not justified if the borrower 
refuses to seek or accept employment in kinds of positions or at salary 
and responsibility levels for which the borrower feels over qualified by 
virtue of education or previous experience.
    (4) For the purpose of this paragraph, full-time employment involves 
at least 30 hours of work a week and is expected to last at least three 
months.
    (5) A lender may not grant a deferment based on a single 
certification under paragraph (h)(1) of this section beyond the date 
that is six months after the date of the certification.
    (6) A lender may accept, as an alternative to the certification of 
employer contacts required under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section,

of the Unemployment Insurance Service, provided it shows the same number 
of contacts and contains the same information the borrower would be 
required to provide under the Department's regulations.

    (3) A borrower enlisted in a reserve component of the Armed Forces 
may qualify for a military deferment only for service on a full-time 
basis that is expected to last for a period of at least one year in 
length, as evidenced by official military orders, unless an order for 
national mobilization of reservists is issued.
    (4) A borrower enlisted in the National Guard qualifies for a

School Officer has complied with paragraph (q)(3) of this section and 
provides an annual listing of designated teacher shortage areas to the 
State's chief administrative officers whose schools are affected by the 
Secretary's designations, the borrower may obtain a certification that 
he or she is teaching in a teacher shortage area from his or her 
school's chief administrative officer.
    (ii) If a borrower is teaching in a State in which the Chief State 
School Officer has not complied with paragraph (q)(3) of this section or

through (7) of this section.
    (4) If a borrower who receives a deferment continues to teach in the 
same teacher shortage area as that in which he or she was teaching when 
the deferment was originally granted, the borrower shall, at the 
borrower's request, continue to receive the deferment for those 
subsequent years, up to the three-year maximum deferment period, even if 
his or her position does not continue to be within an area designated by 
the Secretary as a teacher shortage area in those subsequent years. To 
continue to receive the deferment in a subsequent year under this 
paragraph, the borrower shall provide the lender with a statement by the 
chief administrative officer of the public or nonprofit private

same teacher shortage

[[Page 615]]

area for which the deferment was received for the previous year.
    (5) For purposes of this section a teacher shortage area is--
    (i)(A) A geographic region of the State in which there is a shortage 
of elementary or secondary school teachers; or
    (B) A specific grade level or academic, instructional, subject-
matter, or discipline classification in which there is a statewide 
shortage of elementary or secondary school teachers; and
    (ii) Designated by the Secretary under paragraphs (q)(6) or (q)(7) 
of this section.
    (6)(i) In order for the Secretary to designate one or more teacher 
shortage areas in a State for a school year, the Chief State School 
Officer shall by January 1 of the calendar year in which the school year 
begins, and in accordance with objective written standards, propose 
teacher shortage areas to the Secretary for designation. With respect to 
private nonprofit schools included in the recommendation, the Chief 
State School Officer shall consult with appropriate officials of the 
private nonprofit schools in the State prior to submitting the 
recommendation.
    (ii) In identifying teacher shortage areas to propose for 
designation under paragraph (q)(6)(i) of this section, the Chief State 
School Officer shall consider data from the school year in which the 
recommendation is to be made, unless that data is not yet available, in 
which case he or she may use data from the immediately preceding school 
year, with respect to--
    (A) Teaching positions that are unfilled;
    (B) Teaching positions that are filled by teachers who are certified 
by irregular, provisional, temporary, or emergency certification; and
    (C) Teaching positions that are filled by teachers who are 
certified, but who are teaching in academic subject areas other than 
their area of preparation.
    (iii) If the total number of unduplicated full-time equivalent (FTE) 
elementary or secondary teaching positions identified under paragraph 
(q)(6)(ii) of this section in the shortage areas proposed by the State 
for designation does not exceed 5 percent of the total number of FTE 
elementary and secondary teaching positions in the State, the Secretary 
designates those areas as teacher shortage areas.
    (iv) If the total number of unduplicated FTE elementary and 
secondary teaching positions identified under paragraph (q)(6)(ii) of 
this section in the shortage areas proposed by the State for designation 
exceeds 5 percent of the total number of elementary and secondary FTE 
teaching positions in the State, the Chief State School Officer shall 
submit, with the list of proposed areas, supporting documentation 
showing the methods used for identifying shortage areas, and an 
explanation of the reasons why the Secretary should nevertheless 
designate all of the proposed areas as teacher shortage areas. The 
explanation must include a ranking of the proposed shortage areas 
according to priority, to assist the Secretary in determining which 
areas should be designated. The Secretary, after considering the 
explanation, determines which shortage areas to designate as teacher 
shortage areas.
    (7) A Chief State School Officer may submit to the Secretary for 
approval an alternative written procedure to the one described in 
paragraph (q)(6) of this section, for the Chief State School Officer to 
use to select the teacher shortage areas recommended to the Secretary 
for designation, and for the Secretary to use to choose the areas to be 
designated. If the Secretary approves the proposed alternative 
procedure, in writing, that procedure, once approved, may be used 
instead of the procedure described in paragraph (q)(6) of this section 
for designation of teacher shortage areas in that State.
    (8) For purposes of paragraphs (q)(1) through (7) of this section--
    (i) The definition of the term school in Sec. 682.200(b) does not 
apply;
    (ii) Elementary school means a day or residential school that 
provides elementary education, as determined under State law;
    (iii) Secondary school means a day or residential school that 
provides secondary education, as determined under State law. In the 
absence of applicable

[[Page 616]]

State law, the Secretary may determine, with respect to that State, 
whether the term ``secondary school'' includes education beyond the 
twelfth grade;
    (iv) Teacher means a professional who provides direct and personal 
services to students for their educational development through classroom 
teaching;
    (v) Chief State School Officer means the highest ranking educational 
official for elementary and secondary education for the State;

through June 30 of the following calendar year;
    (vii) Teacher shortage area means an area of specific grade, subject 
matter, or discipline classification, or a geographic area in which the 
Secretary determines that there is an inadequate supply of elementary or 
secondary school teachers; and
    (viii) Full-time equivalent means the standard used by a State in 
defining full-time employment, but not less than 30 hours per week. For 
purposes of counting full-time equivalent teacher positions, a teacher 
working part of his or her total hours in a position that is designated 
as a teacher shortage area is counted on a pro rata basis corresponding 
to the percentage of his or her working hours spent in such a position.
    (r) Working-mother deferment. (1) To qualify for the working-mother 
deferment described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section, the 
borrower shall provide the lender with a statement certifying that she--
    (i) Is the mother of a preschool-age child;
    (ii) Entered or reentered the workforce not more than one year 
before the beginning date of the period for which the deferment is being 
sought;

the rate prescribed under section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938 (the Federal minimum wage).

of this section, the borrower shall provide to the lender documents 
demonstrating the age of her child (e.g., a birth certificate) and the 
rate of her compensation (e.g., a pay stub showing her hourly rate of 
pay).
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph--
    (i) A preschool-age child is one who has not yet enrolled in first 
grade or a higher grade in elementary school; and
    (ii) Full-time employment involves at least 30 hours of work a week 
and is expected to last at least 3 months.
    (s) Deferments for new borrowers on or after July 1, 1993--

this section, a ``new borrower'' is an individual who has no outstanding 
principal or interest balance on an FFEL Program loan as of July 1, 1993 
or on the date he or she obtains a loan on or after July 1, 1993. This 
term also includes a borrower who obtains a Federal Consolidation Loan 
on or after July 1, 1993 if the borrower has no other outstanding FFEL 
Program loan when the Consolidation Loan was made.
    (2) Student deferment. An eligible borrower is entitled to a 
deferment for at least half-time study in accordance with the rules

an economic hardship deferment for periods

[[Page 617]]

of up to one year at a time that, collectively, do not exceed 3 years, 
if the borrower provides documentation satisfactory to the lender

    (i) Has been granted an economic hardship deferment under either the 
Direct Loan or Federal Perkins Loan Programs for the period of time for 
which the borrower has requested an economic hardship deferment for his

    (A) The minimum wage rate described in section 6 of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act of 1938; or

    (vi) In determining a borrower's Federal education debt burden for 
purposes of an economic hardship deferment under paragraphs (s)(6)(iv) 
through (v) of this section, the lender shall count only the monthly 
payment amount (or a proportional share if the payments are due less 
frequently than monthly) that would have been owed on a Federal 
postsecondary education loan if the loan had been scheduled to be repaid 
in 10 years from the date the borrower entered repayment, regardless of 
the length of the borrower's actual repayment schedule or the actual 
monthly payment amount (if any) that would be owed during the period 
that the borrower requested an economic hardship deferment. The lender 
shall require the borrower to provide evidence that would enable the 
lender to determine the amount of the monthly payments that would have 
been owed by the borrower during the deferment period to other entities 
for Federal postsecondary education loans in accordance with paragraph 
(s)(6)(vi) of this section.

this section.
    (viii) To qualify for a subsequent period of deferment that begins 
less than one year after the end of a period of deferment under 
paragraphs (s)(6)(iii) through (v) of this section, the lender shall 
require the borrower to submit evidence showing the amount of the 
borrower's most recent total monthly gross income, as defined in 
paragraph (s)(6)(ix) of this section, and a copy of the borrower's 
Federal income tax return if the borrower filed a tax return within

total monthly gross income shall be the gross amount of income received 
by the borrower from employment (either full-time or part-time) and from 
other sources.
    (x) For purposes of paragraph (s)(6) of this section, a borrower is 
considered to be working full-time if the borrower is expected to be 
employed for at least

Sec. 682.211  Forbearance.

    (a)(1) The Secretary encourages a lender to grant forbearance for 
the benefit of a borrower or endorser in order to prevent the borrower 
or endorser from defaulting on the borrower's or endorser's repayment 
obligation, or to permit the borrower or endorser to resume honoring 
that obligation after default. Forbearance means permitting the 
temporary cessation of payments, allowing an extension of time for 
making payments, or temporarily accepting smaller payments than 
previously were scheduled.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (h) of this section, a lender may grant 
forbearance of payments of principal and interest under paragraphs (b), 
(c), and (d) of this section only if--
    (i) The lender reasonably believes, and documents in the borrower's 
file, that the borrower or endorser intends to repay the loan but, due 
to poor health or other acceptable reasons, is currently unable to make 
scheduled payments; or
    (ii) The borrower's payments of principal are deferred under 
Sec. 682.210 and the Secretary does not pay interest benefits on behalf 
of the borrower under Sec. 682.301.
    (3) If two individuals are jointly liable for repayment of a PLUS 
loan or a Consolidation loan, the lender may grant forbearance on 
repayment of the loan only if the ability of both individuals to make 
scheduled payments has been impaired.
    (4) If payments of interest are forborne, they may be capitalized as 
provided in Sec. 682.202(b).
    (b) A lender may grant forbearance if the lender and the borrower or 
endorser agree in writing to the terms of the forbearance, or, in the 
case of forbearance of interest during a period of deferment, if the 
lender informs the borrower at the time the deferment is granted that 
interest payments are to be forborne.
    (c) A lender may grant forbearance for a period of up to one year at 
a time if both the borrower or endorser and an authorized official of 
the lender agree in writing to the forbearance.
    (d) A guaranty agency may authorize a lender to grant forbearance to 
permit a borrower or endorser to resume honoring the agreement to repay 
the debt after default. The terms of the forbearance agreement in this 
situation must include a new signed repayment obligation.
    (e) Except in the case of forbearance of interest payments during a 
deferment period or a forbearance granted under paragraph (g) of this 
section, if a forbearance involves the postponement of all payments, the 
lender must contact the borrower or endorser by telephone or send a 
written notice to the borrower or endorser at least once every three 
months during the period of forbearance to remind the borrower or 
endorser of the outstanding obligation to repay.
    (f) A lender may grant forbearance, upon notice to the borrower or 
if applicable, the endorser, with respect to payments of interest and 
principal that are overdue--
    (1) For a properly granted period of deferment for which the lender 
learns the borrower did not qualify;
    (2) Upon the beginning of an authorized deferment period;
    (3) For the period beginning when the borrower entered repayment 
until the first payment due date was established;
    (4) For a period as authorized by the Secretary in the event of a 
national military mobilization or other national emergency; or
    (5) For the period prior to the borrower's filing of a bankruptcy 
petition as provided in Sec. 682.402(d).
    (6) For a period not to exceed 60 days after the lender receives 
reliable information indicating that the borrower (or student in the 
case of a PLUS loan) has died, or the borrower has become totally and 
permanently disabled, until the lender receives documentation of death 
or total and permanent disability, pursuant to Sec. 682.402(b) or (c);

[[Page 619]]

    (7) For periods necessary for the Secretary or guaranty agency to 
determine the borrower's eligibility for discharge of the loan because 
of attendance at a closed school or false certification of loan 
eligibility, pursuant to Sec. 682.402(d) or (e), or the borrower's or, 
if applicable, endorser's bankruptcy, pursuant to Sec. 682.402(f); or
    (8) For a period of delinquency at the time a loan is sold or 
transferred, if the borrower or endorser is less than 60 days delinquent 
on the loan at the time of sale or transfer.
    (9) For a period of delinquency that may remain after a borrower 
ends a period of deferment or mandatory forbearance until the next due 
date is established in accordance with Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(B).
    (g) Upon the written request of the borrower, a lender shall grant 
forbearance of principal and, unless otherwise indicated by the 
borrower, interest, in intervals not to exceed 12 months, to a borrower 
whose deferment received under Sec. 682.210(n) has expired until the 
borrower has completed the internship or residency.
    (h) In granting a forbearance under this section, except for a 
forbearance under paragraph (j)(5), a lender shall grant a temporary 
cessation of payments, unless the borrower chooses another form of 
forbearance subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (i) Mandatory forbearance. (1) Medical or dental interns or 
residents. Upon receipt of a written request and sufficient supporting 
documentation, as described in Sec. 682.210(n), from a borrower serving 
in a medical or dental internship or residency program, a lender shall 
grant forbearance to the borrower in yearly increments (or a lesser 
period equal to the actual period during which the borrower is eligible) 
if the borrower has exhausted his or her eligibility for a deferment 
under Sec. 682.210(n), or the borrower's promissory note does not 
provide for such a deferment--
    (i) For the length of time remaining in the borrower's medical or 
dental internship or residency that must be successfully completed 
before the borrower may begin professional practice or service; or
    (ii) For the length of time that the borrower is serving in a 
medical or dental internship or residency program leading to a degree or 
certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, 
or a health care facility that offers postgraduate training.
    (2) Borrowers who are not medical or dental interns or residents, 
and endorsers. Upon receipt of a written request and sufficient 
supporting documentation from an endorser (if applicable), or from a 
borrower (other than a borrower who is serving in a medical or dental 
internship or residency described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section), 
a lender shall grant forbearance--
    (i) In increments up to one year, for periods that collectively do 
not exceed three years, if--
    (A) The borrower or endorser is currently obligated to make payments 
on Title IV loans; and
    (B) The amount of those payments each month (or a proportional share 
if the payments are due less frequently than monthly) is collectively 
equal to or greater than 20 percent of the borrower's or endorser's 
total monthly income;
    (ii) In yearly increments (or a lesser period equal to the actual 
period during which the borrower is eligible) for as long as a 
borrower--
    (A) Is serving in a national service position for which the borrower 
receives a national service educational award under the National and 
Community Service Trust Act of 1993;
    (B) Is eligible for loan forgiveness under the Federal Stafford Loan 
Forgiveness Demonstration Program, if the program is funded, for 
performing the type of service described in Sec. 682.215(b); or
    (C) Is performing the type of service that would qualify the 
borrower for a partial repayment of his or her loan under the Student 
Loan Repayment Programs administered by the Department of Defense under 
10 U.S.C. 2171.
    (3) Documentation. (i) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower 
or endorser under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, the lender shall 
require the borrower or endorser to submit at least the following 
documentation:
    (A) Evidence showing the amount of the most recent total monthly 
gross

[[Page 620]]

income received by the borrower or endorser from employment and from 
other sources; and
    (B) Evidence showing the amount of the monthly payments owed by the 
borrower or endorser to other entities for the most recent month for the 
borrower's or endorser's Title IV loans.
    (ii) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower or endorser under 
paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the lender shall require the 
borrower or endorser to submit documentation showing the beginning and 
ending dates that the borrower is expected to perform the type of 
service described in Sec. 682.215(b).
    (iii) Before granting a forbearance to a borrower or endorser under 
paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the lender shall require the 
borrower or endorser to submit documentation showing the beginning and 
ending dates that the Department of Defense considers the borrower to be 
eligible for a partial repayment of his or her loan under the Student 
Loan Repayment Programs.
    (j) Mandatory administrative forbearance. (1) The lender shall grant 
a mandatory administrative forbearance for the periods specified in 
paragraph (j)(2) of this section until the lender is notified by the 
Secretary or a guaranty agency that the forbearance period no longer 
applies. The lender may not require a borrower who is eligible for a 
forbearance under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section to submit a 
request or supporting documentation, but shall require a borrower (or 
endorser, if applicable) who requests forbearance because of a military 
mobilization to provide documentation showing that he or she is subject 
to a military mobilization as described in paragraph (j)(4) of this 
section.
    (2) The lender is not required to notify the borrower (or endorser, 
if applicable) at the time the forbearance is granted, but shall grant a 
forbearance to a borrower or endorser during a period, and the 30 days 
following the period, when the lender is notified by the Secretary 
that--
    (i) Exceptional circumstances exist, such as a local or national 
emergency or military mobilization; or
    (ii) The geographical area in which the borrower or endorser resides 
has been designated a disaster area by the president of the United 
States or Mexico, the prime minister of Canada, or by a governor of a 
state.
    (3) As soon as feasible, or by the date specified by the Secretary, 
the lender shall notify the borrower (or endorser, if applicable) that 
the lender has granted a forbearance and the date that payments should 
resume. The lender's notification shall state that the borrower or 
endorser--
    (i) May decline the forbearance and continue to be obligated to make 
scheduled payments; or
    (ii) Consents to making payments in accordance with the lender's 
notification if the forbearance is not declined.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, the term 
``military mobilization'' shall mean a situation in which the Department 
of Defense orders members of the National Guard or Reserves to active 
duty under sections 672(a), 672(g), 673, 673b, 674, or 688 of title 10, 
United States Code. This term also includes the assignment of other 
members of the Armed Forces to duty stations at locations other than the 
locations at which they were normally assigned, only if the military 
mobilization involved the activation of the National Guard or Reserves.
    (5) The lender shall grant a mandatory administrative forbearance to 
a borrower (or endorser, if applicable) during a period when the 
borrower (or endorser, if applicable) is making payments for a period 
of--
    (i) Up to 3 years of payments in cases where the effect of a 
variable interest rate on a standard or graduated repayment schedule 
would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment 
term; or
    (ii) Up to 5 years of payments in cases where the effect of 
decreased installment amounts paid under an income-sensitive repayment 
schedule

[[Page 621]]

would result in the loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment 
term.

    (d) Except to secure a loan from the Student Loan Marketing

Sec. 682.215  Federal Stafford Loan forgiveness demonstration program.

    (a) General. The Federal Stafford Loan forgiveness demonstration 
program is intended to encourage individuals to enter the teaching and 
nursing professions and to perform national and community service. Under 
this demonstration program, the Secretary repays portions of 
unsubsidized, subsidized and nonsubsidized Federal Stafford obligations 
that were incurred by a borrower during the borrower's last two years of 
undergraduate education if that borrower worked in those professions or 
performed that service. For purposes of this section, an eligible 
borrower is a borrower who, as of October 1, 1989, had no outstanding 
debt under the FFEL programs.
    (b) Borrower eligibility; requirements for qualification. A borrower 
may obtain loan forgiveness under this program if he or she was employed 
as a full-time teacher in certain elementary and secondary schools 
teaching certain subjects or as a full-time nurse in certain types of 
hospitals or health care centers, or was serving as a volunteer under 
the Peace Corps Act or under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, 
or was performing comparable service as a full-time employee of a tax 
exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986. For purposes of this section, full-time means the standard used 
by a State or profession in defining full-time employment. For a 
borrower serving in more than one organization, the determination of 
``full-time'' is based on the combination of all qualifying employment. 
A borrower who is in default on a FFEL loan and has not made

borrowers are chosen on a first-come, first-served basis to participate 
and must receive forbearance upon request for each year of service for 
which forgiveness is requested. An eligible borrower must reapply each 
year to receive the forgiveness benefit. Incomplete or inaccurate 
applications are not considered in the first-come, first-served process.

Sec. 682.303  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 682.304  Methods for computing interest benefits and special allowance.

    (a) General. The Secretary pays a lender interest benefits and 
special allowance on eligible loans on a quarterly basis. These calendar 
quarters end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each 
year. A lender may use either the average daily balance method or the 
actual accrual method to determine the amount of interest benefits 
payable on a lender's loans. A lender shall use the average daily 
balance method to determine the balance on which the Secretary computes 
the amount of special allowance payable on its loans.
    (b) Average daily balance method for interest benefits. (1) Under 
this method, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on 
all loans qualifying for interest benefits at each actual interest rate 
for each day of the quarter, divides the sum by the number of days in 
the quarter, and rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The 
resulting figure is the average daily balance for qualified loans 
outstanding at each actual interest rate.
    (2) The Secretary computes the interest benefits due on all 
qualified loans at each actual interest rate by multiplying the average 
daily balance thereof by the actual interest rate, multiplying this 
result by the number of days in the quarter, and then dividing this 
result by the actual number of days in the year.
    (c) Actual accrual method for interest benefits. (1) Under this 
method, the lender computes the total unpaid principal balance 
outstanding on all qualified loans at each actual interest rate on each 
day of the quarter, multiplies this result by the actual interest rate, 
and divides this result by the actual number of days in the year, or, 
alternatively, 365.25 days. A lender who chooses to divide by 365.25 
days must do so for four consecutive years.
    (2) The interest benefits due for a quarter equal the sum of the 
daily interest benefits due, computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, for each day of the quarter.
    (d) Average daily balance method for special allowance. (1) To 
compute the average daily balance outstanding for purposes of special 
allowance, the lender adds the unpaid principal balance outstanding on 
all qualified loans at each applicable interest rate for each day of the 
quarter, divides this sum by the number of days in the quarter, and 
rounds the result to the nearest whole dollar. The resulting figure is 
the average daily balance for the quarter for qualifying loans at each 
applicable interest rate.
    (2) The Secretary computes the special allowance payable to a lender 
based upon the average daily balance computed by the lender under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1087-1)


<R05>
Sec. 682.305  Procedures for payment of interest benefits and special allowance.

    (a) General. (1) To receive payments of interest benefits and 
special allowance, a lender must submit quarterly reports to the 
Secretary on a form provided or prescribed by the Secretary.
    (2) The lender shall report, on the quarterly report required by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amount of origination fees it was 
authorized to collect and the amount of those fees refunded to borrowers 
during the quarter covered by the report.
    (3) The Secretary reduces the amount of interest benefits and 
special allowance payable to the lender by the amount of origination 
fees the lender was authorized to collect during the quarter under 
Sec. 682.202(c), whether or not the lender actually collected that 
amount. The Secretary increases the amount of interest benefits and 
special allowance payable to the lender by the amount of origination 
fees refunded to borrowers during the quarter under Sec. 682.202(c).
    (4) If an originating lender sells or otherwise transfers a loan to 
a new holder, the originating lender remains

[[Page 631]]

liable to the Secretary for payment of the origination fees. The 
Secretary will not pay interest benefits or special allowance to the new 
holder or pay reinsurance to the guaranty agency until the origination 
fees are paid to the Secretary.
    (b) Penalty interest. (1)(i) If the Secretary does not pay interest 
benefits or the special allowance within 30 days after the Secretary 
receives an accurate, timely, and complete request for payment from a 
lender, the Secretary pays the lender penalty interest.
    (ii) The payment of interest benefits or special allowance is deemed 
to occur, for purposes of this paragraph, when the Secretary--
    (A) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the lender;
    (B) Credits the payment due the lender against a debt that the 
Secretary determines is owed the Secretary by the lender; or
    (C) Authorizes the Treasury Department to pay the amount due by the 
lender to another Federal agency for credit against a debt that the 
Federal agency has determined the lender owes.
    (2) Penalty interest is an amount that accrues daily on interest 
benefits and special allowance due to the lender. The penalty interest 
is computed by--
    (i) Multiplying the daily interest rate applicable to loans on which 
payment for interest benefits was requested, by the amount of interest 
benefits due on those loans for each interest rate;
    (ii) Multiplying the daily special allowance rate applicable to 
loans on which special allowance was requested by the amount of special 
allowance due on those loans for each interest rate and special 
allowance category;
    (iii) Adding the results of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section to determine the gross penalty interest to be paid for each day 
that penalty interest is due;
    (iv) Dividing the results of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section 
by the gross amount of interest benefits and special allowance due to 
obtain the average penalty interest rate;
    (v) Multiplying the rate obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this 
section by the total amount of reduction to gross interest benefits and 
special allowance due (e.g., origination fees or other debts owed to the 
Federal government);
    (vi) Subtracting the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of 
this section from the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section to obtain the net amount of penalty interest due per day; 
and
    (vii) Multiplying the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of 
this section by the number of days calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) The Secretary pays penalty interest for the period--
    (i) Beginning on the later of--
    (A) The 31st day after the final day of the quarter covered by the 
request for payment; or
    (B) The 31st day after the Secretary's receipt of an accurate, 
timely, and complete request for payment from the lender; and
    (ii) Ending on the day the Secretary pays the interest benefits and 
the special allowance at issue, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (4) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is 
considered timely only if it is received by the Secretary within 90 days 
following the end of the quarter to which the request pertains.
    (5) A request for interest benefits and special allowance is not 
considered accurate and complete if it--
    (i) Requests payments to which the lender is not entitled under 
Secs. 682.300 through 682.302;
    (ii) Includes loans that the Secretary, in writing, has directed 
that the lender exclude from the request;
    (iii) Does not contain all information required by the Secretary or 
contains conflicting information; or
    (iv) Is not provided and certified on the form and in the manner 
prescribed by the Secretary.
    (c) Independent audits. (1) A lender shall arrange for an 
independent annual compliance audit conducted by a qualified independent 
organization or person.
    (2) The audit required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must--
    (i) Examine the lender's compliance with the Act and applicable 
regulations;

[[Page 632]]

    (ii) Examine the lender's financial management of its FFEL program 
activities;
    (iii) Be conducted in accordance with the standards for audits 
issued by the United States General Accounting Office's (GAO's) 
Government Auditing Standards. Procedures for audits are contained in an 
audit guide developed by and available from the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department;
    (iv) Be conducted at least annually and be submitted to the 
Secretary within six months of the end of the audit period. The initial 
audit must be of the lender's first fiscal year that begins after July 
23, 1992, and must be submitted within six months of the end of the 
audit period. Each subsequent audit must cover the lender's activities 
for the period beginning no later than the end of the period covered by 
the preceding audit;
    (v) With regard to a lender that is a governmental entity, the audit 
required by this paragraph must be conducted in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 7502 and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G; and
    (vi) With regard to a lender that is a nonprofit organization, the 
audit required by this paragraph must be conducted in accordance with 
OMB Circular A-133, Audit of Institutions of Higher Education and Other 
Nonprofit Institutions, as incorporated in 34 CFR 74.61(h)(3). If a 
nonprofit lender meets the criteria in Circular A-133 for choosing the 
option for a program-specific audit, and so chooses, the program-
specific audit must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(c)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (vii) The Secretary may determine that a lender has met the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if the lender has been 
audited in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 for other purposes, the lender 
submits the results of the audit to the Office of Inspector General, and 
the Secretary determines that the audit meets the requirements of this 
paragraph.

<R05>
Sec. 682.401  Basic program agreement.

    (a) General. In order to participate in the FFEL programs, a

following requirements at all times:
    (1) Aggregate loan limits. The aggregate guaranteed unpaid principal 
amount for all Stafford, SLS, PLUS loans made to a borrower may not 
exceed the amounts set forth in Sec. 682.204 (b), (e), and (h).
    (2) Annual loan limits. (i) The annual loan maximum amount for a

sources including, but not limited to--
    (1) Evidence of current income (e.g. proof of welfare benefits, 
Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, Workers' 
Compensation, child support, veterans' benefits, two most recent pay

those terms.
    (iv) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with written

in Sec. 682.607(c);
    (H) The school has not satisfied, within 30 days of issuance, a 
final judgment obtained by a student seeking a refund;
    (I) The school or an owner, director, or officer of the school is

    (ii) Limitation by a guaranty agency of a school's participation. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a school that is subject to limitation 
of participation in the guaranty agency's program may be either a school 
that is applying to participate in the agency's program for the first 
time, or a school that is renewing its application to continue 
participation in the agency's program. A guaranty agency may limit the 
total number of loans or the volume of loans made to students attending 
a particular school, or otherwise establish appropriate limitations on 
the school's participation, if the agency makes a determination that the 
school does not satisfy--
    (A) The standards of financial responsibility defined in 34 CFR 
668.5; or
    (B) The standards of administrative capability defined in 34 CFR 
668.16.
    (iii) Limitation, suspension, or termination of school eligibility. 
A guaranty agency may limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of 
an eligible school. If a guaranty agency limits, suspends, or terminates 
the participation of a school from the agency's program, the Secretary 
applies that limitation, suspension, or termination to all locations of 
the school.
    (iv) Condition for guaranteeing loans for students attending a 
school. The guaranty agency may require the school to execute a 
participation agreement with the agency and to submit documentation that 
establishes the school's eligibility to participate in the agency's 
program.
    (7) Lender eligibility. (i) An eligible lender may participate in 
the program of the agency under reasonable criteria established by the 
guaranty agency except to the extent that--
    (A) The lender's eligibility has been limited, suspended, or 
terminated by the Secretary under subpart G of this part or by the 
agency under standards and procedures that are substantially the same as 
those in subpart G of this part; or
    (B) The lender is disqualified by the Secretary under sections 
432(h)(1), 432(h)(2), 435(d)(3), or 435(d)(5) of the Act or

    (8) Out-of-State schools. The agency shall guarantee Stafford, SLS, 
and PLUS loans for students who are legal residents of any State served 
by the agency under Sec. 682.404(h)(2) but who attend schools out of 
that State and for parents who are legal residents of that State and are 
borrowing on behalf of students attending schools out of that State. In 
guaranteeing these loans, the agency may not impose any restrictions 
that it does not apply to borrowers who are legal residents of the State 
attending in-State schools or to parent

[[Page 636]]

borrowers who are legal residents of the State and are borrowing for 
students attending in-State schools.
    (9) Out-of-State residents. The agency shall guarantee Stafford, 
SLS, and PLUS loans for students who are not legal residents of any 
State served by the agency under Sec. 682.404(h)(2) but who attend 
schools in that State, and for parents who are not legal residents of 
that State and who are borrowing on behalf of students attending schools 
in that State. In guaranteeing these loans, the agency may not impose 
any restrictions that it does not apply to borrowers who are legal 
residents of the State attending in-State schools, or to parent 
borrowers who are legal residents of the State and who are borrowing for 
students attending in-State schools.
    (10) Insurance premiums. (i) Except for a SLS or PLUS loan 
refinanced under Sec. 682.209 (e) or (f), the guaranty agency may charge 
the lender an insurance premium on each Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan it 
guarantees.
    (ii) The guaranty agency may use the proceeds of this charge only to 
guarantee loans and to cover costs incurred by the guaranty agency in 
the administration of its loan guarantee program.
    (iii) The lender may deduct the amount of the premium from the 
borrower's loan proceeds. For a loan disbursed in more than one 
installment, the insurance premium must be deducted proportionately from 
each disbursement of the loan proceeds.
    (iv) The amount of the insurance premium may not exceed 3 percent of 
the principal balance of the loan.
    (v) The guaranty agency shall refund to the lender any insurance 
premium received for a loan under the circumstances specified in 
Sec. 682.401(b)(9)(vi) (A) and (B).
    (vi) The lender shall refund to the borrower by a credit against the 
borrower's loan balance the insurance premium paid by the borrower on a 
loan under the following circumstances:
    (A) The premium attributable to each disbursement of a loan must be 
refunded if the loan check is returned uncashed to the lender.

must be refunded by application to the borrower's account if--
    (1) The loan or a portion of a loan is returned by the school to the 
lender;
    (2) Within 120 days of disbursement, the loan is repaid in full;
    (3) Within 120 days of disbursement, the loan check has not been 
negotiated; or
    (4) Within 120 days of disbursement, the loan proceeds disbursed by 
electronic funds transfer or master check in accordance with 
Sec. 682.207(b)(1)(ii) (B) and (C) have not been released from the 
restricted account maintained by the school.
    (11) Payments for lender referral service. (i) The guaranty agency 
may not use insurance premiums to pay incentive fees to lenders, except 
to those lenders who agree to participate in and make FFEL loans (other 
than Stafford loans that do not qualify for interest benefits) to all 
eligible students referred under a qualified lender referral service.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term qualified lender 
referral service means a lender referral service offered by a guaranty 
agency under which the agency refers to a participating lender each 
eligible student applying for the service who is either a resident of 
the State in which the agency is the principal guaranty agency or 
attending a school in that State and who has sought and been unable to 
find a lender willing to make a FFEL loan (other than a Stafford loan 
that does not qualify for interest benefits) to the student.
    (iii) The Secretary will pay a lender referral fee to each guaranty 
agency with whom the Secretary has a lender referral agreement, an 
amount equal to 0.5 percent of the principal amount of a loan made as a 
result of the agency's referral service.
    (12) Administrative fee for Consolidation loans. The guaranty agency 
may charge a lender a fee, not to exceed $50, reasonably calculated to 
cover the agency's cost of increased or extended liability incurred in 
guaranteeing a Consolidation loan. The lender may not pass the fee on to 
the borrower. If it charges the fee, the agency must charge it for all 
loans made under the agency's Consolidation Loan program.

    (13) Administrative fee for refinancing fixed-rate PLUS or SLS 
loans. The guaranty agency may require a lender to pay to the guaranty 
agency up to 50 percent of the fee the lender charges a borrower under 
Sec. 682.202(e) for the purpose of defraying the agency's administrative 
costs incident to the guarantee of a lender's reissuance of a fixed-rate 
PLUS or SLS loan at a variable interest rate. If it charges the fee, the 
agency must charge the same fee to all lenders that refinance under this 
paragraph.

each loan guaranteed for loans first disbursed on or after October 1, 
1993.
    (15) Guarantee agency verification of default data. A guarantee 
agency shall respond to an institution's written request for 
verification of its default rate data for purposes of an appeal pursuant 
to 34 CFR 668.15(g)(1)(i) within 15 working days of the date the agency 
receives the institution's written request pursuant to 34 CFR 
668.15(g)(7), and simultaneously provide a copy of that response to the 
Secretary's designated Department official.
    (16) Guaranty agency administration. In the case of a State loan 
guarantee program administered by a State government, the program must

nonprofit institutions or organizations under the supervision of a 
single State agency. For this purpose, ``supervision'' includes, but is 
not limited to, setting policies and procedures, and having full 
responsibility for the operation of the program.

guarantee requested by a borrower seeking a transfer to secure a single 
guarantor, the guaranty agency may transfer its guarantee obligation on 
a loan to another guaranty agency, only with the approval of the 
Secretary, the transferee agency, and the holder of the loan.

request for information made under paragraph (b)(21)(i) of this section 
must be paid by the guaranty agency making the request.
    (24) Information of defaults. The guaranty agency shall upon the 
request of an eligible institution furnish information with respect to 
students, including the names and addresses of such students, who were 
enrolled at the eligible institution and who are in default on the 
repayment of any loan guaranteed by that agency.

    Editorial Note: At 59 FR 33353, June 28, 1994, paragraph (b)(24) was 
added. However, (b)(24) already exists. The Department of Education will 
publish a document in the Federal Register clarifying this error. The 
recently added paragraph follows.

    (24) Information on loan sales or transfers. The guaranty agency 
must, upon the request of an eligible school, furnish to the school last 
attended by the student, information with respect to the sale or 
transfer of a borrower's loan prior to the beginning of the repayment 
period, including--
    (i) Notice of the assignment;
    (ii) The identity of the assignee;
    (iii) The name and address of the party by which contact may be made 
with the holder concerning repayment of the loan; and
    (iv) The telephone number of the assignee, or if the assignee uses a 
lender servicer, another appropriate number for borrower inquiries.
    (25) Third-party servicers. The guaranty agency may not enter into a

does not meet the financial and compliance

[[Page 639]]

standards under Sec. 682.416. The guaranty agency shall provide the 
Secretary with the name and address of any third-party servicer with 
which the agency enters into a contract and, upon request by the 
Secretary, a copy of that contract.
    (26) [Reserved]
    (27) Collection Charges and Late Fees on Defaulted FFEL loans being 
Consolidated. (i) A guaranty agency may add collection costs in an 
amount not to exceed 18.5 percent of the outstanding principal and 
interest to a defaulted FFEL Program loan that is included in a Federal 
Consolidation loan.
    (ii) When returning the proceeds from the consolidation of a 
defaulted loan to the Secretary, a guaranty agency may only retain the 
amount added to the borrower's balance pursuant to paragraph (b)(27)(i) 
of this section.
    (28) Change in agency's records system. The agency shall provide 
written notification to the Secretary at least 30 days prior to placing 
its new guarantees or converting the records relating to its existing 
guaranty portfolio to an information or computer system that is owned 
by, or otherwise under the control of, an entity that is different than 
the party that owns or controls the agency's existing information or 
computer system. If the agency is soliciting bids from third parties 
with respect to a proposed conversion, the agency shall provide written 
notice to the Secretary as soon as the solicitation begins. The 
notifications described in this paragraph must include a concise 
description of the agency's conversion project and the actual or 
estimated cost of the project.
    (c)(1) Lender-of-last-resort. The guaranty agency must ensure that 
it or an eligible lender described in section 435(d)(1)(D) of the Act 
serves as a lender-of-last-resort in the State in which it is the 
principal guaranty agency, as defined in Sec. 682.800(d).
    (2) The lender-of-last-resort must make a subsidized Stafford loan 
to any eligible student who satisfies the lender's eligibility 
requirements and--
    (i) Qualifies for interest benefits, pursuant to Sec. 682.301, for a 
loan amount of at least $200; and
    (ii) Has been otherwise unable after conscientious efforts to obtain 
a loan from another eligible lender for the same period of enrollment.
    (3) The guaranty agency or an eligible lender described in section 
435(d)(1)(D) of the Act may arrange for a loan required to be made under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be made by another eligible lender.
    (4) The guaranty agency must develop policies and operating 
procedures for its lender-of-last-resort program that provide for the 
accessibility of lender-of-last-resort loans. These policies and 
procedures must be submitted to the Secretary for approval as required 
under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The policies and procedures for 
the agency's lender-of-last-resort program must ensure that--
    (i) The guaranty agency will serve eligible students attending any 
eligible school;
    (ii) The program establishes operating hours and methods of 
application designed to facilitate application by students; and
    (iii) Information about the availability of loans under the program 
is made available to schools in the State;
    (iv) Appropriate steps are taken to ensure that borrowers receiving 
loans
under the program are appropriately counseled on their loan obligation;
    (v) The guaranty agency will respond to a student within 60 days

submit to the Secretary its write-off criteria and procedures. The 
agency may not use these materials until the Secretary approves them.
    (2) The guaranty agency shall promptly submit to the Secretary its 
regulations, statements of procedures and standards, agreements, and 
other materials that substantially affect the operation of the agency's 
program, and any proposed changes to those materials. Except as provided 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the agency may use these materials 
unless and until the Secretary disapproves them.

[[Page 640]]

    (3) The guaranty agency shall use a common application form, 
promissory note, and other common forms approved by the Secretary.
    (4) The guaranty agency must develop and implement appropriate 
procedures that provide for the granting of a student deferment as 
specified in Sec. 682.210(a)(6)(iv) and (c)(3) and require their lenders 
to use these procedures.
    (5) The guaranty agency shall ensure that all program materials meet 
the requirements of Federal and State law, including, but not limited 
to, the Act and the regulations in this part and part 668.
    (e) Prohibited inducements. A guaranty agency may not--
    (1) Offer directly or indirectly any premium, payment, or other 
inducement to an employee or student of a school, or an entity or 
individual affiliated with a school, to secure applicants for FFEL 
loans;
    (2)(i) Offer, directly or indirectly, any premium, incentive 
payment, or other inducement to any lender, or any person acting as an 
agent, employee, or independent contractor of any lender or other 
guaranty agency to administer or market FFEL loans, other than 
unsubsidized Stafford loans or subsidized Stafford loans made under a 
guaranty agency's lender-of-last-resort program, in an effort to secure 
the guaranty agency as an insurer of FFEL loans. Examples of prohibited 
inducements include, but are not limited to--
    (A) Compensating lenders or their representatives for the purpose of 
securing loan applications for guarantee;
    (B) Performing functions normally performed by lenders without 
appropriate compensation;
    (C) Providing equipment or supplies to lenders at below market cost 
or rental; or
    (D) Offering to pay a lender, that does not hold loans guaranteed by 
the agency, a fee for each application forwarded for the agency's 
guarantee.
    (ii) For the purposes of this section, the terms ``premium'', 
``inducement'', and ``incentive'' do not include services directly 
related to the enhancement of the administration of the FFEL Program the 
guaranty agency generally provides to lenders that participate in its 
program. However, the terms ``premium'', ``inducement'', and 
``incentive'' do apply to other activities specifically intended to 
secure a lender's participation in the agency's program.
    (3) Conduct unsolicited mailings of student loan application forms 
to students enrolled in secondary school;
    (4) Conduct fraudulent or misleading advertising concerning loan 
availability.

<R05>
Sec. 682.402  Death, disability, closed school, false certification, and bankruptcy payments.

    (a) General. (1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on 
filing for relief in bankruptcy, and discharge of loans due to death, 
total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, and 
false certification by a school of a borrower's eligibility for a loan, 
are set forth in this section.
    (2) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, or a 
Consolidation loan was obtained by a married couple, and only one of the 
borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection 
of his or her loan obligation stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that 
obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains 
obligated to repay the loan.
    (3) Except for a borrower's loan obligation discharged by the 
Secretary under the false certification discharge provision of 
paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a loan qualifies for payment 
under this section only to the extent that the loan is legally 
enforceable under applicable law by the holder of the loan.
    (4) For purposes of this section--
    (i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on 
the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative tribunal of competent 
jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with

[[Page 641]]

respect to another loan in a judgment that collaterally estops the 
holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan;
    (ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable 
to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant to an objection 
presented in a proceeding conducted in connection with credit bureau 
reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment, or in any other 
administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and
    (iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another 
party about the legal enforceability of the loan and no determination 
has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the 
Secretary may authorize the payment of a claim under this section under 
conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary 
determines in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this 
section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable 
obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund 
that amount of the payment to the Secretary.
    (b) Death. (1) If an individual borrower dies, or, on or after July 
23, 1992 the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the 
obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments 
on the loan is discharged.
    (2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender 
may rely on a death certificate or other proof of death that is 
acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other 
acceptable proof of death is not available, the borrower's obligation on 
the loan can be discharged only if the guaranty agency determines that 
other evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died.
    (3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or 
student) has died, the lender, if it believes the information to be 
reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and 
promptly request that the borrower's representative (or the student's 
parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection 
activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the lender shall diligently 
attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) 
death. If, despite diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm 
the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender shall 
resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued 
and is deemed to have exercised forbearance as to repayment of the loan 
during the period when collection activity was suspended.
    (4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender may not 
attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any 
endorser.
    (5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from 
the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after the date of the 
borrower's (or student's) death.
    (c) Total and permanent disability. (1) If the lender determines 
that an individual borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the 
obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments 
on the loan is discharged. A borrower is not considered totally and 
permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the 
time he or she applied for the loan, unless the borrower's condition has 
substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally 
and permanently disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the 
borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the time 
the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the 
condition has substantially deteriorated, so as to render the borrower 
totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the 
date the Consolidation loan was made, the borrower must provide the 
lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans if the 
information does not already appear in the borrower's loan file 
possessed by the lender.
    (2) After being notified by the borrower or the borrower's 
representative that the borrower claims to be totally and permanently 
disabled, the lender promptly shall request that the borrower or the 
borrower's representative submit on a form provided or approved

[[Page 642]]

by the Secretary a certification by a physician who is a doctor of 
medicine or osteopathy and legally authorized to practice in a State 
that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled. The lender shall 
continue collection until it receives either the certification of total 
disability or a letter from a physician stating that the certification 
has been requested and that additional time is needed to determine if 
the borrower is totally and permanently disabled. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, after receiving the physician's 
certification or letter, the lender may not attempt to collect from the 
borrower or any endorser.
    (3) After being notified that the guaranty agency has paid a 
disability discharge claim, the lender shall return to the sender any 
payments received by the lender after the date that the borrower became 
totally and permanently disabled as certified by the physician. At the 
same time that the lender returns the payment, it shall notify the 
borrower that there is no obligation to repay a loan discharged on the 
basis of disability.
    (4) If the lender determines that a borrower who claims to be 
totally and permanently disabled is not in fact disabled, or if the 
lender does not receive the physician's certification of total 
disability within 60 days of the receipt of the physician's letter 
requesting additional time, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the lender shall resume collection and shall be deemed to have 
exercised forbearance of payment of both principal and interest from the 
date the lender received the physician's letter requesting additional 
time and may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any 
interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (d) Closed school--(1) General. (i) The Secretary reimburses the 
holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after January 1, 1986, and 
discharges the borrower's obligation with respect to the loan in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, if the 
borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan) could 
not complete the program of study for which the loan was intended 
because the school at which the borrower (or student) was enrolled, 
closed, or the borrower (or student) withdrew from the school not more 
than 90 days prior to the date the school closed. This 90-day period may 
be extended if the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstances 
related to a school's closing would justify an extension.
    (ii) For purposes of the closed school discharge authorized by this 
section--
    (A) A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to 
provide educational instruction in all programs, as determined by the 
Secretary;
    (B) The term ``borrower'' includes all endorsers on a loan; and
    (C) A ``school'' means a school's main campus or any location or 
branch of the main campus, regardless of whether the school or its 
location or branch is considered eligible.
    (2) Relief available pursuant to discharge. (i) Discharge under 
paragraph (d) of this section relieves the borrower of an existing or 
past obligation to repay the loan and any charges imposed or costs 
incurred by the holder with respect to the loan that the borrower is, or 
was otherwise obligated to pay.
    (ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (d) of this section 
qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or 
through enforced collection on a loan obligation discharged under 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under 
paragraph (d) of this section is not regarded as in default on the loan 
after discharge, and is eligible to receive assistance under the Title 
IV, HEA programs.
    (iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (d) of this section must 
be reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting agencies to which 
the holder previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete 
all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.
    (3) Borrower qualification for discharge. In order to qualify for 
discharge of a loan under paragraph (d) of this section a borrower shall 
submit to the holder of the loan a written request and sworn statement. 
The statement need not be notarized, but must be made by the borrower 
under penalty of perjury, and,

[[Page 643]]

in the statement, the borrower shall state--
    (i) Whether the student has made a claim with respect to the 
school's closing with any third party, such as the holder of a 
performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and if so, the amount of 
any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the 
borrower's loan obligation;
    (ii) That the borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a 
PLUS loan)--
    (A) Received, on or after January 1, 1986, the proceeds of any 
disbursement of a loan disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after 
January 1, 1986 to attend a school;
    (B) Did not complete the educational program at that school because 
the school closed while the student was enrolled or on an approved leave 
of absence in accordance with Sec. 682.605(c), or the student withdrew 
from the school not more than 90 days before the school closed; and
    (C) Did not complete the program of study through a teach-out at 
another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at 
the closed school to another school;
    (iii) That the borrower agrees to provide, upon request by the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, other documentation reasonably 
available to the borrower that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, that the student meets the 
qualifications in paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (iv) That the borrower agrees to cooperate with the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section, and to transfer any right to recovery against a 
third party in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
    (4) Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions. (i) In any 
judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee to recover for amounts discharged under paragraph 
(d) of this section or to take other enforcement action with respect to 
the conduct on which those claims were based, a borrower who requests or 
receives a discharge under paragraph (d) of this section must cooperate 
with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. At the request of the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, and upon the Secretary's or the 
Secretary's designee's tendering to the borrower the fees and costs as 
are customarily provided in litigation to reimburse witnesses, the 
borrower shall--
    (A) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the 
borrower to support a request for discharge; and
    (B) Produce any documentation reasonably available to the borrower 
with respect to those representations and any sworn statement required 
by the Secretary with respect to those representations and documents.
    (ii) The Secretary revokes the discharge, or denies the request for 
discharge, of a borrower who--
    (A) Fails to provide testimony, sworn statements, or documentation 
to support material representations made by the borrower to obtain the 
discharge; or
    (B) Provides testimony, a sworn statement, or documentation that 
does not support the material representations made by the borrower to 
obtain the discharge.
    (5) Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery 
against third parties. (i) Upon discharge under paragraph (d) of this 
section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in 
favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount 
discharged) that the borrower (or student) may have by contract or 
applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for 
the program for which the loan was received, against the school, its 
principals, affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any 
private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents 
funds received from a private party.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply 
notwithstanding any provision of State law that would otherwise restrict 
transfer of such rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a 
transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a 
scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to 
recover on those rights.
    (iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or 
foreclosing the

[[Page 644]]

borrower's (or student's) right to pursue legal and equitable relief 
regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise unrelated to the loan 
discharged.
    (6) Guaranty agency responsibilities--(i) Procedures applicable if a 
school closed on or after January 1, 1986, but prior to June 13, 1994. 
(A) If a borrower received a loan for attendance at a school with a 
closure date on or after January 1, 1986, but prior to June 13, 1994, 
the loan may be discharged in accordance with the procedures specified 
in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section.
    (B) If a loan subject to paragraph (d) of this section was 
discharged in part in accordance with the Secretary's ``Closed School 
Policy'' as authorized by section IV of Bulletin 89-G-159, the guaranty 
agency shall initiate the discharge of the remaining balance of the loan 
not later than August 13, 1994.
    (C) A guaranty agency shall review its records and identify all 
schools that appear to have closed on or after January 1, 1986 and prior 
to June 13, 1994, and shall identify the loans made to any borrower (or 
student) who appears to have been enrolled at the school on the school 
closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the closure 
date.
    (D) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately if it 
determines that a school not previously known to have closed appears to 
have closed, and, within 30 days of making that determination, notify 
all lenders participating in its program to suspend collection efforts 
against individuals with respect to loans made for attendance at the 
closed school, if the student to whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was 
made, appears to have been enrolled at the school on the closing date, 
or withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the date the school appears 
to have closed. Within 30 days after receiving confirmation of the date 
of a school's closure from the Secretary, the agency shall--
    (1) Notify all lenders participating in its program to mail a 
discharge application explaining the procedures and eligibility criteria 
for obtaining a discharge and an explanation of the information that 
must be included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to all 
borrowers who may be eligible for a closed school discharge; and
    (2) Review the records of loans that it holds, identify the loans 
made to any borrower (or student) who appears to have been enrolled at 
the school on the school closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 
days prior to the closure date, and mail a discharge application and an 
explanation of the information that must be included in the sworn 
statement (which may be combined) to the borrower. The application shall 
inform the borrower of the procedures and eligibility criteria for 
obtaining a discharge.
    (E) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(D)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is known, the guaranty agency shall 
immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan 
received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may 
continue to receive borrower payments), and notify the borrower that the 
agency will provide additional information about the procedures for 
requesting a discharge after the agency has received confirmation from 
the Secretary that the school had closed.
    (F) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(D)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is unknown, the agency shall, by June 13, 
1995, further refine the list of borrowers whose loans are potentially 
subject to discharge under paragraph (d) of this section by consulting 
with representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing 
agency, accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. Upon learning 
the new address of a borrower who would still be considered potentially 
eligible for a discharge, the guaranty agency shall, within 30 days 
after learning the borrower's new address, mail to the borrower a 
discharge application that meets the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(6)(i)(E) of this section.
    (G) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this section has satisfied all of the 
conditions required for a discharge, the agency shall notify the 
borrower in writing of

[[Page 645]]

that determination within 30 days after making that determination.
    (H) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this section does not qualify for a 
discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in writing of that 
determination and the reasons for it within 30 days after the date the 
agency--
    (1) Made that determination based on information available to the 
guaranty agency;
    (2) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had not closed;
    (3) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had closed on a 
date that was more than 90 days after the borrower (or student) withdrew 
from the school;
    (4) Was notified by the Secretary that the borrower (or student) was 
ineligible for a closed school discharge for other reasons; or
    (5) Received the borrower's completed application and sworn 
statement.
    (I) If a borrower described in paragraph (d)(6)(i)(E) or (F) of this 
section fails to submit the written request and sworn statement 
described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section within 60 days of being 
notified of that option, the guaranty agency shall resume collection and 
shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal 
and interest from the date it suspended collection activity. The agency 
may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued 
and not paid during that period.
    (J) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied solely on 
the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the lender, guaranty 
agency, or the Secretary.
    (ii) Procedures applicable if a school closed on or after June 13, 
1994. (A) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately 
whenever it becomes aware of reliable information indicating a school 
may have closed. The designated guaranty agency in the state in which 
the school is located shall promptly investigate whether the school has 
closed and, within 30 days after receiving information indicating that 
the school may have closed, report the results of its investigation to 
the Secretary concerning the date of the school's closure and whether a 
teach-out of the closed school's program was made available to students.
    (B) If a guaranty agency determines that a school appears to have 
closed, it shall, within 30 days of making that determination, notify 
all lenders participating in its program to suspend collection efforts 
against individuals with respect to loans made for attendance at the 
closed school, if the student to whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was 
made, appears to have been enrolled at the school on the closing date, 
or withdrew not more than 90 days prior to the date the school appears 
to have closed. Within 30 days after receiving confirmation of the date 
of a school's closure from the Secretary, the agency shall--
    (1) Notify all lenders participating in its program to mail a 
discharge application explaining the procedures and eligibility criteria 
for obtaining a discharge and an explanation of the information that 
must be included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to all 
borrowers who may be eligible for a closed school discharge; and
    (2) Review the records of loans that it holds, identify the loans 
made to any borrower (or student) who appears to have been enrolled at 
the school on the school closure date or who withdrew not more than 90 
days prior to the closure date, and mail a discharge application and an 
explanation of the information that must be included in the sworn 
statement (which may be combined) to the borrower. The application shall 
inform the borrower of the procedures and eligibility criteria for 
obtaining a discharge.
    (C) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is known, the guaranty agency shall 
immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan 
received for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may 
continue to receive borrower payments), and notify the borrower that the 
agency will provide additional information about the procedures for 
requesting a discharge after the agency

[[Page 646]]

has received confirmation from the Secretary that the school had closed.
    (D) If a loan identified under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(2) of this 
section is held by the guaranty agency as a defaulted loan and the 
borrower's current address is unknown, the agency shall, within one year 
after identifying the borrower, attempt to locate the borrower and 
further determine the borrower's potential eligibility for a discharge 
under paragraph (d) of this section by consulting with representatives 
of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, accrediting agency, 
and other appropriate parties. Upon learning the new address of a 
borrower who would still be considered potentially eligible for a 
discharge, the guaranty agency shall, within 30 days after learning the 
borrower's new address, mail to the borrower a discharge application 
that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (E) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) or (D) of this section has satisfied all of the 
conditions required for a discharge, the agency shall notify the 
borrower in writing of that determination within 30 days after making 
that determination.
    (F) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower identified in 
paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) or (D) of this section does not qualify for a 
discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in writing of that 
determination and the reasons for it within 30 days after the date the 
agency--
    (1) Made that determination based on information available to the 
guaranty agency;
    (2) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had not closed;
    (3) Was notified by the Secretary that the school had closed on a 
date that was more than 90 days after the borrower (or student) withdrew 
from the school;
    (4) Was notified by the Secretary that the borrower (or student) was 
ineligible for a closed school discharge for other reasons; or
    (5) Received the borrower's completed application and sworn 
statement.
    (G) Upon receipt of a closed school discharge claim filed by a 
lender, the agency shall review the borrower's request and supporting 
sworn statement in the light of information available from the records 
of the agency and from other sources, including other guaranty agencies, 
state authorities, and cognizant accrediting associations, and shall 
take the following actions--
    (1) If the agency determines that the borrower satisfies the 
requirements for discharge under paragraph (d) of this section, it shall 
pay the claim in accordance with Sec. 682.402(h) not later than 90 days 
after the agency received the claim; or
    (2) If the agency determines that the borrower does not qualify for 
a discharge, the agency shall, not later than 90 days after the agency 
received the claim, return the claim to the lender with an explanation 
of the reasons for its determination.
    (H) If a borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section within 60 days 
of being notified of that option, the lender or guaranty agency shall 
resume collection and shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of 
payment of principal and interest from the date it suspended collection 
activity. The lender or guaranty agency may capitalize, in accordance 
with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that 
period.
    (I) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied solely on 
the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the lender, guaranty 
agency, or the Secretary.
    (7) Lender responsibilities. (i) A lender shall comply with the 
requirements prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. In the absence 
of specific instructions from a guaranty agency or the Secretary, if a 
lender receives information from a source it believes to be reliable 
indicating that an existing or former borrower may be eligible for a 
loan discharge under paragraph (d) of this section, the lender shall 
immediately notify the guaranty agency, and suspend any efforts to 
collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study 
for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower 
payments).

[[Page 647]]

    (ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section within 60 days 
after being notified of that option, the lender shall resume collection 
and shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of 
principal and interest from the date the lender suspended collection 
activity. The lender may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), 
any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (iii) The lender shall file a closed school claim with the guaranty 
agency in accordance with Sec. 682.402(g) no later than 60 days after 
the lender receives the borrower's written request and sworn statement 
described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If a lender receives a 
payment made by or on behalf of the borrower on the loan after the 
lender files a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender 
shall forward the payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its 
receipt. The lender shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in 
determining whether the borrower is eligible for discharge of the loan.
    (iv) Within 30 days after receiving reimbursement from the guaranty 
agency for a closed school claim, the lender shall notify the borrower 
that the loan obligation has been discharged, and request that all 
credit bureaus to which it previously reported the status of the loan 
delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.
    (v) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that 
the borrower's request for a closed school discharge has been denied, 
the lender shall resume collection and notify the borrower of the 
reasons for the denial. The lender shall be deemed to have exercised 
forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date the 
lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, in accordance 
with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that 
period.
    (e) False certification by a school of a student's eligibility to 
borrow and unauthorized disbursements--(1) General. (i) The Secretary 
reimburses the holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after 
January 1, 1986, and discharges a current or former borrower's 
obligation with respect to the loan in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (e) of this section, if the borrower's (or the student for 
whom a parent received a PLUS loan) eligibility to receive the loan was 
falsely certified by an eligible school. For purposes of a false 
certification discharge, the term ``borrower'' includes all endorsers on 
a loan. A student's eligibility to borrow shall be considered to have 
been falsely certified by the school if the school--
    (A) Certified the student's eligibility for a FFEL Program loan on 
the basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did 
not meet the applicable requirements described in 34 CFR Part 668 and 
section 484(d) of the Act, as applicable and as described in paragraph 
(e)(13) of this section; or
    (B) Signed the borrower's name without authorization by the borrower 
on the loan application or promissory note.
    (ii) The Secretary discharges the obligation of a borrower with 
respect to a loan disbursement for which the school, without the 
borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or 
authorization for electronic funds transfer, unless the student for whom 
the loan was made received the proceeds of the loan either by actual 
delivery of the loan funds or by a credit in the amount of the contested 
disbursement applied to charges owed to the school for that portion of 
the educational program completed by the student. However, the Secretary 
does not reimburse the lender with respect to any amount disbursed by 
means of a check bearing an unauthorized endorsement unless the school 
also executed the application or promissory note for that loan for the 
named borrower without that individual's consent.
    (2) Relief available pursuant to discharge. (i) Discharge under 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section relieves the borrower of an existing 
or past obligation to repay the loan certified by the school, and any 
charges imposed or costs incurred by the holder with respect to the loan 
that the borrower is, or was, otherwise obligated to pay.
    (ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section 
qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of

[[Page 648]]

amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on a loan 
obligation discharged under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under 
paragraph (e) of this section is not regarded as in default on the loan 
after discharge, and is eligible to receive assistance under the Title 
IV, HEA programs.
    (iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section is 
reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting agencies to which 
the holder previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete 
all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.
    (v) Discharge under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section qualifies 
the borrower for relief only with respect to the amount of the 
disbursement discharged.
    (3) Borrower qualification for discharge. In order to qualify for 
discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section the borrower 
shall submit to the holder of the loan a written request and a sworn 
statement. The statement need not be notarized, but must be made by the 
borrower under penalty of perjury, and, in the statement, the borrower 
shall--
    (i) State whether the student has made a claim with respect to the 
school's false certification with any third party, such as the holder of 
a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and if so, the amount 
of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the 
borrower's loan obligation;
    (ii) In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge based on the 
school's defective testing of the student's ability to benefit, state 
that the borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS 
loan)--
    (A) Received, on or after January 1, 1986, the proceeds of any 
disbursement of a loan disbursed, in whole or in part, on or after 
January 1, 1986 to attend a school;
    (B) Was admitted to that school on the basis of ability to benefit 
from its training and did not meet the applicable requirements for 
admission on the basis of ability to benefit as described in paragraph 
(e)(13) of this section; and
    (C) Withdrew from the school and did not find employment in the 
occupation for which the program was intended to provide training, or 
completed the training program for which the loan was made and made a 
reasonable attempt to obtain employment in the occupation for which the 
program was intended to provide training, and--
    (1) Was not able to find employment in that occupation; or
    (2) Obtained employment in that occupation only after receiving 
additional training that was not provided by the school that certified 
the loan;
    (iii) In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the 
school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory 
note--
    (A) State that the signature on either of those documents was not 
the signature of the borrower; and
    (B) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two of 
which must be not earlier or later than one year before or after the 
date of the contested signature;
    (iv) In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the 
school, without authorization of the borrower, endorsed the borrower's 
name on the loan check or signed the authorization for electronic funds 
transfer or master check, the borrower shall--
    (A) Certify that he or she did not endorse the loan check or sign 
the authorization for electronic funds transfer or master check, or 
authorize the school to do so;
    (B) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two of 
which must be not earlier or later than one year before or after the 
date of the contested signature; and
    (C) State that the proceeds of the contested disbursement were not 
received either through actual delivery of the loan funds or by a credit 
in the amount of the contested disbursement applied to charges owed to 
the school for that portion of the educational program completed by the 
student;
    (v) That the borrower agrees to provide upon request by the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, other documentation reasonably 
available to the borrower, that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, that the student

[[Page 649]]

meets the qualifications in paragraph (e) of this section; and
    (vi) That the borrower agrees to cooperate with the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section, and to transfer any right to recovery against a 
third party in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
    (4) Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions. (i) In any 
judicial or administrative proceeding brought by the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee to recover for amounts discharged under paragraph 
(e) of this section or to take other enforcement action with respect to 
the conduct on which those claims were based, a borrower who requests or 
receives a discharge under paragraph (e) of this section must cooperate 
with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. At the request of the 
Secretary or the Secretary's designee, and upon the Secretary's or the 
Secretary's designee's tendering to the borrower the fees and costs as 
are customarily provided in litigation to reimburse witnesses, the 
borrower shall--
    (A) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the 
borrower to support a request for discharge; and
    (B) Produce any documentation reasonably available to the borrower 
with respect to those representations and any sworn statement required 
by the Secretary with respect to those representations and documents.
    (ii) The Secretary revokes the discharge, or denies the request for 
discharge, of a borrower who--
    (A) Fails to provide testimony, sworn statements, or documentation 
to support material representations made by the borrower to obtain the 
discharge; or
    (B) Provides testimony, a sworn statement, or documentation that 
does not support the material representations made by the borrower to 
obtain the discharge.
    (5) Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery 
against third parties. (i) Upon discharge under paragraph (e) of this 
section, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in 
favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount 
discharged) that the borrower (or student) may have by contract or 
applicable law with respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for 
the program for which the loan was received, against the school, its 
principals, affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any 
private fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents 
funds received from a private party.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraph (e) of this section apply 
notwithstanding any provision of state law that would otherwise restrict 
transfer of such rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a 
transferee from exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a 
scheme of distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to 
recover on those rights.
    (iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or 
foreclosing the borrower's (or student's) right to pursue legal and 
equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise 
unrelated to the loan discharged.
    (6) Guaranty agency responsibilities--general. (i) A guaranty agency 
shall notify the Secretary immediately whenever it becomes aware of 
reliable information indicating that a school may have falsely certified 
a student's eligibility or caused an unauthorized disbursement of loan 
proceeds, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The 
designated guaranty agency in the state in which the school is located 
shall promptly investigate whether the school has falsely certified a 
student's eligibility and, within 30 days after receiving information 
indicating that the school may have done so, report the results of its 
preliminary investigation to the Secretary.
    (ii) If the guaranty agency receives information it believes to be 
reliable indicating that a borrower whose loan is held by the agency may 
be eligible for a discharge under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
agency shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the 
borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the 
loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments), and 
inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.
    (iii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of

[[Page 650]]

this section within 60 days of being notified of that option, the 
guaranty agency shall resume collection and shall be deemed to have 
exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date 
it suspended collection activity. The agency may capitalize, in 
accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid 
during that period.
    (iv) Upon receipt of a discharge claim filed by a lender or a 
request submitted by a borrower with respect to a loan held by the 
guaranty agency, the agency shall have up to 90 days to determine 
whether the discharge should be granted. The agency shall review the 
borrower's request and supporting sworn statement in light of 
information available from the records of the agency and from other 
sources, including other guaranty agencies, state authorities, and 
cognizant accrediting associations.
    (v) A borrower's request for discharge and sworn statement may not 
be denied solely on the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by 
the lender or the guaranty agency.
    (7) Guaranty agency responsibilities with respect to a claim filed 
by a lender based on the borrower's assertion that he or she did not 
sign the loan application or the promissory note, or that the school 
failed to test, or improperly tested, the student's ability to benefit. 
(i) The agency shall evaluate the borrower's request and consider 
relevant information it possesses and information available from other 
sources, and follow the procedures described in paragraph (e)(7) of this 
section.
    (ii) If the agency determines that the borrower satisfies the 
requirements for discharge under paragraph (e) of this section, it 
shall, not later than 30 days after the agency makes that determination, 
pay the claim in accordance with Sec. 682.402(h) and--
    (A) Notify the borrower that his or her liability with respect to 
the amount of the loan has been discharged, and that the lender has been 
informed of the actions required under paragraph (e)(7)(ii)(C) of this 
section;
    (B) Refund to the borrower all amounts paid by the borrower to the 
lender or the agency with respect to the discharged loan amount, 
including any late fees or collection charges imposed by the lender or 
agency related to the discharged loan amount; and
    (C) Notify the lender that the borrower's liability with respect to 
the amount of the loan has been discharged, and that the lender must--
    (1) Immediately terminate any collection efforts against the 
borrower with respect to the discharged loan amount and any charges 
imposed or costs incurred by the lender related to the discharged loan 
amount that the borrower is, or was, otherwise obligated to pay; and
    (2) Within 30 days, report to all credit reporting agencies to which 
the lender previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete 
all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.
    (iii) If the agency determines that the borrower does not qualify 
for a discharge, it shall, within 30 days after making that 
determination--
    (A) Notify the lender that the borrower's liability on the loan is 
not discharged and that, depending on the borrower's decision under 
paragraph (e)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, the loan shall either be 
returned to the lender or paid as a default claim; and
    (B) Notify the borrower that the borrower does not qualify for 
discharge, and state the reasons for that conclusion. The agency shall 
advise the borrower that he or she remains obligated to repay the loan 
and warn the borrower of the consequences of default, and explain that 
the borrower will be considered to be in default on the loan unless the 
borrower submits a written statement to the agency within 30 days 
stating that the borrower--
    (1) Acknowledges the debt and, if payments are due, will begin or 
resume making those payments to the lender; or
    (2) Requests the Secretary to review the agency's decision.
    (iv) Within 30 days after receiving the borrower's written statement 
described in paragraph (e)(7)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, the agency 
shall return the claim file to the lender and notify the lender to 
resume collection efforts if payments are due.
    (v) Within 30 days after receiving the borrower's request for review 
by the Secretary, the agency shall forward the

[[Page 651]]

claim file to the Secretary for his review and take the actions required 
under paragraph (e)(11) of this section.
    (vi) The agency shall pay a default claim to the lender within 30 
days after the borrower fails to return either of the written statements 
described in paragraph (e)(7)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (8) Guaranty agency responsibilities with respect to a claim filed 
by a lender based only on the borrower's assertion that he or she did 
not sign the loan check or the authorization for the release of loan 
funds via electronic funds transfer or master check. (i) The agency 
shall evaluate the borrower's request and consider relevant information 
it possesses and information available from other sources, and follow 
the procedures described in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.

[[Page 652]]

    (A) Notify the lender that the borrower's liability on the loan is 
not discharged and that, depending on the borrower's decision under 
paragraph (e)(8)(iv)(B) of this section, the loan shall either be

    (B) Notify the borrower that the borrower does not qualify for 
discharge, and state the reasons for that conclusion. The agency shall 
advise the borrower that he or she remains obligated to repay the loan

the borrower will be considered to be in default on the loan unless the 
borrower submits a written statement to the agency within 30 days

    (ii) The Secretary notifies the agency and the borrower of a

    (iii) If the Secretary determines that the borrower meets the 
requirements for a discharge under paragraph (e) of this section, the

(e)(9)(ii), (e)(10)(ii), or (e)(10)(iii) of this section, as applicable.
    (12) Lender Responsibilities. (i) If the lender is notified by a 
guaranty agency or the Secretary, or receives information it believes to 
be reliable from another source indicating that a current or former 
borrower may be eligible for a discharge under paragraph (e) of this 
section, the lender shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect 
from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for 
which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments) 
and, within 30 days of receiving the information or notification, inform 
the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.
    (ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section within 60 days 
of being notified of that option, the lender shall resume collection and 
shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal 
and interest from the date the lender suspended collection activity. The 
lender may capitalize, in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest 
accrued and not paid during that period.
    (iii) The lender shall file a claim with the guaranty agency in 
accordance with Sec. 682.402(g) no later than 60 days after the lender 
receives the borrower's written request and sworn statement described in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If a lender receives a payment made by 
or on behalf of the borrower on the loan after the lender files a claim 
on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the 
payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The lender 
shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining whether 
the borrower is eligible for discharge of the loan.
    (iv) The lender shall comply with all instructions received from the 
Secretary or a guaranty agency with respect to loan discharges under 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (v) The lender shall review a claim that the borrower did not 
endorse and did not receive the proceeds of a loan check. The lender 
shall take the actions required under paragraphs (e)(8)(ii)(A) and (B) 
of this section if it determines that the borrower did not endorse the 
loan check, unless the lender secures persuasive evidence that the 
proceeds of the loan were received by the borrower or the student for 
whom the loan was made, as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). If the 
lender determines that the loan check was properly endorsed or the 
proceeds were received by the borrower or student, the lender may 
consider the borrower's objection to repayment as a statement of 
intention not to repay the loan, and may file a claim with the guaranty 
agency for reimbursement on that ground, but shall not report the loan 
to credit bureaus as in default until the guaranty agency, or, as 
applicable, the Secretary, reviews the claim for relief. By filing such 
a claim, the lender shall be deemed to have agreed to the following--
    (A) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower 
endorsed the loan check or the proceeds of the loan were received by the 
borrower or the student, any failure to satisfy due diligence 
requirements by the lender prior to the filing of the claim that would 
have resulted in the loss of reinsurance on the loan in the event of 
default will be waived by the Secretary; and
    (B) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower 
did not endorse the loan check and that the

[[Page 655]]

proceeds of the loan were not received by the borrower or the student, 
the lender will comply with the requirements specified in paragraph 
(e)(8)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (vi) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that 
the borrower's request for a discharge has been denied, the lender shall 
notify the borrower of the reasons for the denial and, if payments are 
due, resume collection against the borrower. The lender shall be deemed 
to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from 
the date the lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, 
in accordance with Sec. 682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid 
during that period.
    (13) Requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit.

one before the scheduled completion of the program of instruction is 
deemed to have the ability to benefit from the training offered by the 
school.
    (ii) A student not described in paragraph (e)(13)(i) of this section 
is considered to have the ability to benefit from training offered by 
the school if the student--

determined by the school to have the ability to benefit from the 
school's training in accordance with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.6;
    (B) For periods of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1987,

requirements for employment (in the student's State of residence) in the 
occupation for which the training program supported by the loan was

dismissed, the lender shall treat the loan as if the lender had 
exercised forbearance as to repayment of principal and interest accrued 
from the date of the borrower's filing of the bankruptcy petition until 
the date the lender is notified that the bankruptcy proceeding is 
completed or dismissed.

    (A) Whether the first payment on the loan was due less than 7 years 
(exclusive of any applicable suspension of the repayment period) before 
the filing of the petition for relief commencing the bankruptcy case; 
and
    (B) Whether repayment under either the current repayment schedule or 
any adjusted schedule authorized under this part would impose an undue 
hardship on the borrower and his or her dependents.
    (ii) If the agency determines that repayment would not constitute an 
undue hardship, the agency shall then determine whether the expected 
costs of opposing the discharge petition would exceed one-third of the 
total amount owed on the loan, including principal, interest, late 
charges, and collection costs.
    (iii) If the expected costs of opposing the discharge petition do 
not exceed one-third of the total amount owed on the loan, the agency 
shall--
    (A) Oppose the borrower's petition for a determination of 
dischargeability; and
    (B) If the borrower is in default on the loan, seek a judgment for 
the amount owed on the loan.
    (iv) In opposing a petition for a determination of dischargeability 
on the grounds of undue hardship, a guaranty agency may agree to 
discharge of a portion of the amount owed on a loan if it reasonably 
determines that the agreement is necessary in order to obtain a judgment 
on the remainder of the loan.
    (2) Response by a guaranty agency to plans proposed under Chapters 
11, 12, and 13. The guaranty agency shall take the following actions 
when a petition for relief in bankruptcy under Chapters 11, 12, or 13 is 
filed:
    (i) The agency is not required to respond to a proposed plan that--
    (A) Provides for repayment of the full outstanding balance of the 
loan;
    (B) Makes no provision with regard to the loan or to general 
unsecured claims.
    (ii) In any other case, the agency shall determine, based on a 
review of its own records and documents filed by the debtor in the 
bankruptcy proceeding--
    (A) What part of the loan obligation will be discharged under the 
plan as proposed;
    (B) Whether the plan itself or the classification of the loan under 
the plan meets the requirements of 11 U.S.C. 1129, 1225, or 1325, as 
applicable; and

[[Page 659]]

    (C) Whether grounds exist under 11 U.S.C. 1112, 1208, or 1307, as 
applicable, to move for conversion or dismissal of the case.
    (iii) If the agency determines that grounds exist to challenge the 
proposed plan, the agency shall, as appropriate, object to the plan or 
move to dismiss the case, if--
    (A) The costs of litigation of these actions are not reasonably 
expected to exceed one-third of the amount of the loan to be discharged 
under the plan; and
    (B) With respect to an objection under 11 U.S.C. 1325, the 
additional amount that may be recovered under the plan if an objection 
is successful can reasonably be expected to equal or exceed the cost of 
litigating the objection.
    (iv) The agency shall monitor the debtor's performance under a 
confirmed plan. If the debtor fails to make payments required under the 
plan or seeks but does not demonstrate entitlement to discharge under 11 
U.S.C. 1328(b), the agency shall oppose any requested discharge or move 
to dismiss the case if the costs of litigation together with the costs 
incurred for objections to the plan are not reasonably expected to 
exceed one-third of the amount of the loan to be discharged under the 
plan.
    (3) Response by guaranty agency to plans proposed under chapters 11, 
12, and 13 for loans in repayment less than seven years. The guaranty 
agency shall take the following actions with regard to a loan that was 
in repayment for less than seven years (exclusive of applicable 
suspensions of the repayment period) when a petition for relief in 
bankruptcy under chapter 11, 12, or 13 was filed:
    (i) If the debtor proposes a plan that is expected to end less than 
seven years (exclusive of applicable suspensions of the repayment 
period) after the first payment was due on the loan, the agency shall 
monitor the debtor's performance under a confirmed plan. If the debtor 
fails to make payments required under the plan and demonstrate 
entitlement to discharge under 11 U.S.C. 1328(b), the agency shall 
oppose any requested discharge and move to dismiss the case if the costs 
of litigation together with the costs incurred for objections to the 
plan are not reasonably expected to exceed one-third of the amount of 
the loan to be discharged under the plan.
    (ii) If the debtor proposes a plan that is expected to end more than 
seven years (exclusive of applicable suspensions of the repayment 
period) after the first payment was due on the loan, the agency shall 
take the actions required under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (j) Mandatory purchase by a lender of a loan subject to a bankruptcy 
claim. (1) The lender shall repurchase from the guaranty agency a loan 
held by the agency pursuant to a bankruptcy claim paid to that lender, 
unless the guaranty agency sells the loan to another lender, promptly 
after the earliest of the following events:
    (i) The entry of an order denying or revoking discharge or 
dismissing a proceeding under any chapter.
    (ii) A ruling in a proceeding under chapter 7 or 11 that the loan is 
not dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(B) or other applicable law.
    (iii) The entry of an order granting discharge under chapter 12 or 
13, or confirming a plan of arrangement under chapter 11 in a proceeding 
begun less than 7 years (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the 
repayment period) after the first payment due date of the loan, unless 
the court determined that the loan is dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. 
523(a)(8)(B) on grounds of undue hardship.
    (2) The lender may capitalize all outstanding interest accrued on a 
loan purchased under paragraph (j) of this section to cover any periods 
of delinquency prior to the bankruptcy action through the date the 
lender purchases the loan and receives the supporting loan documentation 
from the guaranty agency.
    (k) Claims for reimbursement from the Secretary on loans held by 
guarantee agencies. (1)(i) The Secretary reimburses the guaranty agency 
for its losses on bankruptcy claims paid to lenders after--
    (A) A determination by the court that the loan is dischargeable 
under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(B) with respect to a proceeding initiated 
under chapter 7 or

[[Page 660]]

chapter 11 begun less than 7 years (exclusive of any applicable 
suspension of the repayment period) after the first payment due date of 
the loan; or
    (B) With respect to any other loan, after the agency pays the claim 
to the lender.
    (ii) The guaranty agency shall refund to the Secretary the full 
amount of reimbursement received from the Secretary on a loan that a 
lender repurchases under this section.
    (2) The Secretary pays a death, disability, bankruptcy, closed 
school, or false certification claim in an amount determined under 
Sec. 682.402(k)(5) on a loan held by a guaranty agency after the agency 
has paid a default claim to the lender thereon and received payment 
under its reinsurance agreement. The Secretary reimburses the guaranty 
agency only if--
    (i) The guaranty agency determines that the borrower (or the student 
for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan or each of the co-makers of a 
PLUS loan) has died, or the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a PLUS 
loan) has become totally and permanently disabled since applying for the 
loan, or has filed for relief in bankruptcy, in accordance with the 
procedures in paragraphs (b), (c), or (f) of this section, or the 
student was unable to complete an educational program because the school 
closed, or the borrower's eligibility to borrow (or the student's 
eligibility in the case of a PLUS loan) was falsely certified by an 
eligible school. For purposes of this paragraph, references to the 
``lender'' and ``guaranty agency'' in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section mean the guaranty agency and the Secretary respectively;
    (ii) In the case of a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan, the guaranty 
agency determines that the borrower (or the student for whom a parent 
obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has died, 
or the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) has become 
totally and permanently disabled since applying for the loan, or has 
filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy within 10 years of the date 
the borrower entered repayment, exclusive of periods of deferment or 
periods of forbearance granted by the lender that extended the 10-year 
maximum repayment period, or the borrower (or the student for whom a 
parent received a PLUS loan) was unable to complete an educational 
program because the school closed, or the borrower's eligibility to 
borrow (or the student's eligibility in the case of a PLUS loan) was 
falsely certified by an eligible school;
    (iii) In the case of a Consolidation loan, the guaranty agency 
determines that the borrower (or each of the co-makers) has died, become 
totally and permanently disabled since applying for the Consolidation 
loan, or has filed the petition for relief in bankruptcy within the 
maximum repayment period described in Sec. 682.209(h)(2), exclusive of 
periods of deferment or periods of forbearance granted by the lender 
that extended the maximum repayment period;
    (iv) The guaranty agency has not written off the loan in accordance 
with the procedures established by the agency under 
Sec. 682.410(b)(6)(x), except for closed school and false certification 
discharges; and
    (v) The guaranty agency has exercised due diligence in the 
collection of the loan in accordance with the procedures established by 
the agency under Sec. 682.410(b)(6)(x), until the borrower (or the 
student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan, or each of the co-makers 
of a PLUS loan) has died, or the borrower (or each of the co-makers of a 
PLUS loan) has become totally and permanently disabled or filed a 
Chapter 12 or Chapter 13 petition, or had the loan discharged in 
bankruptcy, or for closed school and false certification claims, the 
guaranty agency receives a request for discharge from the borrower or 
another party.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) Within 30 days of receiving reimbursement for a closed school or 
false certification claim, the guaranty agency shall pay--
    (i) The borrower an amount equal to the amount paid on the loan by 
or on behalf of the borrower, less any school tuition refunds or 
payments received by the holder, guaranty agency, or the borrower from a 
tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third-party source; or

[[Page 661]]

    (ii) The amount determined under paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this 
section to the holder of the borrower's Consolidation Loan.

the reinsurance percentage paid on the loan. This interest includes 
interest that accrues during--
    (i) For death, disability, or bankruptcy claims, the shorter of 60 
days or the period from the date the guaranty agency determines that the 
borrower (or the student for whom a parent obtained a PLUS loan, or each 
of the co-makers of a PLUS loan) died, became totally and permanently 
disabled, or filed a petition for relief in bankruptcy until the 
Secretary authorizes payment; or
    (ii) For closed school or false certification claims, the period 
from the date on which the guaranty agency received payment from the 
Secretary on a default claim to the date on which the Secretary 
authorizes payment of the closed school or false certification claim.
    (l) Payments received after the Secretary's payment of a death, 
disability, closed school, false certification, or bankruptcy claim. 
    (1) If the guaranty agency receives any payments from or on behalf 
of the borrower on or attributable to a loan that has been discharged in 
bankruptcy on which the Secretary previously paid a bankruptcy claim, 
the guaranty agency shall return 100 percent of these payments to the 
sender. The guaranty agency shall promptly return, to the sender, any 
payment on a cancelled or discharged loan made by the sender and 
received after the Secretary pays a closed school or false certification 
claim. At the same time that the agency returns the payment, it shall 
notify the borrower that there is no obligation to repay a loan 
discharged on the basis of death, disability, bankruptcy, false 
certification, or closing of the school.
    (2) The guaranty agency shall remit to the Secretary all payments 
received from a tuition recovery fund, performance bond, or other third 
party with respect to a loan on which the Secretary previously paid a 
closed school or false certification claim.
    (3) If the guaranty agency has returned a payment to the borrower, 
or the borrower's representative, with the notice described in paragraph 
(l)(2) of this section, and the borrower (or representative) continues 
to send payments to the guaranty agency, the agency shall remit all of 
those payments to the Secretary.
    (m) Applicable suspension of the repayment period. For purposes of

under the FFEL Program, an applicable suspension of the repayment 
period--
    (1) Includes any period, including a period of deferment, during 
which the lender, at the request of the borrower, does not require the 
borrower to make payments on the loan;
    (2) Begins on the date on which the borrower qualifies for the 
requested deferment or the lender grants the requested forbearance;
    (3) Closes on the later of the date on which--
    (i) The condition for which the requested deferment or forbearance 
was received ends; or
    (ii) The lender receives notice of the end of the condition for 
which the requested deferment or forbearance was received, if the 
condition ended earlier than represented by the borrower at the time of 
the request and the borrower did not notify timely the lender of the 
date on which the condition actually ended;
    (4) Includes the period between the end of the borrower's grace 
period and the first payment due date established by the lender in the 
case of a borrower who entered repayment without the knowledge of the 
lender;
    (5) Includes the period between the filing of the petition for

September 30, 1976, or was not actively carrying on a loan guarantee 
program covered by a basic program agreement on October 1, 1976 for five 
consecutive fiscal years beginning with the first year of its operation.
    (2) For purposes of this section--
    (i) Losses means the amount of unpaid principal and accrued interest 
the agency paid on a default claim filed by a lender on a reinsured 
loan, minus payments made by or on behalf of the borrower after default 
but before the Secretary reimburses the agency;
    (ii) Preclaims assistance means collection assistance made available 
to the lender by the guaranty agency no later than the 90th day of 
delinquency. This assistance must include collection activities that are 
at least as forceful as the level of preclaims assistance performed by 
the guaranty agency as of October 16, 1990, and involves the initiation 
by the guaranty agency of at least 3 collection activities, one of which 
is a letter designed to encourage the borrower to begin or resume 
repayment. As part of their preclaims assistance, guaranty agencies must 
provide counseling and consumer information (in written or other format) 
to the borrower by the 10th working day after the agency receives the 
lender's request for preclaims assistance informing the borrower of all 
of the borrower's options to avoid default, including the availability 
of consolidating delinquent loans under the FFEL Program or the Federal 
Direct Consolidation Loan Program.
    (iii) Supplemental preclaims assistance means collection assistance 
provided to the lender by the guaranty agency that involves the 
initiation by the agency of at least two collection activities designed 
to encourage the borrower to begin or resume payment that is begun on or 
after the 120th day of delinquency.
    (3)(i) If an account has been subject to supplemental preclaims 
assistance and is not submitted as a default claim by the lender to the 
guaranty agency by the 150th day after the loan becomes 120 days 
delinquent, the Secretary will pay the guaranty agency $50.
    (ii) If a guaranty agency contracts with an outside entity to 
perform any supplemental preclaims assistance activity, that entity may 
not--
    (A) Hold or service the loan;
    (B) Own, control, or share common ownership with the holder or 
servicer of the loan; or
    (C) Hold a contract with the agency to perform collection services 
on the loan in the event of default.
    (iii) For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, an 
``account'' includes 1 or more FFEL programs loans that were--
    (A) Made to the same borrower;
    (B) Held by the same lender;
    (C) Guaranteed by the same guaranty agency;
    (D) Subject to preclaims assistance by the same agency; and
    (E) Covered by the same supplemental preclaims assistance request.
    (4) A guaranty agency's loss on a loan that was outstanding when a 
reinsurance agreement was executed is covered by the reinsurance 
agreement only if the default on the loan occurs after the effective 
date of the agreement.
    (5) If a lender has requested preclaims assistance as described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section upon request of the school, the 
agency shall notify the school for attendance at which the borrower 
received the loan of the lender's request by providing the school with a 
copy of that request, or by other means.
    (b) Reinsurance rate. (1) If the total of reinsurance claims paid by 
the Secretary to a guaranty agency during any fiscal year reaches 5 
percent of the amount of loans in repayment at the end of the preceding 
fiscal year, the Secretary's reinsurance payment on a default claim 
subsequently paid by the guaranty agency during that fiscal year 
equals--
    (i) 90 percent of its losses for loans made before October 1, 1993 
or transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary from an insolvent 
guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws its participation in 
the FFEL Program; or
    (ii) 88 percent of its losses for loans made on or after October 1, 
1993.
    (2) If the total of reinsurance claims paid by the Secretary to a 
guaranty agency during any fiscal year reaches 9

[[Page 664]]

percent of the amount of loans in repayment at the end of the preceding 
fiscal year, the Secretary's reinsurance payment on a default claim 
subsequently paid by the guaranty agency during that fiscal year 
equals--
    (i) 80 percent of its losses for loans made before October 1, 1993 
or transferred under a plan approved by the Secretary from an insolvent 
guaranty agency or a guaranty agency that withdraws its participation in 
the FFEL Program; or

    (G) The agency paid claims, excluding the amount of those claims--
    (1) Paid under Sec. 682.412(e);
    (2) Paid under a policy established by the agency that is consistent 
with Sec. 682.509(a)(1); or
    (3) Paid at the direction of the Secretary.
    (c) Submission of reinsurance rate base data. The guaranty agency 
shall submit to the Secretary the quarterly report required by the 
Secretary for the previous quarter ending September 30 containing 
complete and accurate data in order for the Secretary to calculate the 
amount of loans in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year. 
The Secretary does not pay a reinsurance claim to the guaranty agency 
after the date the guarterly report is due until the quaranty agency 
submits a complete and accurate report.
    (d) Reinsurance fee. (1) Except for loans made under 
Sec. 682.209(e), (f) and (h), a guaranty agency shall pay to the 
Secretary during each fiscal year in quarterly installments a

agency.
    (3) The guaranty agency shall pay the reinsurance fee required by 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section due the Secretary for each calendar 
quarter ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, within 
90 days after the end of the applicable quarter or within 30 days after 
receiving written notice from the Secretary that the fees are due, 
whichever is earlier.
    (e) Initiation or extension of agreements. In deciding whether to 
enter

[[Page 665]]

into or extend a reinsurance agreement, or, if an agreement has been 
terminated, whether to enter into a new agreement, the Secretary 
considers the adequacy of--

provides guarantees to collect outstanding loans as required by 
Sec. 682.410(b) (6) or (7), and Sec. 682.411;
    (2) Efforts by the guaranty agency to make FFEL loans available to 
all eligible borrowers; and
    (3) Other relevant aspects of the guaranty agency's program 
operations.
    (f) Application of borrower payments. A payment made to a guaranty 
agency by a borrower on a defaulted loan must be applied first to the 
collection costs incurred to collect that amount and then to other 
incidental charges, such as late charges, then to accrued interest and 
then to principal.
    (g) Federal share of borrower payments. (1) If a borrower makes 
payments on a loan after the Secretary has paid a reinsurance claim on

Secretary; and

    (3) Unless the Secretary approves otherwise, the guaranty agency 
shall pay to the Secretary the Secretary's equitable share of borrower 
payments within 45 days of its receipt of the payments.
    (h) Nondiscrimination. (1) A guaranty agency may not engage in any 
pattern or practice that results in a denial of a borrower's access to 
FFEL loans because of the borrower's race, sex, color, religion, 
national origin, age, handicapped status, income, attendance at a 
particular participating school within any State served by the guaranty 
agency, length of the borrower's educational program, or the borrower's 
academic year in school.
    (2) For purposes of this section a guaranty agency is deemed to be 
serving a State if it guarantees a loan that is--
    (i) Made by a lender located in a State not served by the agency;
    (ii) Made to a borrower who is a resident of a State not served by 
the agency; and
    (iii) Made for attendance at a school located in the State.
    (i) Other terms. The reinsurance agreement contains other terms and 
conditions that the Secretary finds necessary to--
    (1) Promote the purposes of the FFEL programs and to protect the 
United States from unreasonable risks of loss;
    (2) Ensure proper and efficient administration of the loan guarantee 
program; and
    (3) Ensure that due diligence will be exercised in the collection of 
loans.

Sec. 682.405  Loan rehabilitation agreement.

    (a) General. (1) A guaranty agency that has a basic program 
agreement must enter into a loan rehabilitation agreement with the 
Secretary. The guaranty agency must establish a loan

[[Page 666]]

rehabilitation program for all borrowers with an enforceable promissory 
note for the purpose of rehabilitating defaulted loans so that the loan 
may be purchased, if practicable, by an eligible lender and removed from 
default status.
    (2) A loan is considered to be rehabilitated only after the borrower 
has made one voluntary reasonable and affordable full payment each month 
and the payment is received by a guaranty agency or its agent within 15 
days of the scheduled due date for 12 consecutive months in accordance 
with this section, and the loan has been sold to an eligible lender.
    (3) After the loan has been rehabilitated, the borrower regains all 
benefits of the program, including any remaining deferment eligibility 
under section 428(b)(1)(M) of the Act, from the date of the 
rehabilitation.
    (4) A borrower who wishes to rehabilitate a loan on which a judgment 
has been entered must sign a new promissory note prior to the sale of 
the loan to an eligible lender.
    (b) Terms of agreement. In the loan rehabilitation agreement, the 
guaranty agency agrees to ensure that its loan rehabilitation program 
meets the following requirements at all times:
    (1) A borrower may request the rehabilitation of the borrower's 
defaulted FFEL loan held by the guaranty agency. The borrower must make 
one voluntary full payment each month for 12 consecutive months to be 
eligible to have the defaulted loans rehabilitated. For purposes of this 
section, ``full payment'' means a reasonable and affordable payment 
agreed to by the borrower and the agency. The required amount of such 
monthly payment may be no more than is reasonable and affordable based 
upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. Voluntary payments 
are those made directly by the borrower regardless of whether there is a 
judgment against the borrower, and do not include payments obtained by 
income tax off-set, garnishment, or income or asset execution. A 
guaranty agency must attempt to secure a lender to purchase the loan at 
the end of the twelve-(12-)month payment period.
    (i) For purposes of this section, the determination of reasonable 
and affordable must--
    (A) Include a consideration of the borrower's and spouse's 
disposable income and reasonable and necessary expenses including, but 
not limited to, housing, utilities, food, medical costs, work-related 
expenses, dependent care costs and other Title IV repayment;
    (B) Not be a required minimum payment amount, e.g. $50, if the 
agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable 
based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. The agency must 
include documentation in the borrower's file of the basis for the 
determination if the monthly reasonable and affordable payment 
established under this section is less than $50.00 or the monthly 
accrued interest on the loan, whichever is greater. However, $50.00 may 
not be the minimum payment for a borrower if the agency determines that 
a smaller amount is reasonable and affordable; and
    (C) Be based on the documentation provided by the borrower or other 
sources including, but not be limited to--
    (1) Evidence of current income (e.g., proof of welfare benefits, 
Social Security benefits, child support, veterans' benefits, 
Supplemental Security Income, Workmen's Compensation, two most recent 
pay stubs, most recent copy of U.S. income tax return, State Department 
of Labor reports);
    (2) Evidence of current expenses (e.g., a copy of the borrower's 
monthly household budget, on a form provided by the guaranty agency); 
and
    (3) A statement of the unpaid balance on all FFEL loans held by 
other holders.
    (ii) The agency must include any payment made under 
Sec. 682.401(b)(4) in determining whether the 12 consecutive payments 
required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been made.
    (iii) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be 
adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial circumstances 
only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(C) of this section.

[[Page 667]]

    (iv) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a written 
statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment 
amount, as determined by the agency, and explaining any other terms and 
conditions applicable to the required series of payments that must be 
made before a borrower's account can be considered for repurchase by an 
eligible lender. The statement must inform borrowers of the consequences 
of having their loans rehabilitated (e.g. credit clearing, possibility 
of increased monthly payments). The statement must inform the borrower 
of the amount of the collection costs to be added to the unpaid 
principal at the time of the sale. The collection costs may not exceed 
18.5 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest at the time of 
the sale.
    (v) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with an opportunity 
to object to terms of the rehabilitation of the borrower's defaulted 
loan.
    (2) The guaranty agency must report to all national credit bureaus 
within 90 days of the date the loan was rehabilitated that the loan is 
no longer in a default status.
    (3) An eligible lender purchasing a rehabilitated loan must 
establish a repayment schedule that meets the same requirements that are 
applicable to other FFEL Program loans made under the same loan type and 
provides for the borrower to make monthly payments at least as great as 
the average of the 12 consecutive monthly payments received by the 
guaranty agency. For the purposes of the maximum loan repayment period, 
the lender must treat the first payment made under the 12 consecutive 
payments as the first payment under the 10-year maximum.

returned the claim is not reinsured unless the lender files a claim for 
loss on the loan with the guarantor together with all required 
documentation, prior to the 30th day;
    (7) The lender satisfied all conditions of guarantee coverage set by 
the agency, unless the agency reinstated guarantee coverage on the loan

requirements in Sec. 682.404(a)(2)(ii);
    (13) The agency assigns the loan to the Secretary, if so directed,

<R05>
Sec. 682.409  Mandatory assignment by guaranty agencies of defaulted loans to the Secretary.

    (a)(1) If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to 
protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary will direct a 
guaranty agency to promptly assign to the Secretary any loan held by the 
agency on which the agency has received payment under Sec. 682.402(d), 
682.402(i), or 682.404. An orderly transition from the FFEL program to 
the Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program and the collection of 
unpaid loans owed by Federal employees by Federal salary offset are, 
among other things, deemed to be in the Federal fiscal interest. Unless 
the Secretary notifies an agency, in writing, that other loans must be 
assigned to the Secretary, an agency must assign any loan that meets all 
of the following criteria as of April 15 of each year:
    (i) The unpaid principal balance is at least $100.
    (ii) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in 
which these regulations are effective, the loan, and any other loans 
held by the agency for that borrower, have been held by the agency for 
at least four years; for any subsequent fiscal year such loan must have 
been held by the agency for at least five years.
    (iii) A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year.
    (iv) A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the 
borrower.
    (2) If the agency fails to meet a fiscal year recovery rate standard 
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for a loan type, and the 
Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to 
protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the 
agency to assign in addition to those loans described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, loans in amounts needed to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (i) Calculation of fiscal year loan type recovery rate. A fiscal 
year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the 
amount collected on defaulted loans, including collections by Federal 
Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford, 
PLUS, SLS, and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of 
that program (including payments received by the agency on loans under 
Sec. 682.401(b)(4) and Sec. 682.409 and the amounts of any loans 
purchased from the guaranty agency by an eligible lender) during the 
most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of 
principal and interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each 
loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts 
permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal 
year.
    (ii) Fiscal year loan type recovery rates standards. (A) If, in each 
of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these 
regulations are effective, the fiscal year loan type recovery rate for a 
loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery 
rate of all active guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal 
years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that 
additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal 
interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional 
assignments in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (B) In any subsequent fiscal year the loan type recovery rate 
standard for a loan program must be 90 percent of the average recovery 
rate of all active guaranty agencies.
    (iii) Non-achievement of loan type recovery rate standards.
    (A) Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of 
this section that protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires 
that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an 
agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate described

[[Page 670]]

in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the 
Secretary a sufficient amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans 
to be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to 
cause the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal 
year to equal or exceed the average rate of all agencies described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from 
the denominator of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the 
amount of these additional loans.
    (B) The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may 
require the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section to include particular categories of loans that share 
characteristics that make the performance of the agency fall below the 
appropriate percentage of the loan type recovery rate as described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Calculation of loan type recovery rate standards. The 
Secretary, within 30 days after the date for submission of the second 
quarterly report from all agencies, makes available to all agencies a 
mid-year report, showing the recovery rate for each agency and the 
average recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies for each loan 
type. In addition, the Secretary, within 120 days after the beginning of 
each fiscal year, makes available a final report showing those rates and 
the average rate for each loan type for the preceding fiscal year.
    (3)(i) Determination that the protection of the Federal fiscal 
interest requires assignments. Upon petition by an agency submitted 
within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of 
this section, the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal 
fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans described in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount 
described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section only after review of 
the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary 
considers all relevant information available to him (including any 
information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in reviews of 
the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows:
    (A) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in 
which these regulations are effective, the Secretary considers 
information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery 
rate above the average rate of all active agencies to demonstrate that 
the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if any 
amounts of loans of the loan type required to be assigned to the 
Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are retained by that 
agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary considers 
information presented by an agency with a fiscal year recovery rate 10 
percent above the average rate of all active agencies.
    (B) The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that 
is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to 
demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be 
served if the agency demonstrates that its compliance with 
Sec. 682.401(b)(4) and Sec. 682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal 
year loan type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required 
to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be assigned.
    (C) The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include, but is not limited to 
the following:
    (1) The fiscal year loan type recovery rate within such school 
sectors as the Secretary may designate for the agency, and for all 
agencies.
    (2) The fiscal year loan type recovery rate for loans for the agency 
and for all agencies categorized by age of the loans as the Secretary 
may determine.
    (3) The performance of the agency, and all agencies, in default 
aversion.
    (4) The agency's performance on judgment enforcement.
    (5) The existence and use of any state or guaranty agency-specific 
collection tools.
    (6) The agency's level of compliance with Secs. 682.409 and 
682.410(b)(6).
    (7) Other factors that may affect loan repayment such as State or 
regional unemployment and natural disasters.

[[Page 671]]

    (ii) Denial of an agency's petition. If the Secretary does not 
accept the agency's petition, the Secretary provides, in writing, to the 
agency the Secretary's reasons for concluding that the Federal fiscal 
interest is best protected by requiring the assignment.
    (b)(1) A guaranty agency that assigns a defaulted loan to the 
Secretary under this section thereby releases all rights and title to 
that loan. The Secretary does not pay the guaranty agency any 
compensation for a loan assigned under this section.
    (2) The guaranty agency does not share in any amounts received by 
the Secretary on a loan assigned under this section, regardless of the 
reinsurance percentage paid on the loan or the agency's previous 
collection costs.
    (c)(1) A guaranty agency must assign a loan to the Secretary under 
this section at the time, in the manner, and with the information and 
documentation that the Secretary requires. The agency must submit this 
information and documentation in the form (including magnetic media) and 
format specified by the Secretary.
    (2) The guaranty agency shall execute an assignment to the United 
States of America of all right, title, and interest in the promissory 
note or judgment evidencing a loan assigned under this section.
    (3) If the agency does not provide the required information and 
documentation in the form and format required by the Secretary, the 
Secretary may, at his option--
    (i) Allow the agency to revise the agency's submission to include 
the required information and documentation in the specified form and 
format;
    (ii) In the case of an improperly formatted computer tape, reformat 
the tape and assess the cost of the activity against the agency;
    (iii) Reorganize the material submitted and assess the cost of that 
activity against the agency; or
    (iv) Obtain from other agency records and add to the agency's 
submission any information from the original submission, and assess the 
cost of that activity against the agency.
    (4) For each loan assigned, the agency shall submit to the Secretary 
the following documents associated for each loan, assembled in the order 
listed below:
    (i) The promissory note.
    (ii) Any documentation of a judgment entered on the loan.
    (iii) A written assignment of the loan or judgment, unless this 
assignment is affixed to the promissory note.
    (iv) The loan application.
    (v) A payment history for the loan, as described in 
Sec. 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(C).
    (vi) A collection history for the loan, as described in 
Sec. 682.414(a)(1)(ii)(D).
    (5) The agency may submit certified copies of required documents in 
lieu of originals if no originals exist.
    (6) The Secretary may accept the assignment of a loan without all of 
the documents listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If directed to 
do so, the agency must retain these documents for submission to the 
Secretary at some future date.
    (d)(1) If the Secretary determines that the agency has not submitted 
a document or record required by paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Secretary decides to allow the agency an additional opportunity to 
submit the omitted document under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, 
the Secretary notifies the agency and provides a reasonable period of 
time for the agency to submit the omitted record or document.
    (2) If the omitted document is not submitted within the time 
specified by the Secretary, the Secretary determines whether that 
omission impairs the Secretary's ability to collect the loan.
    (3) If the Secretary determines that the ability to collect the loan 
has been impaired under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Secretary 
assesses the agency the amount paid to the agency under the reinsurance 
agreement and accrued interest at the rate applicable to the borrower 
under Sec. 682.410(b)(3).

[[Page 672]]

    (4) The Secretary reassigns to the agency that portion of the loan 
determined to be unenforceable by the Department.

    (ii) Costs that are reasonable, as defined under 
Sec. 682.410(a)(11)(iii), and that are ordinary and necessary for the 
agency to fulfill its responsibilities under the HEA, including costs of 
collecting loans, providing preclaims assistance, monitoring enrollment 
and repayment status, and carrying out any other guaranty activities. 
Those costs must be--
    (A) Allocable to the FFEL Program;
    (B) Not higher than the agency would incur under established 
policies, regulations, and procedures that apply to any comparable non-
Federal activities of the guaranty agency;
    (C) Not included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching 
requirements of any other federally supported activity, except as 
specifically provided by Federal law;
    (D) Net of all applicable credits; and
    (E) Documented in accordance with applicable legal and accounting 
standards;
    (iii) Lenders for their participation in a loan referral service 
under section 428(e) of the Act;
    (iv) The Secretary's equitable share of collections;
    (v) Federal advances and other funds owed to the Secretary;
    (vi) Reinsurance fees;
    (vii) Insurance premiums related to cancelled loans;
    (viii) Borrower refunds, including those arising out of student or 
other borrower claims and defenses;
    (ix) (A) The repayment, on or after December 29, 1993, of amounts 
credited under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(1)(ix) of this section, if 
the agency provides the Secretary 30 days prior notice of the repayment 
and demonstrates that--
    (1) These amounts were originally received by the agency under 
appropriate contemporaneous documentation specifying that receipt was on 
a temporary basis only;
    (2) The objective for which these amounts were originally received 
by the agency has been fully achieved; and
    (3) Repayment of these amounts would not cause the agency to fail to 
comply with the minimum reserve levels provided by paragraph (a)(10) of 
this section, except that the Secretary may, for good cause, provide 
written permission for a payment that meets the other requirements of 
this paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A).

[[Page 673]]

    (B) The repayment, prior to December 29, 1993, of amounts credited 
under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(1)(ix) of this section, if the agency 
demonstrates that--
    (1) These amounts were originally received by the agency under 
appropriate contemporaneous documentation that receipt was on a 
temporary basis only; and
    (2) The objective for which these amounts were originally received 
by the agency has been fully achieved.
    (x) Any other costs or payments ordinary and necessary to perform 
functions directly related to the agency's responsibilities under the 
HEA and for their proper and efficient administration;
    (xi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any other 
payment that was allowed by law or regulation at the time it was made, 
if the agency acted in good faith when it made the payment or the agency 
would otherwise be unfairly prejudiced by the nonallowability of the 
payment at a later time; and
    (xii) Any other amounts authorized or directed by the Secretary.
    (3) Accounting basis. Except as approved by the Secretary, a 
guaranty agency shall credit the items listed in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section to its reserve fund upon their receipt, without any 
deferral for accounting purposes, and shall deduct the items listed in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section from its reserve fund upon their 
payment, without any accrual for accounting purposes.
    (4) Accounting records. (i) The accounting records of a guaranty 
agency must reflect the correct amount of sources and uses of funds 
under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) A guaranty agency may reverse prior credits to its reserve fund 
if--
    (A) The agency gives the Secretary prior notice setting forth a 
detailed justification for the action;
    (B) The Secretary determines that such credits were made erroneously 
and in good faith; and
    (C) The Secretary determines that the action would not unfairly 
prejudice other parties.
    (iii) A guaranty agency shall correct any other errors in its 
accounting or reporting as soon as practicable after the errors become 
known to the agency.
    (iv) If a general reconstruction of a guaranty agency's historical 
accounting records is necessary to make a change under paragraphs 
(a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of this section or any other retroactive 
change to its accounting records, the agency may make this 
reconstruction only upon prior approval by the Secretary and without any 
deduction from its reserve fund for the cost of the reconstruction.
    (5) Investments. The guaranty agency shall exercise the level of 
care required of a fiduciary charged with the duty of investing the 
money of others when it invests the assets of the reserve fund described 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. It may invest these assets only in 
low-risk securities, such as obligations issued or guaranteed by the 
United States or a State.
    (6) Development of assets. (i) If the guaranty agency uses in a 
substantial way for purposes other than the agency's guaranty activities 
any funds required to be credited to the reserve fund under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section or any assets derived from the reserve fund to 
develop an asset of any kind and does not in good faith allocate a 
portion of the cost of developing and maintaining the developed asset to 
funds other than the reserve fund, the Secretary may require the agency 
to--
    (A) Correct this allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section; or
    (B) Correct the recorded ownership of the asset under paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii) of this section so that--
    (1) If, in a transaction with an unrelated third party, the agency 
sells or otherwise derives revenue from uses of the asset that are 
unrelated to the agency's guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall 
deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section a percentage of the sale proceeds or revenue equal to the fair 
percentage of the total development cost of the asset paid with the 
reserve fund monies or provided by assets derived from the reserve fund; 
or
    (2) If the agency otherwise converts the asset, in whole or in part, 
to a use unrelated to its guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall 
deposit into

[[Page 674]]

the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a fair 
percentage of the fair market value or, in the case of a temporary 
conversion, the rental value of the portion of the asset employed for 
the unrelated use.
    (ii) If the agency uses funds or assets described in paragraph 
(a)(6)(i) of this section in the manner described in that paragraph and 
makes a cost and maintenance allocation erroneously and in good faith, 
it shall correct the allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section.
    (7) Third-party claims. If the guaranty agency has any claim against 
any other party to recover funds or other assets for the reserve fund, 
the claim is the property of the United States.
    (8) Related-party transactions. All transactions between a guaranty 
agency and a related organization or other person that involve funds 
required to be credited to the agency's reserve fund under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section or assets derived from the reserve fund must be 
on terms that are not less advantageous to the reserve fund than would 
have been negotiated on an arm's-length basis by unrelated parties.
    (9) Scope of definition. The provisions of this Sec. 682.410(a) 
define reserve funds and assets for purposes of sections 422 and 428 of 
the Act. These provisions do not, however, affect the Secretary's 
authority to use all funds and assets of the agency pursuant to section 
428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the Act.
    (10) Minimum reserve fund level. The guaranty agency must maintain a 
current minimum reserve level of not less than--
    (i) .5 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal 
year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1993;
    (ii) .7 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal 
year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1994;
    (iii) .9 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal 
year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1995; and
    (iv) 1.1 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for each fiscal 
year of the agency that begins on or after January 1, 1996.
    (11) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (i) Reserve fund level means--
    (A) The total of reserve fund assets as defined in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section;
    (B) Minus the total amount of the reserve fund assets used in 
accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section; and
    (ii) Amount of loans outstanding means--
    (A) The sum of--
    (1) The original principal amount of all loans guaranteed by the 
agency; and
    (2) The original principal amount of any loans on which the 
guarantee was transferred to the agency from another guarantor, 
excluding loan guarantees transferred to another agency pursuant to a 
plan of the Secretary in response to the insolvency of the agency;
    (B) Minus the original principal amount of all loans on which--
    (1) The loan guarantee was cancelled;
    (2) The loan guarantee was transferred to another agency;
    (3) Payment in full has been made by the borrower;
    (4) Reinsurance coverage has been lost and cannot be regained; and
    (5) The agency paid claims.
    (iii) Reasonable cost means a cost that, in its nature and amount, 
does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under 
the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur 
the cost. The burden of proof is upon the guaranty agency, as a 
fiduciary under its agreements with the Secretary, to establish that 
costs are reasonable. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, 
consideration must be given to--
    (A) Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary 
and necessary for the proper and efficient performance and 
administration of the guaranty agency's responsibilities under the HEA;
    (B) The restraints or requirements imposed by factors such as sound 
business practices, arms-length bargaining, Federal, State, and other 
laws and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the guaranty 
agency's agreements with the Secretary; and

[[Page 675]]

    (C) Market prices of comparable goods or services.
    (b) Administrative requirements--(1) Independent audits. The 
guaranty agency shall arrange for an independent financial and 
compliance audit of the agency's FFEL program as follows:
    (i) With regard to a guaranty agency that is an agency of a State 
government, an audit must be conducted in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 
and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G.
    (ii) With regard to a guaranty agency that is a nonprofit 
organization, an audit must be conducted in accordance with OMB Circular 
A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit 
Organizations and 34 CFR 74.61(h)(3). If a nonprofit guaranty agency 
meets the criteria in Circular A-133 to have a program specific audit, 
and chooses that option, the program specific audit must meet the 
following requirements:
    (A) The audit must examine the agency's compliance with the Act, 
applicable regulations, and agreements entered into under this part.
    (B) The audit must examine the agency's financial management of its 
FFEL program activities.
    (C) The audit must be conducted in accordance with the standards for 
audits issued by the United States General Accounting Office's (GAO) 
Government Auditing Standards. Procedures for audits are contained in an 
audit guide developed by, and available from, the Office of the 
Inspector General of the Department.
    (D) The audit must be conducted annually and must be submitted to 
the Secretary within six months of the end of the audit period. The 
first audit must cover the agency's activities for a period that 
includes July 23, 1992, unless the agency is currently submitting audits 
on a biennial basis, and the second year of its biennial cycle starts on 
or before July 23, 1992. Under these circumstances, the agency shall 
submit a biennial audit that includes July 23, 1992 and submit its next 
audit as an annual audit.
    (2) Collection charges. Whether or not provided for in the 
borrower's promissory note and subject to any limitation on the amount 
of those costs in that note, the guaranty agency shall charge a borrower 
an amount equal to reasonable costs incurred by the agency in collecting 
a loan on which the agency has paid a default or bankruptcy claim. These 
costs may include, but are not limited to, all attorney's fees, 
collection agency charges, and court costs. Except as provided in 
Secs. 682.401(b)(27) and 682.405(b)(1)(iv), the amount charged a 
borrower must equal the lesser of--
    (i) The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of 
collection under the formula in 34 CFR 30.60; or
    (ii) The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of 
collection if the loan was held by the U.S. Department of Education.
    (3) Interest charged by guaranty agencies. The guaranty agency shall 
charge the borrower interest on the amount owed by the borrower after 
the capitalization required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section has 
occurred at a rate that is the greater of--
    (i) The rate established by the terms of the borrower's original 
promissory note;
    (ii) In the case of a loan for which a judgment has been obtained, 
the rate provided for by State law.
    (4) Capitalization of unpaid interest. The guaranty agency shall 
capitalize any unpaid interest due the lender from the borrower at the 
time the agency pays a default claim to the lender.
    (5) Credit bureau reports. (i) After the completion of the 
procedures in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the guaranty agency 
shall, after it has paid a default claim, report promptly, but not less 
than sixty days after completion of the procedures in paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii) of this section, and on a regular basis, to all national 
credit bureaus--
    (A) The total amount of loans made to the borrower and the remaining 
balance of those loans;
    (B) The date of default;
    (C) Information concerning collection of the loan, including the 
repayment status of the loan;
    (D) Any changes or corrections in the information reported by the 
agency that result from information received after the initial report; 
and

[[Page 676]]

    (E) The date the loan is fully repaid by or on behalf of the 
borrower or discharged by reason of the borrower's death, bankruptcy, or 
total and permanent disability.
    (ii) The guaranty agency, promptly after it pays a default claim on 
a loan but before it reports the default to a credit bureau or assesses 
collection costs against a borrower, shall provide the borrower with--
    (A) Written notice that meets the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(5)(vi) of this section regarding the proposed actions;
    (B) An opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to 
the loan obligation;
    (C) An opportunity for an administrative review of the legal 
enforceability or past-due status of the loan obligation; and
    (D) An opportunity to enter into a repayment agreement on terms 
satisfactory to the agency.
    (iii) The procedures set forth in 34 CFR 30.20-30.33 (administrative 
offset) satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iv)(A) In response to a request submitted by a borrower, after the 
deadlines established under agency rules, for access to records, an 
administrative review, or for an opportunity to enter into a repayment 
agreement, the agency shall provide the requested relief but may 
continue reporting the debt to credit bureaus until it determines that 
the borrower has demonstrated that the loan obligation is not legally 
enforceable or that alternative repayment arrangements satisfactory to 
the agency have been made with the borrower.
    (B) The deadline established by the agency for requesting 
administrative review under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section must 
allow the borrower at least 60 days from the date the notice described 
in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section is sent to request that 
review.
    (v) An agency may not permit an employee, official, or agent to 
conduct the administrative review required under this paragraph if that 
individual is--
    (A) Employed in an organizational component of the agency or its 
agent that is charged with collection of loan obligations; or
    (B) Compensated on the basis of collections on loan obligations.
    (vi) The notice sent by the agency under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of 
this section must--
    (A) Advise the borrower that the agency has paid a default claim 
filed by the lender and has taken assignment of the loan;
    (B) Identify the lender that made the loan and the school for 
attendance at which the loan was made;
    (C) State the outstanding principal, accrued interest, and any other 
charges then owing on the loan;
    (D) Demand that the borrower immediately begin repayment of the 
loan;
    (E) Explain the rate of interest that will accrue on the loan, that 
all costs incurred to collect the loan will be charged to the borrower, 
the authority for assessing these costs, and the manner in which the 
agency will calculate the amount of these costs;
    (F) Notify the borrower that the agency will report the default to 
all national credit bureaus to the detriment of the borrower's credit 
rating;
    (G) Explain the opportunities available to the borrower under agency 
rules to request access to the agency's records on the loan, to request 
an administrative review of the legal enforceability or past-due status 
of the loan, and to reach an agreement on repayment terms satisfactory 
to the agency to prevent the agency from reporting the loan as defaulted 
to credit bureaus and provide deadlines and method for requesting this 
relief;
    (H) Unless the agency uses a separate notice to advise the borrower 
regarding other proposed enforcement actions, describe specifically any 
other enforcement action, such as offset against federal or state income 
tax refunds or wage garnishment that the agency intends to use to 
collect the debt, and explain the procedures available to the borrower 
prior to those other enforcement actions for access to records, for an 
administrative review, or for agreement to alternative repayment terms;
    (I) Describe the grounds on which the borrower may object that the 
loan obligation as stated in the notice is not a

[[Page 677]]

legally enforceable debt owed by the borrower;
    (J) Describe any appeal rights available to the borrower from an 
adverse decision on administrative review of the loan obligation;
    (K) Describe any right to judicial review of an adverse decision by 
the agency regarding the legal enforceability or past-due status of the 
loan obligation; and
    (L) Describe the collection actions that the agency may take in the 
future if those presently proposed do not result in repayment of the 
loan obligation, including the filing of a lawsuit against the borrower 
by the agency and assignment of the loan to the Secretary for the filing 
of a lawsuit against the borrower by the Federal Government.
    (6) Collection efforts on defaulted loans. (i) A guaranty agency 
shall engage in at least the collection activities described in 
paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (xii) of this section on a loan on which 
it pays a default claim filed by a lender, and shall attempt an annual 
IRS offset on each eligible loan, except that the agency may engage in 
the collection activities described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section 
in lieu of the activities described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through 
(vi) of this section.
    If, after initiating wage garnishment procedures, the agency 
terminates those procedures for a particular borrower, the agency shall, 
within 30 days, commence collection efforts at least as forceful as 
those described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (xii) of this 
section. The agency's collection efforts shall begin with the same 
collection activities as those that immediately preceded the initiation 
of garnishment procedures, or, if no collection activities had been 
performed, the agency shall begin with the activities described in 
paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the agency may engage 
in the collection activities described in paragraph (b)(7) of this 
section in lieu of the activities described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) 
through (vi) of this section.
    (ii)(A) The periods of time set forth in paragraphs (b)(6)(iii)-
(xii) and (b)(7) of this section refer to the number of days that elapse 
from the date the agency pays a default claim on a loan or on multiple 
loans for a borrower. These periods of time do not include any periods 
during which the agency is engaged in activities related to 
administrative wage garnishment, or is receiving a payment through 
garnishment at least once every 60 days during the period specified in 
paragraph (5)(iv)(B) of this section, or during which the agency is 
engaged in an administrative review of the borrower's indebtedness on 
the loan pursuant to a request by the borrower under paragraph 
(b)(5)(iv) of this section. References to the ``borrower'' in this 
paragraph and paragraph (b)(7) of this section include all endorsers on 
a loan.
    (B) The agency may institute a civil suit against the borrower 
earlier than the first day of the period described in paragraph 
(b)(6)(vii) of this section. Upon instituting suit, the agency is not 
required thereafter to follow the procedures in paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) 
or (b)(7) of this section.
    (C) Upon receipt of a payment from a borrower during a period 
described in paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) or (iv) of this section, or, in the 
case of a borrower whom the agency locates through the use of a skip-
tracing under paragraph (b)(6)(xii) of this section, the agency is not 
required to follow the specific collection efforts described in 
paragraphs (b)(6)(iii)-(vii) of this section if the written notice 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section has been sent but 
shall diligently attempt to collect the loan for 60-days following 
receipt of the payment or receipt of confirmation of the borrower's 
address as applicable. If the agency receives no payments during the 60-
day period, the agency shall resume its use of the collection efforts 
described in paragraphs (b)(6)(iv)-(ix) of this section, treating the 
first day after the end of the 60-day period as the first day of the 
period described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) One-45 days: During this period, the agency shall--
    (A) Send to the borrower the written notice described in paragraph 
(b)(5)(ii) of this section, and a written notice

[[Page 678]]

stating that the agency either will initiate procedures to garnish the 
borrower's wages, or institute a civil suit to compel repayment of the 
amount that the borrower owes plus related collection costs; and
    (B) Diligently attempt to contact the borrower by telephone, as 
defined in Sec. 682.411(1) (with references to ``the lender'' understood 
to mean ``the agency''), to demand payment of the loan.
    (iv) 46-180 days: During this period the agency shall--
    (A) Engage in at least two diligent attempts to contact the borrower 
by telephone, as defined in Sec. 682.411(1) (with references to ``the 
lender'' understood to mean ``the agency'') to demand repayment of the 
loan; and
    (B) Send at least three written notices to the borrower forcefully 
demanding that the borrower immediately commence repayment of the loan, 
and informing the borrower that the default has been reported to all 
national credit bureaus (if that is the case) and that the borrower's 
credit rating may thereby have been damaged. The final notice also must 
indicate that it is the final notice the borrower will receive before 
the agency will take more forceful action, including the initiation of 
procedures to garnish the borrower's wages, or to offset the borrower's 
state and federal income tax refunds, or instituting a civil suit to 
compel repayment of the amount that the borrower owes plus related 
collection costs.
    (v) At no point during the periods described in paragraphs (b)(6) 
(iii) and (iv) of this section may the agency permit the occurrence of a 
gap in collection activity of more than 60 days.
    (vi) For purposes of paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, the term 
gap in collection activity means, with respect to a loan, any period--
    (A) Beginning on the date that is the day after--
    (1) The date the agency paid a default claim to the lender thereon;
    (2) The day on which the agency receives the correct address for a 
borrower who has made no payment in the preceding 60 days; or
    (3) The day on which the agency completes a collection activity as 
defined in Sec. 682.411(k) (1) through (3) (with references to ``the 
lender'' therein understood to mean ``the agency''); and
    (B) Ending on the date of the earliest of --
    (1) The day on which the agency receives the first subsequent 
payment;
    (2) The day on which the agency begins the first subsequent 
collection activity as defined in Sec. 682.411(k) (1) through (3) (with 
references to the ``lender'' understood to mean ``the agency''); or
    (3) The last day of the period described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of 
this section.
    (vii) After 181 days:
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vii)(B) of this section, 
during this period but not sooner than 30 days after sending the notice 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section, the agency shall 
initiate proceedings to offset the borrower's state and federal income 
tax refunds and other payments made by the federal government to a 
borrower, and shall initiate administrative wage garnishment proceedings 
against the borrower by the 225th day. If the agency determines that the 
borrower has insufficient income to satisfy the debt through wage 
garnishment, but has assets from which the debt can be satisfied, the 
agency shall assign the loan to the Department. The agency must not file 
suit to collect a loan from a borrower unless directed to do so by the 
Secretary.
    (B) The agency need not file suit if the agency determines and 
documents in the borrower's file that--
    (1) The cost of litigation would exceed the likely recovery if 
litigation was begun; or
    (2) The borrower does not have the means to satisfy a judgment on 
the debt or a substantial portion thereof.
    (viii)(A) If as a result of a determination made pursuant to 
paragraph (B)(6)(vii)(D)(2) of this section the agency does not 
institute a civil suit against the borrower for repayment of the loan, 
the agency shall conduct diligent semi-annual inquiries to determine if 
the borrower has since acquired the means to satisfy a judgment on the 
debt or a substantial portion thereof.
    (B) If the agency determines that the borrower has acquired the 
means to satisfy at least a substantial portion of

[[Page 679]]

the debt and that the cost of litigation would not exceed the amount 
likely to be obtained if litigation were begun, then, if subsequent 
collection efforts are not successful, the agency, no later than 60 days 
after the determination, shall institute a civil suit against the 
borrower for repayment of the loan.
    (C) The guaranty agency shall document in the borrower's file 
determinations made pursuant to this paragraph.
    (ix)(A) The agency shall attempt diligently to enforce a judgment 
obtained against a borrower on a loan and shall ensure that the judgment 
is renewed as permitted by applicable law. If, despite diligent 
attempts, the agency cannot recover the full amount of the judgment 
because the borrower lacks sufficient assets or income attachable under 
applicable law to fully satisfy the judgment, the agency shall conduct 
diligent semi-annual inquiries to determine if the borrower has since 
acquired sufficient attachable assets or income to satisfy the remainder 
of the judgment.
    (B) If the agency determines that the borrower has acquired 
sufficient attachable assets or income to satisfy the remainder of the 
judgment and that the cost of enforcing the judgment would not exceed 
the likely recovery, the agency, not later than 60 days thereafter, 
shall notify the borrower in writing of its intention to resume 
enforcement efforts on the judgment unless the borrower makes payment in 
full of all outstanding amounts.
    (C) If the borrower does not make payment in full within 30 days of 
the date the agency sends the notice described in paragraph 
(b)(6)(ix)(B) of this section, the agency, within 30 days thereafter, 
shall proceed to enforce the remainder of the judgment.
    (x) The agency may discontinue conducting the semi-annual inquiries 
concerning a borrower's means required by paragraphs (b)(6) (viii) and 
(ix) of this section only in accordance with criteria and procedures 
approved by the Secretary.
    (xi) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(6)(vii)-(x) of this section, the 
agency shall file a civil suit against the borrower for repayment of the 
loan, and shall enforce a judgment obtained thereon unless the agency--
    (A) Determines and documents in the borrower's file that the cost of 
litigation would exceed the judgment amount likely to be obtained if 
litigation were begun, or, in the case of a proceeding to enforce a 
judgment, that the cost of such a proceeding would exceed the likely 
recovery from the debtor; or
    (B) Previously has discontinued semi-annual inquiries on the debt in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(x) of this section.
    (xii) Not later than 10 days after its receipt of information 
indicating that it does not know the current address of a borrower on a 
loan on which the agency has neither declined to sue under paragraph 
(b)(6)(vii)(B) of this section nor discontinued semi-annual inquiries 
under paragraph (b)(6)(x) of this section, or the 60th day after its 
payment of a default claim on the loan, whichever is later, the agency 
shall attempt diligently to locate the borrower through the use of all 
available skip-tracing techniques, including, but not limited to, any 
skip-tracing assistance available from the IRS, credit bureaus, and 
state motor vehicle departments. A guaranty agency shall use any 
information provided by a school about a borrower's location in 
conducting skip-tracing activities.
    (7) Alternative collection procedures for defaulted loans. (i) A 
guaranty agency may engage in the following collection activities in 
lieu of the activities described in paragraphs (b)(6)(iii)-(vi) of this 
section. The regulations in paragraphs (b)(6)(ii) (A) and (B) of this 
section apply to the periods of time set forth in paragraphs 
(b)(7)(iii)-(v) of this section.
    (ii) Upon receipt of a payment from a borrower, the agency is not 
required to follow the specific collection efforts described in 
paragraphs (b)(7)(iii)-(vi) of this section but shall diligently attempt 
to collect the loan for 60 days following receipt of the payment. If the 
agency receives no payments during the 60-day period, the agency shall 
resume its use of the collection efforts described in paragraphs 
(b)(7)(iii)-(vi) of this section, treating the first day after the end 
of the 60-day period as the first day of the period described in 
paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section.

[[Page 680]]

    (iii) 1-30 days: During this period the agency shall send to the 
borrower the written notice described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iv)(A) 31-180 days: During this period the guaranty agency shall 
attempt diligently to collect the loan using such collection tools and 
activities as it deems appropriate, provided, however, that the agency 
must make at least one diligent effort to contact the borrower by 
telephone, as defined in Sec. 682.411(l) (with references to ``the 
lender'' understood to mean ``the agency''), and send at least two 
forceful collection letters to the borrower.
    (B) By the end of this period, the agency shall refer the loan to a 
collection contractor in accordance with paragraph (b)(7)(iv)(C) of this 
section.
    (C) The collection contractor to whom the agency refers a loan under 
paragraph (b)(7)(iv)(B) of this section must--
    (1) Be compensated for its services on all FFEL loans referred by 
the agency solely on a contingency fee basis;
    (2) Be one of at least two collection contractors simultaneously 
providing collection services to the agency on FFEL loans under a 
competitive system that the agency has established and that includes the 
periodic assessment by the agency of the performance of the competing 
contractors and periodic adjustments in the volume of loans referred by 
the agency to each competing contractor based on those assessments; and
    (3) Not receive referral of more than 70 percent of the agency's 
referred loans in any calendar year.
    (v) Notwithstanding the deadline for instituting a civil suit set 
forth in paragraph (b)(6)(vii) of this section, an agency that uses the 
procedures in paragraphs (b)(7)(i)-(iv) of this section shall institute 
a civil suit required by that paragraph prior to the earliest of--
    (A) The 90th day following the collection contractor's return of the 
loan to the agency; or
    (B) The 365th day following the later of the agency's referral of 
the loan to the collection contractor, or the contractor's receipt of a 
payment on the loan.
    (8) Special conditions for agency payment of a claim. (i) A guaranty 
agency may adopt a policy under which it pays a claim to a lender on a 
loan under the conditions described in Sec. 682.509(a)(1).
    (ii) Upon the payment of a claim under a policy described in 
paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the guaranty agency shall--
    (A) Perform the loan servicing functions required of a lender under 
Sec. 682.208, except that the agency is not required to follow the 
credit bureau reporting requirements of that section;
    (B) Perform the functions of the lender during the repayment period 
of the loan, as required under Sec. 682.209;
    (C) If the borrower is delinquent in repaying the loan at the time 
the agency pays a claim thereon to the lender or becomes delinquent 
while the agency holds the loan, exercise due diligence in accordance 
with Sec. 682.411 in attempting to collect the loan from the borrower 
and any endorser or co-maker; and
    (D) After the date of default on the loan, if any, comply with 
paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section with respect to collection 
activities on the loan, with the date of default treated as the claim 
payment date for purposes of those paragraphs.
    (9) Preemption of State law. The provisions of paragraphs (b) (2), 
(5), (6), and (7) of this section preempt any State law, including State 
statutes, regulations, or rules, that would conflict with or hinder 
satisfaction of the requirements of these provisions.
    (10) Administrative Garnishment. (i) If a guaranty agency decides to 
garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not making payments on a 
loan held by the agency, on which the Secretary has paid a reinsurance 
claim, it shall do so in accordance with the following procedures:
    (A) The employer shall deduct and pay to the agency from a 
borrower's wages an amount that does not exceed the lesser of 10 percent 
of the borrower's disposable pay for each pay period or the amount 
permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, unless the borrower provides the agency 
with written consent to deduct a greater amount. For this purpose, the 
term ``disposable pay'' means that part of the borrower's compensation 
from

[[Page 681]]

an employer remaining after the deduction of any amounts required by law 
to be withheld.
    (B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment 
proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's last known 
address, a written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, the 
intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt 
through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's 
rights.
    (C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to 
inspect and copy agency records related to the debt.
    (D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to 
enter into a written repayment agreement with the agency under terms 
agreeable to the agency.
    (E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity for 
a hearing in accordance with paragraph (b)(10)(i)(J) of this section 
concerning the existence or the amount of the debt and, in the case of a 
borrower whose proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order 
is established other than by a written agreement under paragraph 
(b)(10)(i)(D) of this section, the terms of the repayment schedule.
    (F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer for any amount that 
the employer, after receipt of the garnishment notice provided by the 
agency under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold 
from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's normal 
pay and disbursement cycle.
    (G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a borrower whom 
it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the 
borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months.
    (H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency 
believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, it 
shall send a withholding order to the employer within 20 days after the 
borrower fails to make a timely request for a hearing, or, if a timely 
request for a hearing is made by the borrower, within 20 days after a 
final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment.
    (I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) 
of this section must contain only the information as may be necessary 
for the employer to comply with the withholding order.
    (J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at the 
borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower submits a 
written request for a hearing on the existence or amount of the debt or 
the terms of the repayment schedule. The time and location of the 
hearing shall be established by the agency. An oral hearing may, at the 
borrower's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone 
conference. All telephonic charges must be the responsibility of the 
guaranty agency.
    (K) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty 
agency on or before the 15th day following the borrower's receipt of the 
notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the 
guaranty agency may not issue a withholding order until the borrower has 
been provided the requested hearing. For purposes of this paragraph, in 
the absence of evidence to the contrary, a borrower shall be considered 
to have received the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this 
section 5 days after it was mailed by the agency. The guaranty agency 
shall provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a 
decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may 
prescribe, to be rendered within 60 days.
    (L) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty 
agency after the 15th day following the borrower's receipt of the notice 
described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty 
agency shall provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time that a 
decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may 
prescribe, may be rendered within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of 
a withholding order unless the agency determines that the delay in 
filing the request was caused by factors over which the borrower had no 
control, or the agency receives information that the agency believes 
justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order. For purposes 
of this paragraph, in the

[[Page 682]]

absence of evidence to the contrary, a borrower shall be considered to 
have received the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this 
section 5 days after it was mailed by the agency.
    (M) The hearing official appointed by the agency to conduct the 
hearing may be any qualified individual, including an administrative law 
judge, not under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty 
agency.
    (N) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision at the 
earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the guaranty 
agency's receipt of the borrower's hearing request.
    (O) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the HEA, the borrower may 
seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if the employer 
discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against the 
borrower due to the issuance of a withholding order.
    (ii) References to ``the borrower'' in this paragraph include all 
endorsers on a loan.
    (11) Conflicts of interest. (i) A guaranty agency shall maintain and 
enforce written standards of conduct governing the performance of its 
employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents engaged in the 
selection, award, and administration of contracts or agreements. The 
standards of conduct must, at a minimum, require disclosure of financial 
or other interests and must mandate disinterested decision-making. The 
standards must provide for appropriate disciplinary actions to be 
applied for violations of the standards by employees, officers, 
directors, trustees, or agents of the guaranty agency, and must include 
provisions to--
    (A) Prohibit any employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent from 
participating in the selection, award, or decision-making related to the 
administration of a contract or agreement supported by the reserve fund 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, if that participation would 
create a conflict of interest. Such a conflict would arise if the 
employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent, or any member of his or 
her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization that 
employs or is about to employ any of those parties has a financial or 
ownership interest in the organization selected for an award or would 
benefit from the decision made in the administration of the contract or 
agreement. The prohibitions described in this paragraph do not apply to 
employees of a State agency covered by codes of conduct established 
under State law;
    (B) Ensure sufficient separation of responsibility and authority 
between its lender claims processing as a guaranty agency and its 
lending or loan servicing activities, or both, within the guaranty 
agency or between that agency and one or more affiliates, including 
independence in direct reporting requirements and such management and 
systems controls as may be necessary to demonstrate, in the independent 
audit required under Sec. 682.410(b)(1), that claims filed by another 
arm of the guaranty agency or by an affiliate of that agency receive no 
more favorable treatment than that accorded the claims filed by a lender 
or servicer that is not an affiliate or part of the guaranty agency; and
    (C) Prohibit the employees, officers, directors, trustees, and 
agents of the guaranty agency, his or her partner, or any member of his 
or her immediate family, from soliciting or accepting gratuities, 
favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to 
agreements, except that nominal and unsolicited gratuities, favors, or 
items may be accepted.
    (ii) Guaranty agency restructuring. If the Secretary determines that 
action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest because of an 
agency's failure to meet the requirements of Sec. 682.410(b)(11)(i), the 
Secretary may require the agency to comply with any additional measures 
that the Secretary believes are appropriate, including the total 
divestiture of the agency's non-FFEL functions and the agency's 
interests in any affiliated organization.
    (c) Enforcement requirements. A guaranty agency shall take such 
measures and establish such controls as are necessary to ensure its 
vigorous enforcement of all Federal, State, and guaranty agency 
requirements, including agreements, applicable to its loan guarantee 
program, including, at a minimum, the following:

[[Page 683]]

    (1) Conducting comprehensive biennial on-site program reviews, using 
statistically valid techniques to calculate liabilities to the Secretary 
that each review indicates may exist, of at least--
    (i)(A) Each participating lender whose dollar volume of FFEL loans

year--
    (1) Equaled or exceeded two percent of the total of all loans 
guaranteed in that year by the agency;
    (2) Was one of the ten largest lenders whose loans were guaranteed 
in that year by the agency; or
    (3) Equaled or exceeded $10 million in the most recent fiscal year;
    (B) Each lender described in section 435(d)(1)(D) or (J) of the Act

guaranty agency, the Student Loan Marketing Association; and
    (C) Each participating school, located in a State for which the 
guaranty agency is the principal guaranty agency, that has a cohort 
default rate, as defined in 34 CFR 668.15, for either of the two 
immediately preceding fiscal years, as defined in Sec. 668.15, that 
exceeds 20 percent, unless the school is under a mandate from the 
Secretary under Sec. 668.15 to take specific default reduction measures 
or if the total dollar amount of loans entering repayment in each fiscal 
year on which the default rate over 20 percent is based does not exceed 
$100,000; or
    (ii) The schools and lenders selected by the agency as an 
alternative to the reviews required by paragraphs (c)(1)(A)-(C) of this 
section if the Secretary approves the agency's proposed alternative 
selection methodology.
    (2) Demanding prompt repayment by the responsible parties to 
lenders, borrowers, the agency, or the Secretary, as appropriate, of all 
funds found in those reviews to be owed by the participants with regard 
to loans guaranteed by the agency, whether or not the agency holds the 
loans, and monitoring the implementation by participants of corrective 
actions, including these repayments, required by the agency as a result 
of those reviews.
    (3) Referring to the Secretary for further enforcement action any 
case in which repayment of funds to the Secretary is not made in full 
within 60 days of the date of the agency's written demand to the school, 
lender, or other party for payment, together with all supporting 
documentation, any correspondence, and any other documentation submitted 
by that party regarding the repayment.
    (4) Adopting procedures for identifying fraudulent loan

    (7) Promptly reporting all of the allegations and indications of 
misconduct having a substantial basis in fact, and the scope, progress, 
and results of the agency's investigations thereof to the Secretary.
    (8) Referring appropriate cases to State or local authorities for 
criminal prosecution or civil litigation.
    (9) Promptly notifying the Secretary of--
    (i) Any action it takes affecting the FFEL program eligibility of a 
participating lender or school;
    (ii) Information it receives regarding an action affecting the FFEL 
program eligibility of a participating lender or school taken by a 
nationally recognized accrediting agency, association, or a State 
licensing agency;
    (iii) Any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to the 
enforceability of FFEL loans guaranteed by the agency or in which 
tuition obligations of a school's students are directly at issue, other 
than a proceeding relating to a single borrower or student; and
    (iv) Any petition for relief in bankruptcy, application for 
receivership, or corporate dissolution proceeding

<R05>
Sec. 682.411  Due diligence by lenders in the collection of guaranty agency loans.

    (a) General. In the event of delinquency on a FFEL programs loan, 
the lender shall engage in at least the collection efforts described in 
paragraphs (c)-(m) of this section, except that in the case of a loan 
made to a borrower who is incarcerated or to a borrower residing outside 
a State, Mexico, or Canada, the lender may send a forceful collection 
letter in lieu of each telephone effort required by this section.
    (b) Delinquency. (1) For purposes of this section, delinquency on a 
loan begins on the first day after the due date of the first missed 
payment which is not later made. The due date of the first payment is 
established by the lender but must occur no later than 45 days following 
the end of the grace period, or, if the lender first learns after the 
fact that the borrower has entered the repayment period, no later than 
75 days after the day the lender so learns, except as provided in 
Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E). If a payment is made late, the first day of 
delinquency is the day after the due date of the next missed payment 
which is not later made. A payment that is within five dollars of the 
amount normally required to advance the due date may nevertheless 
advance the due date if the lender's procedures allow for that 
advancement.
    (2) At no point during the periods specified in paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section may the lender permit the occurrence of a gap in 
collection activity, as defined in paragraph (i) of this section, of 
more than 45 days (60 days in the case of a transfer).
    (c) 1-15 days delinquent: Except in the case where a loan is brought 
into this period by a payment on the loan, expiration of an authorized 
deferment or forbearance period, or the lender's receipt from the drawee 
of a dishonored check submitted as a payment on the loan, the lender 
during this period shall send at least one written notice or collection 
letter to the borrower informing the borrower of the delinquency and 
urging the borrower to make payments sufficient to eliminate the 
delinquency. The notice or collection letter sent during this period 
must include, at a minimum, a lender/servicer contact and telephone 
number, and a prominent statement informing the borrower that assistance 
may be available if he or she is experiencing difficulty in making a 
scheduled repayment.
    (d) 16-180 days delinquent (16-240 days delinquent for a loan 
repayable in installments less frequent than monthly): (1) Unless 
exempted under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, during this period the 
lender shall engage in at least four diligent efforts to contact the 
borrower by

[[Page 685]]

telephone and send at least four collection letters urging the borrower 
to make the required payments on the loan. At least one of the diligent 
efforts to contact the borrower by phone must occur before, and another 
one must occur after, the 90th day of delinquency. The notice or 
collection letter sent during this period must include, at a minimum, 
information for the borrower regarding deferment, forbearance, income-
sensitive repayment and loan consolidation and other available options 
to avoid default.
    (2) At least two of the collection letters required under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section must warn the borrower that if the loan is not 
paid, the lender will assign the loan to the guaranty agency that, in 
turn, will report the default to all national credit bureaus, and that 
the agency may institute proceedings to offset the borrower's state and 
federal income tax refunds and other payments made by the federal 
government to a borrower or to garnish the borrower's wages, or assign 
the loan to the federal government for litigation against the borrower.
    (3) Following the lender's receipt of a payment on the loan or a 
correct address for the borrower, the lender's receipt from the drawee 
of a dishonored check received as a payment on the loan, the lender's 
receipt of a correct telephone number for the borrower, or the 
expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period, the lender 
is required to engage in only--
    (i) Two diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone during 
this period, if the loan is less than 91 days delinquent (121 days 
delinquent for a loan repayable in installments less frequent than 
monthly) upon receipt of the payment, correct address, or returned 
check, or expiration of the deferment or forbearance; or
    (ii) One diligent effort to contact the borrower by telephone if the 
loan is 91-120 days delinquent (121-180 days delinquent for a loan 
repayable in installments less frequent than monthly) upon receipt of 
the payment, correct address, or returned check, or expiration of the 
deferment of forbearance.
    (4) A lender need not attempt to contact by telephone any borrower--
    (i) Who is incarcerated;
    (ii) Who is residing outside of a State, Mexico or Canada;
    (iii) Whose telephone number is unknown;
    (iv) Who is more than 120 days delinquent (180 days delinquent for a 
loan repayable in installments less frequent than monthly) following the 
lender's receipt of--
    (A) A payment on the loan;
    (B) A correct address for the borrower;
    (C) A dishonored check received from the drawee as a payment on the 
loan; or
    (D) The expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance.
    (e) Final demand. On or after the 151st day of delinquency, (the 
211th day for loans payable in less frequent installments than monthly) 
the lender shall send a final demand letter to the borrower requiring 
repayment of the loan in full and notifying the borrower that a default 
will be reported to a national credit bureau. The lender shall allow the 
borrower at least 30 days after the date the letter is mailed to respond 
to the final demand letter and to bring the loan out of default before 
filing a default claim on the loan.
    (f) Collection procedures when borrower's telephone number is not 
available. Upon completion of a diligent but unsuccessful effort to 
ascertain the correct telephone number of a borrower as required by 
paragraph (l)(1) of this section, the lender is excused from any further 
efforts to contact the borrower by telephone during the delinquency 
period in which the unsuccessful effort was made, unless the borrower's 
number is obtained before the 120th day of delinquency (the 150th day 
for loans payable repayable in installments less frequent than monthly).
    (g) Skip-tracing. (1) Unless the letter specified under paragraph 
(e) of this section has already been sent, within 10 days of its receipt 
of information indicating that it does not know the borrower's current 
address, the lender shall begin to diligently attempt to locate the 
borrower through the use of normal commercial skip-tracing techniques. 
These efforts must include, but are not limited to, making a diligent

[[Page 686]]

effort to contact each endorser, relative, reference, and individual and 
entity identified in the borrower's loan file. For this purpose, a 
lender's contact with a school official who might reasonably be expected 
to know the borrower's address may be with someone other than the 
financial aid administrator identified on the loan application. These 
efforts must be completed by the date of default with no gap of more 
than 45 days between attempts to contact those individuals or entities.
    (2) Upon receipt of information indicating that it does not know the 
borrower's current address, the lender shall discontinue the collection 
efforts described in paragraphs (c)-(e) of this section.
    (3) If the lender is unable to ascertain the borrower's current 
address despite its performance of the activities described in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section, the lender is excused thereafter from 
performance of the collection activities described in paragraphs (c)-(e) 
and (k)(1) through (k)(3) and (k)(5) of this section unless it receives 
communication indicating the borrower's address before the 151st day of 
delinquency (the 211th day for loans payable in less frequent 
installments than monthly).
    (4) The activities specified by paragraphs (l)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section (with references to ``the borrower'' understood to mean 
endorser, reference, relative, individual or entity as appropriate) meet 
the requirement that the lender make a diligent effort to contact each 
individual identified in the borrower's loan file.
    (h) Preclaims assistance. The lender shall request preclaims 
assistance from the agency that guaranteed the loan within 10 days 
before or after the date established by the agency that assistance is 
first available from the agency.
    (i) Gap in collection activity. For purposes of this section, the 
term ``gap in collection activity'' means, with respect to a loan, any 
period--
    (1) Beginning on the date that is the day after--
    (i) The due date of a payment unless the lender does not know the 
borrower's address on that date;
    (ii) The day on which the lender receives a payment on a loan that 
remains delinquent notwithstanding the payment;
    (iii) The day on which the lender receives the correct address for a 
delinquent borrower;
    (iv) The day on which the lender completes a collection activity;
    (v) The day on which the lender receives a dishonored check 
submitted as a payment on the loan;
    (vi) The expiration of an authorized deferment or forbearance period 
on a delinquent loan; or
    (vii) The day the lender receives information indicating it does not 
know the borrower's current address; and
    (2) Ending on the date of the earliest of--
    (i) The day on which the lender receives the first subsequent 
payment or completed deferment request or forbearance agreement;
    (ii) The day on which the lender begins the first subsequent 
collection activity;
    (iii) The day on which the lender receives written communication 
from the borrower relating to his or her account; or
    (iv) Default.
    (j) Transfer. For purposes of this section, the term ``transfer'' 
with respect to a loan means any action, including, but not limited to, 
the sale of the loan, that results in a change in the system used to 
monitor or conduct collection activity on a loan from one system to 
another.
    (k) Collection activity. For purposes of this section, the term 
``collection activity'' with respect to a loan means--
    (1) Mailing or otherwise transmitting to the borrower at an address 
that the lender reasonably believes to be the borrower's current address 
a collection letter or final demand letter that satisfies the timing and 
content requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section;
    (2) Making an attempt to contact the borrower by telephone to urge 
the borrower to begin or resume repayment;
    (3) Conducting skip-tracing efforts, in accordance with paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section, to locate a borrower whose correct address or 
telephone number is unknown to the lender;
    (4) Mailing or otherwise transmitting to the guaranty agency a 
request for

[[Page 687]]

preclaims assistance available from the agency on the loan at the time 
the request is transmitted; or
    (5) Any telephone discussion or personal contact with the borrower 
so long as the borrower is apprised of the account's past-due status.
    (l) ``Diligent effort'' for telephone contact. (1) For purposes of 
this section, the term ``diligent effort'' with respect to telephone 
contact means--
    (i) A successful effort to contact the borrower by telephone;
    (ii) At least two unsuccessful attempts to contact the borrower by 
telephone at a number that the lender reasonably believes to be the 
borrower's correct telephone number; or
    (iii) An unsuccessful effort to ascertain the correct telephone 
number of a borrower, including, but not limited to, a directory 
assistance inquiry as to the borrower's telephone number, and a diligent 
effort to contact each reference, relative, and individual identified in 
the most recent loan application for that borrower held by the lender. 
The lender may contact a school official other than the financial aid 
administrator who reasonably may be expected to know the borrower's 
address.
    (2) If the lender is unable to ascertain the borrower's correct 
telephone number despite its performance of the activities described in 
paragraph (l)(1)(iii) of this section, the lender is excused thereafter 
from attempting to contact the borrower by telephone unless it receives 
a communication indicating the borrower's current telephone number 
before the 120th day of delinquency (the 150th day for loans repayable 
in installments less frequent than monthly).
    (3) The activities specified by paragraphs (l)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section (with references to ``the borrower'' understood to mean 
endorser, reference, relative or individual as appropriate), meet the 
requirement that the lender make a diligent effort to contact each 
endorser or each reference, relative or individual identified on the 
borrower's most recent loan application.
    (m) Due diligence for endorsers. (1) During the delinquency period 
the lender shall--
    (i) Make a diligent effort to contact the endorser by telephone; and
    (ii) Send the endorser on the loan two letters advising the endorser 
of the delinquent status of the loan and urging the endorser to make the 
required payments on the loan with at least one letter containing the 
information described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (with 
references to ``the borrower'' understood to mean the endorser).
    (2) On or after the 151st day of delinquency, (the 211th day for 
loans payable in less frequent installments than monthly) the lender 
shall send a final demand letter to the endorser requiring repayment of 
the loan in full and notifying the endorser that a default will be 
reported to a national credit bureau. The lender shall allow the 
endorser at least 30 days after the date the letter is mailed to respond 
to the final demand letter and to bring the loan current before filing a 
default claim on the loan.
    (3) Unless the letter specified under paragraph (m)(2) of this 
section has already been sent, upon receipt of information indicating 
that it does not know the endorser's current address or telephone 
number, the lender must diligently attempt to locate the endorser 
through the use of normal commercial skip-tracing techniques. This 
effort must include an inquiry to directory assistance.
    (n) Preemption of State law. The provisions of this section preempt 
any State law, including State statutes, regulations, or rules, that 
would conflict with or hinder satisfaction of the requirements or 
frustrate the purposes of this section.

letter meeting the requirements of

[[Page 688]]

Sec. 682.411(e) when it learns and can substantiate that the borrower or

to interest benefits on a loan after it learns that one of the

this section, the lender shall demand that within 30 days from the date

interest and all special allowance paid by the Secretary.
    (d) If the borrower repays the amounts described in paragraph (c) of 
this section within the 30-day period, the lender shall--
    (1) On its next quarterly interest billing submitted under 
Sec. 682.305, refund to the Secretary the interest benefits and special 
allowance repaid by the borrower and all other interest benefits and 
special allowance previously paid by the Secretary on the ineligible 
portion of the loan; and
    (2) Treat that payment of the principal amount of the ineligible 
portion of the loan as a prepayment of principal.
    (e) If a borrower fails to comply with the terms of a final demand 
letter described in paragraph (a) of this section, the lender shall 
treat the entire loan as in default, and--
    (1) With its next quarterly interest billing submitted under 
Sec. 682.305, refund to the Secretary the amount of the interest 
benefits received from the Secretary on the ineligible portion of the 
loan, whether or not repaid by the borrower; and
    (2) Within the time specified in Sec. 682.406(a)(5), file a default

administering any aspect of the FFEL programs under a contract with the 
lender to repay interest benefits and special allowance or other 
compensation received on a loan guaranteed by a guaranty agency, 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section--
    (i) For any period beginning on the date of a failure by the lender 
or servicer, with respect to the loan, to comply with any of the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 682.406(a)(1)-(a)(6), (a)(9), and 
(a)(12);
    (ii) For any period beginning on the date of a failure by the lender

which the guaranty agency reinstated the guarantee coverage pursuant to 
policies and procedures established by the agency;
    (iii) For any period in which the lender or servicer, with respect 
to the loan, violates the requirements of subpart C of this part; and
    (iv) For any period beginning on the day after the Secretary's 
obligation to pay special allowance on the loan terminates under 
Sec. 682.302(d).
    (2) For purposes of this section, a lender and any applicable third-
party servicer shall be considered jointly and severally liable for the

any interest benefits and special allowance paid as a result of a 
violation of applicable requirements by the servicer in administering 
the lender's FFEL programs.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the relevant 
third-party servicer shall repay any outstanding liabilities under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section only if--
    (i) The Secretary has determined that the servicer is jointly and 
severally liable for the liabilities; and
    (ii) (A) The lender has not repaid in full the amount of the 
liability within 30 days from the date the lender receives notice from

    (B) The lender has not made other satisfactory arrangements to pay

receives notice from the Secretary of the liability; or
    (C) The Secretary is unable to collect the liability from the lender 
by offsetting the lender's bill to the Secretary for interest benefits 
or special allowance, if--
    (1) The bill is submitted after the 30 day period specified in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section has passed; and
    (2) The lender has not paid, or made satisfactory arrangements to 
pay, the liability.
    (b)(1) The Secretary requires a guaranty agency to repay reinsurance

payments received on a loan or to assign FFEL loans to the Department if 
the agency fails to meet the requirements of Sec. 682.410.
    (c)(1) In addition to requiring repayment of reinsurance payments 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may take one or 
more of the following remedial actions against a guaranty agency or 
third-party servicer administering any aspect of the FFEL programs under 
a contract with the guaranty agency, that makes an incomplete or

    (i) Require the agency to return payments made by the Secretary to 
the agency.
    (ii) Withhold payments to the agency.
    (iii) Limit the terms and conditions of the agency's continued 
participation in the FFEL programs.
    (iv) Suspend or terminate agreements with the agency.
    (v) Impose a fine on the agency or servicer. For purposes of

the servicer has been cited for a similar violation previously and had 
failed to make the appropriate corrections to the system.
    (vi) Require repayment from the agency and servicer pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, of interest, special allowance, and

administering any aspect of the FFEL programs under a contract with that 
guaranty agency.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the relevant 
third-party servicer shall repay any outstanding liabilities under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section only if--
    (i) The Secretary has determined that the servicer is jointly and 
severally liable for the liabilities; and

    (d)(1) The Secretary follows the procedures described in 34 CFR part

imposing a fine against a lender, guaranty agency, or third-party 
servicer. References to ``the institution'' in those regulations shall 
be understood to mean the lender, guaranty agency, or third-party 
servicer, as applicable, for this purpose.
    (2) The Secretary also follows the provisions of section 432(g) of 
the Act in imposing a fine against a guaranty agency or lender.
    (e)(1) The Secretary's decision to require repayment of funds, 
withhold funds, or to limit, suspend, or terminate a lender, agency, or 
third-party servicer from participation in the FFEL programs does not 
become final until the Secretary provides the lender, agency, or 
servicer with written notice of the intended action and an opportunity 
to be heard thereon, at a time and in a manner the Secretary determines 
to be appropriate to the resolution of the issues on which the lender, 
agency, or servicer requests an opportunity to be heard.
    (2)(i) The Secretary may withhold payments from an agency or suspend 
an agreement with an agency prior to giving notice and an opportunity to 
be heard if the Secretary finds that emergency action is necessary to 
prevent substantial harm to Federal interests.

    (f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)-(e) of this section, the 
Secretary may waive the right to require repayment of funds by a lender 
or agency if in the Secretary's judgment the best interests of the 
United States so require. The Secretary's waiver policy for violations 
of Sec. 682.406(a)(3) or (a)(5) is set forth in appendix D to this part.
    (g) The Secretary's final decision to require repayment of funds or 
to take other remedial action, other than a fine, against a lender or 
guaranty agency under this section is conclusive and binding on the 
lender or agency.

    Note: A decision by the Secretary under this section is subject to 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 706 and 41 U.S.C. 321-322.

retain the original note until the loan is paid in full or assigned to

or notify the borrower under an alternate procedure that is acceptable 
under State law that the loan is paid in full, and retain a copy for the 
prescribed period.

to Sec. 682.401(b) (21) and (22), and the right of the lender to receive

or chief executive officer of the applicant certifying that the 
applicant meets the definition of a servicer contained in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section; and
    (iii)(A) A compliance audit of its loan portfolio, conducted by a 
qualified independent organization meeting the criteria in paragraph 
(b)(9) of this section, that yields a compliance performance rating of 
97 percent or higher of all due diligence requirements applicable to 
each loan, on average, with respect to the collection of delinquent or 
defaulted loans and satisfying the requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) 
of this section or, if applicable, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. 
The audit period may end no more than 90 days prior to the date the 
lender, servicer or guaranty agency submits its request for designation.
    (B) To satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section, a servicer may submit its annual compliance audit under 34 CFR 
682.416(e), if the servicer includes in its report a measure of its 
compliance performance rating required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of 
this section, if this audit is performed in accordance with an audit 
guide developed by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector 
General.
    (3) The cost of audits for determining eligibility and continued 
compliance under this section is the responsibility of the lender, 
servicer, or guaranty agency.
    (4) A lender or servicer shall also submit the information in 
paragraph (a)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section to each appropriate 
guaranty agency.
    (5) A lender may be designated for exceptional performance for loans 
that it services itself. A lender servicer may

[[Page 694]]

be designated for exceptional performance only for all loans it 
services.
    (6)(i) To prevent a lapse of a lender's, servicer's, or guaranty 
agency's exceptional performance status after the end of the 12-month 
period, the lender, servicer, or guaranty agency shall submit updated 
information required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the 
Secretary no later than 90 days after the end of the annual audit 
period.
    (ii) Upon the Secretary's determination that the lender, servicer, 
or guaranty agency maintained at least a 97 percent compliance 
performance rate and satisfies the other requirements for designation, 
the Secretary notifies the lender, servicer, or guaranty agency that its 
redesignation for exceptional performance begins on the date following 
the last day of the previous 12-month period for which it received 
designation for exceptional performance. However, a lender's, 
servicer's, or guaranty agency's designation for exceptional performance 
continues until it receives notification from the Secretary that its 
request for redesignation is approved, or that its designation is 
revoked, under the provisions of paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) The Secretary notifies the lender or lender servicer and the 
appropriate guaranty agency within 60 days after the date the Secretary 
receives the information, listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
from the eligible lender or lender servicer, that the lender's or lender 
servicer's reapplication for designation for exceptional performance has 
been approved or denied. A notice under paragraph (a)(6) of this section 
is determined to have been received by the lender, servicer, or guaranty 
agency no later than 3 days after the notice is mailed, unless the 
lender, servicer, or guaranty agency is able to prove otherwise.
    (b) Determination of eligibility. (1) The Secretary determines 
whether to designate a lender or lender servicer for exceptional 
performance based upon--
    (i) The annual compliance audit of collection activities required 
for FFEL Program loans under Sec. 682.411(c) through (h), and (m), if 
applicable, serviced during the audit period;
    (ii) Information from any guaranty agency regarding an eligible 
lender or lender servicer desiring designation, including, but not 
limited to, any information suggesting that the lender's or lender 
servicer's request for designation should not be approved;
    (iii) Any other information in the possession of the Secretary, or 
submitted to the Secretary by any other agency or office of the Federal 
Government; and
    (iv) Evidence indicating that the lender or lender servicer has 
complied with the requirements for converting FFEL Program loans to 
repayment under Sec. 682.209(a), and the timely filing requirements 
under Secs. 682.402(e)(2) and 682.406(a)(5), in accordance with the 
audit guide as published by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of 
Inspector General. The audit submitted under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section may satisfy this requirement, if a separate sample of loans is 
used.
    (2) The Secretary informs the eligible lender or lender servicer, 
and the appropriate guaranty agency, that the lender's or lender 
servicer's request for designation as an exceptional lender or lender 
servicer has been approved, unless the results of the audit are 
persuasively rebutted by information under paragraphs (b) (1)(ii) or 
(iii) of this section. If the request for designation is not approved, 
the Secretary informs the lender or lender servicer and the appropriate 
guaranty agency or agencies of the reason the application is not 
approved.
    (3) In calculating a lender's or lender servicer's compliance 
rating, as referenced in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
universe for the audit must include all loans in the lender's or lender 
servicer's FFEL Program portfolio that are serviced during the audit 
period performed under the Department's regulations in Secs. 682.411, 
682.209(a), 682.402(e)(2), and 682.406(a)(5). The calculation may 
consider only due diligence activities applicable to the audit period. 
The numerator must include the total number of collection activities 
successfully completed, in accordance with program regulations, that are 
serviced during the audit period. The denominator must include

[[Page 695]]

the total number of collection activities required to be performed, in 
compliance with program regulations, that are serviced during the audit 
period. Using statistical sampling and evaluation techniques identified 
in an audit guide prepared by the Department's Office of Inspector 
General, a random sample of loans must be selected and evaluated.
    (4) The Secretary notifies the lender or lender servicer and the 
appropriate guaranty agency within 60 days after the date the Secretary 
receives the information, listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
from the eligible lender or lender servicer, that the lender's or lender 
servicer's application for designation for exceptional performance has 
been approved or denied.
    (5)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a 
guaranty agency may not refuse, solely on the basis of a violation of 
repayment conversion, due diligence requirements, or timely filing 
requirements, to pay an eligible lender or lender servicer, designated 
for exceptional performance, 100 percent of the unpaid principal and 
interest of all loans for which eligible claims are submitted for 
insurance payment by that eligible lender or lender servicer. The 
designation of a lender or lender servicer for exceptional performance 
applies to loans that have been serviced by the lender or lender 
servicer for the last 180 days prior to a borrower's default or earlier 
in the case of death, disability, or bankruptcy.
    (ii) A guaranty agency or the Secretary may require the lender or 
lender servicer to repurchase a loan if the agency determines the loan 
should not have been submitted as a claim. A guaranty agency may not 
require repurchase of a loan based solely on the lender's violation of 
the requirement relating to repayment conversion, due diligence, or 
timely filing. The guaranty agency must pay claims to a lender or lender 
servicer designated for exceptional performance in accordance with this 
paragraph for the one-year period following the date the guaranty agency 
receives notification of the lender's or lender servicer's designation 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary notifies 
the guaranty agency that the lender's or lender servicer's designation 
for exceptional performance has been revoked.
    (6)(i) To maintain its designation for exceptional performance, the 
lender or lender servicer must have a quarterly compliance audit of the 
due diligence in collection activities required for FFEL Program loans 
under Sec. 682.411(c)-(h), and (m), if applicable, and for converting 
FFEL Program loans to repayment under Sec. 682.209(a) and timely filing 
requirements under Secs. 682.402(e)(2) and 682.406(a)(5) conducted by a 
qualified independent organization meeting the criteria in paragraph 
(b)(9) of this section that results in a compliance rating for the 
quarter of not less than 97 percent. The audit must indicate a 
compliance performance rating of not less than 97 percent for two 
consecutive months or 90 percent for any month. The quarterly audit may 
not include any period covered by the annual financial and compliance 
audit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The results of the 
quarterly compliance audit must be submitted to the Secretary and to the 
appropriate guaranty agencies within 90 days following the end of each 
quarter.
    (ii) If a lender or lender servicer has been designated for 
exceptional performance for at least 15 months, a lender or lender 
servicer may petition the Secretary for permission to have its internal 
auditors perform the subsequent quarterly compliance audits required by 
paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. If the Secretary approves the 
request, the lender's or lender servicer's annual audit must assess the 
reliability of the procedures used by the lender's or lender servicer's 
internal auditor in performing the quarterly audits.
    (iii) The lender or lender servicer shall perform three quarterly 
audits and one annual audit that includes a representative sample of 
fourth quarter collection activities to satisfy the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (7)(i) Insurance payments made on eligible claims submitted by a 
lender or lender servicer designated for exceptional performance are not 
subject to additional review of repayment conversion, due diligence, and 
timely filing requirements, or to required repurchase by the lender or 
lender servicer,

[[Page 696]]

unless the Secretary determines that the eligible lender or lender 
servicer engaged in fraud or other purposeful misconduct in obtaining 
designation for exceptional performance. Notwithstanding the payment 
requirements in this paragraph, nothing prohibits the guaranty agency or 
the Secretary from reviewing the lender's or lender servicer's 
activities in regard to the loans paid under this paragraph as part of 
program oversight responsibilities, or for requiring the lender to 
repurchase a loan if the agency determines the loan should not have been 
submitted as a claim. The lender shall file, and the guaranty agency 
shall maintain, the documentation the guaranty agency normally requires 
its lenders to file with respect to the collection history of each loan.
    (ii) A lender or lender servicer designated under this section that 
fails to service loans or otherwise comply with applicable program 
regulations is considered in violation of 31 U.S.C. 3729.
    (8)(i) The Secretary revokes the designation of a lender or lender 
servicer for exceptional performance if--
    (A) The quarterly compliance audit required under paragraph (b)(6) 
of this section is submitted to the Secretary and indicates that the 
lender or lender servicer failed to maintain not less than 97 percent 
compliance with due diligence standards for the quarter, or not less 
than 97 percent compliance for 2 consecutive months, or 90 percent for 
any month; or
    (B) Any quarterly audit required in paragraph (b)(6) of this section 
is not received by the Secretary within 90 days following the end of 
each quarter.
    (ii) The Secretary may revoke the designation of an exceptional 
lender or lender servicer if--
    (A) The Secretary determines the eligible lender or lender servicer 
failed to maintain an overall level of regulatory compliance consistent 
with the audit submitted by the lender or lender servicer;
    (B) The Secretary has reason to believe the lender or lender 
servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing its designation for 
exceptional performance; or
    (C) The lender or lender servicer fails to service loans in 
accordance with program regulations. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
lender or lender servicer fails to service loans in accordance with 
program regulations if the Secretary determines that the lender or 
lender servicer has committed serious and material violations of the 
regulations.
    (iii) The date on which the event or condition occurred is the 
effective date of the revocation, except for revocation under paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section, which is effective at the close of the 12-month 
period for which the lender or lender servicer received designation for 
exceptional performance.
    (9) Public accountants, public accounting firms, and external 
government audit organizations that meet the qualification and 
independence standards contained in Government Auditing Standards 
published by the Comptroller General of the United States are acceptable 
entities to perform the audits required under paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(A) 
and (b)(6) of this section.
    (c)(1)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, 
the Secretary pays the applicable reinsurance rate under section 
428(b)(1)(G) of the Act on all claims submitted by a guaranty agency or 
guaranty agency servicer that has been designated for exceptional 
performance.
    (ii) A guaranty agency may be designated for exceptional performance 
for loans that it services itself.
    (iii) A guaranty agency servicer may be designated for exceptional 
performance for loans it services.
    (iv) A guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer is designated for 
exceptional performance for a 12-month period following the receipt, by 
the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer, of the Secretary's 
notification of designation.
    (v) A notice under this paragraph is determined to have been 
received no later than 3 days after the date the notice is mailed, 
unless the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer is able to prove 
otherwise.
    (2) The Secretary determines whether to designate a guaranty agency 
or guaranty agency servicer for exceptional performance based upon--

[[Page 697]]

    (i) The annual financial audit and a compliance audit of collection 
activities, including timely claim payment and timely reinsurance filing 
required for FFEL Program loans under Secs. 682.410(b)(6) (iii) through 
(xii), and 682.406 (a)(8) and (a)(9), or Secs. 682.410(b)(7) and 682.406 
(a)(8) and (a)(9); and
    (ii) Any other information in the possession of the Secretary.
    (3) The Secretary informs the guaranty agency or guaranty agency 
servicer that its request for designation for exceptional performance 
has been approved, unless the results of the audit are persuasively 
rebutted by other information received by the Secretary. If the 
Secretary does not approve the guaranty agency's or guaranty agency 
servicer's request for designation, the Secretary informs the guaranty 
agency or guaranty agency servicer of the reason the application was not 
approved.
    (4) In calculating a guaranty agency's or guaranty agency servicer's 
compliance rating, as referenced in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section, the Secretary requires that the universe of loans in the audit 
sample must consist of all loans in the guaranty agency's or guaranty 
agency servicer's FFEL Program portfolio that are serviced during the 
audit period performed under the Department's regulations in 
Secs. 682.410(b)(6) (iii) through (xii) and 682.406 (a)(8) and (a)(9) or 
Secs. 682.410(b)(7) and 682.406 (a)(8) and (a)(9). The calculation may 
consider only the due diligence activities that were or should have been 
conducted during the audit period. The numerator must include the total 
number of collection activities successfully completed in accordance 
with program regulations on loans that were serviced during the audit 
period. The denominator must include the total number of collection 
activities required to be performed in compliance with program 
regulations on loans that were serviced during the audit period. Using 
statistical sampling and evaluation techniques identified in an audit 
guide prepared by the Department's Office of Inspector General, a random 
sample of loans must be selected and evaluated.
    (5) The Secretary notifies a guaranty agency or guaranty agency 
servicer, within 60 days after the date the Secretary receives the 
information listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section whether the 
guaranty agency's or guaranty agency servicer's application for 
designation for exceptional performance has been approved or denied.
    (6)(i) To maintain its status as an exceptional guaranty agency or 
guaranty agency servicer, the guaranty agency or guaranty agency 
servicer must have a quarterly compliance audit of the due diligence in 
collection activities of defaulted FFEL Program loans under 
Secs. 682.410(b)(6) (iii) through (xii) and 682.406 (a)(8) and (a)(9) or 
682.410(b)(7) and 682.406(a)(8) and (a)(9) conducted by a qualified 
independent organization meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(9) of 
this section. The audit must yield a compliance performance rating of 
not less than 97 percent. The quarterly audit may not include any period 
covered by the annual financial and compliance audit required under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The results of the quarterly 
compliance audit must be submitted to the Secretary within 90 days 
following the end of each quarter.
    (ii) If the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer has been 
designated for exceptional performance for at least 15 months, the 
guaranty agency or a guaranty agency servicer may petition the Secretary 
for permission to have its internal auditors perform subsequent 
quarterly compliance audits required by paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this 
section. If the Secretary approves the request, the guaranty agency's or 
guaranty agency servicer's annual audit must assess the reliability of 
the procedures used by the guaranty agency's or the guaranty agency 
servicer's internal auditor in performing the quarterly audits.
    (7)(i) Payments of reinsurance made on claims, under the FFEL 
Program, submitted by a guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer 
designated for exceptional performance are not subject to repayment 
based on additional review of due diligence activities, including timely 
claim payment, or timely filing for reinsurance covering a period during 
which the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer was designated for 
any reason other than a determination by the Secretary

[[Page 698]]

that the eligible guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer engaged in 
fraud or other purposeful misconduct in obtaining designation for 
exceptional performance.
    (ii) A guaranty agency designated under this section that fails to 
servicer loans or otherwise comply with applicable program regulations 
is considered in violation of 31 U.S.C. 3729.
    (8)(i) The Secretary may revoke the designation of a guaranty agency 
or guaranty agency servicer for exceptional performance if the Secretary 
has reason to believe the guaranty agency or guaranty agency servicer 
fraudulently obtained its designation for exceptional performance.
    (ii) The Secretary may revoke the designation for exceptional 
performance upon 30 days' notice, and an opportunity for a hearing 
before the Secretary, if the Secretary finds that the guaranty agency or 
guaranty agency servicer failed to maintain an acceptable overall level 
of regulatory compliance.
    (9) A qualified independent organization is an organization that 
meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Due diligence requirements means the activities required to be 
performed by lenders or guaranty agencies on delinquent or defaulted 
loans pursuant to Sec. 682.411 (c) through (h), and (m), if applicable 
and Secs. 682.410(b)(6) (iii) through (xii) and 682.406 (a)(8) and 
(a)(9) or Secs. 682.410(b)(7) and 682.406(a)(8) and (a)(9);
    (2) Eligible loan means a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under

<R05>
Sec. 682.416  Requirements for third-party servicers and lenders contracting with third-party servicers.

    (a) Standards for administrative capability. A third-party servicer 
is considered administratively responsible if it--
    (1) Provides the services and administrative resources necessary to 
fulfill its contract with a lender or guaranty agency, and conducts all 
of its contractual obligations that apply to the FFEL programs in 
accordance with FFEL programs regulations;
    (2) Has business systems including combined automated and manual 
systems, that are capable of meeting the requirements of part B of Title 
IV of the Act and with the FFEL programs regulations; and
    (3) Has adequate personnel who are knowledgeable about the FFEL 
programs.
    (b) Standards of financial responsibility. The Secretary applies the 
provisions of 34 CFR 668.15(b) (1)-(4) and (6)-(9) to determine that a 
third-party servicer is financially responsible under this part. 
References to ``the institution'' in those provisions shall be 
understood to mean the third-party servicer, for this purpose.
    (c) Special review of third-party servicer. (1) The Secretary may 
review a third-party servicer to determine that it meets the 
administrative capability and financial responsibility standards in this 
section.
    (2) In response to a request from the Secretary, the servicer shall 
provide evidence to demonstrate that it meets the administrative 
capability and financial responsibility standards in this section.

[[Page 699]]

    (3) The servicer may also provide evidence of why administrative 
action is unwarranted if it is unable to demonstrate that it meets the 
standards of this section.
    (4) Based on the review of the materials provided by the servicer, 
the Secretary determines if the servicer meets the standards in this 
part. If the servicer does not, the Secretary may initiate an 
administrative proceeding under subpart G.
    (d) Past performance of third-party servicer or persons affiliated 
with servicer. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
third-party servicer is not financially responsible if--
    (1)(i) The servicer; its owner, majority shareholder, or chief 
executive officer; any person employed by the servicer in a capacity 
that involves the administration of a Title IV, HEA program or the 
receipt of Title IV, HEA program funds; any person, entity, or officer 
or employee of an entity with which the servicer contracts where that 
person, entity, or officer or employee of the entity acts in a capacity 
that involves the administration of a Title IV, HEA program or the 
receipt of Title IV, HEA program funds has been convicted of, or has 
pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, 
use, or expenditure of Federal, State, or local government funds, or has 
been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud 
or any other material violation of law involving such funds, unless--
    (A) The funds that were fraudulently obtained, or criminally 
acquired, used, or expended have been repaid to the United States, and 
any related financial penalty has been paid;
    (B) The persons who were convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or 
guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of the 
funds are no longer incarcerated for that crime; and
    (C) At least five years have elapsed from the date of the 
conviction, nolo contendere plea, guilty plea, or administrative or 
judicial determination; or
    (ii) The servicer, or any principal or affiliate of the servicer (as 
those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85), is--
    (A) Debarred or suspended under Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 (3 CFR, 
1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (B) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 34 CFR 85.305 or 
85.405 for debarment or suspension under E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., 
p. 189) or the FAR, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; and
    (2) Upon learning of a conviction, plea, or administrative or 
judicial determination described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
the servicer does not promptly remove the person, agency, or 
organization from any involvement in the administration of the 
servicer's participation in Title IV, HEA programs, including, as 
applicable, the removal or elimination of any substantial control, as 
determined under 34 CFR 668.15, over the servicer.
    (e) Independent audits. (1) A third-party servicer shall arrange for 
an independent audit of its administration of the FFELP loan portfolio 
unless--
    (i) The servicer contracts with only one lender or guaranty agency; 
and
    (ii) The audit of that lender's or guaranty agency's FFEL programs 
involves every aspect of the servicer's administration of those FFEL 
programs.
    (2) The audit must--
    (i) Examine the servicer's compliance with the Act and applicable 
regulations;
    (ii) Examine the servicer's financial management of its FFEL program 
activities;
    (iii) Be conducted in accordance with the standards for audits 
issued by the United States General Accounting Office's (GAO's) 
Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, 
and Functions. (This publication is available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.) 
Procedures for audits are contained in an audit guide developed by and 
available from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of 
Education; and
    (iv) Except for the initial audit, be conducted at least annually 
and be submitted to the Secretary within six months of the end of the 
audit period. The initial audit must be an annual audit of the 
servicer's first full fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 1994,

[[Page 700]]

and include any period from the beginning of the first full fiscal year. 
The audit report must be submitted to the Secretary within six months of 
the end of the audit period. Each subsequent audit must cover the 
servicer's activities for the one-year period beginning no later than 
the end of the period covered by the preceding audit.
    (3) With regard to a third-party servicer that is a governmental 
entity, the audit required by this paragraph must be conducted in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 7502 and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G.
    (4) With regard to a third-party servicer that is a nonprofit 
organization, the audit required by this paragraph must be conducted in 
accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, 
``Audit of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit 
Institutions,'' as incorporated in 34 CFR 74.61(h)(3).
    (f) Contract responsibilities. A lender that participates in the 
FFEL programs may not enter into a contract with a third-party servicer 
that the Secretary has determined does not meet the requirements of this 
section. The lender must provide the Secretary with the name and address 
of any third-party servicer with which the lender enters into a contract 
and, upon request by the Secretary, a copy of that contract. A third-
party servicer that is under contract with a lender to perform any 
activity for which the records in Sec. 682.414(a)(3)(ii) are relevant to 
perform the services for which the servicer has contracted shall 
maintain current, complete, and accurate records pertaining to each loan 
that the servicer is under contract to administer on behalf of the 
lender. The records must be maintained in a system that allows ready 
identification of each loan's current status.

Sec. 682.417  Determination of reserve funds or assets to be returned.

    (a) General. The procedures described in this section apply to a 
determination by the Secretary that--
    (1) A guaranty agency must return to the Secretary a portion of its 
reserve funds which the Secretary has determined is unnecessary to pay 
the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the agency; and
    (2) A guaranty agency must require the return to the agency or the 
Secretary of reserve funds or assets within the meaning of section

which the Secretary determines are necessary to pay the program expenses 
and contingent liabilities of the agency or which are required for the 
orderly termination of the guaranty agency's operations and the 
liquidation of its assets.
    (b) Return of unnecessary reserve funds. (1) The Secretary may 
initiate a process to recover unnecessary reserve funds under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that a guaranty 
agency's reserve fund ratio under Sec. 682.410(a)(10) for each of the 
two preceding Federal fiscal years exceeded 2.0 percent.
    (2) If the Secretary initiates a process to recover unnecessary 
reserve funds, the Secretary requires the return of a portion of the 
reserve funds that the Secretary determines will permit the agency to--
    (i) Have a reserve fund ratio of at least 2.0 percent under 
Sec. 682.410(a)(10) at the time of the determination; and
    (ii) Meet the minimum reserve fund requirements under 
Sec. 682.410(a)(10) and retain sufficient additional reserve funds to 
perform its responsibilities as a guaranty agency during the current 
Federal fiscal year and the four succeeding Federal fiscal years.
    (3)(i) The Secretary makes a determination of the amount of the 
reserve funds needed by the guaranty agency under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section on the basis of financial projections for the period 
described in that paragraph. If the agency provides projections for a 
period longer than the period referred to in that paragraph, the 
Secretary may consider those projections.

[[Page 701]]

    (ii) The Secretary may require a guaranty agency to provide 
financial projections in a form and on the basis of assumptions 
prescribed by the Secretary. If the Secretary requests the agency to 
provide financial projections, the agency shall provide the projections 
within 60 days of the Secretary's request. If the agency does not 
provide the projections within the specified time period, the Secretary 
determines the amount of reserve funds needed by the agency on the basis 
of other information.
    (c) Notice. (1) The Secretary or an authorized Departmental official 
begins a proceeding to order a guaranty agency to return a portion of 
its reserve funds, or to direct the return of reserve funds or assets 
subject to return, by sending the guaranty agency a notice by certified 
mail, return receipt requested.
    (2) The notice--
    (i) Informs the guaranty agency of the Secretary's determination 
that the reserve funds or assets must be returned;
    (ii) Describes the basis for the Secretary's determination and 
contains sufficient information to allow the guaranty agency to prepare 
and present an appeal;
    (iii) States the date by which the return of reserve funds or assets 
must be completed;
    (iv) Describes the process for appealing the determination, 
including the time for filing an appeal and the procedure for doing so; 
and
    (v) Identifies any actions that the guaranty agency must take to 
ensure that the reserve funds or assets that are the subject of the 
notice are maintained and protected against use, expenditure, transfer, 
or other disbursement after the date of the Secretary's determination, 
and the basis for requiring those actions. The actions may include, but 
are not limited to, directing the agency to place the reserve funds in 
an escrow account. If the Secretary has directed the guaranty agency to 
require the return of reserve funds or assets held by or under the 
control of another entity, the guaranty agency shall ensure that the 
agency's claims to those funds or assets and the collectability of the 
agency's claims will not be compromised or jeopardized during an appeal. 
The guaranty agency shall also comply with all other applicable 
regulations relating to the use of reserve funds and assets.
    (d) Appeal. (1) A guaranty agency may appeal the Secretary's 
determination that reserve funds or assets must be returned by filing a 
written notice of appeal within 20 days of the date of the guaranty 
agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's determination. If the 
agency files a notice of appeal, the requirement that the return of 
reserve funds or assets be completed by a particular date is suspended 
pending completion of the appeal process. If the agency does not file a 
notice of appeal within the period specified in this paragraph, the 
Secretary's determination is final.
    (2) A guaranty agency shall submit the information described in 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section within 45 days of the date of the 
guaranty agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's determination 
unless the Secretary agrees to extend the period at the agency's 
request. If the agency does not submit that information within the 
prescribed period, the Secretary's determination is final.
    (3) A guaranty agency's appeal of a determination that reserve funds 
or assets must be returned is considered and decided by a Departmental 
official other than the official who issued the determination or a 
subordinate of that official.
    (4) In an appeal of the Secretary's determination, the guaranty 
agency shall--
    (i) State the reasons the guaranty agency believes the reserve funds 
or assets need not be returned;
    (ii) Identify any evidence on which the guaranty agency bases its 
position that the reserve funds or assets need not be returned;
    (iii) Include copies of the documents that contain this evidence;
    (iv) Include any arguments that the guaranty agency believes support 
its position that the reserve funds or assets need not be returned; and
    (v) Identify the steps taken by the guaranty agency to comply with 
the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.

[[Page 702]]

    (5)(i) In its appeal, the guaranty agency may request the 
opportunity to make an oral argument to the deciding official for the 
purpose of clarifying any issues raised by the appeal. The deciding 
official provides such an opportunity promptly after the expiration of 
the period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) The agency may not submit new evidence at or after the oral 
argument unless the deciding official determines otherwise. A transcript 
of the oral argument is made a part of the record of the appeal and is 
promptly provided to the agency.
    (6) The guaranty agency has the burden of production and the burden 
of persuading the deciding official that the Secretary's determination 
should be modified or withdrawn.
    (e) Third-party participation. (1) If the Secretary issues a 
determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary 
promptly publishes a notice in the Federal Register announcing the 
portion of the reserve fund to be returned by the agency and providing 
interested persons an opportunity to submit written information relating 
to the determination within 30 days after the date of publication. The 
Secretary publishes the notice no earlier than five days after the 
agency receives a copy of the determination.
    (2) If the guaranty agency to which the determination relates files 
a notice of appeal of the determination, the deciding official may 
consider any information submitted in response to the Federal Register 
notice. All information submitted by a third party is available for 
inspection and copying at the offices of the Department of Education in 
Washington, D.C., during normal business hours.
    (f) Adverse information. If the deciding official considers 
information in addition to the evidence described in the notice of the 
Secretary's determination that is adverse to the guaranty agency's 
position on appeal, the deciding official informs the agency and 
provides it a reasonable opportunity to respond to the information 
without regard to the period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (g) Decision. (1) The deciding official issues a written decision on 
the guaranty agency's appeal within 45 days of the date on which the 
information described in paragraph (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section 
is received, or the oral argument referred to in paragraph (d)(5) of 
this section is held, whichever is later. The deciding official mails 
the decision to the guaranty agency by certified mail, return receipt 
requested. The decision of the deciding official becomes the final 
decision of the Secretary 30 days after the deciding official issues it. 
In the case of a determination that a guaranty agency must return 
reserve funds, if the deciding official does not issue a decision within 
the prescribed period, the agency is no longer required to take the 
actions described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.
    (2) A guaranty agency may not seek judicial review of the 
Secretary's determination to require the return of reserve funds or 
assets until the deciding official issues a decision.
    (3) The deciding official's written decision includes the basis for 
the decision. The deciding official bases the decision only on evidence 
described in the notice of the Secretary's determination and on 
information properly submitted and considered by the deciding official 
under this section. The deciding official is bound by all applicable 
statutes and regulations and may neither waive them nor rule them 
invalid.
    (h) Collection of reserve funds or assets. (1) If the deciding 
official's final decision requires the guaranty agency to return reserve 
funds, or requires the guaranty agency to require the return of reserve 
funds or assets to the agency or to the Secretary, the decision states a 
new date for compliance with the decision. The new date is no earlier 
than the date on which the decision becomes the final decision of the 
Secretary.
    (2) If the guaranty agency fails to comply with the decision, the 
Secretary may recover the reserve funds from any funds due the agency 
from the Department without any further notice or procedure and may take 
any

[[Page 703]]

other action permitted or authorized by law to compel compliance.

Sec. 682.418  Prohibited uses of reserve fund assets.

    (a) General. (1) A guaranty agency may not use the assets of the 
reserve fund established under Sec. 682.410(a)(1) to pay costs 
prohibited under paragraph (b) of this section and may not use the 
assets of the reserve fund to pay for goods, property, or services 
provided by an affiliated organization that would exceed the affiliated 
organization's actual and reasonable cost of providing those goods, 
property, or services, unless the agency demonstrates to the Secretary, 
and receives the Secretary's concurrence, that such a payment would be 
in the Federal fiscal interest.
    (2) All guaranty agency contracts with respect to its reserve fund 
or assets must include a provision stating that the contract is 
terminable by the Secretary upon 30 days notice to the contracting 
parties if the Secretary determines that the contract includes an 
impermissible transfer of the reserve fund or assets or is otherwise 
inconsistent with the terms and purposes of section 422 of the HEA.
    (b) Prohibited uses of reserve fund assets. A guaranty agency may 
use the assets of the reserve fund established under Sec. 682.410(a)(1) 
only as prescribed in Sec. 682.410(a)(2). Uses of the reserve fund that 
are not allowable under Sec. 682.410(a)(2) include, but are not limited 
to--
    (1) Compensation for personnel services, including wages, salaries, 
pension plan costs, post-retirement health benefits, employee life 
insurance, unemployment benefit plans, severance pay, costs of leave, 
and other benefits, to the extent that total compensation to an 
employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent of the guaranty agency is 
not reasonable for the services rendered. Compensation is considered 
reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid in the labor 
market in which the guaranty agency competes for the kind of employees 
involved. Costs that are otherwise unallowable may not be considered 
allowable solely on the basis that they constitute personnel 
compensation. In no case may the reserve fund be used to pay any 
compensation, whether calculated on an hourly basis or otherwise, that 
would be proportionately greater than 118.05 percent of the total salary 
paid (as calculated on an hourly basis) under section 5312 of title 5, 
United States Code (relating to Level I of the Executive Schedule).
    (2) Contributions and donations, including cash, property, and 
services, by the guaranty agency to others, regardless of the recipient 
or purpose, unless pursuant to written authorization from the Secretary;
    (3) Entertainment, including amusement, diversion, hospitality 
suites, and social activities, and any costs associated with those 
activities, such as tickets to shows or sports events, meals, alcoholic 
beverages, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities;
    (4) Fines, penalties, damages, and other settlements resulting from 
violations or alleged violations of the guaranty agency's failure to 
comply with Federal, State, or local laws and regulations that are 
unrelated to the FFEL Program, unless specifically approved by the 
Secretary. This prohibition does not apply if a non-criminal violation 
or alleged violation has been assessed against the guaranty agency, the 
payment does not reimburse an agency employee, and the payment does not 
exceed $1,000, or if it occurred as a result of compliance with specific 
requirements of the FFEL Program or in accordance with written 
instructions from the Secretary. The use of the reserve fund in any 
other case must be requested by the agency and specifically approved in 
advance by the Secretary;
    (5) Legal expenses for prosecution of claims against the Federal 
Government, unless the guaranty agency substantially prevails on those 
claims. In that event, the Secretary approves the reimbursement of 
reasonable legal expenses incurred by the guaranty agency;
    (6) Lobbying activities, as defined in section 501(h) of the 
Internal Revenue

[[Page 704]]

Code, including dues to membership organizations to the extent that 
those dues are used for lobbying;
    (7) Major expenditures, including those for land, buildings, 
equipment, or information systems, whether singly or as a related group 
of expenditures, that exceed 5 percent of the guaranty agency's reserve 
fund balance at the time the expenditures are made, unless the agency 
has provided written notice of the intended expenditure to the Secretary 
30 days before the agency makes or commits itself to the expenditure. 
For those expenditures involving the purchase of an asset, the term 
``major expenditure'' applies to costs such as the cost of purchasing 
the asset and making improvements to it, the cost to put it in place, 
the net invoice price of the asset, ancillary charges, such as taxes, 
duty, protective in-transit insurance, freight, and installation costs, 
and the costs of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or 
auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the asset usable for the purpose 
for which it was acquired, whether the expenditures are classified as 
capital or operating expenses;
    (8) Public relations, and all associated costs, paid directly or 
through a third party, to the extent that those costs are used to 
promote or maintain a favorable image of the guaranty agency. The term 
``public relations'' does not include any activity that is ordinary and 
necessary for the fulfillment of the agency's FFEL guaranty 
responsibilities under the HEA, including appropriate and reasonable 
advertising designed specifically to communicate with the public and 
program participants for the purpose of facilitating the agency's 
ability to fulfill its FFEL guaranty responsibilities under the HEA. 
Ordinary and necessary public relations activities include training of 
program participants and secondary school personnel and customer service 
functions that disseminate FFEL-related information and materials to 
schools, loan holders, prospective loan applicants, and their parents. 
In providing that training at workshops, conferences, or other ordinary 
and necessary forums customarily used by the agency to fulfill its 
responsibilities under the HEA, the agency may provide light meals and 
refreshments of a reasonable nature and amount to the participants;
    (9) Relocation of employees in excess of an employee's actual or 
reasonably estimated expenses or for purposes that do not benefit the 
administration of the guaranty agency's FFEL program. Except as approved 
by the Secretary, reimbursement must be in accordance with an 
established written policy; and
    (10) Travel expenses that are not in accordance with a written 
policy approved by the Secretary or a State policy. If the guaranty 
agency does not have such a policy, it may not use the assets of the 
reserve fund to pay for travel expenses that exceed those allowed for 
lodging and subsistence under subchapter I of Chapter 57 of title 5, 
United States Code, or in excess of commercial airfare costs for 
standard coach airfare, unless those accommodations would require 
circuitous routing, travel during unreasonable hours, excessively 
prolonged travel, would result in increased cost that would offset 
transportation savings, or would offer accommodations not reasonably 
adequate for the medical needs of the traveler.
    (c) Cost allocation. Each guaranty agency that shares costs with any 
other program, agency, or organization shall develop a cost allocation 
plan consistent with the requirements described in OMB Circular A-87 and 
maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit. A 
guaranty agency is required to submit its cost allocation plans for the 
Secretary's approval if it is specifically requested to do so by the 
Secretary.

           Subpart E--Federal Guaranteed Student Loan Programs


<R05>
Sec. 682.500  Circumstances under which loans may be guaranteed by the Secretary.

    (a) The Secretary may guarantee all--

[[Page 705]]

    (1) FISL, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS loans made by lenders 
located in a State in which no State or private nonprofit guaranty 
agency has in effect an agreement with the Secretary under Sec. 682.401 
to serve as guarantor in that State;
    (2) Federal Consolidation loans made by the Student Loan Marketing 
Association and Federal Consolidation loans made by any other lender 
that has applied for and been denied guarantee coverage on Consolidation 
loans by the guaranty agency that guarantees the largest dollar volume 
of FFEL loans made by the lender; and
    (3) FISL, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS, and Federal Consolidation loans 
made by lenders located in a State in which a guaranty agency program is 
operating but is not reasonably accessible to students who meet the 
agency's residency requirements.
    (b) The Secretary may guarantee FISL, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS and 
Federal Consolidation loans made by a lender located in a State where a 
guaranty agency operates a program that is reasonably accessible to 
students who meet the residency requirements of that program only for--
    (1) A student who does not meet the agency's residency requirements;
    (2) A lender who is not able to obtain a guarantee from the guaranty 
agency for at least 80 percent of the loans the lender intends to make 
over a 12-month period because of the agency's residency requirements;
    (3) With the approval of the guaranty agency, a student who has 
previously received from the same lender a FISL loan that has not been 
repaid; or
    (4) All students at a school located in the State if the Secretary 
finds that--
    (i) No single guaranty agency program is reasonably accessible to 
students at that school as compared to students at other schools during 
a comparable period of time; and
    (ii) Guaranteeing loans made in the State to students attending that 
school would significantly increase the access of students at that 
school to FFEL Program loans. The Secretary may guarantee loans made to 
those students by a lender in that State if--
    (A) The guaranty agency does not recognize the school as being 
eligible, but the school is eligible under the FISL program; or
    (B) A majority of the persons enrolled at the school meet the 
conditions of student eligibility for FISL loans but are not recognized 
as eligible under the guaranty agency program.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a lender is 
considered to be located in the same State as a school if the lender--
    (1) Has an origination relationship with the school;
    (2) Has a majority of its voting stock held by the school; or
    (3) Has common ownership or management with the school and more than 
50 percent of the loans made by that lender are made to students at that 
school.
    (d) As a condition for guaranteeing loans under the Federal FFEL 
programs, the Secretary may require the lender to submit evidence of 
circumstances that would justify loan guarantees under the provisions of 
this section.
    (e) With regard to a school lender that has entered into an 
agreement with the Secretary under Sec. 682.600, the Secretary denies 
loan guarantees on the basis of this section only if the Secretary first 
determines that all eligible students at that school who make a 
conscientious effort to obtain a loan from another lender will find a 
loan to be reasonably available. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
determination of loan availability is based on studies and surveys that 
the Secretary considers satisfactory.

<R05>
Sec. 682.501  Extent of Federal guarantee under the Federal GSL programs.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Secretary's guarantee liability on any Federal GSL loan is 100 
percent of the unpaid principal balance and, to the extent permitted 
under Sec. 682.512, accrued interest.
    (b) Special provisions for State lenders. (1) Except as described in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary's guarantee liability is 
less than 100 percent under the following conditions:

[[Page 706]]

    (i) If the total of default claims under the Federal GSL programs 
paid by the Secretary to a State lender during any fiscal year reaches 
five percent of the amount of the Federal GSL loans in repayment at the 
end of the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary's guarantee liability on 
a claim subsequently paid during that fiscal year is 90 percent of the 
amount of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest.
    (ii) If the total of default claims under the Federal GSL programs 
paid by the Secretary to a State lender during any fiscal year reaches 
nine percent of the amount of the Federal GSL loans in repayment at the 
end of the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary's guarantee liability on 
a claim subsequently paid during that fiscal year is 80 percent of the 
amount of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest.
    (iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the total default claims paid 
by the Secretary during any fiscal year do not include paid claims filed 
by the lender under the provisions of Sec. 682.412(e) or Sec. 682.509.
    (2) The potential reduction in guarantee liability does not apply to 
a State lender during the first Federal fiscal year of its operation as 
a Federal GSL Program lender and during each of the four succeeding 
fiscal years.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the term ``amount of the 
Federal GSL loans in repayment'' means the original principal amount of 
all loans guaranteed by the Secretary less--
    (i) The original principal amount of loans on which--
    (A) Under the FISL program, the borrower has not yet reached the 
repayment period;
    (B) Payment in full has been made by the borrower;
    (C) The borrower was in deferment status at the time repayment of 
principal was scheduled to begin and remains in deferment status; or
    (D) The Secretary has paid a claim filed under section 437 of the 
Act; and
    (ii) The amount paid by the Secretary for default claims on loans, 
exclusive of paid claims filed by the lender under Sec. 682.412(e) or 
Sec. 682.509.
    (4) For the purposes of this paragraph, payments by the Secretary on 
a loan that the original lender assigned to a subsequent holder are 
considered payments made to the original lender.
    (5) State lenders shall consolidate Federal GSL loans for the 
purpose of calculating the amount of the Secretary's guarantee liability 
under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 682.502  The application to be a lender.

    (a) To be considered for participation in the Federal GSL programs, 
a lender shall submit an application to the Secretary.
    (b) In determining whether to enter into a guarantee agreement with 
an applicant, and, if so, what the terms of the agreement will be, the 
Secretary considers--
    (1) Whether the applicant meets the definition of an ``eligible 
lender'' in section 435(d) of the Act and the definition of ``lender`' 
in Sec. 682.200;
    (2) Whether the applicant is capable of complying with the 
regulations in this part as they apply to lenders;
    (3) Whether the applicant is capable of implementing adequate 
procedures for making, servicing, and collecting loans;
    (4) Whether the applicant has had prior experience with a similar 
Federal, State, or private nonprofit student loan program, and the 
amount and percentage of loans that are currently delinquent or in 
default under that program;
    (5) The financial resources of the applicant; and
    (6) In the case of a school that is seeking approval as a lender, 
its accreditation status.
    (c) The Secretary may require an applicant to submit sufficient 
materials with its application so that the Secretary may fairly evaluate 
it in accordance with the criteria in this section.
    (d)(1) If the Secretary decides not to approve the application for a 
guarantee agreement, the Secretary's response includes the reason for 
the decision.
    (2) The Secretary provides the lender an opportunity for the lender 
to meet with a designated Department official if the lender wishes to 
appeal the Secretary's decision.

[[Page 707]]

    (3) However, the Secretary need not explain the reasons for the 
denial or grant the lender an opportunity to appeal if the lender 
submits its application within six months of a previous denial.

<R05>
Sec. 682.503  The guarantee agreement.

    (a)(1) To participate in the Federal GSL programs, a lender must 
have a guarantee agreement with the Secretary. The Secretary does not 
guarantee a loan unless it is covered by such an agreement.
    (2) In general, under a guarantee agreement the lender agrees to 
comply with all laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to 
its participation as a lender in the Federal GSL programs. In return, 
the Secretary agrees to guarantee each eligible Federal GSL loan held by 
the lender against the borrower's default, death, total and permanent 
disability, or bankruptcy.
    (3) The Secretary may include in an agreement a limit on the 
duration of the agreement and the number or amount of Federal GSL loans 
the lender may make or hold.
    (b)(1) Except as otherwise approved by the Secretary, a guarantee 
agreement with a school lender limits the Federal GSL loans made by that 
school lender that will be covered by the Federal guarantee to those 
loans made to students, or to parents borrowing on behalf of students, 
who are--
    (i) In attendance at that school;
    (ii) In attendance at other schools under the same ownership as that 
school; or
    (iii) Employees or dependents of employees, or whose parents are 
employees, of that school lender or other schools under the same 
ownership, under circumstances the Secretary considers appropriate for 
loan guarantees.
    (2) The Secretary may on a school-by-school basis impose limits 
under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section on a school lender that 
makes loans to students or to parents of students in attendance at other 
schools under the same ownership, or to employees, or to dependents or 
parents of employees, of those other schools.

Sec. 682.504  Issuance of Federal loan guarantees.

    (a) A lender having a guarantee agreement shall submit an 
application to the Secretary for a Federal loan guarantee on each 
intended loan that the lender determines to be eligible for a guarantee. 
The application must be on a form prescribed by the Secretary. The 
Secretary notifies the lender whether the loan will be guaranteed and of 
the amount of the guarantee. No disbursement on a loan made prior to the 
Secretary's approval of that loan is covered by the guarantee.
    (b) The Secretary issues a guarantee on a Federal GSL loan in 
reliance on the implied representations of the lender that all 
requirements for the initial eligibility of the loan for guarantee 
coverage have been met. As described in Sec. 682.513, the continuance of 
the guarantee is conditioned upon compliance by all holders of the loan 
with the regulations in this part.

Sec. 682.505  Insurance premium.

    (a) General. The Secretary charges the lender an insurance premium 
for each Federal GSL Program loan that is guaranteed, except that no 
insurance premium is charged on a Federal Consolidation loan, or on a 
Federal SLS or Federal PLUS loan made under Sec. 682.209(f).
    (b) Rate. The rate of the insurance premium is one-fourth of one 
percent per year of the loan principal, excluding interest or other 
charges that may have been added to the principal.
    FISL loans--insurance premium calculation. (1) The insurance premium 
for FISL loans is calculated by--
    (i) Counting the number of months beginning with the month following 
the month in which each disbursement on the loan is to be made and 
ending 12 months after the borrower's anticipated graduation from the 
school for attendance at which the loan is sought;

[[Page 708]]

    (ii) Dividing one-fourth of one percent of the principal amount of 
the loan by 12; and
    (iii) Multiplying the result obtained in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section by that obtained in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) If the lender disburses the loan in multiple installments, the 
insurance premium is calculated for each disbursement from the month 
following the month that the disbursement is made.
    (d) PLUS and SLS Loans--insurance premium calculation. The insurance 
premium for a Federal PLUS or SLS loan is calculated by--
    (1) Using the projected repayment period as a base;
    (2) Amortizing the loan in equal monthly installments over the 
repayment period;
    (3) Determining one-fourth of one percent of each monthly declining 
principal balance; and
    (4) Computing the total of monthly amounts calculated under 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (e) Collection from lenders. (1) The Secretary may bill the lender 
for the insurance premium or may require the lender to pay the insurance 
premium to the Secretary at the time of disbursement of the loan. At the 
Secretary's discretion, the Secretary may alternatively collect the 
insurance premium by offsetting it against amounts payable by the 
Secretary to the lender.
    (2) The Secretary's guarantee on a loan ceases to be effective if 
the lender fails to pay the insurance premium within 60 days of the date 
payment is due. However, the Secretary may excuse late payment of an 
insurance premium and reinstate the guarantee coverage on a loan if the 
Secretary is satisfied that at the time the premium is paid--
    (i) The loan is not in default and the borrower is not delinquent in 
making installment payments; or
    (ii) The loan is in default, or the borrower is delinquent, under 
circumstances where the borrower has entered the repayment period 
without the lender's knowledge.
    Collection from borrowers. The lender may pass along the cost of the 
insurance premium to the borrower. If it does so, the insurance premium 
must be deducted from each disbursement of the loan in an amount 
proportionate to that disbursement's contribution to the premium amount.
    (g) Refund provisions. The insurance premium is not refundable by 
the Secretary and need not be refunded by the lender to the borrower, 
even if the borrower prepays, defaults, dies, becomes totally and 
permanently disabled, or files a petition in bankruptcy.

Sec. 682.506  Limitations on maximum loan amounts.

    (a) The Secretary does not guarantee a FISL, Federal SLS, or Federal 
PLUS loan in an amount that would--
    (1) Result in an annual loan amount in excess of the student's 
estimated cost of attendance for the period of enrollment for which the 
loan is intended less--
    (i) The student's estimated financial assistance; and
    (ii) The student's expected family contribution for that period, in 
the case of a FISL loan; or
    (2) Result in an annual or aggregate loan amount in excess of the 
permissible annual and aggregate loan limits described in Sec. 682.204.
    (b) The Secretary does not guarantee a Federal Consolidation loan in 
an amount greater than that required to discharge loans eligible for 
consolidation under Sec. 682.100(a)(4).

<R05>
Sec. 682.507  Due diligence in collecting a loan.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, a lender shall exercise due diligence in the collection of a 
loan with respect to both a borrower and an authorized endorser. In 
order to exercise due diligence, a lender shall implement the procedures 
described in this section if a borrower fails to make an installment 
payment when due.
    (2) If two borrowers are liable for repayment of a Federal PLUS or 
Consolidation loan as co-makers, the lender must follow these procedures 
with respect to both borrowers.

[[Page 709]]

    (3) For purposes of this section, the borrower's delinquency begins 
on the day after the due date of an installment payment not paid when 
due, except that if the borrower entered the repayment period without 
the lender's knowledge, the delinquency begins 30 days after the day the 
lender receives notice that the borrower has entered the repayment 
period.
    (4) In lieu of the procedures described in this section, a lender 
may use the due diligence procedures in Sec. 682.411 in collecting a 
Federal GSL loan.
    (b) Initial delinquency. If a borrower is delinquent in making a 
payment, the lender shall remind the borrower within 10 working days of 
the date the payment was due by means of a letter, notice, telephone 
call, or personal contact. If payments do not begin or resume, the 
lender shall attempt to contact the borrower--
    (1) At last six more times at regular intervals during the remainder 
of the six-month period that started on the date of delinquency for 
loans repayable in monthly installments; or
    (2) At least eight more times during the remainder of the eight-
month period that started on the date of delinquency for loans repayable 
in installments less frequent than monthly.
    (c) Skip-tracing assistance. (1) If a lender does not know the 
borrower's current address, the lender promptly shall attempt to locate 
the borrower through normal commercial collection activities, including 
contacting all individuals and entities named in the borrower's loan 
application. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the lender promptly 
shall attempt to learn the borrower's current address through use of the 
Department's skip-tracing assistance.
    (2) If the lender does not know the borrower's address when a 
borrower is first delinquent in making a payment, but subsequently 
obtains the borrower's address prior to the date on which the loan goes 
into default, the lender shall attempt to contact the borrower in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, with the first contact 
occurring within 15 days of the date the lender obtained knowledge of 
the borrower's address, and shall attempt to contact the borrower at 
least once during each succeeding 30-day period until default.
    (d) Preclaims assistance. When the borrower is 60 days delinquent in 
making a payment, the lender shall request preclaims assistance from the 
Department of Education. This preclaims assistance consists of sending a 
series of letters to the borrower, urging the borrower to contact the 
lender and begin or resume payments.
    (e) Final demand letter. A lender shall send a final demand letter 
to the borrower at least 30 days before the lender files a default 
claim. The lender shall allow the borrower at least 30 days to respond 
to the final demand letter. However, a lender need not send a final 
demand letter to a borrower whose address is unknown to the lender.
    (f) Litigation. (1) If a loan is in default and the lender 
determines that the borrower or an endorser has the ability to repay the 
loan, the lender may bring suit against the borrower or the endorser to 
recover the amount of the unpaid principal and interest, together with 
reasonable attorneys' fees, late charges, and court costs.
    (2) Prior to bringing suit the lender shall--
    (i) Obtain the Secretary's approval; and
    (ii) Notify the borrower or endorser in writing that it has received 
the Secretary's approval to bring suit on the loan, and that unless the 
borrower or endorser makes payments sufficient to bring the account out 
of default the lender will seek a judgment under which the borrower or 
endorser will be liable for payment of late charges, attorneys' fees, 
collection agency charges, court costs, and other reasonable collection 
costs in addition to the unpaid principal and interest on the loan. The 
lender shall mail the notice to the borrower or endorser by certified 
mail, return receipt requested.
    (3) The lender may bring suit if the borrower or endorser does not 
make payments sufficient to bring the account out of default within 10 
days following the date of delivery of the notice described in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii) of this section to the borrower or endorser indicated on the 
receipt.

[[Page 710]]

    (4) A lender may first apply the proceeds of any judgment against 
its attorneys' fees, court costs, collection agency charges, and other 
reasonable collection costs, whether or not the judgment provides for 
these fees and costs.

Sec. 682.508  Assignment of a loan.

    (a) General. A Federal GSL loan may not be assigned except to 
another eligible lender. For the purpose of this paragraph, ``assigned'' 
means any kind of transfer of an interest in the loan, including a 
pledge of such an interest as security.
    (b)(1) Procedure. If the assignment of a FISL Program loan is to 
result in a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower 
must send subsequent payments, the assignor and the assignee of the loan 
shall, no later than 45 days from the date the assignee acquires a 
legally enforceable right to receive payment from the borrower on the 
assigned loan, provide separate notices to the borrower of--
    (i) The assignment;
    (ii) The identity of the assignee;
    (iii) The name and address of the party to whom subsequent payments 
must be sent; and
    (iv) The telephone numbers of both the assignor and the assignee.
    (2) The assignor and assignee shall provide the notice required by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section separately. Each notice must indicate 
that a corresponding notice will be sent by the other party to the 
assignment.
    (c) The Secretary's approval. The approval of the Secretary is 
required prior to the assignment of a note to an eligible lender that 
has not entered into a contract of insurance with the Secretary under 
Sec. 682.503.
    (d) Warranty. (1) Nothing in this section precludes the buyer of a 
loan from obtaining a warranty from the seller covering certain future 
reductions by the Secretary in computing the amount of guaranteed loss, 
if any, on a claim filed on the loan.
    (2) The warranty may cover only reductions that are attributable to 
an act or failure to act of the seller or other previous holder.
    (3) The warranty may not cover matters the buyer is responsible for 
under the regulations in this part.

[[Page 711]]

Secretary's guarantee on a Federal GSL loan for any of the following 
reasons:
    (i) The loan is in default, as defined in Sec. 682.200.
    (ii) Any of the conditions exist for filing a claim without 
collection efforts, as set forth in Sec. 682.412(e)(2) or Sec. 682.509.
    (iii) The borrower has died, become totally and permanently 
disabled, or filed a bankruptcy petition, as determined by the lender in 
accordance with Sec. 682.510.
    (2) If a Federal PLUS loan was obtained by two eligible parents as 
co-makers, or a Consolidation loan was obtained jointly by a married 
couple, the reason for filing a claim must hold true for both 
applicants, or each applicant must have satisfied a claimable criterion 
at the time of the request for discharge of the loan.
    (3) A lender may file a claim against the Secretary's guarantee only 
on a form provided by the Secretary. The lender shall attach to the 
claim all documents required by the Secretary. If the lender fails to do 
so, the Secretary denies the claim.
    (b) Documentation required for claims. (1) The Secretary requires a 
lender to submit the following documentation with all claims:
    (i) The original promissory note.
    (ii) The loan application.

    (iv) A payment history, as described in Sec. 682.414(a)(3)(ii)(I).
    (v) A collection history, as described in Sec. 682.414(a)(3)(ii)(J).

    (viii) If applicable, evidence of the lender's requests to the 
Department for skip-tracing assistance under Sec. 682.507(c) and for 
preclaims assistance under Sec. 682.507(d).
    (ix) Any additional documentation that the Secretary determines is 
relevant to a claim.
    (2) The documentation requirements for death, total and permanent 
disability, or bankruptcy claims in Sec. 682.402(e)(1) apply to the 
Federal GSL programs. For purposes of this section, references to the 
``guaranty agency'' in Sec. 682.402(e)(1) mean the Secretary.
    (c) Assignment of note. The Secretary's payment of a claim is 
contingent upon receipt from the lender of an assignment to the United 
States of America of all rights, title, and interest of the lender in 
the note underlying the claim.
    (d) Bankruptcy subsequent to default. If the lender files a default 
claim on a loan and subsequently receives a notice of the first meeting 
of creditors in the proceeding of the borrower in bankruptcy, the lender 
shall promptly forward that notice to the Department of Education. Under 
these circumstances the lender shall not file a proof of claim with the 
bankruptcy court.
    (e) Claim filing deadlines. To obtain payment of a claim, a lender 
shall comply with the following deadlines:
    (1) Default claims. Unless the lender has already filed suit against 
the borrower in accordance with Sec. 682.507(f), it shall file a default 
claim on a loan with the Secretary within 90 days after a default has 
occurred on the loan. For a claim filed by a lender pursuant to 
Sec. 682.412(e)(2), as directed in Sec. 682.208(f)(2), the lender shall 
file a claim within 90 days following transmission of the final demand 
letter sent pursuant to Sec. 682.411(e) if the borrower failed to comply 
with the terms of the letter within 30 days of the transmission.
    (2) Death, total and permanent disability, or bankruptcy claims. The 
claim filing deadlines in Sec. 682.402(e)(2) apply to the Federal GSL 
programs. For purposes of this section, references to the ``guaranty 
agency'' in Sec. 682.402(e)(2) mean the Secretary.
    (3) Special condition claims. In the case of a special condition 
claim filed pursuant to Sec. 682.509, the lender shall file a claim with 
the Secretary within 45 days of the date the lender determines that the

<R05>
Sec. 682.512  Determination of amount payable on a claim.

    (a) Default claims. (1) Amount payable. The amount of loss to be 
paid on a default claim depends upon the date the Secretary received the 
application for a guarantee commitment on the loan. If the application 
was received--
    (i) Prior to July 1, 1972, or from August 19, 1972 through February 
28, 1973, the amount payable on a valid claim is equal to the unpaid 
balance of the original principal loan amount disbursed; or
    (ii) From July 1 through August 18, 1972, or after February 28, 
1973, the amount payable on a valid claim is equal to the unpaid balance 
of the principal and interest in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section. The unpaid principal amount of the loan may include 
capitalized interest to the extent authorized by Sec. 682.202(b).
    (2) Payment of interest. If the guarantee covers unpaid interest, 
the payment of a valid claim covers the unpaid interest that accrues 
during the following periods:
    (i) During the period before the claim is filed, not to exceed the 
period provided for in Sec. 682.511(e) for filing the claim.
    (ii) During a period not to exceed 30 days following the return of 
the claim to the lender by the Secretary for additional documentation 
necessary for the claim to be approved by the Secretary.
    (iii) During the period, after the claim is filed, that is required 
by the Secretary to approve the claim and to authorize payment or to 
return the claim to the lender for additional documentation.
    (3) Recovery of outstanding debts. The Secretary may reduce the 
amount of loss due to the lender on a claim by the amount the Secretary 
determines is owed to the Secretary by the lender.
    (b) Death, total and permanent disability, or bankruptcy claims. (1) 
In the case of a death or disability claim, the amount to be paid on a 
valid claim--
    (i) Is equal to the unpaid balance of the original principal loan 
amount disbursed if the loan was disbursed prior to December 15, 1968; 
or
    (ii) Is calculated in accordance with Sec. 682.402(f)(2) and (f)(3) 
if the loan was disbursed after December 14, 1968.
    (2) In the case of a bankruptcy claim, the amount of loss is 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 682.402(f)(2) and (f)(3).
    (3) For purposes of this section, references to the ``guaranty 
agency'' in Sec. 682.402(f)(3) mean the Secretary.
    (c) Special rules for a loan acquired by assignment. If a claim is 
filed by a lender that obtained a loan by assignment, that lender is not 
entitled to any payment under this section greater than that to which a 
previous holder would have been entitled. For example, the Secretary 
deducts from the claim any amounts that are attributable to payments 
made by the borrower to a prior holder of the loan before the borrower 
received proper notice of the assignment of the loan.

<R05>
Sec. 682.513  Factors affecting coverage of a loan under the loan guarantee.

    (a)(1) In determining whether to approve for payment a claim against 
the Secretary's guarantee, the Secretary considers matters affecting the 
enforceability of the loan obligation and whether the loan was made and 
administered in accordance with the Act and applicable regulations.
    (2) The Secretary deducts from a claim any amount that is not a 
legally enforceable obligation of the borrower, except to the extent 
that the defense of infancy applies.
    (3) Except as provided in Sec. 682.509, the Secretary does not pay a 
claim unless--
    (i) All holders of the loan have complied with the requirements of 
this part, including, but not limited to, those concerning due diligence 
in the making, servicing, and collecting of a loan;

[[Page 713]]

    (ii) The current holder has complied with the deadlines for filing a 
claim established in Sec. 682.511(e); and
    (iii) The current holder complies with the requirements for 
submitting documents with a claim as established in Sec. 682.511(b).
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 682.509, the Secretary does not pay a 
death, disability, or bankruptcy claim for a loan after a default claim 
for that loan has been disapproved by the Secretary or if it would not 
be payable as a default claim by the Secretary.
    (c) The Secretary's determination of the amount of loss payable on a 
default claim under this part, once final, is conclusive and binding on 
the lender that filed the claim.

    Note: A determination of the Secretary under this section is subject 
to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 706 and 41 U.S.C. 321-322.

a lender to cure certain defects in a specified manner if, in the 
Secretary's judgment, the best interests of the United States so 
require.
    (b) To receive payment on a default claim or to resume eligibility

a lender has committed a violation of the requirements of this part 
regarding due diligence in collection or timely filing of claims, the 
lender shall meet the conditions described in appendix C to this part.

current status.
    (2) A lender shall retain the records required for each loan for not 
less than five years following the date the loan is repaid in full by

particular cases the Secretary may require the retention of records 
beyond this minimum period.
    (3)(i) The lender may store the records specified in 
Sec. 682.414(a)(3)(ii)(C)-(K) on microfilm, optical disk, or other 
machine readable format.
    (ii) The holder of the promissory note shall retain the original 
note and repayment instrument until the loan is fully repaid. At that 
time the holder shall return the original note and repayment instrument 
to the borrower and retain copies for the prescribed period.
    (iii) The lender shall retain the original or a copy of the loan 
application.
    (b) Reports. A lender shall submit reports to the Secretary at the 
time and in the manner that the Secretary reasonably may require.

with the Secretary, the Department's Office of the Inspector General, 
and the Comptroller General of the United States, or their authorized 
representatives, in the conduct of audits, investigations, and program 
reviews. This cooperation must include--
    (1) Providing timely access for examination and copying to the 
records (including computerized records) required by applicable 
regulations and to any other pertinent books, documents, papers, 
computer programs, and records; and
    (2) Providing reasonable access to lender personnel associated with 
the lender's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs for the 
purpose of obtaining relevant information. In providing reasonable 
access, the institution may not--
    (i) Refuse to supply any relevant information;
    (ii) Refuse to permit interviews with those personnel that do not 
include the presence of representatives of the lender's management; and

Sec. 682.600 [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 682.601  Rules for a school that makes or originates loans.

    (a) General. To make or originate loans under the FFEL programs--
    (1) The school shall employ full-time at least one person whose 
responsibilities are limited to the administration of financial aid 
programs for students attending the school;
    (2) The school may not be a correspondence school;
    (3) The school may not make or originate loans that would be 
outstanding to or on behalf of more than 50 percent of the 
undergraduates in attendance at that school on at least a half-time 
basis unless the Secretary waives this rule pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section;
    (4) The school shall inform any undergraduate student who has not 
previously obtained a loan that was made or originated by the school and 
who seeks to obtain such a loan that he or she must first make a good 
faith effort to obtain a loan from a commercial lender;
    (5)(i) The school may not make or originate a loan for an academic 
period to a student described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section until 
the student provides the school with evidence under paragraph (b) of 
this section of denial of a loan by a commercial lender for the same 
academic period.
    (ii) In determining whether a school has complied with the 
requirement set paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the Secretary may 
take into consideration any patterns reflected by the letters of denial 
or the students' sworn statements referred to in paragraph (b) of this 
section that indicate that the school has not given sufficient 
counseling to students to seek loans from a commercial lender first. An 
example of an unacceptable pattern would be if all denials of loans to a 
school's students were made by a small number of lenders; and
    (6) The school's cohort default rate as calculated under Sec. 668.17 
may not exceed 15 percent; and
    (7) Except for reasonable administrative expenses directly related 
to the FFEL Program, the school must use payments received under 
Sec. 682.300 and Sec. 682.302 for need-based grant programs for its 
students.
    (b) Establishing a loan denial by a commercial lender. (1) To verify 
that a borrower has sought and been denied a loan from a commercial 
lender pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the school shall 
obtain from the borrower--
    (i) A written statement from a commercial lender indicating that the 
lender denied the borrower a loan for that academic period; or
    (ii) The borrower's sworn statement, indicating both the refusal of 
a loan by a commercial lender and the lender's refusal to provide a 
written statement of the denial.
    (2) If the borrower's statement is used to establish the denial of a 
loan, the statement must include--
    (i) The name and address of the lender that denied the loan;
    (ii) The approximate date on which the loan was denied;
    (iii) The name and telephone number of the official who communicated 
the denial to the borrower; and
    (iv) The borrower's signature.
    (3) If the school determines that the denial of a loan to an 
eligible borrower by a commercial lender is based upon the lender's 
refusal to lend more than a part of the amount requested by the 
borrower, the school may either--
    (i) Make or originate a loan to the borrower for the entire amount; 
or
    (ii) Supplement the loan that the commercial lender is willing to 
make with a second loan to the borrower.
    (c) Waiver of the 50 percent lending limit. A school may request the 
Secretary to waive the 50 percent lending limit described in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section if adherence to that limit

[[Page 715]]

would create a substantial hardship for the school's present or 
prospective students. The Secretary determines whether to grant the 
school a waiver after considering, among other factors--
    (1) The extent to which the school provides and expects to continue 
providing educational opportunities to economically disadvantaged 
students, as measured by the percentage of those students enrolled at 
the school who--
    (i) Are in families that fall within the ``low-income family'' 
category used by the Bureau of the Census;
    (ii) Would not be able to enroll or continue their enrollment at 
that school without Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loans made or originated by 
the school; and
    (iii) Would not be able to obtain a comparable education at another 
school;
    (2) The extent to which the school offers educational programs 
that--
    (i) Are unique in the geographical area the school serves; and
    (ii) Would not be available to some students if the school adhered 
to the 50 percent lending limit; and
    (3) The quality of the school's--
    (i) Management of student financial assistance programs; and
    (ii) Conformance with sound business practices.

application is generally an academic year, as defined by 34 CFR 668.2, 
except that a guaranty agency may allow schools to use a longer period 
of time, not to exceed 12 months, corresponding to the period to which 
the agency applies the annual loan limits under Sec. 682.401(b)(2)(ii).

of a PLUS loan, a fee for the completion or certification of any FFEL 
Program form or information or for providing any information necessary 
for a student or parent to receive a loan under part B of the Act or any 
benefits associated with such a loan.

    (a) General. (1) This section establishes rules governing a school's

by EFT or master check, the school must provide the student or parent 
borrower with the notice as described under Sec. 668.165.
    (3) If the school is placed under the reimbursement payment method 
as provided under Sec. 668.162, a school shall not disburse a loan, as 
provided in Sec. 668.167.

[[Page 717]]

    (b) Releasing loan proceeds. (1) Except as provided in 
Sec. 682.207(b)(1)(v)(C)(1), the proceeds of a Stafford, SLS or PLUS 
loan disbursed using electronic transfer of funds must be sent directly 
to the school by the lender.
    (2)(i) Except in the case of a late disbursement under paragraph (e) 
of this section or as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this 
section, a school may release the proceeds of any disbursement of a loan 
only to a student whom the school determines, after the school receives 
those proceeds from the lender, continuously has maintained eligibility 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 682.201, from the beginning of 
the loan period certified by the school on the student's loan 
application.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) If, after the proceeds of the first disbursement are 
transmitted to the student, the student becomes ineligible due solely to 
the school's loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV 
programs, the school may transmit the proceeds of the second or 
subsequent disbursement to the borrower as permitted by Sec. 668.26.
    (iv) If, prior to the transmittal of the proceeds of a disbursement 
to the student, the student temporarily ceases to be enrolled on at 
least a half-time basis, the school may transmit the proceeds of that 
disbursement and any subsequent disbursement to the student if the 
school subsequently determines and documents in the student's file--
    (A) That the student has resumed enrollment on at least a half-time 
basis;
    (B) The student's revised cost of attendance; and
    (C) That the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of 
the loan, notwithstanding any reduction in the student's cost of 
attendance caused by the student's temporary cessation of enrollment on 
at least a half-time basis.
    (c) Processing of the loan proceeds by the school. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, if a school receives a

is intended and then follow the procedures in paragraph (c) (2) of this 
section.
    (2)(i) Except as provided in Sec. 682.207(b)(1)(v)(C)(1), after the 
student has registered, if the loan proceeds are disbursed by means of a 
check that requires the endorsement of the student only, the school 
shall deliver the check to the student, subject to paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, within 30 days of the school's receipt of the check.
    (ii) If the loan proceeds are disbursed by means of a check that 
requires the endorsement of both the student and the school, the school 
shall--
    (A) In the case of the initial disbursement on a loan, endorse the 
check on its own behalf, and, after the student has registered, deliver 
it to the student subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, within 30 
days of the school's receipt of the check; or
    (B) Obtain the student borrower's endorsement on the check, endorse 
the check on its own behalf and, after the student has registered,

provided in the loan application, not more than 30 days prior to the 
first day of classes of the period of enrollment for which the loan is 
intended, obtain the student's, or in the case of a Federal PLUS loan, 
the parent borrower's written authorization for the release of the 
initial and any subsequent disbursement of each FFEL loan to be made, 
and after the student has registered either--
    (i) Deliver the proceeds to the student or parent borrower as 
specified in Sec. 668.164; or
    (ii) Credit the student's account in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section and Sec. 668.164, notify the student or parent 
borrower in writing that it has so credited that account, and deliver to 
the student or parent borrower the remaining loan proceeds not later 
than the timeframe specified in 668.164.

[[Page 718]]

    (4) A school may not credit a student's account or release the 
proceeds of a loan to a student who is on a leave of absence, as 
described in Sec. 668.22(j).
    (5) A school may not release the first installment of a Stafford or 
SLS loan for endorsement to a student who is enrolled in the first year 
of an undergraduate program of study and who has not previously received 
a Stafford or SLS loan until 30 days after the first day of the 
student's program of study.
    (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, unless 
Sec. 682.207(c) (4) or (5) applies--
    (i) If a loan period is more than one payment period, the school 
shall deliver loan proceeds at least once in each payment period; and
    (ii) If a loan period is one payment period, the school shall make 
at least two deliveries of loan proceeds during that payment period. The 
school may not make the second delivery until the calendar midpoint 
between the first and last scheduled days of class of the loan period.
    (7) If an educational program measures academic progress in credit 
hours and does not use semesters, trimesters, or quarters, the school 
may not deliver a second disbursement until the later of--
    (i) The calendar midpoint between the first and last scheduled days 
of class of the loan period; or
    (ii) The date, as determined by the school, that the student has 
completed half of the academic coursework in the loan period.
    (8) If an educational program measures academic progress in clock 
hours, the school may not deliver a second disbursement until the later

    (i) The calendar midpoint between the first and last scheduled days 
of class of the loan period; or
    (ii) The date, as determined by the school, that the student has 
completed half of the clock hours in the loan period.
    (9) The school must deliver loan proceeds in substantially equal 
installments, and no installment may exceed one-half of the loan.
    (d) Applying the loan proceeds. (1)(i) For purposes of paragraphs

expelled prior to the first day of classes of the period of enrollment 
for which the loan is made, the school shall return the proceeds to the 
lender no later than the period specified in Sec. 668.167.
    (4) If the school is unable for any other reason to document that a 
registered student attended school during the period of enrollment for 
which the loan is made, the school must determine the student's 
withdrawal date as required under Sec. 682.605(b)(1)(ii), and by the 
deadline described under Sec. 682.605(b)(1)(A) and (B), within 30 days 
of the period described in Sec. 682.607(c) shall notify the lender of 
the student's withdrawal, expulsion, or failure to attend school, if 
applicable, and return to the lender--
    (i) Any loan proceeds credited directly by the school to the 
student's account; and
    (ii) The amount of payments made directly by the student to the 
school, to the extent that they do not exceed the amount of any loan 
proceeds delivered by the school to the student.
    (e) Processing a late disbursement. (1) A school may process a late 
disbursement received from a lender under Sec. 682.207(d) in accordance 
with Sec. 668.164(g).
    (2) If the total amount of the late disbursement and all prior 
disbursements is greater than that portion of the borrower's educational 
charges, the school shall return the balance of the borrower's loan 
proceeds to the lender with a notice certifying--
    (i) The beginning and ending dates of the period during which the 
borrower was enrolled at the school as an eligible student during the 
loan period or payment period; and

[[Page 719]]

    (ii) The borrower's corrected financial need for the loan for that 
period of enrollment or payment period.
    (f) Initial counseling. (1) Except in the case of a student enrolled 
in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program approved for 
credit at the home institution, a school shall conduct initial 
counseling with each Stafford borrower either in person, by audiovisual 
presentation or by computer assisted technology. In each case, the 
school shall conduct this counseling prior to its release of the first 
disbursement of the proceeds of the first Stafford loan made to the 
borrower for attendance at the school, unless the borrower has received 
a prior Stafford, SLS or Direct loan, and shall ensure that an 
individual with expertise in the title IV programs is reasonably 
available shortly after the counseling to answer the borrower's 
questions regarding those programs. In the case of a correspondence 
school or a student enrolled in a study-abroad program that the school 
approves for credit, the school shall provide the borrower with written 
counseling materials by mail prior to releasing those proceeds.
    (2) In conducting the initial counseling, the school must--
    (i) Emphasize to the borrower the seriousness and importance of the 
repayment obligation the borrower is assuming;
    (ii) Describe in forceful terms the likely consequences of default, 
including adverse credit reports and litigation; and
    (iii) In the case of a borrower of a Stafford or SLS loan (other 
than a loan made or originated by the school), emphasize that the 
borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan even if the 
borrower does not complete the program, is unable to obtain employment 
upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive 
the educational or other services that the borrower purchased from the 
school.
    (3) Additional matters that the Secretary recommends that a school 
include in the initial counseling session or materials are set forth in 
appendix D to 34 CFR part 668.
    (g) Exit counseling. (1) A school shall conduct in-person exit 
counseling with each Stafford and SLS borrower shortly before the 
borrower ceases at least half-time study at the school, except that--
    (i) In the case of a correspondence school, the school shall provide 
the borrower with written counseling materials by mail within 30 days 
after the borrower completes the program; and
    (ii) If the borrower withdraws from school without the school's 
prior knowledge or fails to attend an exit counseling session as 
scheduled, the school shall mail written counseling material to the 
borrower at the borrower's last known address within 30 days after 
learning that the borrower has withdrawn from school or failed to attend 
the scheduled session.
    (2) In conducting the exit counseling, the school shall--
    (i) Inform the student as to the average anticipated monthly 
repayment for those students based on that average indebtedness;
    (ii) Review for the borrower available repayment options (e.g., loan 
consolidation, refinancing);
    (iii) Suggest to the borrower debt-management strategies that the 
school determines would best assist repayment by the borrower;
    (iv) Include the matters described in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section;
    (v) Review with the borrower the conditions under which the borrower 
may defer repayment or obtain partial cancellation of a loan; and
    (vi) Require the borrower to provide corrections to the 
institution's records concerning name, address, social security number, 
references, and driver's license number, as well as the name and address 
of the borrower's expected employer that will then be provided within 60 
days to the guaranty agency or agencies listed in the borrower's 
records.
    (3) Additional matters that the Secretary recommends that a school 
include in the exit counseling session or materials are set forth in 
appendix D to 34 CFR part 668.
    (4) The school shall maintain in the student borrower's file 
documents substantiating the school's compliance with paragraphs (f)-(g) 
of this section as to that borrower.

[[Page 720]]

    (h) Treatment of excess loan proceeds. Except as provided under 
paragraph (i) of this section, or in the case of a student attending a 
foreign school, if, before the delivery of any Stafford or SLS loan 
disbursement, the school learns that the borrower will receive or has 
received financial aid for the period of enrollment for which the loan 
was made that exceeds the amount of assistance for which the student is 
eligible, the school shall reduce or eliminate the overaward by either--
    (1) Using the student's SLS, PLUS, nonsubsidized Stafford, or State-
sponsored or private loan to cover the expected family contribution, if 
not already done;
    (2)(i) Returning the entire undelivered disbursement to the lender 
or escrow agent; and
    (ii) Providing the lender with a written statement--
    (A) Describing the reason for the return of the funds, if any;
    (B) Setting forth the student's revised financial need; and
    (C) Directing the lender to re-disburse a revised amount and, if 
necessary, revise subsequent disbursements to eliminate the overaward; 
or
    (3) Returning to the lender only the portion of the disbursement for 
which the student is ineligible and providing the lender with a written 
statement explaining the return of the funds.
    (i) For purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, funds obtained 
from any Federal College Work-Study employment that do not exceed the 
borrower's financial need by more than $300 may not be considered as 
excess loan proceeds.

Sec. 682.608  Termination of a school's lending eligibility.

    (a) General. The Secretary may terminate a school's eligibility to 
make loans under this part if the school reaches the 15 percent limit on 
loan defaults described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The 15 percent limit. (1) The Secretary may terminate a school's 
eligibility to make loans if at the end of each of the 2 most recent 
consecutive Federal fiscal years for which data are available, the total 
amount of loans described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is 
equal to or greater than 15 percent of the total amount of loans 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section as follows:
    (i) The original principal amount of all loans the school has ever 
made that went into default during that period.
    (ii) The original principal amount of all loans the school has ever 
made, including loans in deferment status that--
    (A) Were in repayment status at the beginning of that period; or
    (B) Entered repayment status during that period.
    (2) In making the determination under this section, the Secretary 
considers the status of all FFEL loans made by the school whether the 
loans are held by the school or by a subsequent holder.
    (c) Exception based on hardship. The Secretary does not terminate a 
school's lending eligibility under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section if the Secretary determines that the termination would result in 
a hardship for the school or its students. The Secretary makes this 
determination if the school shows that--
    (1) Termination is not justified in light of recent improvements the 
school has made in its collection capabilities that will reduce the 
school's loan default rate significantly within the next year. Examples 
of these improvements include--
    (i) Adopting more efficient collection procedures; or
    (ii) Employing increased collection staff; or
    (2) Termination would cause a substantial hardship to the school's 
current or prospective students or their parents based on--
    (i) The extent to which the school provides, and expects to continue 
to provide educational opportunities to economically disadvantaged 
students as measured by the percentage of students enrolled at the 
school who--
    (A) Are in families that fall within the ``low-income family'' 
category used by the Bureau of the Census;
    (B) Would not be able to enroll or continue their enrollment at that 
school without a loan from the school; and
    (C) Would not be able to obtain a comparable education at another 
school;
    (ii) The extent to which the school offers educational programs 
that--
    (A) Are unique in the geographical area that the school serves; and
    (B) Would not be available to some students if they or their parents 
could not obtain loans from the school; and
    (iii) The quality of improvements the school has made in its--
    (A) Management of student financial assistance programs; and
    (B) Conformance with sound business practices.
    (d) Termination procedures. (1) The Secretary notifies the school of 
the proposed termination of its lending eligibility and provides an 
opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary terminates the school 
under this section.

[[Page 722]]

    (2) The Secretary or his designee begins a termination action by 
sending a notice to the school. The notice is sent by certified mail 
with return receipt requested. The notice--
    (i) Informs the school of the intent to terminate the school's 
lending eligibility because of the school's default experience;
    (ii) Specifies the proposed date the termination becomes effective; 
and
    (iii) Informs the school that it has 15 days to--
    (A) Submit any written material it wants considered in determining 
whether its lending eligibility should be terminated under paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section, including written material in support of a 
hardship exception under paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (B) Request an oral hearing to show why the school's lending 
eligibility should not be terminated.
    (3) If the school does not request an oral hearing but submits 
written material, the Secretary or the designated official considers 
that material and notifies the school as to whether the termination 
action will be taken.
    (4) The Secretary or the designated official (presiding officer) 
schedules the date and place of a hearing for a school that has 
requested an oral hearing. The date of the hearing is at least 15 days 
from the date of receipt of the request. A presiding officer--
    (i) Conducts the hearing;
    (ii) Considers all written material presented before the hearing and 
any other material presented during the hearing; and
    (iii) Determines if termination of the school's lending eligibility 
is warranted.
    (5) The decision of the designated official is subject to review by 
the Secretary.
    (e) Effects of termination. A school that has its lending 
eligibility terminated under this section may not--
    (1) Make further loans under this part until it has entered into a 
new guarantee agreement with the Secretary; or
    (2) Enter into a new guarantee agreement with the Secretary until at 
least one year after the school's lending eligibility has been 
terminated under this section.
    (f) Schools under the same ownership. If a school makes loans to 
students or parents of students in attendance at other schools under the 
same ownership, the Secretary may make the determination required by 
this section by--
    (1) Treating all of the schools as one school; or
    (2) Treating each school on an individual basis.

<R05>
Sec. 682.609  Remedial actions.

    (a) The Secretary may require a school to repay funds paid to other 
program participants by the Secretary. The Secretary also may require a 
school to purchase from the holder of a FFEL loan that portion of the 
loan that is unenforceable, that the borrower was ineligible to receive, 
or for which the borrower was ineligible to receive interest benefits 
contrary to the school's certification, and to make arrangements 
acceptable to the Secretary for reimbursement of the amounts the 
Secretary will be obligated to pay to program participants respecting 
that loan in the future. The repayment of funds and purchase of loans 
may be required if the Secretary determines that the payment to program 
participants, the unenforceability of the loan, or the disbursement of 
loan amounts for which the borrower was ineligible or for which the 
borrower was ineligible for interest benefits, resulted in whole or in 
part from--
    (1) The school's violation of a Federal statute or regulation; or
    (2) The school's negligent or willful false certification.
    (b) In requiring a school to repay funds to the Secretary or to 
another party or to purchase loans from a holder in connection with an 
audit or program review, the Secretary follows the procedures described 
in 34 CFR part 668, subpart H.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may 
waive the right to require repayment of funds or repurchase of loans by 
a school if, in the Secretary's judgment, the best interest of the 
United States so requires.

[[Page 723]]

    (d) The Secretary may impose a fine or take an emergency action 
against a school or limit, suspend, or terminate a school's 
participation in the FFEL programs, in accordance with 34 CFR part 668, 
subpart G.
    (e) A school shall comply with any emergency action, limitation, 
suspension, or termination imposed by a guaranty agency in accordance 
with the agency's standards and procedures. A school shall repay funds 
to the Secretary or other party or purchase loans from a holder if a 
guaranty agency determines that the school improperly received or 
retained the funds in violation of a Federal law or regulation or a 
guaranty agency rule or regulation.

procedures and all necessary records as set forth in the regulations in 
this part and in 34 CFR part 668;
    (2) Follow the record retention and examination provisions in this 
part and in 34 CFR 668.24; and
    (3) Submit all reports required by this part and 34 CFR part 668 to 
the Secretary.
    (b) Loan record requirements. In addition to records required by 34 
CFR part 668, for each Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan received by or on 
behalf of its students, a school shall maintain a copy of the loan 
application or data electronically submitted to the lender, that 
includes--
    (1) The name of the lender;
    (2) The address of the lender;
    (3) The amount of the loan and the period of enrollment for which 
the loan was intended;
    (4) For loans delivered to the school by check, the date the school 
endorsed each loan check, if required;
    (5) The date or dates of delivery of the loan proceeds by the school 
to the student or to the parent borrower; and
    (6) For loans delivered by electronic funds transfer or master 
check, a copy of the borrower's written authorization required under 
Sec. 682.604(c)(3) to deliver the initial and subsequent disbursements 
of each FFEL program loan.
    (c) Student status confirmation reports. A school shall--
    (1) Upon receipt of a student status confirmation report form from 
the Secretary or a similar student status confirmation report form from 
any guaranty agency, complete and return that report within 30 days of 
receipt to the Secretary or the guaranty agency, as appropriate; and
    (2) Unless it expects to submit its next student status confirmation 
report to the Secretary or the guaranty agency within the next 60 days, 
notify the guaranty agency or lender within 30 days--
    (i) If it discovers that a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan has been made 
to or on behalf of a student who enrolled at that school, but who has 
ceased to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis;
    (ii) If it discovers that a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan has been 
made to or on behalf of a student who has been accepted for enrollment 
at that school, but who failed to enroll on at least a half-time basis 
for the period for which the loan was intended;
    (iii) If it discovers that a Stafford, SLS, or PLUS loan has been 
made to or on behalf of a full-time student who has ceased to be 
enrolled on a full-time basis; or
    (iv) If it discovers that a student who is enrolled and who has 
received a Stafford or SLS loan has changed his or her permanent 
address.

<R05>
Sec. 682.700  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart governs the limitation, suspension, or termination 
by the Secretary of the eligibility of an otherwise eligible lender to 
participate in the FFEL programs or the eligibility of a third-party 
servicer to enter into a contract with an eligible lender to administer 
any aspect of the lender's FFEL programs. The regulations in this 
subpart apply to a lender or third-party servicer that violates any 
statutory provision governing the FFEL programs or any regulations, 
special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into under the 
authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA prescribed under 
the FFEL programs. These regulations apply to lenders that participate 
only in a guaranty agency program, lenders that participate in the FFEL 
programs, and third-party servicers that administer aspects of a 
lender's FFELP portfolio. These regulations also govern the Secretary's 
disqualification of a lender or school from participation in the FFEL 
programs under section 432(h)(2) and (h)(3) of the Act.
    (b) This subpart does not apply--
    (1)(i) To a determination that an organization fails to meet the 
definition of ``eligible lender'' in section 435(d)(1) of the Act or the 
definition of ``lender'' in Sec. 682.200, for any reason other than a 
violation of the prohibitions in section 435(d)(5) of the Act; or
    (ii) To a determination that an organization fails to meet the 
standards in Sec. 682.416;
    (2) To a school's loss of lending eligibility under Sec. 682.608; or
    (3) To an administrative action by the Department of Education based 
on any alleged violation of--
    (i) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (section 
438 of the General Education Provisions Act), which is governed by 34 
CFR part 99;
    (ii) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is governed by 
34 CFR parts 100 and 101;
    (iii) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (relating to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap), which is governed by 34 CFR 
part 104; or
    (iv) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (relating to sex 
discrimination), which is governed by 34 CFR part 106.
    (c) This subpart does not supplant any rights or remedies that the 
Secretary may have against participating lenders or schools under other 
authorities.

Sec. 682.705  Suspension proceedings.

    (a) Scope. (1) A suspension by the Secretary removes a lender's 
eligibility under the FFEL programs or a third-party servicer's ability 
to enter into contracts with eligible lenders, and the Secretary does

suspend the lender's or servicer's eligibility for a period not to 
exceed 60 days;
    (ii) Describes the consequences of a suspension;
    (iii) Identifies the alleged violations on which the proposed 
suspension is based;
    (iv) States the proposed date the suspension becomes effective, 
which is at least 20 days after the date of mailing of the notice;
    (v) Informs the lender or servicer that the suspension will not take 
effect on the proposed date, except as provided in paragraph (c)(8) of 
this section, if the Secretary receives at least five days prior to that 
date a request for an oral hearing or written material showing why the 
suspension should not take effect; and
    (vi) Asks the lender or servicer to correct voluntarily any alleged 
violations.
    (c) Hearing. (1) If the lender or servicer does not request an oral 
hearing but submits written material, the Secretary, or a designated

and notifies the lender or servicer of the effective date of the 
suspension.
    (2) If the lender or servicer requests an oral hearing within the 
time specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the Secretary 
schedules the date

[[Page 727]]

and place of the hearing. The date is at least 15 days after receipt of 
the request from the lender or servicer. No proposed suspension takes 
effect until a hearing is held.
    (3) The oral hearing is conducted by a presiding officer who--
    (i) Ensures that a written record of the hearing is made;
    (ii) Considers relevant written material presented before the 
hearing and other relevant evidence presented during the hearing; and
    (iii) Issues a decision based on findings of fact and conclusions of 
law that may suspend the lender's or servicer's eligibility only if the 
presiding officer is persuaded that the suspension is warranted by the 
evidence.
    (4) The formal rules of evidence do not apply, and no discovery, as 
provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (28 U.S.C. Appendix) 
is required.
    (5) The presiding officer shall base findings of fact only on 
evidence considered at or before the hearing and matters given official 
notice.
    (6) In a suspension action against a lender or third-party servicer 
based on a suspension under Executive Order 12549 or a proposed 
debarment under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, that does not meet the standards described in 34 CFR 
85.201(c), the presiding official finds that the suspension or proposed 
debarment constitutes prima facie evidence that cause for suspension 
under this subpart exists.
    (7) The initial decision of the presiding officer is mailed to the 
lender or servicer.
    (8) The Secretary automatically reviews the initial decision of the 
presiding officer. The Secretary notifies the lender or servicer of the 
Secretary's decision by mail.
    (9) A suspension takes effect on either a date that is at least 20 
days after the date the notice of a decision imposing the suspension is 
mailed to the lender or servicer, or on the proposed effective date 
stated in the notice sent under paragraph (b) of this section, whichever 
is later.

    (vi) Informs the lender or servicer that the limitation or 
termination will not take effect on the proposed date if the Secretary 
receives, at least five days prior to that date, a request for an oral 
hearing or written material showing why the limitation or termination 
should not take effect;
    (vii) Asks the lender or servicer to correct voluntarily any alleged 
violations; and
    (viii) Notifies the lender or servicer that the Secretary may 
collect any amount owed by means of offset against amounts owed to the 
lender by the Department and other Federal agencies.
    (b) Hearing. (1) If the lender or servicer does not request an oral 
hearing but submits written material, the Secretary, or a designated 
Departmental official, considers the material and--
    (i) Dismisses the proposed limitation or termination; or
    (ii) Notifies the lender or servicer of the date the limitation or 
termination becomes effective.
    (2) If the lender or servicer requests a hearing within the time 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section, the Secretary 
schedules the date and place of the hearing. The date is at least 15

[[Page 728]]

days after receipt of the request from the lender or servicer. No 
proposed limitation or termination takes effect until a hearing is held.
    (3) The hearing is conducted by a presiding officer who--
    (i) Ensures that a written record of the hearing is made;
    (ii) Considers relevant written material presented before the 
hearing and other relevant evidence presented during the hearing; and
    (iii) Issues an initial decision, based on findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, that may limit or terminate the lender's or 
servicer's eligibility if the presiding officer is persuaded that the 
limitation or termination is warranted by the evidence.
    (4) The formal rules of evidence do not apply, and no discovery, as 
provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. appendix), 
is required.
    (5) The presiding officer shall base findings of fact only on 
evidence presented at or before the hearing and matters given official 
notice.
    (6) If a termination action is brought against a lender or third-
party servicer and the presiding officer concludes that a limitation is 
more appropriate, the presiding officer may issue a decision imposing 
one or more limitations on a lender or third-party servicer rather than 
terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility.
    (7) In a termination action against a lender or third-party servicer 
based on a debarment under Executive Order 12549 or under the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4 that does not 
meet the standards described in 34 CFR 85.201(c), the presiding official 
finds that the debarment constitutes prima facie evidence that cause for 
debarment and termination under this subpart exists.
    (8) The initial decision of the presiding officer is mailed to the 
lender or servicer.
    (9) Any time schedule specified in this section may be shortened 
with the approval of the presiding officer and the consent of the lender 
or servicer and the Secretary or designated Departmental official.
    (10) The presiding officer's initial decision automatically becomes 
the Secretary's final decision 20 days after it is issued and received 
by both parties unless the lender, servicer, or designated Departmental 
official appeals the decision to the Secretary within this period.
    (c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if a 
lender or a lender's owner or officer or third-party servicer or 
servicer's owner or officer, respectively, is convicted of or pled nolo 
contendere or guilty to a crime involving the unlawful acquisition, use, 
or expenditure of FFEL program funds, that conviction or guilty plea is 
grounds for terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility, 
respectively, to participate in the FFEL programs.

    (1) An appeal is made to the Secretary by submitting to the 
Secretary and the opposing party within 15 days of the date of the 
appealing party's receipt of the presiding officer's decision, a brief 
or other written material explaining why the decision of the presiding 
officer should be overturned or modified; and

reversing the initial decision, including a statement of the reasons for 
the Secretary's decision.
    (c) Any party submitting material to the Secretary shall provide a 
copy to each party that participates in the hearing.
    (d) If the presiding officer's initial decision would limit or 
terminate the lender's or servicer's eligibility, it does not take 
effect pending the appeal unless the Secretary determines that a stay of 
the date it becomes effective would seriously and adversely affect

applicable to Title IV of the HEA.
    (b) The corrective action may include payment to the Secretary or 
recipients designated by the Secretary of any funds, and any interest 
thereon, that the lender, or, in the case of a third-party servicer, the 
servicer or the lender that has a contract with a third-party servicer, 
improperly received, withheld, disbursed, or caused to be disbursed. A 
third-party servicer may be held liable up to the amounts specified in 
Sec. 682.413(a)(2).
    (c) If a final decision requires a lender, a lender that has a 
contract with a third-party servicer, or a third-party servicer to 
reimburse or make any payment to the Secretary, the Secretary may, 
without further notice or opportunity for a hearing, proceed to offset 
or arrange for another Federal agency to offset the amount due against 
any interest benefits, special allowance, or other payments due to the 
lender, the lender that has a contract with the third-party servicer, or 
the third-party servicer. A third-party servicer may be held liable up 
to the amounts specified in Sec. 682.413(a)(2).

Sec. 682.712   Disqualification review of limitation, suspension, and termination actions taken by guarantee agencies against lenders.

    (a) The Secretary reviews a limitation, suspension, or termination 
action taken by a guaranty agency against a lender participating in the 
FFEL programs to determine if national disqualification is appropriate. 
Upon completion of the Secretary's review, the Secretary notifies the 
guaranty agency and the lender of the Secretary's decision by mail.
    (b) The Secretary disqualifies a lender from participation in the 
FFEL programs if--
    (1) The lender waives review by the Secretary; or

limitation, suspension, or termination was imposed in accordance with 
section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act.
    (c)(1) Disqualification by the Secretary continues until the 
Secretary is satisfied that--
    (i) The lender has corrected the failure that led to the limitation, 
suspension, or termination; and
    (ii) There are reasonable assurances that the lender will comply 
with the requirements of the FFEL programs in the future.
    (2) Revocation of disqualification by the Secretary does not remove 
any limitation, suspension, or termination imposed by the agency whose 
action resulted in the disqualification.
    (d) A guaranty agency shall refer a limitation, suspension, or 
termination action that it takes against a lender to the Secretary 
within 30 days of its final decision to limit, suspend, or terminate the 
lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program.
    (e) The Secretary reviews an agency's limitation, suspension, or 
termination of a lender's eligibility only when the guaranty agency's 
action is final, e.g, the lender is not entitled to any further appeals 
within the guaranty agency. A subsequent court challenge to an agency's 
action does not by itself affect the timing of the Secretary's review.
    (f) The guaranty agency's notice to the Secretary regarding a 
termination action must include a certified copy of the administrative 
record compiled by the agency with regard to the action. The record must 
include certified copies of the following documents:
    (1) The guaranty agency's letter initiating the action.
    (2) The lender's response.
    (3) The transcript of the agency's hearing.
    (4) The decision of the agency's hearing officer.

    (1) The documents described in paragraph (f) of this section; and
    (2) Documents describing and substantiating the existence of one or 
more of the circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (h)(1) Within 60 days of the Secretary's receipt of a referral 
notice described in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, the Secretary 
makes an initial assessment, based on the agency's record, as to whether 
the agency's action appears to comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the 
Act.
    (2) In the case of a referral notice described in paragraph (g) of 
this section, the Secretary also determines whether one or more of the 
circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section exist.
    (3) If the Secretary concludes that the agency's action appears to 
comply with section 428(b)(1)(U) of the Act and, if applicable, one or 
more of the circumstances described in paragraph (j) of this section 
exist, the Secretary notifies the lender that the Secretary will review 
the guaranty agency's action to determine whether to disqualify the 
lender from further participation in the FFEL programs and affords the 
lender an opportunity--
    (i) To waive the review and be disqualified immediately; or
    (ii) To request a review.
    (i) The Secretary's review of the guaranty agency's action is 
limited to whether the agency action was taken in accordance with 
procedures that were substantially the same as procedures applicable to 
the limitation, suspension, or termination of eligibility of a lender 
under the FISL Program (34 CFR part 682, subpart G).
    (j) In the case of an action by an agency that limits or suspends a 
lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's program, the agency 
shall provide the Secretary with a referral as described in paragraph 
(g) of this section only if--
    (1) The lender has not corrected the violation. A violation is 
corrected if, among other things, the lender has satisfied fully all 
liabilities incurred by the lender as a result of the violation, 
including its liability to the Secretary, or the lender has arranged to 
satisfy those liabilities in a manner acceptable to the parties to whom 
the liabilities are owed;
    (2) The lender has not provided satisfactory assurances to the 
agency of future compliance with program requirements; or
    (3) The guaranty agency determines that special circumstances 
warrant disqualification of the lender from the FFEL programs for a 
significant period, notwithstanding the agency's decision not to 
terminate the lender's eligibility to participate in the agency's 
program.

Sec. 682.804  Failure to comply with Plan for Doing Business.

    (a) If the Secretary finds that an Authority has failed to comply 
with any requirement of its Plan or of this subpart, the Secretary takes 
actions necessary to protect the interests of the United States. These 
actions may include the following:
    (1) Withholding payment of special allowances.
    (2) Suspending or revoking approval of the Plan.
    (3) Determining that loans made or purchased with the proceeds of a 
tax-exempt obligation by the Authority or any entity acting for the 
Authority after the date of suspension or revocation are ineligible for 
payments of special allowances.
    (4) Requiring reimbursement from the Authority of special allowances 
paid on loans made or purchased by the Authority or any entity acting 
for the Authority.
    (b) The Secretary's decision to require repayment of funds by an 
Authority, to withhold payments of special allowance, or to suspend or 
revoke approval of a Plan does not become final until the Secretary 
provides the Authority with written notice of the intended action and an 
opportunity to be heard thereon. However, the Secretary may withhold 
payments or suspend approval of the Plan prior to giving notice and 
opportunity to be heard if the Secretary finds that emergency action 
necessary to prevent substantial harm to Federal interests.

Sec. 682.805  Sanctions for material misrepresentation.

    (a) If at any time the Secretary determines that the submission for 
approval of a tax-exempt obligation or a Plan for Doing Business 
contains or contained a material misrepresentation, the Secretary may to 
the extent provided in paragraph (b) of this section--
    (1) Require reimbursement from the Authority of special allowance 
payments to the Authority or to any other party on loans made or 
purchased with the proceeds of the issue with respect to which the 
misrepresentation was made; and
    (2) Determine to be ineligible for special allowance payments any 
loans to be made or purchased by the Authority or any entity acting for 
the Authority with the unexpended proceeds of the issue with respect to 
which the misrepresentation was made.
    (b) If an Authority uses funds from sources other than a tax-exempt 
obligation to retire an issue with respect to which the Secretary has 
determined that a material misrepresentation was made, the Secretary 
takes the adverse actions described in paragraph (a) of this section 
only with regard to those special allowance payments which accrued 
earlier than ninety days before that issue was retired.
    (c) The Secretary's decision to require repayment of funds by an 
Authority, to withhold payments of special allowance, or to take any of 
the actions in Sec. 682.804 does not become final until the Secretary 
provides the Authority with written notice of the intended action and an 
opportunity to be heard thereon. However, the Secretary may withhold 
payments or suspend approval of the Plan prior to giving notice and 
opportunity to be heard if the Secretary finds such emergency action 
necessary to prevent substantial harm to Federal interests.

Sec. 682.840  Prohibition against discrimination as a condition for receiving special allowance payments.

    (a) For an Authority to receive special allowance payments on loans 
made or acquired with the proceeds of a tax-exempt obligation, the 
Authority or its agent may not engage in any pattern or practice that 
results in a denial of a borrower's access to loans under the FFEL 
programs because of the borrower's race, sex, color, religion, national 
origin, age, handicapped status, income, attendance at a particular

loans guaranteed by an agency or organization that discriminates on one 
or more grounds listed in paragraph (a) of this section to have adopted 
a practice of denying access to loans on that ground unless the 
Authority makes provision for loan guarantees from other sources 
necessary to serve the borrowers excluded by that discriminatory policy.

  Appendix C to Part 682--Procedures for Curing Violations of the Due 
    Diligence in Collection and Timely Filing of Claims Requirements 
Applicable to FISLP and Federal PLUS Program Loans and for Repayment of 
      Interest and Special Allowance Overbillings [Bulletin L-77a]

    Note: The following is a reprint of Bulletin L-77a, issued on 
January 7, 1983, with minor modifications made to reflect changes in the 
program regulations since that date. All references to ``the date of 
this bulletin'' refer to that date. All references made to the Federal 
Insured Student Loan Program (FISLP) shall be understood to include the 
Federal PLUS Program. The bulletin includes references to the 120- and 
180-day default periods that used to apply to FFELP and PLUS Program 
loans. Public Law 99-272 established new default periods of 180 and 240 
days (as set out in 34 CFR 682.200 of these regulations) for all new 
loans and many existing ones. Although the discussion in this Appendix C 
refers to the 120- and 180-day default periods, it is equally applicable 
to the new 180- and 240-day default periods.

                              Introduction

    This bulletin prescribes procedures for lenders to use (1) to cure 
violations of the requirements for due diligence in collection (``due 
diligence'') and timely filing of claims under the Federal Insured 
Student Loan Program (FISLP), and (2) to repay interest and special 
allowance overbillings made on loans evidencing such violations. See 34 
CFR 682.507, 682.511.\1\ These procedures allow for the reinstatement of 
a lender's eligibility for interest and special allowance and claim 
payments on loans evidencing such violations, under specified 
circumstances. These procedures apply to loans for which the first day 
of the 120-day or 180-day default period occurred on or after October 
21, 1979 (the effective date of the September 17, 1979 regulations), 
whether or not the loans have previously been submitted as claims to the 
Secretary.
    The due diligence and timely filing requirements governing the FISLP 
were established in response to requests from some lenders for more 
detailed regulatory guidance on the proper handling of FISLP loans. 
Despite the promulgation of these provisions, a number of lenders have 
failed to exercise the requisite care in their treatment of these loans, 
thereby increasing the risk of default thereon and, in many cases, 
prejudicing the Secretary's ability to collect from the borrowers. At 
the time the current due diligence and timely filing rules were issued, 
the Secretary anticipated that violations of these rules would be so 
infrequent as

[[Page 738]]

to permit requests for cures to be handled individually. However, the 
unexpectedly high incidence of violations of these rules has made 
continued case-by-case treatment of all cure requests administratively 
unmanageable. After carefully considering the views of lenders and other 
program participants, the Secretary has decided to exercise his 
authority under 20 U.S.C. 1082(a)(5), (6), and institute uniform 
procedures by which lenders with loans involving violations of the due 
diligence or timely filing requirements may cure these violations.

                              Due Diligence

    Collection activity is required to begin immediately upon 
delinquency by the borrower in honoring the repayment obligation. This 
holds true whether or not the borrower received a repayment schedule or 
signed a repayment agreement. Under 34 CFR 682.200, default on a FISLP 
loan occurs when a borrower fails to make a payment when due, provided 
this failure persists for 120 days for loans payable in monthly 
installments, or for 180 days for loans payable in less frequent 
installments. If, however, the lender has added the optional provision 
to the promissory note requiring the borrower to execute a repayment 
agreement not later than 120 days prior to the expiration of the grace 
period, the loan entered repayment prior to September 4, 1985 (see 50 FR 
35970), the lender sends the agreement to the borrower 150 days or more 
before the end of the grace period, and the agreement is not executed 
before the end of the grace period, default occurs at that time. One 
exception to this rule is as follows: If the holder of the loan is not 
the lender that made the loan, the holder may choose to forego 
enforcement of the optional 120-day provision in the note.
    The 120/180 day default period applies regardless of whether 
payments were missed consecutively or intermittently. For example, if 
the borrower, on a loan payable in monthly installments, makes his 
January 1st payment on time, his February 1st payment two months late 
(April 1st), his March 1st payment three months late (June 1st), and 
makes no further payments, the default period begins on February 1st, 
with the first delinquency, and ends on August 1st, when the April 1st 
payment becomes 120 days past due. The lender must treat the payment 
made on April 1st as the February 1st payment, since the February 1st 
payment had not been made prior to that time. Similarly, the lender must 
treat the payment made on June 1st as the March 1st payment, since the 
March payment had not been made prior to that time.

    Note: Lenders are strongly encouraged to exercise forbearance, prior 
to default, for the benefit of borrowers who have missed payments 
intermittently but have otherwise indicated willingness to repay their 
loans. See 34 CFR 682.211. The forebearance process helps to reduce the 
incidence of default, and serves to emphasize for the borrower the 
importance of compliance with the repayment obligation.

                              Timely Filing

    The 90-day filing period applicable to FISLP default claims is set 
forth in 34 CFR 682.511(e) (1) and (3). The 90-day filing period begins 
at the end of the 120/180 day default period. The lender must file a 
default claim on a loan in default by the end of the filing period, 
unless the borrower brings the account current before the end of the 
filing period. In such a case, the lender may choose not to file a claim 
on the loan at that time.
    In addition, for any loan less than 210 days delinquent on the date 
of this bulletin, the lender need not file a claim on that loan before 
the 210th day of delinquency (120-day default period plus 90-day filing 
period) if the borrower brings the account less than 120 days delinquent 
before such 210th day. Thus, in the above example, if the borrower makes 
the April 1st payment on August 2nd, the 90-day filing period continues 
to run from August 1st, unless the loan was less than 210 days 
delinquent on the date of this bulletin. If the loan was less than 210 
days delinquent on the date of this bulletin, then the August 2nd 
payment makes the loan 91 days delinquent, and the lender may, but need 
not file a default claim on the loan at that time. If, however, that 
loan again becomes 120 days delinquent, the lender must file a default 
claim within 90 days thereafter (unless the loan is again brought to 
less than 120 days delinquent prior to the end of that 90 day period). 
In other words, for any loan less than 210 days delinquent on the date 
of this bulletin, the Secretary will permit a lender to treat payments 
made during the filing period as ``curing'' the default if such payments 
are sufficient to make the loan less than 120 days delinquent.
    If a lender fails to comply with either the due diligence or timely 
filing requirements, the affected loan ceases to be insured; that is, 
the lender loses its right to receive interest benefits, special 
allowance and claim payments thereon. Some examples of violations of the 
due diligence requirements are set out in section I.C. below.

                           I. Cure Procedures

                             A. Definitions

    The following definitions apply to terms used throughout Section I 
of this bulletin.
    Full payment means payment by the borrower, or another person (other 
than the lender) on the borrower's behalf, in an amount at least as 
great as the monthly payment amount required under the existing

[[Page 739]]

terms of the loan, exclusive of any forbearance agreement in force at 
the time of the default. (For example, if the original repayment 
schedule or agreement called for payments of $30 per month, but a 
forbearance agreement was in effect at the time of default that allowed 
the borrower to pay $15 per month for a specified time, and the borrower 
defaulted in making the reduced payments, a ``full payment'' would be 
$30, or two $15 payments in accordance with original repayment schedule 
or agreement.)
    Reinstatement with respect to insurance coverage means the 
reinstatement of the lender's right to receive default, death, 
disability, or bankruptcy claim payments for the unpaid principal 
balance of the loan and for unpaid interest accruing on the loan after 
the date of reinstatement. Upon reinstatement of insurance, the borrower 
regains the right to receive forbearance or deferments, as appropriate. 
For purposes of this bulletin, ``reinstatement'' with respect to 
insurance on a loan does not include reinstatement of the lender's right 
to receive interest and special allowance payments on that loan. 
Reinstatement of the lender's right to receive interest and special 
allowance payments is addressed in section I.B.1, below.

                               B. General

    1. Resumption of Interest and Special Allowance Billing on Loans 
Involving Due Diligence or Timely Filing Violations. For any loan on 
which a cure is attempted under this bulletin, the lender may resume 
billing for interest and special allowance on the loan only for periods 
following the earlier of (1) its receipt of the equivalent of three full 
payments thereon, after the date of this bulletin or the date of the 
violation, whichever is later, or (2) receipt by the borrower of an 
authorized deferment, after reinstatement of insurance coverage.
    2. Reservation of the Secretary's Right to Strict Enforcement. While 
this bulletin allows cures to be attempted for particular violations in 
specified ways, the Secretary retains the option of refusing to permit 
or recognize cures in cases where, in the Secretary's judgment, a lender 
has committed an excessive number of severe violations of the due 
diligence or timely filing rules, and in cases where the best interests 
of the program otherwise require strict enforcement of these 
requirements. More generally, this bulletin states the Secretary's 
general policy and is not intended to limit in any way the authority and 
discretion afforded the Secretary by statute or regulations.
    3. Applicability of the Cure Procedures to Particular Classes of 
Loans. The cure procedures outlined in this bulletin apply only to a 
loan for which the first day of the 120/180 day default period that 
ended with default by the borrower occurred on or after October 21, 
1979, and which involve violations only of the due diligence and/or 
timely filing requirements.
    The cure procedures applicable to loans involving due diligence 
violations also apply to loans involving violations of both the timely 
filing and due diligence requirements.
    4. Excusal of Certain Due Diligence Violations. A lender whose claim 
was previously denied solely for violation of the timely filing rule, 
and who is permitted to cure that violation under the procedures set out 
in this bulletin, will not be required to utilize the procedures for 
curing due diligence violations, or to repay interest and special 
allowance improperly received from the Secretary as a result of a due 
diligence violation for periods prior to the timely filing violation. 
This applies even if, upon submission of the ``cured'' claim, the 
Secretary discovers that evidence of due diligence violations appeared 
in the file of the previously rejected claim.
    The Secretary will also excuse a due diligence violation by a lender 
if the account was brought current by the borrower (or another, other 
than the lender, on the borrower's behalf) prior to the 120th/180th day 
of the delinquency period during which the violation occurred.
    5. Treatment of Accrued Interest on ``Cured'' Claims--a. Due 
Diligence Violations. For any default claim involving ``cured'' 
violations of the due diligence rules, the Secretary will not reimburse 
the lender for any unpaid interest accruing after the first day of the 
120/180 day period that culminated in default, and prior to the date of 
reinstatement of insurance coverage.
    For any loan involving ``cured'' due diligence violations, the 
lender may capitalize unpaid interest accruing on the loan from the 
commencement of the 120/180 day default period to the date of the 
reinstatement of insurance coverage. See sections I.C. and D. below. 
However, if the lender later files a claim on that loan, the lender must 
deduct this capitalized interest from the amount of the claim. This 
deduction must be reflected in column 15 on the ED Form 1207, Lender's 
Application for Insurance Claim on Federal Insured Student Loan, filed 
with the claim evidencing the cure.
    b. Timely Filing Violations. For any default claim involving 
``cured'' violations of the timely filing rules, the Secretary will not 
reimburse the lender for unpaid interest accruing after the end of the 
120/180 day default period that culminated in default, and prior to the 
date of reinstatement of insurance coverage.
    For any default claim involving a ``cured'' timely filing violation, 
if insurance coverage is later reinstated, the lender may capitalize 
unpaid interest accruing on the loan from the commencement of the 
original 120/180

[[Page 740]]

day default period to the date of the reinstatement of insurance 
coverage. See sections I.C. and D. below. However, if the lender later 
files a claim, on that loan, the lender must deduct this capitalized 
interest from the amount of the claim, except that the lender need not 
deduct from the claim unpaid interest that accrued on the loan during 
the original 120/180 day default period. This deduction must be 
reflected in Column 15 of the ED Form 1207, Lender's Application for 
Insurance Claim on Federal Insured Student Loan, filed with the claim 
evidencing the cure.
    Some timely filing cures will not reinstate insurance coverage. For 
treatment of accrued interest in such cases, see Section I.D.1.c.
    6. Documents to be Submitted with ``Cured'' Claims. The Secretary 
requests that any lender submitting a claim on a loan involving 
``cured'' violations identify the claim as such with a note in the claim 
file stapled to the new ED Form 1207.
    For all ``cured'' claims, the lender must submit:
    <bullet> For loans on which a claim was previously rejected, all 
documents sent by the regional office with the original claim (when the 
claim was rejected and returned to the lender), including without 
limitation, the original ED Form 1207 and all documents showing the 
reason(s) for the original rejection;
    <bullet> All documents ordinarily required in connection with the 
submission of a default claim, including, without limitation, the 
promissory note, which must bear a valid assignment to the United States 
of America;
    <bullet> A new ED Form 1207; and
    <bullet> All documents showing that the lender has complied with the 
applicable cure procedures and requirements.

C. Cures for Violations of the Due Diligence in Collection Requirements 
                            (34 CFR 682.507)

    A violation of the due diligence in collection rules occurs when a 
lender fails to meet requirements found in 34 CFR 682.507. For example, 
a violation occurs if the lender fails to:
    <bullet> Remind the borrower of the date a missed payment was due 
within 15 days of delinquency;
    <bullet> Attempt to contact the borrower and any endorser at least 3 
times at regular intervals during the rest of the 120/180 day default 
period;
    <bullet> Request preclaims assistance from the Department of 
Education;
    <bullet> Request skip-tracing assistance from the Secretary, if 
required, or
    <bullet> Send a final demand letter to the borrower exercising the 
option to accelerate the due date for the outstanding balance of the 
loan, unless the lender does not know the borrower's address as of the 
90th day of delinquency.
    1. Reinstatement of Insurance Coverage. In the case of a due 
diligence violation, the lender may utilize either of the two procedures 
described below for obtaining reinstatement of insurance coverage on the 
loan. After the date of this bulletin, or after the date of the 
violation, whichever is later:
    (a) The lender obtains a new repayment agreement signed by the 
borrower which complies with the ten and fifteen year repayment 
limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7); or
    (b) The lender obtains 3 full payments. If the borrower later 
defaults, the lender must submit evidence of these payments (e.g., 
copies of the checks) with the claim.
    2. Borrower's Deemed Current As of Date of Cure. On the date the 
lender receives a signed copy of the new repayment agreement, or 
receives the third (curing) payment, insurance coverage on the loan is 
reinstated, and the borrower shall be deemed by the lender to be current 
in repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits available 
to FISLP borrowers. If the borrower later becomes delinquent in 
repayment, the lender shall follow the collection procedures set out in 
34 CFR 682.507, and the timely filing requirements set out in 34 CFR 
682.511.

   D. Cures for Violations of the Timely Filing Requirements (34 CFR 
                                682.511)

    1. Default Claims.--a. Reinstatement of Insurance Coverage. In order 
to obtain reinstatement of insurance coverage on a loan in the case of a 
timely filing violation, the lender must first locate the borrower after 
the date of this bulletin, or after the date of the violation, whichever 
is later (see section I.D.1.d. for description of acceptable evidence of 
location). Then, the lender must send to the borrower, at the address at 
which the borrower was located, (i) a new repayment agreement, to be 
signed by the borrower, which complies with the ten and fifteen year 
repayment limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7), along with (ii) a 
collection letter indicating in strong terms the seriousness of the 
borrower's delinquency and its potential effect on his or her credit 
rating if repayment is not commenced or resumed.
    If, within 30 days after the lender sends these items, the borrower 
fails to make a full payment or to sign and return the new repayment 
agreement, the lender shall, within 5 working days thereafter, send the 
borrower a copy of the attached ``48 hour'' collection letter, on the 
lender's letterhead. (See attachment A.)
    b. Borrower Deemed Current Under Certain Circumstances. If, within 
45 days after the lender sends the new repayment agreement to the 
borrower for signature, the borrower makes a full payment or signs and 
returns the new repayment agreement, insurance

[[Page 741]]

coverage on the loan is reinstated. The borrower shall be deemed by the 
lender to be current in repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and 
benefits available to FISLP borrowers. If the borrower later becomes 
delinquent in repayment, the lender shall follow the collection steps in 
34 CFR 682.507 and the timely filing requirements in 34 CFR 682.511.
    c. Borrower Deemed in Default Under Certain Circumstances. If the 
borrower does not make a full payment, or sign and return the new 
repayment agreement, within 45 days after the lender sends the new 
repayment agreement, the lender shall deem the borrower to be in 
default. The lender shall then file a default claim on the loan 
accompanied by acceptable evidence of location (see I.D.I.d below), 
within 30 days after the end of such 45-day period. Although insurance 
coverage is not reinstated on loans involving these circumstances, the 
Secretary will honor default claims submitted in accordance with this 
paragraph on the outstanding principal balance of such loans, and on 
unpaid interest accruing on the loan during the 120/180 day default 
period.
    d. Acceptable Evidence of Location. Only the following documentation 
is acceptable as evidence that the lender has located the borrower:
    (i) Postal receipt signed by the borrower not more than 25 days 
prior to the date on which the lender sent the new repayment agreement, 
indicating acceptance of correspondence from the lender by the borrower 
at the address shown on the receipt; or
    (ii) A completed ``Certification of Borrower Location'' form 
(Attachment B).
    2. Death, Disability, and Bankruptcy Claims. Lenders may immediately 
resubmit any death or disability claim which was rejected solely for 
failure to meet the 60 day timely filing requirements (see 34 CFR 
685.511(e)(2)). However, the Secretary will not pay any such claim if, 
before the date the lender determined that the borrower died or was 
totally and permanently disabled, the lender had violated the due 
diligence or timely filing requirements applicable to default claims 
with respect to that loan. Interest that accrued on the loan after the 
expiration of the 60-day filing period remains uninsured by the 
Secretary, and the lender must repay all interest and special allowance 
received on the loan for periods after the expiration of the 60-day 
filing period.
    The Secretary has determined that, in the vast majority of cases, 
the failure of a lender to comply with the timely filing requirement 
applicable to bankruptcy claims causes irreparable harm to the 
Secretary's ability to contest the discharge of the loan by the court, 
or to otherwise collect from the borrower. Therefore, the Secretary has 
decided not to permit cures for violations of the timely filing 
requirement applicable to bankruptcy claims, except when the lender can 
demonstrate that the bankruptcy action has concluded and that the loan 
has not been discharged in bankruptcy. In that case, the lender shall 
treat the loan as in default. The Secretary will honor a default claim 
later filed on such a loan only if the lender has met the cure 
requirements in section I.C. above for due diligence violations.

  II. Repayment of Interest and Special Allowance on Loans Evidencing 
      Violations of the Due Diligence or Timely Filing Requirements

                             A. General Rule

    It has always been the Secretary's interpretation of the FISLP 
statute and regulations that a lender's right to receive interest and 
special allowance payments on a FISLP loan terminates immediately 
following the lender's violation of the due diligence or timely filing 
requirements. This applies whether or not the lender has filed a claim 
on the loan. In other words, lenders may receive interest and special 
allowance only on loans which are insured by the Secretary. Since these 
violations result in the termination of insurance, they also result in 
the termination of FISLP benefits.

   B. Cessation of Billing on Loans Evidencing Violations of the Due 
                 Diligence or Timely Filing Requirements

    Any lender currently billing the Secretary for interest and special 
allowance on a loan that the lender knows involves a due diligence or 
timely filing violation must cease doing so immediately. However, 
lenders are not required at this time to review their loan portfolios 
for due diligence and timely filing violations.

C. Determination of Amounts of Interest and Special Allowance That Must 
                                Be Repaid

    1. Due Diligence Violations. In the case of due diligence 
violations, it is often difficult to ascertain the precise date on which 
a violation occurred. For the administrative ease of the Secretary and 
lenders, the Secretary has decided to waive his right to recoup interest 
and special allowance payments made to a lender for periods between the 
date of a due diligence violation and the end of the 120/180 day default 
period. However, any lender that has received interest or special 
allowance payments from the Secretary for periods after the end of the 
120/180 day default period on a loan that the lender knows involves a 
due diligence violation must promptly repay those amounts.
    2. Timely Filing Violations. In the case of timely filing 
violations, the lender loses its right to receive interest and special 
allowance payments as of the expiration of the applicable timely filing 
period. Therefore, any lender that has received interest or special

[[Page 742]]

allowance payments from the Secretary for periods following the end of 
the applicable timely filing period on a loan that the lender knows 
involves a timely filing violation must repay those amounts.
    3. Situations in Which a Lender May Have Received Interest Benefits 
for Periods During Which a Loan was Uninsured. Because most due 
diligence violations, and timely filing violations, occur after 
termination of the grace period, interest payments are ordinarily not 
affected by such violations. However, there are three types of 
situations in which a lender may have received interest payments from 
the Secretary to which it was not entitled due to a due diligence or 
timely filing violation.
    a. Promissory notes that include a requirement that the borrower 
sign a repayment agreement no later than 120 days prior to the 
expiration of the grace period. In such cases, a due diligence violation 
may occur during the grace period, when the lender may otherwise have 
been eligible to receive interest benefits. However, the lender need not 
repay that interest to the Secretary. See II.C.1. above.
    b. Deferment Periods. A due diligence violation may occur prior to a 
deferment period when the lender would otherwise have been eligible to 
receive interest benefits.
    c. Loans Made Prior to December 15, 1968. A loan disbursed prior to 
December 15, 1968, and which qualified for payment of Federal interest 
benefits at the time the loan was disbursed, qualifies for payment of a 
3 percent interest subsidy on the unpaid principal balance during the 
entire repayment period, provided the loan remains insured. In the case 
of such a loan, a due diligence or timely filing violation terminates 
the lender's eligibility for the 3 percent payments.

  D. Procedures for Repayment of Federal Interest Benefits and Special 
   Allowance Received by a Lender for Periods During Which a Loan Was 
                                Uninsured

    A lender must make the repayments of interest and/or special 
allowance discussed in II.C. above, by way of an adjustment during the 
two quarters immediately following the discovery of the violation. These 
adjustments must be reported on the normal Lender`s Interest and Special 
Allowance Request and Report (ED Form 799). Lenders are requested not to 
send a check with the adjustment; the overpaid amount will be deducted 
by the Secretary from the lender's next regular interest and special 
allowance payment. For five years after any loan for which an adjustment 
is made is repaid in full, the lender shall retain a record of the basis 
for the adjustment showing the amount(s) of the overbilling(s), and the 
date it used for cessation of interest or special allowance eligibility 
in calculating the overbilled amount. See 34 CFR 682.515(a)(2).

  Appendix D to Part 682--Policy for Waiving the Secretary's Right To 
  Recover or Refuse To Pay, Interest Benefits, Special Allowance, and 
  Reinsurance on Stafford, PLUS, Supplemental Loans for Students, and 
  Consolidation Program Loans Involving Lenders' Violations of Federal 
 Regulations Pertaining to Due Diligence in Collection or Timely Filing 
                     of Claims [Bulletin 88-G-138].

    Note: The following is a reprint of Bulletin 88-G-138, issued on 
March 11, 1988, with modifications made to reflect changes in the 
program regulations. For a loan that has lost reinsurance prior to 
December 1, 1992, this policy applies only through November 30, 1995. 
For a loan that loses reinsurance on or after December 1, 1992, this 
policy applies until three years after the default claim filing 
deadline.

                              Introduction

    This letter sets forth the circumstances under which the Secretary, 
pursuant to sections 432(a) (5) and (6) of the Higher Education Act of 
1965 and 34 CFR Secs. 682.406(b) and 682.413(f), will waive certain of 
his rights and claims with respect to Stafford Loans, PLUS, Supplemental 
Loans for Students (SLS), and Consolidation Program loans made under a 
guaranty agency program that involve violations of Federal regulations 
pertaining to due diligence in collection or timely filing. (These 
programs are collectively referred to in this letter as the FFEL 
Programs.) This policy applies to due diligence violations on loans for 
which the first day of delinquency occurred on or after March 10, 1987 
(the effective date of the November 10, 1986 due diligence regulations) 
and to timely filing violations occurring on or after December 26, 1986, 
whether or not the affected loans have been submitted as claims to the 
guaranty agency.
    The Secretary has been implementing a variety of regulatory and 
administrative actions to minimize defaults in the FFEL Programs. As a 
part of this effort, the Secretary published final regulations on 
November 10, 1986 requiring lenders and guaranty agencies to undertake 
specific due diligence activities to collect delinquent and defaulted 
loans, and establishing deadlines for the filing of claims by lenders 
with guaranty agencies. In recognition of the time required for agencies 
and lenders to modify their internal procedures, the Secretary delayed 
for four months the date by which lenders were required to comply with 
the new due diligence requirements. Thus, Sec. 682.411 of the 
regulations, which established minimum due diligence procedures that a 
lender must follow in order for a guaranty agency to receive reinsurance 
on a loan, became effective for loans for which the first day of 
delinquency occurred on or after March 10, 1987. The regulations make 
clear that compliance with these minimum requirements, and with the new 
timely filing deadlines, is a condition for an agency's receiving or 
retaining reinsurance payments made by the Secretary on a loan. See 34 
CFR 682.406(a)(3), (a)(5), 682.413(b). The regulations also specify that 
a lender must comply with Sec. 682.411 and with the applicable filing 
deadline, as a condition for its right to receive or retain interest 
benefits and special allowance on a loan for certain periods. See 34 CFR 
682.300(b)(2)(vi), 682.413(a)(1).
    The Department has received inquiries regarding the procedures by 
which a lender may ``cure'' a violation of Sec. 682.411 regarding

[[Page 745]]

diligent loan collection, or of the 90-day deadline for the filing of 
default claims found in Sec. 682.406(a)(3) and (a)(5), in order to 
reinstate the agency's right to reinsurance, and the lender's right to 
interest benefits and special allowance. Preliminarily, please note 
that, absent an exercise of the Secretary's waiver authority, a guaranty 
agency may not receive or retain reinsurance payments on a loan on which 
the lender has violated the Federal due diligence or timely filing 
requirements, even if the lender has followed a cure procedure 
established by the agency. Under Secs. 682.406(b) and 682.413(f), the 
Secretary--not the guaranty agency--decides whether to reinstate 
reinsurance coverage on a loan involving such a violation, or any other 
violation of Federal regulations. A lender's violation of a guaranty 
agency's requirement that affects the agency's guarantee coverage also 
affects reinsurance coverage. See Secs. 682.406(a)(7); and 682.413(b). 
As Secs. 682.406(a)(7) and 682.413(b) make clear, a guaranty agency's 
cure procedures are relevant to reinsurance coverage only insofar as 
they allow for cure of violations of requirements established by the 
agency affecting the loan insurance it provides to lenders. In addition, 
all such requirements must be submitted to the Secretary for review and 
approval, under 34 CFR 682.401(d).
    References throughout this letter to ``due diligence and timely 
filing'' rules, requirements, and violations should be understood to 
mean only the Federal rules cited above, unless the context clearly 
requires otherwise.

                                A. Scope

    This letter outlines the Secretary's waiver policy regarding certain 
violations of Federal due diligence or timely filing requirements on a 
loan insured by a guaranty agency. Unless your agency receives 
notification to the contrary, or the lender's violation involves fraud 
or other intentional misconduct, you may treat as reinsured any 
otherwise reinsured loan involving such a violation that has been cured 
in accordance with this letter.

          B. Duty of a Guaranty Agency to Enforce Its Standards

    As noted above, a lender's violation of a guaranty agency's 
requirement that affects the agency's guarantee coverage also affects 
reinsurance coverage. Thus, as a general rule, an agency that fails to 
enforce such a requirement and pays a default claim involving a 
violation is not eligible to receive reinsurance on the underlying loan. 
However, in light of the waiver policy outlined below, which provides 
more stringent cure procedures for violations occurring on or after May 
1, 1988 than for pre-May 1, 1988 violations, some guarantee agencies 
with more stringent policies than the policy outlined below for the pre-
May 1 violations have indicated that they wish to relax their own 
policies for violations of agency rules during that period. While the 
Secretary does not encourage any agency to do so, the Secretary will 
permit an agency to take either of the following approaches to its 
enforcement of its own due diligence and timely filing rules for 
violations occurring before May 1, 1988.
    (1) The agency may continue to enforce its rules, even if they 
result in the denial of guarantee coverage by the agency on otherwise 
reinsurable loans; or
    (2) The agency may decline to enforce its rules as to any loan that 
would be reinsured under the retrospective waiver policy outlined below. 
In other words, for violations of a guaranty agency's due diligence and 
timely filing rules occurring before May 1, 1988, a guaranty agency is 
authorized, but not required, to retroactively revise its own due 
diligence and timely filing standards to treat as guaranteed any loan 
amount that is reinsured under the retrospective enforcement policy 
outlined in section I.C.1., below. However, for any violation of an 
agency's due diligence or timely filing rules occurring on or after May 
1, 1988, the agency must resume enforcing those rules in accordance with 
their terms, in order to receive reinsurance payments on the underlying 
loan. For these post-April 30 violations, and for any other violation of 
an agency's rule affecting its guarantee coverage, the Secretary will 
treat as reinsured all loans on which the agency has engaged in, and 
documented, a case-by-case exercise of reasonable discretion allowing 
for guarantee coverage to be continued or reinstated notwithstanding the 
violation. But any agency that otherwise fails, or refuses, to enforce 
such a rule does so without the benefit of reinsurance coverage on the 
affected loans, and the lenders continue to be ineligible for interest 
benefits and special allowance thereon.

                            C. Due Diligence

    Under 34 CFR 682.200, default on a FFEL Program loan occurs when a 
borrower fails to make a payment when due, provided this failure 
persists for 180 days for loans payable in monthly installments, or for 
240 days for loans payable in less frequent installments. The 180/240-
day default period applies regardless of whether payments were missed 
consecutively or intermittently. For example, if the borrower, on a loan 
payable in monthly installments, makes his January 1st payment on time, 
his February 1st payment two months late (April 1st), his March 1st 
payment three months late (June 1st), and makes no further payments, the 
delinquency period begins on February 2nd, with the first delinquency, 
and default occurs on September 29th, when the April payment becomes

[[Page 746]]

180 days past due. The lender must treat the payment made on April 1st 
as the February 1st payment, since the February 1st payment had not been 
made prior to that time. Similarly, the lender must treat the payment 
made on June 1st as the March 1st payment, since the March payment had 
not been made prior to that time.

    Note: Lenders are strongly encouraged to exercise forbearance, prior 
to default, for the benefit of borrowers who have missed payments 
intermittently but have otherwise indicated willingness to repay their 
loans. See 34 CFR 682.211. The forbearance process helps to reduce the 
incidence of default, and serves to emphasize for the borrower the 
importance of compliance with the repayment obligation.

                            D. Timely Filing

    The 90-day filing period applicable to FFEL Program default claims 
is set forth in 34 CFR 682.406(a)(5). The 90-day filing period begins at 
the end of the 180/240-day default period. The lender ordinarily must 
file a default claim on a loan in default by the end of the filing 
period. However, the lender may, but need not, file a claim on that loan 
before the 270th day of delinquency (180-day default period plus 90-day 
filing period) if the borrower brings the account less than 180 days 
delinquent before such 270th day. Thus, in the above example, if the 
borrower makes the April 1st payment on September 30th, that payment 
makes the loan 151 days delinquent, and the lender may, but need not, 
file a default claim on the loan at that time. If, however, the loan 
again becomes 180 days delinquent, the lender must file a default claim 
within 90 days thereafter (unless the loan is again brought to less than 
180 days delinquent prior to the end of that 90-day period). In other 
words, the Secretary will permit a lender to treat payments made during 
the filing period as curing the default if such payments are sufficient 
to make the loan less than 180 days delinquent.
    Section I of this letter outlines the Secretary's waiver policy for 
due diligence and timely filing violations. As noted above, to the 
extent that it results in the imposition of a lesser sanction than that 
available to the Secretary by statute or regulation, this policy 
reflects the exercise of the Secretary's authority to waive the 
Secretary's rights and claims in this area. Section II discusses the 
issue of the due date of the first payment on a loan, and the 
application of the waiver policy to that issue. Section III provides 
guidance on several issues related to due diligence and timely filing as 
to which clarification has been requested by some program participants.

                            I. Waiver Policy

    A. Definitions
    The following definitions apply to terms used throughout this 
letter:
    Full payment means payment by the borrower, or another person (other 
than the lender) on the borrower's behalf, in an amount at least as 
great as the monthly payment amount required under the existing terms of 
the loan, exclusive of any forbearance agreement in force at the time of 
the default. (For example, if the original repayment schedule or 
agreement called for payments of $50 per month, but a forbearance 
agreement was in effect at the time of default that allowed the borrower 
to pay $25 per month for a specified time, and the borrower defaulted in 
making the reduced payments, a ``full payment'' would be $50, or two $25 
payments in accordance with the original repayment schedule or 
agreement.) In the case of a payment made by cash, money order, or other 
means that do not identify the payor that is received by a lender after 
the date of this letter, that payment may constitute a ``full payment'' 
only if a senior officer of the lender or servicing agent certifies that 
the payment was not made by or on behalf of the lender or servicing 
agent.
    Reinstatement with respect to reinsurance coverage means the 
reinstatement of the guaranty agency's right to receive reinsurance 
payments on the loan after the date of reinstatement. Upon reinstatement 
of reinsurance, the borrower regains the right to receive forbearance or 
deferments, as appropriate. ``Reinstatement'' with respect to 
reinsurance on a loan also includes reinstatement of the lender's right 
to receive interest and special allowance payments on that loan.
    ``Gap'' in collection activity on a loan means:

    (a) The period between the initial delinquency and the first 
collection activity;
    (b) The period between collection activities (a request for 
preclaims assistance is considered a collection activity);
    (c) The period between the last collection activity and default; or
    (d) The period between the date a lender discovers a borrower has 
``skipped'' and the lender's first skip-tracing activity.

    Note: the concept of ``gap'' is used herein simply as one measure of 
collection activity. This definition applies to loans subject to the 
FFEL and PLUS programs regulations published on November 10, 1986. For 
such loans, not all gaps are violations of the due diligence rules.
    Violation with respect to the due diligence requirements in 
Sec. 682.411 means the failure to timely complete a required diligent 
phone contact effort, the failure to timely send a required letter 
(including a request for preclaims assistance), or the failure to timely 
engage in a required skip-tracing activity. If during the deliquency 
period, a gap of

[[Page 747]]

more than 45 days occurs (more than 60 days for loans with a transfer), 
the lender must satisfy the requirement outlined in I.D.1. for 
reinsurance to be reinstated. The day after the 45-day gap (or 60 for 
loans with a transfer) will be considered the date that the violation 
occurred.
    Transfer means any action, including, but not limited to, the sale 
of the loan, that results in a change in the system used to monitor or 
conduct collection activity on a loan from one system to another.

                               B. General

    1. Resumption of Interest and Special Allowance Billing on Loans 
Involving Due Diligence or Timely Filing Violations. For any loan on 
which a cure is required under this letter in order for the agency to 
receive any reinsurance payment, the lender may resume billing for 
interest and special allowance on the loan only for periods following 
its completion of the required cure procedure.
    2. Reservation of the Secretary's Right to Strict Enforcement. While 
this letter describes the Secretary's general waiver policy, the 
Secretary retains the option of refusing to permit or recognize cures, 
or of insisting on strict enforcement of the remedies established by 
statute or regulation, in cases where, in the Secretary's judgment, a 
lender has committed an excessive number of severe violations of due 
diligence or timely filing rules, and in cases where the best interests 
of the United States otherwise require such strict enforcement. More 
generally, this bulletin states the Secretary's general policy and is 
not intended to limit in any way the authority and discretion afforded 
the Secretary by statute or regulation.
    3. Interest, Special Allowance, and Reinsurance Repayment Required 
as a Condition for Exercise of the Secretary's Waiver Authority. The 
Secretary's waiver of the right to recover or refuse to pay reinsurance, 
interest benefits, or special allowance payments, and recognition of 
cures for due diligence and timely filing violations, are conditioned on 
the following:
    (1) The guaranty agency and lender shall ensure that the lender 
repays all interest benefits and special allowance received on loans 
involving violations occurring prior to May 1, 1988, for which the 
lender is ineligible under the waiver policy for the ``retrospective 
period'' described in section I.C.1., below, or under the waiver policy 
for timely filing violations described in section I.E.1., below, by an 
adjustment to one of the next three quarterly billings for interest 
benefits and special allowance submitted by the lender in a timely 
manner after May 1, 1988. The guaranty agency's responsibility in this 
regard is satisfied by receipt of a certification from the lender that 
this repayment has been made in full.
    (2) The guaranty agency, on or before October 1, 1988, shall repay 
all reinsurance received on loans involving violations occurring prior 
to May 1, 1988, for which the agency is ineligible under the waiver 
policy for the ``retrospective period'' described in section I.C.1., 
below, or under the waiver policy for timely filing violations described 
in section I.E.1., below. Pending completion of the repayment described 
above, a lender or guaranty agency may submit billings to the Secretary 
on loans that are eligible for reinsurance under the waiver policy in 
this letter until it learns that repayment in full will not be made, or 
until the deadline for a repayment has passed without it being made, 
whichever is earlier. Of course, a lender or guaranty agency is 
prohibited from billing the Secretary for program payments on any loan 
amount that is not eligible for reinsurance under the waiver policy 
outlined in this letter. In addition to the repayments required above, 
any amounts received in the future in violation of this prohibition must 
immediately be repaid to the Secretary.
    4. Applicability of the Waiver Policy to Particular Classes of 
Loans. The policy outlined in this letter applies only to a loan for 
which the first day of the 180/240-day default period that ended with 
default by the borrower occurred on or after March 10, 1987, or, in the 
case of a timely filing violation, December 26, 1986, and that involves 
violations only of the due diligence and/or timely filing requirements. 
For a loan that has lost reinsurance prior to December 1, 1992, this 
policy applies only through November 30, 1995. For a loan that loses 
reinsurance on or after December 1, 1992, this policy applies until 
three years after the default claim filing deadline.
    5. Excuse of Certain Due Diligence Violations. Except as noted in 
section II, below, if a loan has due diligence violations but was later 
cured and brought current, those violations will not be considered in 
determining whether a loan was serviced in accordance with 34 CFR 
682.411. Guarantors must review the due diligence for the 180-day period 
prior to the default date ensuring the due date of the first payment not 
later made is the correct payment due date for the borrower.
    6. Excuse of Timely Filing Violations Due to Performance of a 
Guaranty Agency's Cure Procedures. If, prior to May 1, 1988, and prior 
to the filing deadline, a lender commenced the performance of collection 
activities specifically required by the guaranty agency to cure a due 
diligence violation on a loan, the Secretary will excuse the lender's 
timely filing violation if the lender completes the additional 
activities within the time period permitted by the guaranty agency, and 
files a default claim on the loan not more than 45 days after completing 
the additional activities.
    7. Treatment of Accrued Interest on ``Cured'' Claims. For any loan 
involving any violation

[[Page 748]]

of the due diligence or timely filing rules for which a ``cure'' is 
required under section I.C. or I.E., below, for the agency to receive a 
reinsurance payment, the Secretary will not reimburse the guaranty 
agency for any unpaid interest accruing after the date of the earliest 
unexcused violation occurring after the last payment received before the 
cure is accomplished, and prior to the date of reinstatement of 
reinsurance coverage. The lender may capitalize unpaid interest accruing 
on the loan from the date of the earliest unexcused violation to the 
date of the reinstatement of reinsurance coverage. However, if the 
agency later files a claim for reinsurance on that loan, the agency must 
deduct this capitalized interest from the amount of the claim. Some 
cures will not reinstate coverage. For treatment of accrued interest in 
such cases, see Section I.E.1.c., below.

    C. Waiver Policy for Violations of the Federal Due Diligence in 
                 Collection Requirements (34 CFR 682.411

    A violation of the due diligence in collection rules occurs when a 
lender fails to meet the requirements found in 34 CFR 682.411. However, 
if a lender makes all required calls and sends all required letters 
during any of the delinquency periods described in that section, the 
lender is considered to be in compliance with that section for that 
period, even if the letters were sent before the calls were made.
    The special provisions for transfers set forth below apply whenever 
the violation(s) and, if applicable, the gap, were due to a transfer, as 
defined in section I.A., above.
    1. Retrospective Period. For one or more due diligence violations 
occurring during the period March 10, 1987-April 30, 1988--
    a. There will be no reduction or recovery by the Secretary of 
payments to the lender or guaranty agency if no gap of 46 days or more 
(61 days or more for a transfer) exists.
    b. If a gap of 46-60 days (61-75 days for a transfer) exists, 
principal will be reinsured, but accrued interest, interest benefits, 
and special allowance otherwise payable by the Secretary for the 
delinquency period are limited to amounts accruing through the date of 
default.
    c. If a gap of 61 days or more (76 days or more for a transfer) 
exists, the borrower must be located after the gap, either by the agency 
or the lender, in order for reinsurance on the loan to be reinstated. 
(See section I.E.1.d., below, for a description of acceptable evidence 
of location.) In addition, if the loan is held by the lender or after 
March 15, 1988, the lender must follow the steps described in section 
I.E.1., or receive a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement, 
in order for the loan to again be eligible for reinsurance. The lender 
must repay all interest benefits and special allowance received for the 
period beginning with its earliest unexcused violation, occurring after 
the last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and ending 
with the date, if any, that reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.
    2. Prospective Period. For due diligence violations occurring on or 
after May 1, 1988----
    a. There will be no reduction or recovery by the Secretary of 
payments to the lender or guaranty agency if there is no violation of 
Federal requirements of 6 days or more (21 days or more for a transfer.)
    b. If there exists not more than 2 violations of 6 days or more each 
(21 days or more for a transfer), and no gap of 46 days or more (61 days 
or more for a transfer) exists, principal will be reinsured, but accrued 
interest, interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by 
the Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to amounts 
accruing through the date of default.
    However, the lender must complete all required activities before the 
claim filing deadline, except that a preclaims assistance request must 
be made before the 240th day of delinquency. If the lender fails to make 
this request by the 240th day, the Secretary will not pay any accrued 
interest, interest benefits, and special allowance for the most recent 
180 days prior to default. If the lender fails to complete any other 
required activity before the claim filing deadline, accrued interest, 
interest benefits, and special allowance otherwise payable by the 
Secretary for the delinquency period will be limited to amounts accruing 
through the 90th day before default.
    c. If there exists 3 violations of 6 days or more each (21 days or 
more for a transfer) and no gap of 46 days or more (61 days or more for 
a transfer), the lender must satisfy the requirements outlined in 
I.E.1., or receive a full payment or a new signed repayment agreement in 
order for reinsurance on the loan to be reinstated. The Secretary does 
not pay any interest benefits or special allowance for the period 
beginning with the lender's earliest unexcused violation occurring after 
the last payment received before the cure is accomplished, and ending 
with the date, if any, that reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.
    d. If there exists more than three violations of 6 days or more each 
(21 days or more for a transfer) of any type, or a gap of 46 days (61 
days for a transfer) or more and at least one violation, the lender must 
satisfy the requirement outlined in section I.D.1., for reinsurance on 
the loan to be reinstated. The Secretary does not pay any interest 
benefits or special allowance for the period beginning with the lender's 
earliest unexcused violation occurring after the last payment received 
before the cure is accomplished, and ending with the date, if any, that 
reinsurance on the loan is reinstated.

[[Page 749]]

   D. Reinstatement of Reinsurance Coverage for Certain Egregious Due 
                          Diligence Violations

    1. Cures. In the case of a loan involving violations described in 
section I.C.2.d., above, the lender may utilize either of the two 
procedures described below for obtaining reinstatement of reinsurance 
coverage on the loan.
    a. After the violations occur, the lender obtains a new repayment 
agreement signed by the borrower. The repayment agreement must comply 
with the ten-year repayment limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7); 
or
    b. After the violations occur, the lender obtains one full payment. 
If the borrower later defaults, the guaranty agency must obtain evidence 
of this payment (e.g., a copy of the check) from the lender.
    2. Borrower Deemed Current as of Date of Cure. On the date the 
lender receives a new signed repayment agreement or the curing payment 
under section I.D.1., above, reinsurance coverage on the loan is 
reinstated, and the borrower shall be deemed by the lender to be current 
in repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits available 
to borrowers who are not in default. The lender shall then follow the 
collection and timely filing requirements applicable to the loan.

    E. Cures for Timely Filing Violations and Certain Due Diligence 
                               Violations

    1. Default Claims--a. Reinstatement of Insurance Coverage. Except as 
noted in section I.B.6., in order to obtain reinstatement of reinsurance 
coverage on a loan in the case of a timely filing violation, a due 
diligence violation described in section I.C.2.c., or a due diligence 
violation described in section I.C.1.c. where the lender holds the loan 
on or after March 15, 1988, the lender must first locate the borrower 
after the gap, or after the date of the last violation, as applicable. 
(See section I.E.1.d. for description of acceptable evidence of 
location.) Within 15 days thereafter, the lender must send to the 
borrower, at the address at which the borrower was located, (i) a new 
repayment agreement, to be signed by the borrower, that complies with 
the ten-year repayment limitations set out in 34 CFR 682.209(a)(7), 
along with (ii) a collection letter indicating in strong terms the 
seriousness of the borrower's delinquency and its potential effect on 
his or her credit rating if repayment is not commenced or resumed.
    If, within 15 days after the lender sends these items, the borrower 
fails to make a full payment or to sign and return the new repayment 
agreement, the lender shall, within 5 days thereafter, diligently 
attempt to contact the borrower by telephone. Within 5-10 days after 
completing these efforts, the lender shall again diligently attempt to 
contact the borrower by telephone. Finally, within 5-10 days after 
completing these efforts, the lender shall send a forceful collection 
letter indicating that the entire unpaid balance of the loan is due and 
payable, and that, unless the borrower immediately contacts the lender 
to arrange repayment, the lender will be filing a default claim with the 
guaranty agency.
    b. Borrower Deemed Current Under Certain Circumstances. If, at any 
time on or before the 30th day after the lender completes the additional 
collection efforts described in section I.E.1.a., above, or the 180th 
day of delinquency, whichever is later, the lender receives a full 
payment or a new signed repayment agreement, reinsurance coverage on the 
loan is reinstated on the date the lender receives the full payment or 
new agreement. The borrower shall be deemed by the lender to be current 
in repaying the loan and entitled to all rights and benefits available 
to borrowers who are not in default.
    In the case of a timely filing violation on a loan for which the 
borrower is deemed current under this paragraph, the lender is 
ineligible to receive interest benefits and special allowance accruing 
from the date of the violation to the date of reinstatement of 
reinsurance coverage on the loan.
    c. Borrower Deemed in Default Under Certain Circumstances. If the 
borrower does not make a full payment, or sign and return the new 
repayment agreement, on or before the 30th day after the lender 
completes the additional collection efforts described in section 
I.E.1.a., above, or the 180th day of delinquency, whichever is later, 
the lender shall deem the borrower to be in default. The lender shall 
then file a default claim on the loan, accompanied by acceptable 
evidence of location (see section I.E.1.d., below), within 30 days after 
the end of such 30-day period. Reinsurance coverage, and therefore the 
lender's right to receive interest benefits and special allowance, is 
not reinstated on a loan involving these circumstances. However, the 
Secretary will honor reinsurance claims submitted in accordance with 
this paragraph on the outstanding principal balance of such loans, on 
unpaid interest as provided in section I.B.7., above, and for 
reimbursement of eligible supplemental preclaims assistance costs.
    In the case of a timely filing violation on a loan for which the 
borrower is deemed in default under this paragraph, the lender is 
ineligible to receive interest benefits and special allowance accruing 
from the date of the violation.
    d. Acceptable Evidence of Location. Only the following documentation 
is acceptable as evidence that the lender has located the borrower:
    (1) A postal receipt signed by the borrower not more than 15 days 
prior to the date on which the lender sent the new repayment

[[Page 750]]

agreement, indicating acceptance of correspondence from the lender by 
the borrower at the address shown on the receipt; or
    (2) Documentation submitted by the lender showing--
    (i) The name, identification number, and address of the lender;
    (ii) The name and Social Security number of the borrower; and
    (iii) A signed certification by an employee or agent of the lender, 
that--
    (A) On a specified date, he or she spoke with or received written 
communication (attached to the certification) from the borrower on the 
loan underlying the default claim, or a parent, spouse, sibling, 
roommate, or neighbor of the borrower;
    (B) The address and, if available, telephone number of the borrower 
were provided to the lender in the telephone or written communication; 
and
    (C) In the case of a borrower whose address or telephone number was 
provided to the lender by someone other than the borrower, the new 
repayment agreement and the letter sent by the lender pursuant to 
section I.E.1.a., above, had not been returned undelivered as of 20 days 
after the date those items were sent, for due diligence violations 
described in section I.C.1.c. where the lender holds the loan on the 
date of this letter, and as of the date the lender filed a default claim 
on the cured loan, for all other violations.
    2. Death, Disability, and Bankruptcy Claims. The Secretary will 
honor a death or disability claim on an otherwise eligible loan 
notwithstanding the lender's failure to meet the 60-day timely filing 
requirement (see 34 CFR 682.402(e)(2)(i)). However, the Secretary will 
not reimburse the guaranty agency if, before the date the lender 
determined that the borrower died or was totally and permanently 
disabled, the lender had violated the Federal due diligence or timely 
filing requirements applicable to that loan, except in accordance with 
the waiver policy described above. Interest that accrued on the loan 
after the expiration of the 60-day filing period remains ineligible for 
reimbursement by the Secretary, and the lender must repay all interest 
and special allowance received on the loan for periods after the 
expiration of the 60-day filing period.
    The Secretary had determined that, in the vast majority of cases, 
the failure of a lender to comply with the timely filing requirement 
applicable to bankruptcy claims (Sec. 682.402(e)(2)(ii)) causes 
irreparable harm to the guaranty agency's ability to contest the 
discharge of the loan by the court, or to otherwise collect from the 
borrower. Therefore, the Secretary has decided not to excuse violations 
of the timely filing requirement applicable to bankruptcy claims, except 
when the lender can demonstrate that the bankruptcy action has concluded 
and that the loan has not been discharged in bankruptcy, or, if 
previously discharged, has been the subject of a reversal of the 
discharge. In that case, the lender shall return the borrower to the 
appropriate status that existed prior to the filing of the bankruptcy 
claim. The Secretary will not reimburse the guaranty agency for interest 
accruing beyond the filing deadline for the bankruptcy claim.

                      II. Due Date of First Payment

    Section 682.411(b)(1) refers to the ``due date of the first missed 
payment not later made'' as one way to determine the first day of 
delinquency on a loan. Section 682.209(a)(3) states that, generally, the 
repayment period on a FFEL programs loan begins some number of months 
after the month in which the borrower ceases at least half-time study. 
Where the borrower enters the repayment period with the lender's 
knowledge, the first payment due date may be set by the lender, provided 
it falls within a reasonable time after the first day of the month in 
which the repayment period begins. In this situation, the Secretary 
generally permits a lender to allow the borrower up to 45 days from the 
first day of repayment to make the first payment. (Unless the lender 
establishes the first day of repayment under Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E).)
    In cases where the lender learns that the borrower has entered the 
repayment period after the fact, current Sec. 682.411 treats the 30th 
day after the lender receives this information as the first day of 
delinquency. In the course of discussion with lenders, the Secretary has 
learned that many lenders have not been using the 30th day after receipt 
of notice that the repayment period has begun (``the notice'') as the 
first payment due date. In recognition of this apparently widespread 
practice, the Secretary has decided that, both retrospectively and 
prospectively, a lender should be allowed to establish a first payment 
due date within 60 days after receipt of the notice, to capitalize 
interest accruing up to the first payment due date, and to exercise 
forbearance with respect to the period during which the borrower was in 
the repayment period but made no payment. In effect, this means that, if 
the lender sends the borrower a coupon book, billing notice, or other 
correspondence establishing a new first payment due date, on or before 
the 60th day after receipt of the notice, the lender is deemed to have 
exercised forbearance up to the new first payment due date. The new 
first payment due date must fall no later than 75 days after receipt of 
the notice. (Unless the lender establishes the first day of repayment 
under Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E).) In keeping with the 5-day tolerance 
permitted under section I.C.2.a., for the ``prospective period'', a 
lender that sends the above-described material on or before the 65th day 
after receipt of the notice will be held harmless. However, a lender 
that does so on the 66th day will

[[Page 751]]

have failed by more than 5 days to send both of the collection letters 
required by Sec. 682.411(c) to be sent within the first 30 days of 
delinquency, and will thus have committed two violations of more than 
five days of that rule.
    If the lender fails to send the material establishing a new first 
payment due date on or before the 65th day after receipt of the notice, 
it may thereafter send material establishing a new first payment due 
date falling not more than 45 days after the materials are sent, and 
will be deemed to have exercised forbearance up to the new first payment 
due date. However, all violations and gaps occurring prior to the date 
on which the material is sent are subject to the waiver policies 
described in section I for violations falling in either the 
retrospective or prospective periods. This is an exception to the 
general policy set forth in section I.B.5., above, that only violations 
occurring during the most recent 180 days of the delinquency period on a 
loan are relevant to the Secretary's examination of due diligence.
    Please Note: References to the ``65th day after receipt of the 
notice'' and ``66th day'' in the preceding paragraphs should be amended 
to read ``95th day'' and ``96th day'' respectively for lenders subject 
to Sec. 682.209(a)(3)(ii)(E).

                       III. Questions and Answers

    The waiver policy outlined in this letter was developed after 
extensive discussion and consultation with participating lenders and 
guarantee agencies. In the course of these discussions, lenders and 
agencies raised a number of questions regarding the due diligence rules 
as applied to various circumstances. The Secretary's responses to these 
questions are set forth below.
    Note: The answer to questions 1 and 4 are applicable only to loans 
subject to Sec. 682.411 of the FFEL snd PLUS program regulations 
published on November 10, 1986.
    1. Q: Section 682.411 of the program regulations requires the lender 
to make ``diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone'' during 
each 30-day period of delinquency beginning after the 30th day of 
delinquency. What must a lender do to comply with this requirement?
    A: Generally speaking, one actual telephone contact with the 
borrower, or two attempts to make such contact on different days and at 
different times, will satisfy the ``diligent efforts'' requirement for 
any of the 30-day delinquency periods described in the rule. However, 
the ``diligent efforts'' requirement is intended to be a flexible one, 
requiring the lender to act on information it receives in the course of 
attempting telephone contact regarding the borrower's actual telephone 
number, the best time to call to reach the borrower, etc. For instance, 
if the lender is told during its second telephone contact attempt that 
the borrower can be reached at another number or at a different time of 
day, the lender must then attempt to reach the borrower by telephone at 
that number or that time of day.
    2. Q: What must a lender do when it receives conflicting information 
regarding the date a borrower ceased at least half-time study?
    A: A lender must promptly attempt to reconcile conflicting 
information regarding a borrower's in-school status by making inquiries 
of appropriate parties, including the borrower's school. Pending 
reconciliation, the lender may rely on the most recent credible 
information it has.
    3. Q: If a loan is transferred from one lender to another, is the 
transferee held responsible for information regarding the borrower's 
status that is received by the transferor but is not passed on to the 
transferee?
    A: No. A lender is responsible only for information received by its 
agents and employees. However, if the transferee has reason to believe 
that the transferor has received additional information regarding the 
loan, the transferee must make a reasonable inquiry of the transferor as 
to the nature and substance of that information.
    4. Q: What are a lender's due diligence responsibilities where a 
check received on a loan is dishonored by the bank on which it was 
drawn?
    A: Upon receiving notice that a check has been dishonored, the 
lender shall treat the payment as having never been made for purposes of 
determining the number of days delinquent that the borrower is at that 
time. The lender must then begin (or resume) attempting collection on 
the loan in accordance with Sec. 682.411, commencing with the first 30-
day delinquency period described in Sec. 682.411 that begins after the 
30-day delinquency period in which the notice of dishonor is received. 
The same result obtains when the lender successfully obtains a 
delinquent borrower's correct address through skip-tracing, or when a 
delinquent borrower leaves deferment or forbearance status.

                      Subpart A--Purpose and Scope


<R05>
Sec. 685.100  The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program.

    (a) Under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) 
Program (formerly known as the Federal Direct Student Loan Program), the 
Secretary makes loans to enable a student or parent to pay the costs of 
the student's attendance at a postsecondary school. This part governs 
the Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the Federal Direct 
Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the Federal Direct PLUS 
Program, and the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program. The 
Secretary makes loans under the following program components:
    (1) Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program (formerly known as the 
Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program), which provides loans to 
undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The Secretary 
subsidizes the interest while the borrower is in an in-school, grace, or 
deferment period.
    (2) Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program (formerly 
known as the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program), which 
provides loans to undergraduate, graduate and professional students. The 
borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues during any period.
    (3) Federal Direct PLUS Program, which provides loans to parents of 
dependent students. The borrower is responsible for the interest that 
accrues during any period.
    (4) Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program, which provides loans 
to borrowers to consolidate certain Federal educational loans.
    (b) The Secretary makes a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan only to a student or a parent 
of a student enrolled in a school that has been selected by the 
Secretary to participate in the Direct Loan Program.
    (c) The Secretary makes a Direct Consolidation Loan only to--
    (1) A borrower with a loan made under the Direct Loan Program; or
    (2) A borrower with a loan made under the Federal Family Education

[[Page 753]]

Loan Program who is not able to receive--
    (i) A Federal Consolidation Loan; or
    (ii) A Federal Consolidation Loan with income-sensitive repayment 
terms that are satisfactory to the borrower.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.)

Sec. 685.101  Participation in the Direct Loan Program.

Loan Program enables an eligible student or parent to obtain a loan to 
pay for the student's cost of attendance at the school.
    (2) The Secretary may permit a school to participate in both the 
Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, as defined in 34 CFR Part 
600, and the Direct Loan Program. A school permitted to participate in 
both the FFEL Program and the Direct Loan Program may certify loan 
applications under the FFEL Program according to the terms of its 
agreement with the Secretary.
    (b) An eligible student who is enrolled at a school participating in 
the Direct Loan Program may borrow under the Federal Direct Stafford/
Ford Loan and Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Programs. 
An eligible parent of an eligible dependent student enrolled at a school 
participating in the Direct Loan Program may borrow under the Federal 
Direct PLUS Program.

Students, Federal PLUS, Direct PLUS, and Direct PLUS Consolidation Loans 
may be consolidated into a Direct PLUS Consolidation Loan. The borrower 
is responsible for the interest that accrues during any period.
    Federal Direct PLUS Program: A loan program authorized by title IV, 
part D of the Act that provides loans to parents of dependent students

to as Direct Subsidized Loans.
    Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program: A loan 
program authorized by title IV, part D of the Act that provides loans to

Direct Loan Program borrower ceases to be enrolled as at least a half-
time student at an eligible institution and ends on the day before the 
repayment period begins.

is enrolled in a school participating in the FFEL Program or the Direct 
Loan Program and is carrying an academic workload that is at least one-
half the workload of a full-time student, as determined by the school. A 
student enrolled solely in an eligible program of study by 
correspondence is considered a half-time student.

under title IV, part D of the Act.
    Loan fee: A fee, payable by the borrower, that is used to help 
defray the costs of the Direct Loan Program.
    Period of enrollment: The period for which a Direct Subsidized, 
Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan is intended. The period of 
enrollment must coincide with one or more academic terms established by 
the school (such as semester, trimester, quarter, academic year, and 
length of the program of study), for which institutional charges are 
generally assessed. The period of enrollment is also referred to in this 
part as the loan period.
    Satisfactory repayment arrangement. (1) For the purpose of regaining 
eligibility under section 428F(b) of the HEA, the making of six 
consecutive, voluntary, on-time, full monthly payments on a defaulted 
loan. A borrower may only obtain the benefit of this paragraph with 
respect to renewed eligibility once.
    (2) For the purpose of consolidating a defaulted loan under 34 CFR 
685.215(d)(1)(ii)(E), the making of three consecutive, voluntary, on-
time, full monthly payments on a defaulted loan.
    (3) The required monthly payment amount may not be more than is 
reasonable and affordable based on the borrower's total financial 
circumstances. ``On-time'' means a payment made within 15 days of the 
scheduled due date, and voluntary payments are those payments made 
directly by the borrower, regardless of whether there is a judgment 
against the borrower, and do not include payments obtained by income tax 
offset, garnishment, or income or asset execution.
    School origination option 1: In general, under this option the 
school performs the following functions: creates a loan origination 
record, transmits the record to the Servicer, prepares the promissory 
note, obtains a completed and signed promissory note from a borrower, 
transmits the promissory note to the Servicer, receives the funds 
electronically, disburses a loan to a borrower, creates a disbursement 
record, transmits the disbursement record to the Servicer, and 
reconciles on a monthly basis. The Servicer initiates the drawdown of 
funds for schools participating in school origination option 1. The 
Secretary may modify the functions performed by a particular school.
    School origination option 2: In general, under this option the 
school performs the following functions: creates a loan origination 
record, transmits the record to the Servicer, prepares the promissory 
note, obtains a completed and signed promissory note from a borrower, 
transmits the promissory note to the Servicer, determines funding needs, 
initiates the drawdown of funds, receives the funds electronically, 
disburses a loan to a borrower, creates a disbursement record, transmits 
the disbursement record to the Servicer, and

[[Page 756]]

reconciles on a monthly basis. The Secretary may modify the functions 
performed by a particular school.
    Servicer: An entity that has contracted with the Secretary to act as 
the Secretary's agent in providing services relating to the origination 
or servicing of Direct Loans.
    Standard origination: In general, under this option the school 
performs the following functions: creates a loan origination record, 
transmits the record to the Servicer, receives funds electronically, 
disburses funds, creates a disbursement record, transmits the 
disbursement record to the Servicer, and reconciles on a monthly basis. 
The Servicer prepares the promissory note, obtains a completed and 
signed promissory note from a borrower, and initiates the drawdown of 
funds for schools participating in standard origination. The Secretary 
may modify the functions performed by a particular school.

basis.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a ``parent'' 
includes the individuals described in the definition of ``parent'' in 34 
CFR 668.2 and the spouse of a parent who remarried, if that spouse's

    (i) A school participating under school origination option 2 shall 
create a loan origination record, obtain a completed promissory note 
from the student, draw down funds, and disburse the funds.
    (ii) A school participating under school origination option 1 shall 
create

[[Page 758]]

a loan origination record, obtain a completed promissory note from the 
student, and transmit the record and promissory note to the Servicer. 
The Servicer initiates the drawdown of funds, and the school disburses 
the funds.
    (iii) If the student is attending a school participating under 
standard origination, the school shall create a loan origination record 
and transmit the record to the alternative originator, which prepares 
the promissory note and sends it to the student and receives the 
completed promissory note from the student. The Servicer initiates the 
drawdown of funds, and the school disburses the funds.
    (b) Application for a Direct PLUS Loan. To obtain a Direct PLUS 
Loan, the parent shall complete the application and promissory note and 
submit it to the school at which the student is enrolled. The school 
shall complete its portion of the application and promissory note and 
submit it to the Servicer, which makes a determination as to whether the 
parent has an adverse credit history. Unless a school's agreement with 
the Secretary specifies otherwise, the school shall perform the 
following functions: A school participating under school origination 
option 2 shall draw down funds and disburse the funds. For a school 
participating under school origination option 1 or standard origination, 
the Servicer initiates the drawdown of funds, and the school disburses 
the funds.
    (c) Application for a Direct Consolidation Loan. (1) To obtain a 
Direct Consolidation Loan, the applicant shall complete the application 
and promissory note and submit it to the Servicer. The application and 
promissory note set forth the terms and conditions of the Direct 
Consolidation Loan and inform the applicant how to contact the Servicer. 
The Servicer answers questions regarding the process of applying for a 
Direct Consolidation Loan and provides information about the terms and 
conditions of both Direct Consolidation Loans and the types of loans 
that may be consolidated.
    (2) Once the applicant has submitted the completed application and 
promissory note to the Servicer, the Secretary makes the Direct 
Consolidation Loan under the procedures specified in Sec. 685.215.

Sec. 685.202  Charges for which Direct Loan Program borrowers are responsible.

    (a) Interest--(1) Interest rate for Direct Subsidized Loans and 
Direct Unsubsidized Loans. (i) Loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 
1995. For Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans during 
all periods, the interest rate during any twelve-month period beginning 
on July 1 and ending on June 30 is determined on the June 1 immediately 
preceding that period. The interest rate is equal to the bond equivalent 
rate of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned at the final auction held prior 
to that June 1 plus 3.1 percentage points, but does not exceed 8.25 
percent.
    (ii) Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 1995.
    (A) During the in-school, grace, and deferment periods. The interest 
rate during any twelve-month period beginning on July 1 and ending on 
June 30 is determined on the June 1 immediately preceding that period. 
The interest rate is equal to the bond equivalent rate of 91-day 
Treasury bills auctioned at the final auction held prior to that June 1 
plus 2.5 percentage points, but does not exceed 8.25 percent.
    (B) During all other periods. The interest rate during any twelve-
month period beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 is determined on 
the June 1 immediately preceding that period. The interest rate is equal 
to the bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned at the 
final auction held prior to that June 1 plus 3.1 percentage points, but 
does not exceed 8.25 percent.
    (2) Interest rate for the Direct PLUS Loans. The interest rate on a 
Direct PLUS Loan during any twelve-month period beginning on July 1 and 
ending on June 30 is determined on the June 1 preceding that period. The 
interest rate is equal to the bond equivalent rate of 52-week Treasury 
bills auctioned at the final auction held prior to that June 1 plus 3.1 
percentage points, but does not exceed 9 percent.

[[Page 759]]

    (b) Capitalization. (1) The Secretary may add unpaid accrued 
interest to the borrower's unpaid principal balance. This increase in 
the principal balance of a loan is called ``capitalization.''
    (2) For a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or a Direct Unsubsidized 
Consolidation Loan that qualifies for a grace period, the Secretary 
capitalizes the unpaid interest that accrues on the loan when the 
borrower enters repayment.
    (3) Notwithstanding Sec. 685.208(g)(5) and Sec. 685.209(d)(3), for a 
Direct Loan not eligible for interest subsidies during periods of 
deferment, and for all Direct Loans during periods of forbearance, the 
Secretary capitalizes the unpaid interest that has accrued on the loan 
upon the expiration of the deferment or forbearance.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and in 
Sec. 685.208(g)(5), and Sec. 685.209(d)(3), the Secretary annually 
capitalizes unpaid interest when the borrower is paying under the 
alternative or income contingent repayment plans and the borrower's 
scheduled payments do not cover the interest that has accrued on the 
loan.
    (5) The Secretary may capitalize unpaid interest when the borrower 
defaults on the loan.
    (c) Loan fee for Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct 
PLUS Loans. The Secretary--
    (1) Charges a borrower a loan fee of four percent of the principal 
amount of the loan on a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or 
Direct PLUS Loan;
    (2) Deducts the loan fee from the proceeds of the loan;
    (3) In the case of a loan disbursed in multiple installments, 
deducts a pro rated portion of the fee from each disbursement; and
    (4) Applies to a borrower's loan balance the portion of the loan fee 
previously deducted from the loan that is attributable to a disbursement 
of the loan that is repaid within 120 days of disbursement or that 
should have been repaid within that period by the school.
    (d) Late charge. (1) The Secretary may require the borrower to pay a 
late charge of up to six cents for each dollar of each installment or 
portion thereof that is late under the circumstances described in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) The late charge may be assessed if the borrower fails to pay all 
or a portion of a required installment payment within 30 days after it 
is due.
    (e)(1) Collection charges before default. Notwithstanding any 
provision of State law, the Secretary may require that the borrower or 
any endorser pay costs incurred by the Secretary or the Secretary's 
agents in collecting installments not paid when due. These charges do 
not include routine collection costs associated with preparing letters 
or notices or with making personal contacts with the borrower (e.g., 
local and long-distance telephone calls).
    (2) Collection charges after default. If a borrower defaults on a 
Direct Loan, the Secretary assesses collection costs on the basis of 34 
CFR 30.60.

Federal Stafford

[[Page 760]]

Loan Program may not exceed the following:
    (i) $3,500 for a program of study of at least a full academic year 
in length.
    (ii) If the student is enrolled in a program of study with less than 
a full academic year remaining, an amount that bears the same ratio to 
$3,500 as the number of semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours for 
which the student enrolls bears to one academic year.
    (3) In the case of an undergraduate student who has successfully 
completed the first and second years of a program of study of 
undergraduate education but has not successfully completed the remainder

associate or baccalaureate degree which is required for admission into 
the program, the total amount the student may borrow for any academic 
year of study under the Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program in 
combination with the Federal Stafford Loan Program may not exceed the

Federal Stafford Loan Program may not exceed $8,500.
    (b) Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The total amount a student may borrow 
under any period of study for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan

    (c) Additional eligibility for Direct Unsubsidized Loans. (1)(i) An 
independent undergraduate student, graduate or professional student, and 
certain dependent undergraduate students may borrow amounts under the 
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program in addition to any amount 
borrowed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) In order for a dependent undergraduate student to receive this 
additional loan amount, the financial aid administrator must determine 
that the student's parent likely will be precluded by exceptional 
circumstances from borrowing under the Federal Direct PLUS Program or 
the Federal PLUS Program and the student's family is otherwise unable to 
provide the student's expected family contribution. The financial aid 
administrator shall base the determination on a review of the family 
financial information provided by the student and consideration of the 
student's debt burden and shall document the determination in the 
school's file.
    (iii) ``Exceptional circumstances'' under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section include but are not limited to circumstances in which the 
student's parent receives only public assistance or disability benefits, 
the parent is incarcerated, the parent has an adverse credit history, or 
the parent's whereabouts are unknown. A parent's refusal to borrow a 
Federal PLUS Loan or Direct PLUS Loan does not constitute ``exceptional 
circumstances.''
    (2) The additional amount that a student described in paragraph

    (B) For a student enrolled in a program of study with less than a 
full academic year remaining, an amount that bears the same ratio to 
$5,000 as the number of semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours for 
which the student enrolls bears to one academic year.
    (iii) In the case of a graduate or professional student, $10,000.
    (d) Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program and Federal Stafford 
Loan Program aggregate limits. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of

may not exceed the following:
    (1) $23,000 in the case of any student who has not successfully 
completed a program of study at the undergraduate level.
    (2) $65,500 in the case of a graduate or professional student,

Subsidized Loan and Federal Stafford Loan amounts, unless the student 
qualifies under paragraph (c) of this section for additional eligibility 
or qualified for that additional eligibility under the Federal SLS 
Program.
    (2) For an independent undergraduate or a dependent undergraduate 
who qualifies for additional eligibility under paragraph (c) of this 
section or qualified for this additional eligibility under the Federal 
SLS Program, $46,000 minus any Direct Subsidized Loan and Federal 
Stafford Loan amounts.
    (3) For a graduate or professional student, $138,500 including any

PLUS Loans that a parent or parents may borrow on behalf of each 
dependent student for any academic year of study may not exceed the cost 
of attendance minus other estimated financial assistance for that 
student.
    (g) Direct PLUS Loans aggregate limit. The total amount of all 
Direct PLUS Loans that a parent or parents may borrow on behalf of each 
dependent student for enrollment in an eligible program of study may not

    (i) Treatment of Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal 
Consolidation Loans. The percentage of the outstanding balance on Direct 
Consolidation Loans or Federal Consolidation Loans counted against a 
borrower's aggregate loan limits is calculated as follows:

percentage of the original amount of the Direct Consolidation Loan or 
Federal Consolidation Loan attributable to the Direct Unsubsidized, 
Federal SLS, and Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans.
    (j) Maximum loan amounts. In no case may a Direct Subsidized, Direct 
Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan amount exceed the student's estimated 
cost of attendance for the period of enrollment for which the loan is 
intended, less--
    (1) The student's estimated financial assistance for that period; 
and
    (2) In the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, the borrower's expected 
family contribution for that period.

Sec. 685.205  Forbearance.

    (a) General. ``Forbearance'' means permitting the temporary 
cessation of payments, allowing an extension of time for making 
payments, or temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously 
scheduled. The borrower has the option to choose the form of 
forbearance. If payments of interest are forborne, they are capitalized. 
The Secretary grants forbearance if the borrower or endorser intends to 
repay the loan but requests forbearance and provides sufficient

    (1) The Secretary determines that, due to poor health or other 
acceptable reasons, the borrower or endorser is currently unable to make 
scheduled payments;
    (2) The borrower's payments of principal are deferred under 
Sec. 685.204 and the Secretary does not subsidize the interest benefits 
on behalf of the borrower.
    (3) The borrower is in a medical or dental internship or residency 
that must be successfully completed before

[[Page 763]]

the borrower may begin professional practice or service, or the borrower 
is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program 
leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher 
education, a hospital, or a health care facility that offers 
postgraduate training;
    (4) The borrower is serving in a national service position for which 
the borrower is receiving a national service educational award under the 
National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993;
    (5) The borrower is eligible for loan forgiveness under the Federal 
Stafford Loan Forgiveness Demonstration Program, if the program is 
funded, for performing the type of service described in Sec. 682.215(b); 
or
    (6) For not more than three years during which the borrower or 
endorser--
    (i) Is currently obligated to make payments on loans under title IV 
of the Act; and
    (ii) The sum of these payments each month (or a proportional share 
if the payments are due less frequently than monthly) is equal to or 
greater than 20 percent of the borrower's or endorser's total monthly 
gross income.
    (b) Administrative forbearance. In certain circumstances, the 
Secretary grants forbearance without requiring documentation from the 
borrower. These circumstances include but are not limited to--

learns the borrower did not qualify;
    (2) The period for which payments are overdue at the beginning of an 
authorized deferment period;
    (3) The period beginning when the borrower entered repayment until 
the first payment due date was established;

disabled, until the Secretary receives documentation of death or total 
and permanent disability;
    (6) Periods necessary for the Secretary to determine the borrower's 
eligibility for discharge--
    (i) Under Sec. 685.213;
    (ii) Under Sec. 685.214; or
    (iii) Due to the borrower's or endorser's (if applicable) 
bankruptcy;
    (7) A period of up to three years in cases where the effect of a 
variable interest rate on a fixed-amount or graduated repayment schedule 
causes the extension of the maximum repayment term; or
    (8) A period during which the Secretary has authorized forbearance 
due to a national military mobilization or other local or national 
emergency.
    (c) Period of forbearance. (1) The Secretary grants forbearance for 
a period of up to one year.
    (2) The forbearance is renewable, upon request of the borrower, for 
the duration of the period in which the borrower meets the condition 
required for the forbearance.

Sec. 685.206  Borrower responsibilities and defenses.

    (a) The borrower shall give the school the following information as 
part of the origination process for a Direct Subsidized, Direct 
Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan:
    (1) A statement, as described in 34 CFR Part 668, that the loan will 
be used for the cost of the student's attendance.
    (2) Information demonstrating that the borrower is eligible for the 
loan.
    (3) Information concerning the outstanding FFEL Program and Direct 
Loan Program loans of the borrower and, for a parent borrower, of the 
student, including any Federal Consolidation Loan or Direct 
Consolidation Loan.
    (4) A statement authorizing the school to release to the Secretary 
information relevant to the student's eligibility to borrow or to have a 
parent borrow on the student's behalf (e.g., the student's enrollment 
status, financial assistance, and employment records).
    (b)(1) The borrower shall promptly notify the Secretary of any 
change of

[[Page 764]]

name, address, student status to less than half-time, employer, or 
employer's address; and
    (2) The borrower shall promptly notify the school of any change in 
address during enrollment.
    (c) Borrower defenses. (1) In any proceeding to collect on a Direct 
Loan, the borrower may assert as a defense against repayment, any act or 
omission of the school attended by the student that would give rise to a 
cause of action against the school under applicable State law. These 
proceedings include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Tax refund offset proceedings under 34 CFR 30.33.
    (ii) Wage garnishment proceedings under section 488A of the Act.
    (iii) Salary offset proceedings for Federal employees under 34 CFR 
Part 31.
    (iv) Credit bureau reporting proceedings under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f).
    (2) If the borrower's defense against repayment is successful, the 
Secretary notifies the borrower that the borrower is relieved of the 
obligation to repay all or part of the loan and associated costs and 
fees that the borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay. The 
Secretary affords the borrower such further relief as the Secretary 
determines is appropriate under the circumstances. Further relief may 
include, but is not limited to, the following:
    (i) Reimbursing the borrower for amounts paid toward the loan 
voluntarily or through enforced collection.
    (ii) Determining that the borrower is not in default on the loan and 
is eligible to receive assistance under title IV of the Act.
    (iii) Updating reports to credit bureaus to which the Secretary 
previously made adverse credit reports with regard to the borrower's 
Direct Loan.
    (3) The Secretary may initiate an appropriate proceeding to require 
the school whose act or omission resulted in the borrower's successful 
defense against repayment of a Direct Loan to pay to the Secretary the 
amount of the loan to which the defense applies. However, the Secretary 
does not initiate such a proceeding after the period for the retention 
of records described in Sec. 685.309(c) unless the school received 
actual notice of the claim during that period.

Sec. 685.207  Obligation to repay.

    (a) Obligation of repayment in general. (1) A borrower is obligated 
to repay the full amount of a Direct Loan, including the principal 
balance, fees, any collection costs charged under Sec. 685.202(e), and 
any interest not subsidized by the Secretary, unless the borrower is 
relieved of the obligation to repay as provided in this part.
    (2) The borrower's repayment of a Direct Loan may also be subject to 
the deferment provisions in Sec. 685.204, the forbearance provisions in 
Sec. 685.205, and the discharge provisions in Sec. 685.212.
    (b) Direct Subsidized Loan repayment. (1) During the period in which

    (i) The loan entered repayment before the in-school period began; 
and
    (ii) The borrower has not been granted a deferment under 
Sec. 685.204.
    (2)(i) When a borrower ceases to be enrolled at an eligible school

the grace period has been previously exhausted.
    (ii) During a grace period, the borrower is not required to make 
payments on a Direct Subsidized Loan.
    (3) A borrower is not obligated to pay interest on a Direct

    (c) Direct Unsubsidized Loan repayment. (1) During the period in 
which a borrower is enrolled at an eligible

[[Page 765]]

school on at least a half-time basis, the borrower is in an ``in-
school'' period and is not required to make payments of principal on a 
Direct Unsubsidized Loan unless--
    (i) The loan entered repayment before the in-school period began; 
and
    (ii) The borrower has not been granted a deferment under 
Sec. 685.204.
    (2)(i) When a borrower ceases to be enrolled at an eligible school 
on at least a half-time basis, a six-month grace period begins, unless 
the grace period has been previously exhausted.
    (ii) During a grace period, the borrower is not required to make any 
principal payments on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.
    (3) A borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues on a 
Direct Unsubsidized Loan during in-school and grace periods. Interest 
begins to accrue on the day the first installment is disbursed. Interest 
that accrues may be capitalized or paid by the borrower.
    (4) The repayment period for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan begins the 
day after the grace period ends. A borrower is obligated to repay the 
loan under paragraph (a) of this section during the repayment period.
    (d) Direct PLUS Loan repayment. The repayment period for a Direct 
PLUS Loan begins on the day the loan is fully disbursed. Interest begins 
to accrue on the day the first installment is disbursed. A borrower is 
obligated to repay the loan under paragraph (a) of this section during 
the repayment period.
    (e) Direct Consolidation Loan repayment. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, the repayment period for a 
Direct Consolidation Loan begins and interest begins to accrue on the 
day the loan is made. The borrower is obligated to repay the loan under 
paragraph (a) of this section during the repayment period.
    (2) A borrower who obtains a Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan 
during an in-school period will be subject to the repayment provisions 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) A borrower who obtains a Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan 
during an in-school period will be subject to the repayment provisions 
in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Determining the date on which the grace period begins for a 
borrower in a correspondence program. For a borrower of a Direct 
Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan who is a correspondence student, 
the grace period begins on the earliest of the date--
    (1) The borrower completes the program;
    (2) The borrower falls 60 days behind the due date for submission of 
a scheduled assignment, according to the schedule required in 
Sec. 685.302. However, a school may grant the borrower one restoration 
to in-school status if the borrower fails to submit a lesson within this 
60-day period after the due date for submission of a particular 
assignment if, within the 60-day period, the borrower declares, in 
writing, an intention to continue in the program and an understanding 
that the required lessons must be submitted on time; or
    (3) That is 60 days following the latest allowable date established 
by the school for completing the program under the schedule required 
under Sec. 685.302.

    (3) The Secretary may provide an alternative repayment plan in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (4) All Direct Loans obtained by one borrower must be repaid

Direct PLUS Loan or the Direct PLUS Consolidation Loan separately from 
other Direct Loans obtained by that borrower.

[[Page 766]]

    (b) Standard repayment plan. (1) Under the standard repayment plan, 
a borrower shall repay a loan in full within ten years from the date the 
loan entered repayment by making fixed monthly payments.
    (2) Periods of authorized deferment or forbearance are not included 
in the ten-year repayment period.
    (3) A borrower's payments under the standard repayment plan are at 
least $50 per month, except that a borrower's final payment may be less 
than $50.
    (4) The number of payments or the fixed monthly repayment amount may 
be adjusted to reflect changes in the variable interest rate identified 
in Sec. 685.202(a).
    (c) Extended repayment plan. (1) Under the extended repayment plan, 
a borrower shall repay a loan in full by making fixed monthly payments 
within an extended period of time that varies with the total amount of 
the borrower's loans, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Periods of deferment and forbearance are not included in the 
number of years of repayment.
    (3) A borrower makes fixed monthly payments of at least $50, except 
that a borrower's final payment may be less than $50.
    (4) The number of payments or the fixed monthly repayment amount may 
be adjusted to reflect changes in the variable interest rate identified 
in Sec. 685.202(a).
    (d) Graduated repayment plan. (1) Under the graduated repayment 
plan, a borrower shall repay a loan in full by making payments at two or 
more levels within a period of time that varies with the total amount of 
the borrower's loans, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Periods of deferment and forbearance are not included in the 
number of years of repayment.
    (3) The number of payments or the monthly repayment amount may be 
adjusted to reflect changes in the variable interest rate identified in 
Sec. 685.202(a).
    (4) No scheduled payment under the graduated repayment plan may be 
less than the amount of interest accrued on the loan between monthly 
payments, less than 50 percent of the payment amount that would be 
required under the standard repayment plan, or more than 150 percent of 
the payment amount that would be required under the standard repayment 
plan.
    (e) Repayment period for the extended and graduated plans. Under the 
extended and graduated repayment plans, if the total amount of the 
borrower's Direct Loans is--
    (1) Less than $10,000, the borrower shall repay the loans within 12 
years of entering repayment;
    (2) Greater than or equal to $10,000 but less than $20,000, the

    (f) Income contingent repayment plan. (1) Under the income 
contingent repayment plan, a borrower's monthly repayment amount is 
generally based on the total amount of the borrower's Direct Loans, 
family size, and Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) reported by the borrower 
for the most recent year for which the Secretary has obtained income 
information. The borrower's AGI includes the income of the borrower's 
spouse. A borrower shall make payments on a loan until the loan is 
repaid in full or until the loan has been in repayment through the end 
of the income contingent repayment period.
    (2) The regulations in effect at the time a borrower enters 
repayment and selects the income contingent repayment plan or changes 
into the income contingent repayment plan from another plan govern the 
method for determining the borrowers's monthly repayment amount for all 
of the borrower's Direct Loans, unless--
    (i) The Secretary amends the regulations relating to a borrower's 
monthly repayment amount under the income contingent repayment plan; and
    (ii) The borrower submits a written request that the amended 
regulations

[[Page 767]]

apply to the repayment of the borrower's Direct Loans.
    (3) Provisions governing the income contingent repayment plan are 
set out in Sec. 685.209.
    (g) Alternative repayment. (1) The Secretary may provide an 
alternative repayment plan for a borrower who demonstrates to the 
Secretary's satisfaction that the terms and conditions of the repayment 
plans specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section are not 
adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances.
    (2) The Secretary may require a borrower to provide evidence of the 
borrower's exceptional circumstances before permitting the borrower to 
repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan.
    (3) If the Secretary agrees to permit a borrower to repay a loan 
under an alternative repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower 
in writing of the terms of the plan. After the borrower receives 
notification of the terms of the plan, the borrower may accept the plan 
or choose another repayment plan.
    (4) A borrower shall repay a loan under an alternative repayment 
plan within 30 years of the date the loan entered repayment, not 
including periods of deferment and forbearance.
    (5) If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment under an 
alternative repayment plan is less than the accrued interest on the 
loan, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal 
amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. After 
the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original 
principal amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. 
For purposes of this paragraph, the original principal amount is the 
amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.

<R05>
Sec. 685.209  Income contingent repayment plan.

    (a) Repayment amount calculation. (1) The amount the borrower would 
repay is based upon the borrower's Direct Loan debt when the borrower's 
first loan enters repayment, and this basis for calculation does not 
change unless the borrower obtains another Direct Loan or the borrower 
and the borrower's spouse obtain approval to repay their loans jointly 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the borrower obtains another 
Direct Loan, the amount the borrower would repay is based on the 
combined amounts of the loans when the last loan enters repayment. If 
the borrower and the borrower's spouse repay the loans jointly, the 
amount the borrowers would repay is based on both borrowers' Direct Loan 
debts at the time they enter joint repayment.
    (2) The annual amount payable under the income contingent repayment 
plan by a borrower is the lesser of--
    (i) The amount the borrower would repay annually over 12 years using 
standard amortization multiplied by an income percentage factor that 
corresponds to the borrower's adjusted gross income (AGI) as shown in 
the income percentage factor table in Appendix A to this part; or
    (ii) 20 percent of discretionary income.
    (3) For purposes of this section, discretionary income is defined as 
a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the ``HHS Poverty Guidelines for 
all States (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia'' as 
published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services 
on an annual basis.<SUP>1</SUP> For residents of Alaska and Hawaii, 
discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amounts in 
the ``HHS Poverty Guidelines for Alaska'' and the ``HHS Poverty 
Guidelines for Hawaii'' respectively. If a borrower provides 
documentation acceptable to the Secretary that the borrower has more 
than one person in the borrower's family, the Secretary applies the HHS 
Poverty Guidelines for the borrower's family size.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The HHS Poverty Guidelines are available from the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS), Room 438F, Humphrey Building, 200 Independence 
Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) For exact incomes not shown in the income percentage factor 
table in

[[Page 768]]

Appendix A, an income percentage factor is calculated, based upon the 
intervals between the incomes and income percentage factors shown on the 
table.
    (5) Each year, the Secretary recalculates the borrower's annual 
payment amount based on changes in the borrower's AGI, the variable 
interest rate, the income percentage factors in the table in Appendix A, 
and updated HHS Poverty Guidelines (if applicable).
    (6) If a borrower's monthly payment is calculated to be greater than 
$0 but less than or equal to $5.00, the amount payable by the borrower 
shall be $5.00.
    (7) For purposes of the annual recalculation described in paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section, after periods in which a borrower makes payments 
that are less than interest accrued on the loan, the payment amount is 
recalculated based upon unpaid accrued interest and the highest 
outstanding principal loan amount (including amount capitalized) 
calculated for that borrower while paying under the income contingent 
repayment plan.
    (8) For each calendar year after calendar year 1996, the Secretary 
publishes in the Federal Register a revised income percentage factor 
table reflecting changes based on inflation. This revised table is 
developed by changing each of the dollar amounts contained in the table 
by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage changes in the 
Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December 
1995 and the December next preceding the beginning of such calendar 
year.
    (9) Examples of the calculation of monthly repayment amounts and 
tables that show monthly repayment amounts for borrowers at various 
income and debt levels are included in Appendix A to this part.
    (b) Treatment of married borrowers. (1) A married borrower who 
wishes to repay under the income contingent repayment plan and who has 
filed an income tax return separately from his or her spouse must 
provide his or her spouse's written consent to the disclosure of certain 
tax return information under paragraph (c)(5) of this section (unless 
the borrower is separated from his or her spouse). The AGI for both 
spouses is used to calculate the monthly repayment amount.
    (2) Married borrowers may repay their loans jointly. The outstanding 
balances on the loans of each borrower are added together to determine 
the borrowers' payback rate under (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) The amount of the payment applied to each borrower's debt is the 
proportion of the payments that equals the same proportion as that 
borrower's debt to the total outstanding balance, except that the 
payment is credited toward outstanding interest on any loan before any 
payment is credited toward principal.
    (c) Other features of the income contingent repayment plan. (1) 
Alternative documentation of income. If a borrower's AGI is not 
available or if, in the Secretary's opinion, the borrower's reported AGI 
does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, the Secretary 
may use other documentation of income provided by the borrower to 
calculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount.
    (2) First and second year borrowers. The Secretary requires 
alternative documentation of income from borrowers in their first and 
second years of repayment, when in the Secretary's opinion, the 
borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's 
current income.
    (3) Adjustments to repayment obligations. The Secretary may 
determine that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by 
the borrower or the borrower's spouse, warrant an adjustment to the 
borrower's repayment obligations.
    (4) Repayment period. (i) The maximum repayment period under the 
income contingent repayment plan is 25 years.
    (ii) The repayment period includes periods in which the borrower 
makes payments under the standard repayment plan and under extended 
repayment plans in which payments are based on a repayment period that 
is up to 12 years. The repayment period does not include periods in 
which the borrower makes payments under the graduated and alternative 
repayment plans or periods of authorized deferment or forbearance. The 
repayment period

[[Page 769]]

also does not include periods in which the borrower makes payments under 
an extended repayment plan in which payments are based on a repayment 
period that is longer than 12 years.
    (iii) If a borrower repays more than one loan under the income 
contingent repayment plan, a separate repayment period for each loan 
begins when that loan enters repayment.
    (iv) If a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end of the 
25-year repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan, the 
Secretary cancels the unpaid portion of the loan.
    (v) At the beginning of the repayment period under the income 
contingent repayment plan, a borrower shall make monthly payments of the 
amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loans until the 
Secretary calculates the borrower's monthly repayment amount on the 
basis of the borrower's income.
    (5) Limitation on capitalization of interest. If the amount of a 
borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid 
interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is ten 
percent greater than the original principal amount. After the 
outstanding principal amount is ten percent greater than the original 
amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the original amount is the amount owed by 
the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.
    (6) Notification of terms and conditions. When a borrower elects or 
is required by the Secretary to repay a loan under the income contingent 
repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower of the terms and 
conditions of the plan, including--
    (i) That the Internal Revenue Service will disclose certain tax 
return information to the Secretary or the Secretary's agents; and
    (ii) That if the borrower believes that special circumstances 
warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations, as 
described in Sec. 685.209(c)(3), the borrower may contact the Secretary 
and obtain the Secretary's determination as to whether an adjustment is 
appropriate.
    (7) Consent to disclosure of tax return information. (i) A borrower 
shall provide written consent to the disclosure of certain tax return 
information by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to agents of the 
Secretary for purposes of calculating a monthly repayment amount and 
servicing and collecting a loan under the income contingent repayment 
plan. The borrower shall provide consent by signing a consent form, 
developed consistent with 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1 and provided to the 
borrower by the Secretary, and shall return the signed form to the 
Secretary.
    (ii) The borrower shall consent to disclosure of the borrower's 
taxpayer identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(b)(6), tax 
filing status, and AGI.
    (iii) The borrower shall provide consent for a period of five years 
from the date the borrower signs the consent form. The Secretary 
provides the borrower a new consent form before that period expires. The 
IRS does not disclose tax return information after the IRS has processed 
a borrower's withdrawal of consent.
    (iv) The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a 
borrower who selects the income contingent repayment plan but--
    (A) Fails to provide the required written consent;
    (B) Fails to renew written consent upon the expiration of the five-
year period for consent; or
    (C) Withdraws consent and does not select another repayment plan.
    (v) If a borrower defaults and the Secretary designates the income 
contingent repayment plan for the borrower but the borrower fails to 
provide the required written consent, the Secretary mails a notice to 
the borrower establishing a repayment schedule for the borrower.

Sec. 685.210  Choice of repayment plan.

    (a) Initial selection of a repayment plan. (1) Before a Direct Loan 
enters

[[Page 770]]

into repayment, the Secretary provides the borrower a description of the 
available repayment plans and requests the borrower to select one. A 
borrower may select a repayment plan before the loan enters repayment by 
notifying the Secretary of the borrower's selection in writing.
    (2) If a borrower does not select a repayment plan, the Secretary 
designates the standard repayment plan described in Sec. 685.208(b) for 
the borrower.
    (b) Changing repayment plans. (1) A borrower may change repayment 
plans at any time after the loan has entered repayment by notifying the 
Secretary. However, a borrower who is repaying a defaulted loan under 
the income contingent repayment plan under Sec. 685.211(c)(3)(ii) may 
not change to another repayment plan unless--
    (i) The borrower was required to and did make a payment under the 
income contingent repayment plan in each of the prior three (3) months; 
or
    (ii) The borrower was not required to make payments but made three 
reasonable and affordable payments in each of the prior three months; 
and
    (iii) The borrower makes and the Secretary approves a request to 
change plans.
    (2)(i) A borrower may not change to a repayment plan that has a 
maximum repayment period of less than the number of years the loan has 
already been in repayment, except that a borrower may change to the 
income contingent repayment plan at any time.
    (ii) If a borrower changes plans, the repayment period is the period 
provided under the borrower's new repayment plan, calculated from the 
date the loan initially entered repayment. However, if a borrower 
changes to the income contingent repayment plan, the repayment period is 
calculated as described in Sec. 685.209(d)(2).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.)


<R05>
Sec. 685.211  Miscellaneous repayment provisions.

    (a) Payment application and prepayment. (1) The Secretary applies 
any payment first to any accrued charges and collection costs, then to 
any outstanding interest, and then to outstanding principal.
    (2) A borrower may prepay all or part of a loan at any time without 
penalty. If a borrower pays any amount in excess of the amount due, the 
excess amount is a prepayment.
    (3) If a prepayment equals or exceeds the monthly repayment amount 
under the borrower's repayment plan, the Secretary--
    (i) Applies the prepaid amount according to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section;
    (ii) Advances the due date of the next payment unless the borrower 
requests otherwise; and
    (iii) Notifies the borrower of any revised due date for the next 
payment.
    (4) If a prepayment is less than the monthly repayment amount, the 
Secretary applies the prepayment according to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) Refunds from schools. The Secretary applies any refund due to a 
borrower that the Secretary receives from a school under Sec. 668.22 
against the borrower's outstanding principal and notifies the borrower 
of the refund.
    (c) Default. (1) Acceleration. If a borrower defaults on a Direct 
Loan, the entire unpaid balance and accrued interest are immediately due 
and payable.
    (2) Collection charges. If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, the 
Secretary assesses collection charges in accordance with 
Sec. 685.202(e).
    (3) Collection of a defaulted loan. (i) The Secretary may take any 
action authorized by law to collect a defaulted Direct Loan including, 
but not limited to, filing a lawsuit against the borrower, reporting the 
default to national credit bureaus, requesting the Internal Revenue 
Service to offset the borrower's Federal income tax refund, and 
garnishing the borrower's wages.
    (ii) If a borrower defaults on a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan or a Direct 
Subsidized Consolidation Loan, the Secretary may designate the income 
contingent repayment plan for the borrower.
    (d) Ineligible borrowers. (1) The Secretary determines that a 
borrower is ineligible if, at the time the loan was made and without the 
school's or the Secretary's knowledge, the borrower

[[Page 771]]

(or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) provided false or 
erroneous information or took actions that caused the borrower or 
student--
    (i) To receive a loan for which the borrower is wholly or partially 
ineligible;
    (ii) To receive interest benefits for which the borrower was 
ineligible; or
    (iii) To receive loan proceeds for a period of enrollment for which 
the borrower was not eligible.
    (2) If the Secretary makes the determination described in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, the Secretary sends an ineligible borrower a 
demand letter that requires the borrower to repay some or all of a loan, 
as appropriate. The demand letter requires that within 30 days from the 
date the letter is mailed, the borrower repay any principal amount for 
which the borrower is ineligible and any accrued interest, including 
interest subsidized by the Secretary, through the previous quarter.
    (3) If a borrower fails to comply with the demand letter described 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the borrower is in default on the 
entire loan.
    (4) A borrower may not consolidate a loan under Sec. 685.215 for 
which the borrower is wholly or partially ineligible.
    (e) Rehabilitation of defaulted loans. A defaulted Direct Loan is 
rehabilitated if the borrower makes 12 consecutive on-time, reasonable, 
and affordable monthly payments. The amount of such a payment is 
determined on the basis of the borrower's total financial circumstances. 
If a defaulted loan is rehabilitated, the Secretary instructs any credit 
bureau to which the default was reported to remove the default from the 
borrower's credit history.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.)


<R05>
Sec. 685.212  Discharge of a loan obligation.

    (a) Death. If the Secretary receives acceptable documentation that a 
borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) has died, 
the Secretary discharges the obligation of the borrower and any endorser 
to make any further payments on the loan.
    (b) Total and permanent disability. If the Secretary receives 
acceptable documentation that a borrower has become totally and 
permanently disabled, the Secretary discharges the obligation of the 
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan. A 
borrower is not considered totally and permanently disabled based on a 
condition that existed at the time the borrower applied for the loan 
unless the borrower's condition substantially deteriorated after the 
loan was made so as to render the borrower totally and permanently 
disabled.
    (c) Bankruptcy. If a borrower's obligation to repay a loan is 
discharged in bankruptcy, the Secretary does not require the borrower to 
make any further payments on the loan.
    (d) Closed schools. If a borrower meets the requirements in 
Sec. 685.213, the Secretary discharges the obligation of the borrower 
and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan.
    (e) False certification and unauthorized disbursement. If a borrower 
meets the requirements in Sec. 685.214, the Secretary discharges the 
obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments 
on the loan.
    (f) Payments received after eligibility for discharge. Upon receipt 
of acceptable documentation and approval of the discharge request, the 
Secretary returns to the sender, or, for a discharge based on death, the 
borrower's estate, those payments received after the date that the 
eligibility requirements for discharge were met but prior to the date 
the discharge was approved. The Secretary also returns any payments 
received after the date the discharge was approved.
    (g) Loan forgiveness demonstration program. If funds are 
appropriated for the loan forgiveness demonstration program authorized 
by section 428J of the Act, the Secretary follows the procedures and 
applies the standards in 34 CFR 682.215 for borrowers under the Direct 
Loan Program.

Sec. 685.213  Closed school discharge.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary discharges the borrower's (and any 
endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the 
provisions of this section if the borrower (or the

[[Page 772]]

student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) did not complete the program 
of study for which the loan was made because the school at which the 
borrower (or student) was enrolled closed, as described in paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this section--
    (i) A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to 
provide educational instruction in all programs, as determined by the 
Secretary; and
    (ii) ``School'' means a school's main campus or any location or 
branch of the main campus.
    (b) Relief pursuant to discharge. (1) Discharge under this section 
relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the 
loan and any accrued charges or collection costs with respect to the 
loan.
    (2) The discharge of a loan under this section qualifies the 
borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through 
enforced collection on the loan.
    (3) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a 
loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after 
discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under 
programs authorized by title IV of the Act.
    (4) The Secretary reports the discharge of a loan under this section 
to all credit reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously 
reported the status of the loan.
    (c) Borrower qualification for discharge. In order to qualify for 
discharge of a loan under this section, a borrower shall submit to the 
Secretary a written request and sworn statement, and the factual 
assertions in the statement must be true. The statement need not be 
notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In 
the statement, the borrower shall--
    (1) State that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent 
borrowed)--
    (i) Received the proceeds of a loan to attend a school;
    (ii) Did not complete the program of study at that school because 
the school closed while the student was enrolled, or the student 
withdrew from the school not more than 90 days before the school closed 
(or longer in exceptional circumstances); and
    (iii) Did not complete the program of study through a teach-out at 
another school or by transferring academic credits or hours earned at 
the closed school to another school;
    (2) State whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with 
respect to the school's closing with any third party, such as the holder 
of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the 
amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited 
to the borrower's loan obligation; and
    (3) State that the borrower (or student)--
    (i) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other 
documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates 
that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this 
section; and
    (ii) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions 
in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and to transfer any 
right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary in accordance 
with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Cooperation by borrower in enforcement actions. (1) In order to 
obtain a discharge under this section, a borrower shall cooperate with 
the Secretary in any judicial or administrative proceeding brought by 
the Secretary to recover amounts discharged or to take other enforcement 
action with respect to the conduct on which the discharge was based. At 
the request of the Secretary and upon the Secretary's tendering to the 
borrower the fees and costs that are customarily provided in litigation 
to reimburse witnesses, the borrower shall--
    (i) Provide testimony regarding any representation made by the 
borrower to support a request for discharge;
    (ii) Produce any documents reasonably available to the borrower with 
respect to those representations; and
    (iii) If required by the Secretary, provide a sworn statement 
regarding those documents and representations.
    (2) The Secretary denies the request for a discharge or revokes the 
discharge of a borrower who--

[[Page 773]]

    (i) Fails to provide the testimony, documents, or a sworn statement 
required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
    (ii) Provides testimony, documents, or a sworn statement that does 
not support the material representations made by the borrower to obtain 
the discharge.
    (e) Transfer to the Secretary of borrower's right of recovery 
against third parties. (1) Upon discharge under this section, the 
borrower is deemed to have assigned to and relinquished in favor of the 
Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that 
the borrower (or student) may have by contract or applicable law with 
respect to the loan or the enrollment agreement for the program for 
which the loan was received, against the school, its principals, its 
affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any private fund, 
including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received 
from a private party.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding any 
provision of State law that would otherwise restrict transfer of those 
rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a transferee from 
exercising those rights, or establish procedures or a scheme of 
distribution that would prejudice the Secretary's ability to recover on 
those rights.
    (3) Nothing in this section limits or forecloses the borrower's (or 
student's) right to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes 
arising from matters unrelated to the discharged Direct Loan.
    (f) Discharge procedures. (1) After confirming the date of a 
school's closure, the Secretary identifies any Direct Loan borrower (or 
student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) who appears to have been 
enrolled at the school on the school closure date or to have withdrawn 
not more than 90 days prior to the closure date.
    (2) If the borrower's current address is known, the Secretary mails 
the borrower a discharge application and an explanation of the 
qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary 
also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any 
affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.
    (3) If the borrower's current address is unknown, the Secretary 
attempts to locate the borrower and determines the borrower's potential 
eligibility for a discharge under this section by consulting with 
representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, the 
school's accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties. If the 
Secretary learns the new address of a borrower, the Secretary mails to 
the borrower a discharge application and explanation and suspends 
collection, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (4) If a borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of 
the Secretary's mailing the discharge application, the Secretary resumes 
collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the 
period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may 
capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (5) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a 
discharge meets the qualifications for a discharge, the Secretary 
notifies the borrower in writing of that determination.
    (6) If the Secretary determines that a borrower who requests a 
discharge does not meet the qualifications for a discharge, the 
Secretary notifies that borrower in writing of that determination and 
the reasons for the determination.

<R05>
Sec. 685.214  Discharge for false certification of student eligibility or unauthorized payment.

    (a) Basis for discharge. (1) False certification. The Secretary 
discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a 
Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if a 
school falsely certifies the eligibility of the borrower (or the student 
on whose behalf a parent borrowed) to receive the loan. The Secretary 
considers a student's eligibility to borrow to have

[[Page 774]]

been falsely certified by the school if the school--
    (i) Certified the student's eligibility for a Direct Loan on the 
basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did not 
meet the eligibility requirements described in 34 CFR part 668 and 
section 484(d) of the Act, as applicable;
    (ii) Signed the borrower's name on the loan application or 
promissory note without the borrower's authorization; or
    (iii) Certified the eligibility of a student who, because of a 
physical or mental condition, age, criminal record, or other reason 
accepted by the Secretary, would not meet the requirements for 
employment (in the student's State of residence when the loan was 
originated) in the occupation for which the training program supported 
by the loan was intended.
    (2) Unauthorized payment. The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and 
any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan if the school, without 
the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or 
signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, 
unless the proceeds of the loan were delivered to the student or applied 
to charges owed by the student to the school.
    (b) Relief pursuant to discharge. (1) Discharge for false 
certification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section relieves the 
borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any 
accrued charges and collection costs with respect to the loan.
    (2) Discharge for unauthorized payment under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section relieves the borrower of the obligation to repay the amount 
of the payment discharged.
    (3) The discharge under this section qualifies the borrower for 
reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection 
on the discharged loan or payment.
    (4) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a 
loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after 
discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under 
programs authorized by title IV of the Act.
    (5) The Secretary reports the discharge under this section to all 
credit reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the 
status of the loan.
    (c) Borrower qualification for discharge. In order to qualify for 
discharge under this section, the borrower shall submit to the Secretary 
a written request and a sworn statement, and the factual assertions in 
the statement must be true. The statement need not be notarized but must 
be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the 
borrower shall meet the requirements in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) 
of this section.
    (1) Ability to benefit. In the case of a borrower requesting a 
discharge based on the school's defective testing of the student's 
ability to benefit, the borrower shall state that the borrower (or the 
student on whose behalf a parent borrowed)--
    (i) Received a disbursement of a loan to attend a school;
    (ii) Received a Direct Loan at that school on the basis of an 
ability to benefit from the school's training and did not meet the 
eligibility requirements described in 34 CFR Part 668 and section 484(d) 
of the Act, as applicable; and
    (iii) Either--
    (A) Withdrew from the school and did not find employment in the 
occupation for which the training program was intended; or
    (B) Completed the training program for which the loan was made, made 
reasonable attempts to obtain employment in the occupation for which the 
program was intended, and was not able to find employment in that 
occupation or obtained employment in that occupation only after 
receiving additional training that was not provided by the school that 
originated the loan.
    (2) Unauthorized loan. In the case of a borrower requesting a 
discharge because the school signed the borrower's name on the loan 
application or promissory note without the borrower's authorization, the 
borrower shall--
    (i) State that he or she did not sign the document in question or 
authorize the school to do so; and
    (ii) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two 
of which

[[Page 775]]

must be within one year before or after the date of the contested 
signature.
    (3) Unauthorized payment. In the case of a borrower requesting a 
discharge because the school, without the borrower's authorization, 
endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's 
authorization for electronic funds transfer, the borrower shall--
    (i) State that he or she did not endorse the loan check or sign the 
authorization for electronic funds transfer or authorize the school to 
do so;
    (ii) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two 
of which must be within one year before or after the date of the 
contested signature;
    (iii) State that the proceeds of the contested disbursement were not 
delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to 
the school.
    (4) Claim to third party. The borrower shall state whether the 
borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's 
false certification or unauthorized payment with any third party, such 
as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, 
if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) 
or credited to the borrower's loan obligation.
    (5) Cooperation with Secretary. The borrower shall state that the 
borrower (or student)--
    (i) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other 
documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates 
that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this 
section; and
    (ii) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions 
as described in Sec. 685.213(d) and to transfer any right to recovery 
against a third party to the Secretary as described in Sec. 685.213(e).
    (d) Discharge procedures. (1) If the Secretary determines that a 
borrower's Direct Loan may be eligible for a discharge under this 
section, the Secretary mails the borrower a disclosure application and 
an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a 
discharge. The Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect 
from the borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to 
receive borrower payments.
    (2) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn 
statement described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of 
the Secretary's mailing the disclosure application, the Secretary 
resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for 
the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may 
capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.
    (3) If the borrower submits the written request and sworn statement 
described in paragraph (c) of the section, the Secretary determines 
whether to grant a request for discharge under this section by reviewing 
the request and sworn statement in light of information available from 
the Secretary's records and from other sources, including guaranty 
agencies, State authorities, and cognizant accrediting associations.
    (4) If the Secretary determines that the borrower meets the 
applicable requirements for a discharge under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that 
determination.
    (5) If the Secretary determines that the borrower does not qualify 
for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that 
determination and the reasons for the determination.

Direct Consolidation Loan a repayment schedule before the borrower's 
first payment is due. The repayment schedule identifies the borrower's 
monthly repayment amount under the repayment plan selected.

Loan under Sec. 685.204, both borrowers shall meet the requirements of 
that section.

Consolidation Loan under Sec. 685.205, both borrowers shall meet the

Direct Consolidation Loan and the borrower's spouse does not meet the 
requirements for any type of discharge described in Sec. 685.212, the 
Secretary discharges a portion of the consolidation loan equal to the 
amount of the loan that would have been eligible for discharge under the 
provisions of Sec. 685.212(d) or (e), as applicable.

electronic loan origination record.
    (6) A school may refuse to originate a Direct Subsidized, Direct

<R05>
Sec. 685.303  Processing loan proceeds.

    (a) Purpose. This section establishes rules governing a school's 
processing of

[[Page 782]]

a borrower's Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct PLUS Loan 
proceeds. The school shall also comply with any rules for processing 
loan proceeds contained in 34 CFR Part 668.
    (b) General--(1)(i) A school that initiates the drawdown of funds. A 
school may not disburse loan proceeds to a borrower unless the school 
has obtained an executed, legally enforceable promissory note from the 
borrower.
    (ii) A school that does not initiate the drawdown of funds. A school 
may disburse loan proceeds only to a borrower for whom the school has 
received funds from the Secretary.
    (2)(i) Except in the case of a late disbursement under paragraph (d) 
of this section, or as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this 
section, a school may disburse loan proceeds only to a student, or a 
parent in the case of a PLUS Loan, if the school determines the student 
has continuously maintained eligibility in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 685.200 from the beginning of the loan period 
described in the promissory note.
    (ii) In the event a student delays attending school for a period of 
time, the school may consider that student to have maintained 
eligibility for the loan from the first day of the period of enrollment. 
However, the school must comply with the requirements under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section.
    (iii) If, after a school makes the first disbursement to a borrower, 
the student becomes ineligible due solely to the school's loss of 
eligibility to participate in the title IV programs or the Direct Loan 
Program, the school may make subsequent disbursements to the borrower as 
permitted by 34 CFR Part 668.
    (iv) If, prior to making any disbursement to a borrower, the student 
temporarily ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis, the 
school may make a disbursement and any subsequent disbursement to the 
student if the school determines and documents in the student's file--
    (A) That the student has resumed enrollment on at least a half-time 
basis;
    (B) The student's revised cost of attendance; and
    (C) That the student continues to qualify for the entire amount of 
the loan, notwithstanding any reduction in the student's cost of 
attendance caused by the student's temporary cessation of enrollment on 
at least a half-time basis.
    (3) If a registered student withdraws or is expelled prior to the 
first day of classes of the period of enrollment for which the loan is 
made, or fails to attend school during that period, or if the school is 
unable for any other reason to document that the student attended school 
during that period, the school shall notify the Secretary, within 30 
days of the date described in Sec. 685.305(a), of the student's 
withdrawal, expulsion, or failure to attend school, as applicable, and 
return to the Secretary--
    (i) Any loan proceeds credited by the school to the student's 
account; and
    (ii) The amount of payments made by the student to the school, to 
the extent that they do not exceed the amount of any loan proceeds 
disbursed by the school to the student.
    (4) If a student is enrolled in the first year of an undergraduate 
program of study and has not previously received a Federal Stafford, 
Federal Supplemental Loans for Students, Direct Subsidized, or Direct 
Unsubsidized Loan, a school may not disburse the proceeds of a Direct 
Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan until 30 days after the first day 
of the student's program of study.
    (c) Processing of the proceeds of a Direct Loan. Schools shall 
follow the procedures for disbursing funds in 34 CFR 668.164.
    (d) Late Disbursement. A school may make a late disbursement 
according to the provisions found under 34 CFR 668.164(g).
    (e) Treatment of excess loan proceeds. Before the disbursement of 
any Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan proceeds, if a school 
learns that the borrower will receive or has received financial aid for 
the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended that exceeds 
the amount of assistance for which the student is eligible, the school 
shall reduce or eliminate the overaward by either--
    (1) Using the student's Direct Unsubsidized, Direct PLUS, or State-
sponsored or another non-Federal loan

[[Page 783]]

to cover the expected family contribution, if not already done; or
    (2) Reducing one or more subsequent disbursements to eliminate the 
overaward.

Unsubsidized, Federal Stafford, Federal Unsubsidized Stafford, or 
Federal SLS Loan.
    (2) The counseling must be in person, by audiovisual presentation, 
or by computer-assisted technology. In each case, the school shall 
ensure that an individual with knowledge of the title IV programs is 
reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the 
borrower's questions regarding those programs. In the case of a student 
enrolled in a correspondence program or a study-abroad program approved 
for credit at the home school, the school shall provide the borrower 
with written counseling materials by mail prior to disbursing the loan

repayment obligation the borrower is assuming;
    (ii) Describe in forceful terms the likely consequences of default, 
including adverse credit reports, garnishment of wages, and litigation;
    (iii) Provide the borrower with general information with respect to 
the average indebtedness of students who have obtained Direct Subsidized

appendix D to 34 CFR Part 668.
    (5) A school may adopt an alternative approach for initial 
counseling as part of the school's quality assurance plan described in 
Sec. 685.300(b)(9). If a school adopts an alternative approach, it is 
not required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)-(3) of this 
section unless the Secretary determines that the alternative approach is 
not adequate for the school. The alternative approach must--
    (i) Ensure that each borrower subject to initial counseling under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section is provided written counseling 
materials that contain the information described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section;
    (ii) Be designed to target those students who are most likely to 
default on their repayment obligations and provide them more intensive 
counseling and support services; and
    (iii) Include performance measures that demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the school's alternative approach. These performance 
measures must include objective outcomes, such as levels of borrowing, 
default rates, and withdrawal rates.
    (b) Exit counseling. (1) A school shall conduct in-person exit 
counseling with each Direct Subsidized or Direct Unsubsidized Loan 
borrower shortly before the borrower ceases at least half-time study at

provide the borrower with written counseling materials by mail within 30 
days after the borrower completes the program; and

prior knowledge or fails to attend an exit counseling session as 
scheduled, the school shall mail written counseling

[[Page 784]]

materials to the borrower at the borrower's last known address within 30 
days after the school learns that the borrower has withdrawn from school 
or failed to attend the scheduled session.
    (2) In conducting the exit counseling, the school shall--
    (i) Inform the student of the average anticipated monthly repayment 
amount based on the student's indebtedness;
    (ii) Review for the borrower available repayment options including 
the standard repayment, extended repayment, graduated repayment, and 
income contingent repayment plans, and loan consolidation;
    (iii) Provide options to the borrower concerning those debt-
management strategies that the school determines would facilitate 
repayment by the borrower;
    (iv) Explain to the borrower how to contact the party servicing the 
student's Direct Loans;
    (v) Meet the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) and 
(ii) of this section;
    (vi) Review with the borrower the conditions under which the 
borrower may defer repayment or obtain cancellation of a loan; and
    (vii) Require the borrower to provide corrections to the school's

and address of the borrower's expected employer (if known). The school 
shall provide this information to the Secretary within 60 days.
    (3) Additional matters that the Secretary recommends that a school 
include in the exit counseling session or materials are set forth in 
appendix D to 34 CFR Part 668.
    (4) The school shall maintain in the student borrower's file 
documentation substantiating the school's compliance with paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section as to that borrower.

shall follow the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22(j) for determining the 
student's date of withdrawal.
    (b) For a student who does not return for the next scheduled term 
following a summer break, which includes any summer term(s) in which 
classes are offered but students are not generally required to attend, a 
school shall follow the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22(j) for determining 
the student's date of withdrawal except that the school must determine 
the student's date of withdrawal no later than 30 days after the start 
of the next scheduled term.

    (1) To the extent possible, selects schools that are reasonably 
representative of the schools that are participating in the FFEL Program 
in terms of anticipated loan volume, length of academic program, control 
of the school, highest degree offered, size of student enrollment, 
geographic location, annual loan volume, and default experience; and
    (2) In order to ensure an expeditious but orderly transition from 
the FFEL Program to the Direct Loan Program, selects schools that the 
Secretary believes will make the transition as smooth as possible.

    (A) Those debts are being repaid under or in accordance with a 
repayment arrangement satisfactory to the Federal Government; or

[[Page 787]]

    (B) The Secretary determines that the existence or amount of the 
debts has not been finally determined by the cognizant Federal agency.
    (3) A school that meets the criteria to originate loans may 
participate under school origination option 1 or 2 or under standard 
origination.
    (b) Change in origination status. (1) After the initial 
determination of a school's origination status, the Secretary may allow 
a school that does not qualify to originate loans under either 
origination option 1 or origination option 2 to do so if the Secretary 
determines that the school is fully capable of originating loans under 
one of those options.
    (2)(i) At any time after the initial determination of a school's 
origination status, a school participating under origination option 2 
may request to change to origination option 1 or standard origination, 
and a school participating under origination option 1 may request to 
change to standard origination.
    (ii) The change in origination status becomes effective when the 
school receives notice of the Secretary's approval, unless the Secretary 
specifies a later date.
    (3)(i) A school participating under origination option 1 may apply 
to participate under option 2, and a school participating in standard 
origination may apply to participate under either origination option 1 
or 2 after one full year of participation in its initial origination 
status.
    (ii) Applications to participate under another origination option 
are considered on an annual basis.
    (iii) An application to participate under another origination option 
is evaluated on the basis of criteria and performance standards 
established by the Secretary, including but not limited to--
    (A) Eligibility under paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
    (B) Timely submission of accurate origination and disbursement 
records;
    (C) Successful completion of reconciliation on a monthly basis; and
    (D) Timely submission of completed and signed promissory notes, if 
applicable.
    (iv) The change in origination status becomes effective when the 
school receives notice of the Secretary's approval, unless the Secretary 
specifies a later date.
    (c) Secretarial determination of change in origination status. (1) 
At any time after a school has been approved to originate loans, the 
Secretary may require a school participating under origination option 2 
to convert to option 1 or to standard origination and may require a 
school participating under origination option 1 to convert to standard 
origination.
    (2) The Secretary may require a school to change origination status 
if the Secretary determines that such a change is necessary to ensure 
program integrity or if the school fails to meet the criteria and 
performance standards established by the Secretary, including but not 
limited to--
    (i) For an origination option 1 school, eligibility under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the timely submission of completed and signed 
promissory notes and accurate origination and disbursement records, and 
the successful completion of reconciliation on a monthly basis; and
    (ii) For an origination option 2 school, the criteria and 
performance standards required of origination option 1 schools and 
accurate and timely drawdown requests.
    (3) The change in origination status becomes effective when the 
school receives notice of the Secretary's approval, unless the Secretary 
specifies a later date.
    (d) Origination by consortia. A consortium of schools may 
participate under origination options 1 or 2 only if all members of the 
consortium are eligible to participate under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. All provisions of this section that apply to an individual 
school apply to a consortium.
    (e) School determination of change of Servicer. (1) The Secretary 
assigns one or more Servicers to work with a school to perform certain 
functions relating to the origination and servicing of Direct Loans.
    (2) A school may request the Secretary to designate a different 
Servicer. Documentation of the unsatisfactory performance of the 
school's

[[Page 788]]

current Servicer must accompany the request. The Servicer requested must 
be one of those approved by the Secretary for participation in the 
Direct Loan Program.
    (3) The Secretary grants the request if the Secretary determines 
that--
    (i) The claim of unsatisfactory performance is accurate and 
substantial; and
    (ii) The Servicer requested by the school can accommodate such a 
change.
    (4) If the Secretary denies the school's request based on a 
determination under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the school may 
request another Servicer.
    (5) The change in Servicer is effective when the school receives 
notice of the Secretary's approval, unless the Secretary specifies a 
later date.

           Appendix A to Part 685--Income Contingent Repayment

        Examples of the Calculation of Monthly Repayment Amounts

    Example 1. A single borrower with $12,500 of Direct Loans, 8.25 
percent interest rate, and an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $22,791.
    Step 1: Determine annual payments based on what the borrower would 
pay over 12 years using standard amortization. To do this, multiply the 
principal balance by the constant multiplier for 8.25 percent interest 
(0.1315452). The constant multiplier is a factor used to calculate 
amortized payments at a given interest rate over a fixed period of time. 
(See the constant multiplier chart below to determine the constant 
multiplier you should use for the interest rate on the loan. If the 
exact interest rate is not listed, use the next highest for estimation 
purposes.)

<box> 0.1315452 x 12,500=1,644.315

    Step 2: Multiply the result by the income percentage factor shown in 
the income percentage factor table that corresponds to the borrower's 
income (if the income is not listed, you can calculate the applicable 
income percentage factor by following the instructions under the 
interpolation heading below):

<box> 80.33% (0.8033) x 1,644.315=1,320.8782

    Step 3: Determine 20 percent of discretionary income. For a single 
borrower, subtract the poverty level for a family of one, as published 
in the Federal Register on March 10, 1997 (62 FR 10856), from the 
borrower's income and multiply the result by 20%:

<box> $22,791--$7,890=$14,901
<box> $14,901 x 0.20=$2,980.20

    Step 4: Compare the amount from step 2 with the amount from step 3. 
The lower of the two will be the borrower's annual payment amount. This 
borrower will be paying the amount calculated under step 2. To determine 
the monthly repayment amount, divide the annual amount by 12.

<box> 1,320.8782<divide>12=$110.07

    Example 2. Married borrowers repaying jointly under the income 
contingent repayment plan with a combined AGI of $28,627. The husband 
has a Direct Loan balance of $5,000, and the wife has a Direct Loan 
balance of $15,000. The interest rate is 8.25 percent. This couple has 
no children.
    Step 1: Add the Direct Loan balances of the husband and wife 
together to determine the aggregate loan balance.

<box> $5,000+$15,000=$20,000

    Step 2 Determine the annual payments based on what the couple would 
pay over 12 years using standard amortization. To do this, multiply the 
aggregate principal balance by the constant multiplier for 8.25 percent 
interest (0.1315452). (See the constant multiplier chart to determine 
the constant multiplier you should use for the interest rate on the 
loan. If the exact interest rate is not listed, choose the next highest 
rate for estimation purposes.)

<box> 0.1315452 x 20,000=2,630.904

    Step 3 Multiply the result by the income percentage factor shown in 
the income percentage factor table that corresponds to the couple's 
income (if the income is not listed, you can calculate the applicable 
income percentage factor by following the instructions under the 
interpolation heading below):

<box> 87.61% (0.8761) x 2,630.904=2,304.9350

    Step 4 Determine 20 percent of the couple's discretionary income. To 
do this, subtract the HHS poverty level for a family of 2, as published 
in the Federal Register on March 10, 1997 (62 FR 10856), from the 
couple's income and multiply the result by 20 percent:

<box> $28,627--$10,610=$18,017
<box> $18,017 x 0.20=$3,603.40

    Step 5 Compare the amount from step 3 with the amount from step 4. 
The lower of the two will be the annual payment amount. The married 
borrowers will be paying the amount calculated under step 3. To 
determine the monthly repayment amount, divide the annual amount by 12.

<box> 2,304.9350<divide>12=$192.08

    Interpolation: If your income does not appear on the income 
percentage factor table, you will have to calculate the income 
percentage factor through interpolation. For example, assume you are 
single and your income is $26,000. To interpolate, you must

[[Page 789]]

first find the interval between the closest income listed that is less 
than $26,000 and the closest income listed that is greater than $26,000 
(for this discussion, we'll call the result ``the income interval''):

<box> $28,627--$22,791=$5,836

Next, find the interval between the two income percentage factors that 
are given for these incomes (for this discussion, we'll call the result, 
the ``income percentage factor interval''):

<box> 88.77--80.33=8.44
Subtract the income shown on the chart that is immediately less than 
$26,000 from $26,000:

<box> $26,000-$22,791=$3,209

Divide the result by the number representing the income interval:

<box> $3,209<divide>$5,836=0.5499

Multiply the result by the income percentage factor interval:

<box> 0.5499 x 8.44=4.64

Add the result to the lower income percentage factor used to calculate 
the income percentage factor interval for $26,000 in income:

<box> 4.64+80.33=84.97%

The result is the income percentage factor that will be used to 
calculate the monthly repayment amount under the income contingent 
repayment plan.

<R05>
Sec. 690.8  Enrollment status for students taking regular and correspondence courses.

    (a) If, in addition to regular coursework, a student takes 
correspondence courses from either his or her own institution or another 
institution having an agreement for this purpose with the student's 
institution, the correspondence work may be included in determining the 
student's enrollment status to the extent permitted under paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
correspondence work that may be included in determining a student's 
enrollment status is that amount of work which--
    (1) Applies toward a student's degree or certificate or is remedial 
work taken by the student to help in his or her course of study;
    (2) Is completed within the period of time required for regular 
course work; and
    (3) does not exceed the amount of a student's regular course work 
for the payment period for which the student's enrollment status is 
being calculated.
    (c)(1) Notwithstanding the limitation in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, a student who would be a half-time student based solely on his 
or her correspondence work is considered a half-time student unless the 
calculation in paragraph (b) of this section produces an enrollment 
status greater than half-time.

Sec. 690.65  Transfer student: attendance at more than one institution during an award year.

    (a) If a student who receives a Federal Pell Grant at one 
institution subsequently enrolls at a second institution in the same 
award year, the student may receive a Federal Pell Grant at the second 
institution only if--
    (1) The student submits a valid SAR to the second institution; or
    (2) The second institution obtains a valid ISIR.
    (b) The second institution shall calculate the student's award 
according to Sec. 690.63.
    (c) The second institution may pay a Federal Pell Grant only for 
that portion of the academic year in which a student is enrolled at that 
institution. The grant amount must be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure 
that the grant does not exceed the student's Scheduled Federal Pell 
Grant for that award year except as provided under Sec. 690.67.
    (d) If a student's Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the second 
institution differs from the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the first 
institution, the grant amount at the second institution is calculated as 
follows--
    (1) The amount received at the first institution is compared to the 
Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the first institution to determine the 
percentage of the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant that the student has 
received.
    (2) That percentage is subtracted from 100 percent.
    (3) The remaining percentage is the percentage of the Scheduled 
Federal Pell Grant at the second institution to which the student is 
entitled.
    (e) The student's Federal Pell Grant for each payment period is 
calculated according to the procedures in Sec. 690.63 unless the 
remaining percentage of the Scheduled Federal Pell Grant at the second 
institution, referred to in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, is less 
than the amount the student would normally receive for that payment 
period. In that case, the student's Federal Pell Grant is equal to that 
remaining percentage.
    (f) A transfer student shall repay any amount received in an award 
year that exceeds--

[[Page 803]]

    (1) His or her Scheduled Federal Pell Grant; or

    (3) A payment for a payment period is calculated using the formula 
in Sec. 690.63(d) except that paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section 
are used in lieu of Sec. 690.63(d) (1) and (2) respectively; and

account any changes in the cost of attendance. If such a policy is 
established, it must apply to all students.
    (ii) If a student's projected enrollment status changes during a 
payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her 
classes for that payment period, the institution shall recalculate the

student actually began attendance.
    (c) Change in cost of attendance. If the student's cost of 
attendance changes at any time during the award year and his or her 
enrollment status remains the same, the institution may (but is not 
required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the 
payment period is recalculated. If such a policy is established, it must 
apply to all students.

institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the 
institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with this 
part but has not received credit or payment for those grants, the 
institution may receive payment or a reduction in accountability for 
those grants in accordance with paragraphs (d)(4) and either (d)(2) or 
(d)(3) of this section.
    (2) The institution must demonstrate that it qualifies for a credit 
or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit report of an 
award year that was the first audit of that award year and that was 
conducted after December 31, 1988 and timely submitted to the Secretary 
under 34 CFR 668.23(c).

    (3) An institution that timely submits the Payment Data for a 
student in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section but does not 
timely submit to the Secretary, or have accepted by the Secretary, the 
Payment Data necessary to document the full amount of the award to which 
the student is entitled, may receive a payment or reduction in 
accountability in the full amount of that award, if--
    (i) A program review demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that the student was eligible to receive an amount greater 
than that reported in the student's Payment Data timely submitted to, 
and accepted by the Secretary; and
    (ii) The institution seeks an adjustment to reflect an underpayment 
for that award that is at least $100.
    (4) In determining whether the institution qualifies for a payment 
or reduction in accountability, the Secretary takes into account any 
liabilities of the institution arising from that audit or program review 
or any other source. The Secretary collects those liabilities by offset 
in accordance with 34 CFR part 30.

<R04>
   Subpart B--What Is the Amount of Assistance and How May It Be Used?


<R05>
Sec. 692.10  How does the Secretary allot funds to the States?

    (a)(1) The Secretary allots to each State participating in the SSIG 
program an amount which bears the same ratio to the Federal SSIG funds 
appropriated as the number of students in that State who are ``deemed 
eligible'' to participate in the State's SSIG program bears to the total 
number of students in all States who are ``deemed eligible'' to 
participate in the SSIG program, except that no State may receive less 
than it received in fiscal year 1979.
    (2) If the Federal SSIG funds appropriated for a fiscal year are not 
sufficient to allot to each State the amount of Federal SSIG funds it 
received in fiscal year 1979, the Secretary allots to each State an 
amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of Federal SSIG funds 
appropriated as the amount of Federal SSIG funds that State received in 
fiscal year 1979 bears to the

[[Page 810]]

amount of Federal SSIG funds all States received in fiscal year 1979.
    (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary determines the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to 
participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of that 
State's SSIG expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the 
State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant 
award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines 
the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of 
student recipients for all States into the total amount of SSIG 
expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotments and 
the State-appropriated funds matching those allotments. In making this 
determination, the Secretary uses the most current available data 
reported by each State.

<R04>
    Subpart C--How Does a State Apply To Participate in This Program?

Student Incentive Grant Program as of July 1, 1985.
    (2) If the Governor of the State so designates, and notifies the 
Secretary through a modification to the State's Federal-State 
Relationship Agreement, the State may submit its application under 
paragraph (b) of this section through an agency that did not administer 
its State Student Incentive Grant Program as of July 1, 1985.

grants and work-study jobs under this program represents an additional 
amount for grants and work-study jobs for students attending 
institutions of higher education over the amount expended by the State 
for those activities during the fiscal year two years prior to the 
fiscal year in which the State first received funds under this program;
    (i) Provides for State expenditures under the State program of an 
amount that is not less than--

need, the State may use--
    (1) A system for determining a student's financial need under part F 
of title IV of the HEA;

approve, on a case-by-case basis, a State's need analysis system that 
uses a definition for ``independent student'' that varies from that term 
as defined in section 480(d) of the HEA.

Sec. 770.40  What matching requirements apply to a Public Library Services grant?

    In order to receive a Public Library Services grant, a State shall 
have available, from State and local sources, for expenditure for the 
projects and activities proposed in its annual program an amount that 
equals or exceeds the difference between--
    (a) The cost of carrying out the State's annual program; and
    (b) The Federal share of these costs, as specified in section 7(b) 
of the Act.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 351e(b), 354)


<R05>
Sec. 770.41  What are the basic maintenance-of-effort requirements for a Public Library Services grant?

    (a) Basic maintenance-of-effort. In order to receive a Public 
Library Services grant, a State shall have available for expenditure--
    (1) For State aid to public libraries and library systems, an 
aggregate amount equal to 90 percent of the amount actually expended by 
the State for those purposes in the second preceding fiscal year; and
    (2) For the State library administrative agency, or the part of the 
State library administrative agency charged by State law with extending 
and developing public library services throughout the State, an 
aggregate amount equal to 90 percent of the amount actually expended for 
those purposes in the second preceding fiscal year.
    (b) Waiver. (1) The Secretary may waive the basic maintenance-of-
effort requirements contained in paragraph (a) of this section, if the 
Secretary determines that application of paragraph (a) would be unjust 
or unreasonable in light of exceptional extenuating circumstances.
    (2) The circumstances under which the Secretary may waive the basic 
maintenance-of-effort requirements include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (i) A natural disaster affecting the State.
    (ii) A precipitous decline in the financial resources of the State 
resulting in general reductions in the State's expenditures, except that 
the effect of State legislative action or referenda reducing revenue or 
rejecting revenue initiatives does not in and of itself justify a 
waiver.
    (3) A State shall support a waiver request with appropriate 
documentation.
    (4)(i) If the Secretary grants a waiver under this section, the 
amount of funds that the State library administrative agency is 
otherwise entitled to receive under this part is not reduced.
    (ii) The basic maintenance-of-effort level in the second fiscal year 
following the fiscal year for which a waiver is granted is at least 90 
percent of the amount that the State library administrative agency would 
have been required to expend in the waiver year had the waiver not been 
granted.

    Example: In fiscal year 1991 a State library administrative agency 
obtains a waiver under this section because it will have available for 
expenditure for FY 1991 less than 90 percent of its actual expenditures 
in the second preceding year (1989) due to exceptional extenuating 
circumstances. In determining whether the agency meets the basic 
maintenance-of-effort requirements for fiscal year 1993, the State 
agency must have available for expenditure at least 90 percent of its 
actual expenditures for 1989, the second fiscal year preceding the year 
for which the waiver was granted, and not 90 percent of its actual 
expenditures in FY 1991 (the waiver year). Thus, if the State agency 
expended $3,000,000 in FY 1989, $2,800,000 in FY 1990, and only 
$2,500,000 in FY 1991, when it should have expended $2,700,000 (90 
percent of $3,000,000) but obtained a waiver instead, then in FY 1993 it 
must expend 90 percent of $2,700,000, for a total of $2,430,000, rather 
than 90 percent of $2,500,000 (the amount it actually expended in FY 
1991), or $2,250,000.

<R05>
Sec. 770.42  What other maintenance-of-effort requirements apply to a Public Library Services grant?

    (a) In addition to the requirements in Sec. 770.41, in order to 
receive a Public Library Services grant a State shall spend for State 
institutional library services and library services to the physically 
handicapped, from Federal, State, and local sources, an amount not less 
than the amount that the State spent from those sources for those 
services during the second preceding fiscal year.
    (b) The Secretary ratably reduces the amount that a State is 
required to spend for institutional library services and library 
services to the physically handicapped to the extent that--
    (1) The Federal allocation for the State's Public Library Services 
grant is reduced; and
    (2) The Secretary determines that the populations served by those 
expenditures have declined.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 354)


<R05>
Sec. 770.43  What maintenance of Federal support is required for major urban resource libraries (MURLs)?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if the 
amount of a Public Library Services grant requires a State library 
administrative agency to allocate funds to support and expand library 
services of the State's MURLs, under sections 102(a)(3) and (c) of the 
Act and in Sec. 770.24(b)(2), the State library administrative agency 
may not reduce the amount it pays to a MURL below the amount that it 
paid to that MURL in the preceding fiscal year.
    (b) A State library administrative agency may ratably reduce the 
amount that a State library administrative agency must pay to a MURL 
under paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that--
    (1) The Federal allocation to the State library administrative 
agency for its Public Library Services grant is reduced for the 
applicable fiscal year; or
    (2) The 1990 Census shows that the population of the city served 
under paragraph (a) of this section has decreased.
    (c) In any fiscal year in which both circumstances described in 
paragraph (b) of this section occur, the State library administrative 
agency shall determine whether to apply one or the other, or both, of 
the reduction rates, or to not reduce payments to its State's MURLs at 
all. The following example illustrates how the calculation of the 
reduction can be made if a State library administrative agency chooses 
to apply both rates in a fiscal year when both circumstances occur.

Example: In a State with 4 MURLs, where the minimum amount required to 
be set aside for MURLs is $100,000, the allocation reduction rate is 10 
percent, and one of the MURLs has a 5 percent decrease in its 
population. The ratable reduction may be calculated as follows:

$100,000 x 10%=$10,000
$100,000 x 10,000=$90,000
$90,000<divide>4=$22,500 (assuming equal distribution among these 4 
          MURLs)
$22,500 x 5%=$1,125
$22,500-1,125=$21,375 to be paid to the MURL with a 5 percent population 
          decrease.

<R05>
Sec. 770.44  What are a State's financial obligations under a Public Library Construction and Technology Enhancement grant?

    (a) A State that receives a Public Library Construction and 
Technology Enhancement grant shall provide, from State or local sources 
or both, in the fiscal year for which the grant is made, the difference 
between--
    (1) The costs of projects financed under the grant; and
    (2) The Federal share of these costs, as specified in section 7(b) 
of the Act.
    (b) In the case of any individual project awarded under a Public 
Library Construction and Technology Enhancement grant, at least one half 
of the total cost must be supplied by State or local sources or both.

<R05>
Sec. 770.45  What other financial obligation does a recipient have under a Public Library Construction and Technology Enhancement grant?

    (a) Unless released from the obligation under paragraph (c) of this 
section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance under a Public 
Library Construction and Technology Enhancement grant--or the 
recipient's successor in title or possession--shall repay to the United 
States on request an

[[Page 846]]

amount as specified in paragraph (b) of this section if, within 20 years 
of the completion of construction of the library facility--or part of 
the facility--for which the assistance was received--
    (1) The recipient or its successor ceases or fails to be a public or 
nonprofit institution; or
    (2) The facility ceases to be used as a library facility.
    (b) The amount the recipient or its successor is obligated to repay 
is an amount that equals--
    (1) The value of the facility or part of the facility at the time of 
the occurrence specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, 
multiplied by--
    (2) The ratio of--
    (i) The amount of Federal assistance under the grant or subgrant; to
    (ii) The cost of the facility or part of the facility for which the 
assistance was received.
    Example: In 1977 a local public library completed a project to 
enlarge its reading room. The project had been assisted by a subgrant 
from the State under a Public Library Construction grant. The total cost 
of the project was $300,000; the subgrant had amounted to $120,000 a 
ratio of 2 to 5 or 40 percent of the cost.
    In 1989 the local library moves to another district, and the 
facility for which it received assistance in 1977 ceases to be used as a 
library facility. It is determined that the part of the facility for 
which assistance was received has a current market value of $400,000.
    The United States is entitled to recover from the local public 
library an amount equal to 40 percent of the current market value of the 
facility or portion of the facility assisted with Federal funds; that 
is, 40 percent of $400,000 or $160,000.

    (c) The Secretary may decide, for good cause, to release the 
recipient from its obligation under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The provisions of this section apply to any facility constructed 
at any time with assistance under title II of the Act.

under a Public Library Services grant and funds received under a Public 
Library Construction and Technology Enhancement grant to carry out its 
administrative functions under a Public Library Services grant, a Public 
Library Construction and Technology Enhancement grant, and an 
Interlibrary Cooperation and Resource Sharing grant.
    (b) The total amount the agency may spend to carry out its 
administrative functions under all of these grants during any year may 
not exceed the amount specified in section 8 of the Act.
    (c) The agency may spend the funds for administrative costs in 
connection with the following activities:
    (1) Administration of the State plan, including obtaining the 
services of consultants.
    (2) Statewide planning for and evaluation of library services.

    (a)(1) In the case of a Public Library Construction and Technology 
Enhancement grant, if a State denies funds to a local or other public 
agency that applies for a subgrant for construction of public library 
facilities, the State library administrative agency shall give the local 
or other public agency an opportunity for a hearing.
    (2) The provision in 34 CFR 76.401(b) (which exempts State agencies 
from having to offer an opportunity for a hearing under certain State-
administered programs) does not apply to Public Library Construction and 
Technology Enhancement grants.
    (b) In providing opportunity for a hearing, the State library 
administrative agency shall follow the appropriate policies and 
procedures included

Register, select annually one or more priorities for funding. These 
priorities may be chosen from the areas of greatest immediate concern to 
the Institute and may include, but are not limited to, the following 
areas:
    (a) Developing leadership in adult learners. Because adult learners 
are the true experts on literacy, they are an important resource for the 
field. Their

[[Page 858]]

firsthand experience as ``customers'' of the literacy system can be 
invaluable in assisting the field in moving forward, particularly in 
terms of raising public awareness and understanding about literacy.

Institute's major projects is the Literacy Information aNd Communication 
System (LINCS), an Internet-based information system that provides 
timely information and abundant resources to the literacy community. 
Keeping the literacy community up to date in the Information Age is 
vital.
    (c) Improving accountability for literacy programs. Literacy 
programs must develop accountability systems that demonstrate their 
effectiveness in helping adult learners contribute more fully in the 
workplace, family and community. There is growing interest in results-
oriented literacy practice, especially as related to the Equipped for 
the Future (EFF) framework.
    (d) Raising public awareness about literacy. The Institute is 
leading a national effort to raise public awareness that literacy is 
part of the solution to many social concerns, including health, welfare, 
the economy, and the well-being of children. Projects that enhance this 
effort will be given priority consideration.

    (a) The definitions in 34 CFR 77.1, except that the definitions of 
``Applicant'', ``Application'', ``Award'', and ``Project'' do not apply 
to this part.
    (b) Other definitions. The following definitions also apply to this 
part:
    Adult learner means an individual over 16 years old who is pursuing 
or has completed some form of literacy or basic skills training, 
including preparation for the G.E.D.
    Applicant means an individual requesting a fellowship under this 
program.
    Application means a written request for a fellowship under this 
program.
    Award means an amount of funds provided for fellowship activities.
    Career literacy worker means an individual who is pursuing a career 
in literacy or adult education or a related field and who has relevant 
academic or professional experience. Relevant experience includes 
teaching, policymaking, administration, or research.
    Director means the Director of the National Institute for Literacy.
    Fellow means a recipient of a fellowship.
    Fellowship means an award of financial assistance made by the 
Institute to an individual pursuant to section 384 of the Adult 
Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1213c) to enable that individual to conduct 
research or other authorized literacy activities under the auspices of 
the Institute.
    Fellowship agreement means a written agreement entered into between 
the Institute and a fellow, which, when executed, has the legal effect 
of obligating the fellowship award, and which states the rights and 
obligations of the parties.
    Institute means the National Institute for Literacy.
    Project means the work to be engaged in by the Fellow during the 
period of fellowship.
    Research means one or more of the following activities in literacy 
or education or education related fields: basic and applied research, 
planning, surveys, assessments, evaluations, investigations, 
experiments, development and demonstrations.
Sec. 1100.6  What priorities may the Director establish?
    The Director may, through a notice published in the Federal 
Register, select annually one or more priorities for funding. These 
priorities may be chosen from the areas of greatest immediate concern to 
the Institute and may include, but are not limited to, the following 
areas:
    (a) Workforce and Workplace literacy. Millions of American adults 
need educational services either to enter the work force or to upgrade 
their work-related skills. Increasingly literacy programs are offered in 
the context of the workplace. Workforce education and development is a 
top national priority and a critical focus in the literacy field.
    (b) Family Literacy. Educational research and practice continue to 
demonstrate the fundamental importance of the family in creating both 
the motivation and conditions for a child's readiness for school and 
continued learning throughout life. This intergenerational literacy 
connection is having an increasingly significant effect on the funding, 
design, and operation of Federal, State, and local programs for children 
as well as adults.
    (c) English as a Second Language/Immigration and Literacy. Recent 
studies confirm that adults with limited English proficiency (LEP) 
experience a variety of social and economic disadvantages: lower wages, 
limited employment opportunities, limited access to public services, and 
barriers to becoming active members of their communities and 
neighborhoods. ESL instruction is currently the largest and fastest 
growing component of the Adult Education Act, and the demand continues 
to increase dramatically. About two-thirds of all recent immigrants to 
America are LEP, and about 76% of the 12 to 14 million LEP adults in 
America are immigrants. Issues related to the education of immigrants 
and ESL services are of increasing

[[Page 863]]

importance to the literacy and adult education field.
    (d) Assessing Progress toward National Educational Goal 6. Goal 6, 
the adult literacy and lifelong learning goal, states that: ``By the 
year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the 
knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and 
exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.'' Gauging 
progress toward this goal is a primary concern of the Institute and a 
complex undertaking that challenges all sectors of the literacy field. 
As a result, there is growing interest in development of innovative 
approaches for measuring and documenting this progress in a variety of 
service settings.
    (e) The Role of Adult Learners in Literacy and Adult Education 
Programs. As the primary consumers of literacy and adult education 
services, adult learners have the greatest personal stake in the quality 
of these services, and unique contributions to make in setting policy 
for, planning, and implementing programs. The Institute is interested in 
learning more about how current and former adult learners can play 
meaningful roles at every level of the literacy field nationwide.

procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1614, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.
Secs. 1200.141--1200.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1200.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1200.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that result in such an 
alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods.--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings,

[[Page 872]]

shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the 
Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), 
and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods 
for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give 
priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to 
qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting 
appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 1200.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec. 1200.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1200.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.
Secs. 1200.152--1200.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices

[[Page 873]]

for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems 
shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1200.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.
Secs. 1200.161--1200.169  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.170  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1614 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 791).
    (c) The Executive Director shall be responsible for coordinating 
implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to the National 
Council on Disability, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., suite 814, 
Washington, DC 20591.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec. 1200.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of

[[Page 874]]

the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If the head of 
the agency determines that additional information is needed from the 
complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of 
the additional information to make his or her determination on the 
appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for 
making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.
